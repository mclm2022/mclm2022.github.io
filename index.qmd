title: "Methods in Corpus Linguistics"
---

This is a Quarto website. I just learned about Quarto. Let's try to use it!

In this website I'll compile course material for the Advanced Masters in Linguistics course "Methods in Corpus Linguistics" (September-December 2022). In principle this course will not provide corpora (but we'll see) but it will illustrate code for practice and illustration.

The code shown here makes use of the mclm package that I will eventually link to :)

Check out [this report](base.qmd)!
