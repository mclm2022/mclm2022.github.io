    "title": "Keywords and collocation analysis on the BASE corpus",
    "section": "",
    "text": "This document illustrates a keyword analysis and a collocation analysis. They both use the BASE corpus and the same criteria for association strength. You may replicate the code by copy-pasting the snippets (clicking on the symbol on the top right corner of each) and running it on the console or, better yet, on a script or R Markdown file.\nFor the analysis we’ll mainly use the {tidyverse} package and the {mclm} package. For the report itself, mostly when printing tables, we’ll also use {kableExtra}.\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(mclm)\nlibrary(kableExtra) # for the report\n\n\n\nBoth of the studies rely on the assoc_scores objects of the {mclm} package, which return frequencies and association scores, i.e. measures based on the frequency of a certain event in a target context and in a reference context. For keyword analysis, the target context is a target (sub)corpus and the reference context is a reference (sub)corpus. For collocation analysis based on surface co-occurrences, the target context is the text surrounding the node term and the reference context is all the other text in the corpus.\nIn order to define keywords (for the first study) or collocations (for the second study) we will filter the output of assoc_scores() based on the following three criteria:\n\nA frequency of three or higher in the target context\nA PMI score of two or higher\nA signed G score of two or higher\n\nA PMI score of two or higher means that the probability of the keyword in the target context is at least four times higher than its probability in all the data taken together.1\nA signed G score of two or higher is not a very strict criterion. With a signed G score of two there is only mild evidence for attraction. In a traditional G test (log likelihood ratio test) for a two-by-two contingency table, a G score of one would indicate no evidence for any association whatsoever and a G score of 3.84 would be needed for the test to indicate a significant association (at a 95% confidence level). So a value of two would indicate that there is not enough evidence to establish significance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelection criteria\n\n\n\nIn short, the selection criteria that were chosen here value both the effect size and amount of evidence, but could be said to be more demanding with respect to the former than with respect to the latter. This choice is acceptable, as long as the researcher is aware to be prioritizing (to some extent) effect size over amount of evidence.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first step to analyzing the data is to read the corpus. The first line of the code below sets the path to the “BASE” directory where all the corpus files are stored, in this case inside the parent directory. In order to run this in your own computer, set base_corpus to the path from wherever you are running the code to where your copy of the corpus is stored.\nThe second line of the code collects all the file names in that folder in an fnames object and keeps those with the “txt” extension.\n\nfnames_BASE <- get_fnames(file.path(corpus_folder, \"BASE\")) %>% \n  keep_re(\"[.]txt\")\n\nprint(fnames_BASE, 10)\n\nFilename collection of length 198\n                             filename\n   ----------------------------------\n 1 _corpora//BASE/txt/ah/ahlct001.txt\n 2 _corpora//BASE/txt/ah/ahlct002.txt\n 3 _corpora//BASE/txt/ah/ahlct003.txt\n 4 _corpora//BASE/txt/ah/ahlct004.txt\n 5 _corpora//BASE/txt/ah/ahlct005.txt\n 6 _corpora//BASE/txt/ah/ahlct006.txt\n 7 _corpora//BASE/txt/ah/ahlct007.txt\n 8 _corpora//BASE/txt/ah/ahlct008.txt\n 9 _corpora//BASE/txt/ah/ahlct009.txt\n10 _corpora//BASE/txt/ah/ahlct010.txt\n...\n\n\nThe functions to actually read the corpus for the analyses will be freqlist() and surf_cooc(). In both cases we’ll use three non-default settings that are more appropriate for the format of the BASE corpus.\n\nIn re_token_splitter we use the regular expression (?xi) \\s+; in other words, we treat all chunks of whitespace as token separators. We do this because the default tokenizer, which roughly identifies the chunks of alphanumeric characters as tokens, would e.g. cut up the corpus snippet a simple [0.4] example into the tokens a, simple, 0, 4, and example, which is not what we want. The tokenizer we do use would cut the same snippet up in the tokens a, simple, [0.4], and example. This is still not exactly what we want, but see the next point.\nIn re_drop_token we use (?xi) [:\\[\\]] in order to drop all the tokens that match this regular expression; in other words we drop all tokens that contain either a colon, an opening square bracket or a closing square bracket. So in the aforementioned example, the pseudo-token [0.4], which actually is a pause indication, would be dropped eventually. Tokens that contain a colon are also dropped, because those are speaker identifiers in the BASE corpus, not real tokens.\nIn file_encoding we specify windows-1252, which indeed is the encoding used in the BASE corpus.\n\n\n\n\nThe main function we will use is assoc_scores(), which creates an object of class assoc_scores, i.e. a special kind of dataframe with association scores information. In the case of keyword analysis we’ll run it with two frequency lists created from different (subcorpora), whereas for collocation analysis we’ll provide a cooc_info object created with surf_cooc().\nBy default, assoc_scores() will not return values where the frequency in the target context was lower than 3, so we don’t need to do anything else to define our first criterion. For the other two criteria, instead, we’ll need to filter the assoc_scores object to only retain elements with a high enough PMI and G_signed."

    "text": "This document illustrates a keyword analysis and a collocation analysis. They both use the BASE corpus and the same criteria for association strength. You may replicate the code by copy-pasting the snippets (clicking on the symbol on the top right corner of each) and running it on the console or, better yet, on a script or R Markdown file.\nFor the analysis we’ll mainly use the {tidyverse} package and the {mclm} package. For the report itself, mostly when printing tables, we’ll also use {kableExtra}.\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(mclm)\nlibrary(kableExtra) # for the report\n\n\n\nBoth of the studies rely on the assoc_scores objects of the {mclm} package, which return frequencies and association scores, i.e. measures based on the frequency of a certain event in a target context and in a reference context. For keyword analysis, the target context is a target (sub)corpus and the reference context is a reference (sub)corpus. For collocation analysis based on surface co-occurrences, the target context is the text surrounding the node term and the reference context is all the other text in the corpus.\nIn order to define keywords (for the first study) or collocations (for the second study) we will filter the output of assoc_scores() based on the following three criteria:\n\nA frequency of three or higher in the target context\nA PMI score of two or higher\nA signed G score of two or higher\n\nA PMI score of two or higher means that the probability of the keyword in the target context is at least four times higher than its probability in all the data taken together.1\nA signed G score of two or higher is not a very strict criterion. With a signed G score of two there is only mild evidence for attraction. In a traditional G test (log likelihood ratio test) for a two-by-two contingency table, a G score of one would indicate no evidence for any association whatsoever and a G score of 3.84 would be needed for the test to indicate a significant association (at a 95% confidence level). So a value of two would indicate that there is not enough evidence to establish significance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelection criteria\n\n\n\nIn short, the selection criteria that were chosen here value both the effect size and amount of evidence, but could be said to be more demanding with respect to the former than with respect to the latter. This choice is acceptable, as long as the researcher is aware to be prioritizing (to some extent) effect size over amount of evidence.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first step to analyzing the data is to read the corpus. The first line of the code below sets the path to the “BASE” directory where all the corpus files are stored, in this case inside the parent directory. In order to run this in your own computer, set base_corpus to the path from wherever you are running the code to where your copy of the corpus is stored.\nThe second line of the code collects all the file names in that folder in an fnames object and keeps those with the “txt” extension.\n\nfnames_BASE <- get_fnames(file.path(corpus_folder, \"BASE\")) %>% \n  keep_re(\"[.]txt\")\n\nprint(fnames_BASE, 10)\n\nFilename collection of length 198\n                             filename\n   ----------------------------------\n 1 _corpora//BASE/txt/ah/ahlct001.txt\n 2 _corpora//BASE/txt/ah/ahlct002.txt\n 3 _corpora//BASE/txt/ah/ahlct003.txt\n 4 _corpora//BASE/txt/ah/ahlct004.txt\n 5 _corpora//BASE/txt/ah/ahlct005.txt\n 6 _corpora//BASE/txt/ah/ahlct006.txt\n 7 _corpora//BASE/txt/ah/ahlct007.txt\n 8 _corpora//BASE/txt/ah/ahlct008.txt\n 9 _corpora//BASE/txt/ah/ahlct009.txt\n10 _corpora//BASE/txt/ah/ahlct010.txt\n...\n\n\nThe functions to actually read the corpus for the analyses will be freqlist() and surf_cooc(). In both cases we’ll use three non-default settings that are more appropriate for the format of the BASE corpus.\n\nIn re_token_splitter we use the regular expression (?xi) \\s+; in other words, we treat all chunks of whitespace as token separators. We do this because the default tokenizer, which roughly identifies the chunks of alphanumeric characters as tokens, would e.g. cut up the corpus snippet a simple [0.4] example into the tokens a, simple, 0, 4, and example, which is not what we want. The tokenizer we do use would cut the same snippet up in the tokens a, simple, [0.4], and example. This is still not exactly what we want, but see the next point.\nIn re_drop_token we use (?xi) [:\\[\\]] in order to drop all the tokens that match this regular expression; in other words we drop all tokens that contain either a colon, an opening square bracket or a closing square bracket. So in the aforementioned example, the pseudo-token [0.4], which actually is a pause indication, would be dropped eventually. Tokens that contain a colon are also dropped, because those are speaker identifiers in the BASE corpus, not real tokens.\nIn file_encoding we specify windows-1252, which indeed is the encoding used in the BASE corpus."

Let’s look at the values for the keywords here.\n\ntop_scores_df <- as_tibble(top_scores_kw)\n\nTo illustrate the use of the tibble version of the results, we can, for instance, generate plots on the basis of the object top_scores_df. Below, we build a scatter plot of signed G scores (x-axis) by PMI scores (y-axis). The plot gives us an idea of to which extent both measures correlate.\n\n# plot PMI by G_signed (without names of the types)\ntop_scores_df %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = PMI, y = G_signed)) +\n  geom_point()\n\n\n\n\nWe see that the measures do correlate a bit, but definitely not perfectly. In fact, should you build similar plots for other combinations of measures, you’ll find that some pair correlate much more clearly than what we see here.\nLet’s inspect to which extent absolute frequencies can explain the discrepancies between PMI and signed G. Below we have the frequencies in the target corpus (i.e. the values in the a cell of the contingency tables) reflect the size of the symbols. We see that high frequencies tend to relatively boost signed G scores and that low frequencies appear to relatively increase the probability of obtaining a high PMI score.\n\n# plot PMI by G_signed (size reflecting frequencies)\ntop_scores_df %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = PMI, y = G_signed)) +\n  geom_point(aes(size = a))\n\n\n\n\nWe can also plot the names of the words instead of using symbols, using the geom_text() function. Notice that in top_scores_df the names of the types are stored in a column called type.\n\n# plot PMI by G_signed (with names of the types)\ntop_scores_df %>%\n  ggplot(aes(x = PMI, y = G_signed)) +\n  geom_text(aes(label = type))\n\n\n\n\nFor a more sophisticated plot, the {ggrepel} package allows us to add text close to the position of their datapoints, avoiding overlap. We can combine text and points to only annotate the higher values.\n\nhigh_G_signed <- top_scores_df %>% \n  filter(G_signed > 100) # extract types with high G_signed\n\ntop_scores_df %>% \n  ggplot(aes(x = PMI, y = G_signed)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  ggrepel::geom_text_repel(data = high_G_signed, aes(label = type))"
