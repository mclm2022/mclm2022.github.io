<u who="nm5391">that was a minor</u>
<u who="nm5390">minor in astrophysics from the University of Leicester # then he got his PhD from # this department # and # stayed on as post-doc # and in two-thousand-three was elevated to the status of lecturer and # in the last few weeks # has been informed that # he's been awarded the L F Richardson prize so congratulations to him for receiving that and # he'll now speak on the topic of  <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/></u>
<u who="nm5391">okay thanks <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> yes i'm going to talk about Cloudnet project # which is something that has <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> myself Ewan Anthony Nicola and Malcolm for the last few years this is a E-U-funded project # trying to to systematically evaluate the representation of clouds in a number of European forecast models so we're trying to really get away from sort of case study mentality # that has sometimes affected this # subject so first i'll # <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> motivation and talk about the representation of clouds and G-C-Ms invested in this # i'll talk the the organisation of the Cloudnet project and then talk about # some of the key Cloudnet products this isn't certainly an exhaustive list # the sorts of things that we're producing # are radar and lidar at various stations in Europe these are sort of key parameters we need in the current models then i'll be briefly talking about the various ways that one can use this kind of data to evaluate # these models such as using # long term means of of various parameters # skill scores probability distributions # and so on # but certainly there's far more work to do on the # sort of making the best use of all data that we # have on # on clouds # with # co-located # cloud # values from the various models so just to give you a sort of brief introduction to how clouds are represented in models possibly familiar to many of you which perhaps will look like this so <trunc>real</trunc>  in reality they've got structure in all scales # and their three dimensional structure is also important for radiative transfer and of curse we can't represent all this detail # in fairly low <trunc>res</trunc>  <trunc>res</trunc>  low resolution model but typical representation might look something like this typical G-C-M # global circulation model grid box as a # horizontal # size that vary that can vary considerably depending on the one in question but sort of typically one kilometre for the most high resolution # metre scale models to about a hundred kilometres for a global forecast model # whereas in climate of course we have to run things for much longer so we would need maybe three-hundred kilometre resolution the vertical box size is about five hundred metres and in each box we hold # a very very crude representation of that with all this complexity we just have clouds a fraction and then the mean liquid water content the mean ice-water content we typically assume these clouds to be horizontally uniform within each box okay <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> # perhaps will have # an impact on <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> of transfer of various <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> also have to make assumptions such as # cloud phase and the particle size these are usually represented as functions of temperature so i guess there's two questions here well one is how accurate are these values # cloud fraction content in the models and # # also even if we were to get accurate values for the mean would these be sufficient to get accurate predictions of precipitation and the <trunc>radiati</trunc>  radiative effect of cloud which is an important climate i'm really just going to be looking at the first of these today so let's just have a look at # the results of this A-M-E-T comparison that shows the vertically integrated cloud water content as a function of latitude and what strikes you immediately is there's a hell of a spread # you can see almost a factor of ten different sort of in the # the wettest model and the driest if you like # and the interesting thing is of course is that these models are often tuned # to give roughly the right # top of atmosphere radiative # fluxes that are # measured from satellites so it's quite surprising that there's such a huge variation of water contents give you rather similar # radiative properties # and of course this is a bit of a concern because clouds are very important for # radiative transfer precipitation production and so we're very <trunc>in</trunc>  interested in how these # might change perhaps in a future climate scenario so really to have confidence in climate models # and also to do the best for precipitation forecasts in the much shorter term we really need to improve this and really the problem has originated from the fact that the current satellites provide sort of <trunc>i</trunc>  integrated information or information just a cloud top # we don't really have much of a constraint on these values to kind of bring down the spread we really need instruments with a higher vertical resolution and you won't be surprised to know that that's going to be cloud radar okay so the E-U Cloudnet project was # sort of run for quite a few years now it aim is to retrieve continuously these crucial parameters and we're going to look at three particular sites Gibraltar Cabauw in the Netherlands and Palaiseau in France # we're also soon to include the U-S # and tropical A-R-M sites and also the german Lindenberg site to extend this # to other places in Europe we've got this is a list of current models involved in the project so <trunc>th</trunc>  the European of course Mesoscale and global version of E-C-M-W-F the French model the Dutch two two Dutch models # also the Swedish German and Canadian models are going to be involved so we should be able to objectively evaluate the clouds in all of these different models now there's some crucial aspects to this # project with <trunc>s</trunc>  we're reporting # retrieval errors in data quality flags to make sure we know how accurate our data is at all times and using common formats # S-C-D-F # to allow all our programmes be applied at all sites and compared to all models so <trunc>w</trunc>  as i said we're trying to get away from the problem of people just using their algorithm on a small amount of data comparing with one model perhaps this is allowing us to do the thing in a much more sort of extensive type of # data sets and and compare all sorts of models over a much longer period and the three Cloudnet sites are in Europe so we've got Chilbolton here # Paris there and the Netherlands site there and this is a list of the # instruments that they have so i guess the core instrumentation that we have to consider is # the cloud radar cloud lidar microwave radiometers # and rain gauge that's really where most of the information that we're using is coming from # just a quick # overview of the the key information provided by cloud radar and lidar all you need to know really is that the radar is sensitive to the large particles so particularly detects ice # and the <trunc>s</trunc>  sort of precipitation size particles such as drizzle from stratocumulus so you can hear <trunc>s</trunc>  see here we've got a nice ice cloud here that's fully penetrated and a stratocumulus that we can see the drizzle falling from here by contrast the lidar is sensitive to much smaller particles particularly # cloud droplets # and aerosol particles so you can see here we've got the boundary <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> aerosol here topped by a very strong return from the stratocumulus cloud base that's embedded within the drizzle so you from the radar alone you wouldn't be able to to tell where that is and then you can see you can also detect some # super-cooled liquid water that the radar doesn't detect and # also there's some attenuation problem here in the ice so you can see that there's very complementary information provided by these <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> use the two in synergy to get the best estimate of the profile of clouds at any particular time so this is a sort of diagram of all the <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> we have in # the Cloudnet project and basically <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> the radar lidar frame rates micro <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> and the model data your various stages of processing that takes us up to here # now of course we've got various different formats in some cases from the various models so what we have is this # stage here sort of # instrument synergy target categorization i call it which i'll talk more a bit about in a moment which is where we unify the formats and bring all the data together so we can then go on to produce this list of cloud products that are very useful # for someone who doesn't know about radar and doesn't really want to know just wants to know about ice water content or liquid water content cloud boundaries perhaps turbulence information drizzle # ice particle size and so on so this is really where the meteorology is coming in # this is at high resolution of course the resolution of the actual instruments but of course we can't plot the values on the model grid so we we have to average it up onto the various model grids we do that separately for each <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> where you can see there's more model information coming in here and then we've got the level three products which give us statistics on the # comparisons of these products with what's actually modelled so i'm going to talk a bit about this thing in the middle first # it really makes <trunc>th</trunc>  this multi-sensor data much easier to use and there's a number of key facts that we have here you combine these various key measurements that i mentioned with an identical format for each site # performs a number of key processing tasks so for interpolation of all the data onto the same grid many algorithms actually make use of temperature and wind which <trunc>a</trunc>  <trunc>a</trunc>  are much more accurate than models the cloud information so we can actually take that in # with some confidence we have to correct the radar for attenuation # both from gasses and from liquid water # we provide this some essential extra information that makes this data then usable to create cloud <trunc>pro</trunc>  products # we characterize the random and systematic measurement errors # also the instrument sensitivity so you know that if say the radar doesn't see a cloud # you can tell <trunc>wh</trunc>  whether the cloud really isn't there or perhaps there's a sensitivity issue and it might be there but can't quite be detected and this key extra information here is what the <trunc>cl</trunc>  what the target that the # instruments see are actually composed of so of course we want to know whether it's droplets ice aerosol insects and so on <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> and then there are key # data quality flags which tell us when our observations are reliable and when they're not so just to show you an example of this this is actually a case from the # U-S A-R-M site which # is from now able to process in exactly the same way as the European data # one key thing you can see here if you with the <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> you might think well got all this got this convective system here perhaps # some rain <trunc>w</trunc>  <trunc>w</trunc>  we also seem to have cloud cover for the whole the whole day so this would would mean sort of got this cloud from nought to three kilometres now of course in fact that's insects but # it's certainly a danger with people who are are not used to looking at this kind of data # misinterpreting it perhaps # so what we provide is this # classification of the actual targets to some various some various <trunc>vari</trunc>  various <trunc>sim</trunc>  simple types so you can see here we've characterized our insects as a dark grey aerosol # sorry there's aerosol as well in here so it's aerosol and insects # just aerosol here light grey see clouds there this is rain and there's an orange stripe here where this # there's a melting layer and then this is ice up here so # you can see suddenly we are then able to compare with the models because we know that this isn't cloud at all # so <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> trying to evaluate of clouds there and # we've identified that correctly as insects and we've also got a sort of detection status <trunc>f</trunc>  flags here telling us # whether the data's reliable and so on so the first product i'm going to speak about is cloud fraction which is # derived just by taking a model grid and superimposing it # and then you can just count up if you like the fraction box that's <trunc>fu</trunc>  full of cloud and use this cloud fraction on our form grid so you can see here a comparison of about a month of data and we've got quite a few years of this now the observed cloud fraction going from # nought to one hundred percent cloud cover # <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> purples this is what we derive from our radar and lidar and this is the representation in five of the European models # involved in the project so you can see there's certainly some skill in forecasting the location of these # large cloud features and of course a day is just that size there so you can imagine that you might well get a thousand kilometres of # cloud being affetced over site in quite a short period so actually this is quite a large scale cloud feature even though it's just measured at one particular site you can also see some quite distinct differences between the actual structure and the amount of clouds in the various different models so this is what we want to evaluate so that's cloud fraction and i'll talk a bit about <trunc>s</trunc>  statistical comparisons # later on # now the key thing to getting liquid cloud amount so that's the amount of # liquid water content in a model is # these dual wavelength microwave radiometers now what these provide is # an estimate of the liquid water path which is the total amount of liquid in a column above okay so instead of looking upwards and passively measure the radiation coming downwards so what we what we do because they are sensitive to both the liquid and the vapour in the column above above them is to combine two frequencies which have different # sensitivities to the liquid and water vapour and you can see that we've got simultaneous equations so we can easily invert this to get liquid water path from these two optical depths of twenty two and twenty eight gigaherz now traditionally with this technique you assume that these <trunc>co</trunc>  <trunc>co</trunc>  coefficients are constant when in fact they depend on for example temperature of the liquid cloud # then you also have to <trunc>c</trunc>  # cope with the fact that the calibration can drift significantly <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> instruments so you can see <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> retrievals here <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> path so fairly smooth value here and then sort of spikes here and basically we've got clear sky here and this drift of quite substantial amount is just due to # calibration so # come on with a new technique # where you actually add the information from the lidar on the model # to tell you where the clear sky periods are so the coefficients can be calculated more accurately using the cloud temperature and we can then recalibrate the the # instruments when we've got clear sky periods so the lidar sees no cloud in these periods here so we're able to jump to this red value and get a much more accurate # estimate so we can use this then to get liquid water content now as i <trunc>sa</trunc>  as you saw before the radar is # is dependent on on the large part particles in particular so tends to be detecting drizzle rather than liquid droplets which is where the the ones that  are important for radiation so rather than using radar reflectivity for for getting liquid water content we basically use the # temperature to predict sort of the adiabatic liquid water content profile that is if you lift liquid water # up and it comes condensed than you can predict the profile of liquid water you'd expect in reality entrainment produces that but what we have from our measurements is the cloud base from the lidar and the cloud top from the radar and we know the integrated liquid water content so we can just scale this adiabatic profile so that it agrees with the <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> value so you can see a much more realistic liquid water content here where we've got liquid water increasing from cloud base so we've got high resolution liquid water content information this is # a sort of comparison on the climatological # type situation if you like so we could do this to a <trunc>foreca</trunc>  to a climate model where it's not simulating the actual <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> events where we've got for example mean cloud fraction and the observations in blue # model in red # and the frequency of # any cloud that's been observed in the box over the threshold about five percent # so what you what we tend to find when we do this kind of comparison is that the the frequency of cloud occurrence tends to read reasonably well # certainly below around seven kilometres # but the amount when present or the amount of cloud when there's some presence # can often be wrong so you can see here the reason why the mean cloud fraction is <trunc>overestima</trunc>  is underestimated in the model is that it tends to produce too little cloud when there's some cloud present so in a way this is sort of dependent on humidity information in the model to say whether there's going to be some cloud in the profile at all # the amount is dependent on the cloud perameterisation so that would be perhaps where the problems lie we can also identify some other problems with the # <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> this is a sort of P-D-F of cloud fraction and you can see quite clearly that the <trunc>i</trunc>  in this case the Met Office mesocale model the model has difficulty predicting a hundred percent cloud fractions because its got far less occurrence of this a hundred percent # cloud fraction this is a a known problem # with this particular # cloud scheme we can do a similar thing with # liquid water content # so this is showing similar things <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> mean liquid water content versus height <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> frequency of occurrence <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> presence you can see the frequency of occurrence is actually not to bad although perhaps there's a underestimate of the # height of the boundary layer here on average through this this is a a whole year period about it's about a hundred-and-seventy-two # days in total to be honest but you can see there's a tendency as well to underestimate the fraction of # supercooled liquid clouds # and perhaps the liquid water content when there's cloud presence is underestimated a bit from this comparison you can see this whole P-D-F is <trunc>s</trunc>  shifted to the left so we can do the same with ice water content and you can see here we've got the mean ice water content over about <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> year period from about two thousand three # and also well you can kind of see there's perhaps an overestimate of ice # in the upper levels # and so the mean ice water content something somewhat too high but you do have to be careful # with ice water content # <trunc>be</trunc>  being aware of the radar sensitivity particularly to the thin <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> at cloud top # and also the fact that the <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> are carried out in in rain situations and that does # limit the sample somewhat so the last thing i'll talk about another way of evaluating # models which is actually to look at how good the instantaneous forecast of the cloud is so what we do is we take a threshold cloud of roughly say point one and calculate a contingency table so this is a whole month of data again and we've got green indicating that cloud was both observed and modelled white indicates that # it was clear sky in both the cloud and the model if both the model and the observations and then the red and blue indicate when there's cloud in just one but not the other so we can define a b c and d to be # the amount the occurrences of each of these different categories and from this <trunc>w</trunc>  a standard procedure is to calculate # various skill scores and one of the popular ones is the equitable threat score its got a definition like this but basically one means a <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> forecast and zero or a random forecast so you can see over a a bit over a year you can see the sort of <trunc>tra</trunc>  trajectory of the scores for various different models so i'm pleased to note that the Met Office mesoscale is coming out top here # Meteo France is a bit of a poor showing there although it does improve this point here in around April two thousand and three and quite an interesting factor there is that there's sudden change in their cloud scheme here so you can see from <trunc>p</trunc>  basically never predicting above around point two cloud fraction and they tweak their model and then suddenly they're getting much higher values you can see suddenly their skill scores actually improved here and one thing that's interesting to note is that # cloud fraction and water content in this model are actually entirely diagnostic so it predicts humidity # and then <trunc>pr</trunc>  prognostically and then from that it diagnoses # cloud # amount and water content diagnostically so so it's sort of interesting to see whether with quite a crude scheme certainly compared with the Met Office model to see # have # skills that are comparable so we can also do the # skill score versus height and you can see again the Met Office model with a short time scales is # six to eleven hour forecasts # is nosing ahead E-C-M-W-F # this Dutch model and also the Met Office model with a <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> time of about a day all do comparably well # and them the Meteo France model has sort of increased from before # two-thousand-and-three to after # it hasn't quite caught up with the crowd there so there's certainly a potential to with this technique to test new model paramaterizations you could re-run # the models <trunc>an</trunc>  and redo the skill scores and also what we are also doing is comparing the global versus the mesoscale versions of the Met Office model but both of their # data extracted so just to conclude well this is really the first time that we've had such a large # timed series of data the key parameters that we need to evaluate # climate models and forecast models # and from we can apply this to a number of different sites around the world course there's other Cloudnet products hat i haven't talked about such as drizzle # ice particle size # turbulent kinetic energy dissipation rate # and of course we're we're also moving to # apply this to the U-S A-R-M site # in the framework of the new G-W-E-X working group and of course there's still lots to do in evaluating # these various models # i've just sort of touched on some of the the ways that were doing it so far and if you're interested in more information then you can find it here we've got some <trunc>pr</trunc>  Quicklooks at this web site so i'll finish there </u>
 <u who="nm5390">okay time for maybe one or two questions yes</u>
 <u who="nm5393">how do you <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> the sort of problems with just the synoptic development in the models which have absolutely nothing to with cloud scheme models what do you then get on your sort of <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> </u>
<u who="nm5391">yeah we are we are evaluating how <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> the clouds are which is often because the dynamics is good and that puts it in the right place so you really have to then strip out the skill scores which evaluate how good the actual forecast was in an instantaneous sense and the climatology which is what a climate model would fix and so in that situation the # you'd only have a sort of statistical representation of the weather systems if you like we weren't trying to evaluate the individual ones and so climate models <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> compare the means</u>
<u who="nm5393">but i mean even in the forecast models in mean in your opinion at at at points <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> for example</u>
<u who="nm5391">yeah</u>
<u who="nm5393">and if if the cloud system is just slightly in the wrong place because of error <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> in the forecast how can</u>
<u who="nm5391">we are we have <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/></u>
<u who="nm5393">do you <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> how you might sort that out</u>
<u who="nm5391">well we looked through got data from # a whole # each Met Office forecast for example we've got the full period so we can evaluate the different times and look at the increase in error basically as we go for different time scale so you can do that</u>
<u who="nm5390">just one more question yeah</u>
<u who="nm5394">your P-D-F cloud maps for the observation is a bit suspicious isn't it because it had the big # fraction for hundred percent quite a small fraction for ninety percent i mean why should there be such a big difference in observation between</u>
<u who="nm5391">this is</u>
<u who="nm5394"><trunc>compl</trunc> complete cloud cover and ninety percent</u>
<u who="nm5391">this is #</u>
<u who="nm5394">cloud cover</u>
<u who="nm5391">that's a forecast between three and seven kilometres where you are dominated by <trunc>v</trunc>  very thick ice clouds and in fact when you do look at the observations you do find that certainly on the mesoscale grid # a a twelve kilometres you do average the right amount of times to the twelve kilometre <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> you do tend to either get a hundred percent cloud or no cloud at all and in fact the periods when you've just got partial cloud and it's at that height are actually much smaller that's what we see <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/></u>
<u who="nm5390">okay thanks <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> we'll move on now to our next speaker i'll introduce him very briefly # his reputation i i think precedes him here</u>
<u who="su">yeah</u>
<u who="nm5390"><gap reason="name" extent="2 word"/> is #</u>
<u who="su">the mike isn't on</u>
<u who="nm5390">professor of meteorology # been here since nineteen-ninety-three <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> # heads our radar group before that he was # at Manchester and # do you need any help with the equipment or you're all set</u>
<u who="nm5392">yes thanks for the check</u>
<u who="nm5390">okay so</u>
<u who="nm5392">okay thank you # well Robin's been showing what you can do from # a few spots on the ground for evaluating models and # really this # satellite mission the idea is to extend that sort of ideas and analysis # to grow so i'm going to give you some ideas this as you can see is some of this talk will be in E-E-S-A speak which is an interesting language which you will hear a bit of and i'll give you some # descriptions of # the sort of thing that goes on so # basically # this mission has been selected now as of November and Alan O'Neal was present at the meeting if you give him a few drinks he'll tell you about how they had to take a half way through the voting they took a coffee break and then the Germans he'll tell you all about that anyway after after the recount okay so lets think about the history here of the selection process which has been keeping me busy for quite a few years so in nineteen-ninety-seven nineteen-ninety-nine i went to Granada to present the earth radiation mission about six missions presented and # # i'll show you the ones that were selected there and then we realised what our error was of course is that we'd called this the radiation mission and this is these are the # i should say these are the missions we're looking at here for research not operation in other words follow on from the sort of N-V-S-A-T generation this is of course the E-E-S-A Living Planet programme and of course you know you don't want radiation because you're kill us all aren't you so we then # re-christened this # EarthCARE # you know EarthCARE which i must admit was # <trunc>y</trunc>  you can't be opposed to that # i always have to apologise with an English speaking audience for this title</u>
<u who="su">thank you</u>
<u who="nm5392">it was appointed by a French person # who didn't realise it's a little bit # over the top okay # however # let's just think of the other core missions and selected for the launch in about two-thousand-and-ten that gives quite a lot of time to tweak up some of these algorithms # two-thousand-and-six G-O-C-E these are the C-O-R-E missions G-O-C-E which is Gravity Ocean Circulation so the idea here is to get the # <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> to a few millimetres rather than a few centimetres and get the ocean currents much better from altimetry the dynamics mission two-thousand-and-seven is a a lidar in space to get clear air winds and these ones here are supposed to be slightly cheaper a Cryosat which we didn't hear about from # Duncan <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> ill but we probably will hear about in the summer and S-M-O-S this is looking this is an L-band # <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> of the surface which some people at the at the S-S-C are quite interested in okay this is the mission summary # and it says it all really so here we've got our radar lidar which # Robin's obviously been talking about giving us our vertical slice as we go round the planet and then we have two passive instruments to place this is some sort of context so we have an image of <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> a sort of # <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> type to give some # context over the # few hundred kilometres and also an <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> type instrument to give us the up welling radiation in the short and the long wave # broad band okay # so just going through this again right so this is sort of <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> our mission summary a scientific objectives the aerosol cloud radiation interactions we're trying to get vertical profiles of natural and anthropogenic aerosols and then look at their interaction with radiation and clouds the vertical distribution of liquid water and ice on a global scale and their transport the details of cloud overlap in the vertical cloud-precipitation interactions and the characteristics of vertical motions and then put the whole thing together hopefully to get the radiated heating and cooling who are combined # with the aerosols and so forth okay a little bit of background here well this is the scope of the mission <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> sort of geologists who were <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> so here's most of the <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> on the cloud <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> troposphere # tropopause <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> radiation so again for the # we're hoping to get the # fluxes in the vertical to ten watts per square metre instantaneously <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> over so here are sort of # again for geologists and so forth the sorts of problems we're looking at are the direct effects of aerosols and radiation the direct # cooling and the absorbing <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> carbon # the indirect effect of cloud condensation nuclei and the lifetime effect # and then next # the general thing about the cloud # feedbacks and the <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> high and low cloud vertical structure overlap so interested in the amounts of condensate and the sedimentation rate of ice which of course dictates the lifetime of the cirrus in your model and a little bonus here in the convective precipitation # are these parameterised motions of convection correct we need to get these three right and what about these occasional punches through the # tropopause # through the cold trap there how often does that occur which will answer ideally these particular questions now this is something for Piers this is a an E-E-S-A version of this diagram you're going to <trunc>r</trunc>  re-draw Piers # so here's our forcing for the greenhouse gasses I-P-C-C and then our Japanese colleague Terry # Nakajima has done some more experiments so perhaps we know a little bit more about the direct aerosol but the indirect aerosol is still extremely uncertain and of course ice clouds and aerosol well # who knows and then just to recollect of course the proposal is that these effect of cloud of course an enormous shortwave and longwave effect of about eighty and a hundred watts per square metre and the net effect of the balance sort of cooling at about twenty watts per square metre but just disturb this a little bit and of course # the net change is is large and this is what's responsible for the # <trunc>s</trunc>  a lot of the spread of the global warming forecast but i think # # Robin obviously mentioned the cloud modelling but let's just think we have no information at the moment on the profile of the aerosols these ice water contents well we're getting those just from the ground sites but this will give us it globally and then we have some # global information on convective updraughts okay so these are our mission needs here we hope to get the here's the aerosols this is the sort of thing you see from a lidar <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> elevated aerosol over the # Indian Ocean this is some Peter Walton data here's the convection here seen # from # <trunc>e</trunc>  E-R-T <trunc>p</trunc>  penetrating the tropopause here over Brazil and then this is the radar and the lidar together your imager these are some clouds off California give you some idea of how representative these slices are and here's your <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> type broadband getting the upwelling of radiation which we're going to have a look again at so we have our four particular instruments and i'm going to concentrate on radar and the lidar and some particular features there which we've # developed for this mission so we've seen this one before in Robin's talk we really are interested in seeing there's always from space of course especially with active instruments there's always a # sensitivity <trunc>asp</trunc>  problem because of distance we really would like to see # extinction coefficients larger than about point-oh-five or point-oh-four per kilometre that gives us about ten watts per square metre and this means # the backscatter sensitivity sort of backscatter to extinction is fifty about this unit down here and basically the problem with the lidar of course is correcting for the attenuation through the cloud and of course when you get the backscatter how is that related to the forward scatter or the extinction which is what you really want to know and the way we're going to do that is a rather clever idea using a high spectral resolution # lidar which separates the Rayleigh or molecular scatter from cloud aerosol rescatter so what does this mean well let's just have a look at Icesat which is up at the moment looking at the # isopoles this is a flight # as it goes over the Arabian Sea over Iran and then a little bit over # the the former Soviet Union up here you can see the molecular scatter increasing slowly as this gets deeper <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> lighter blue because the <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> gives you the <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> density of the molecules we can also see the aerosols down here in blue and green and their vertical extent and see the clouds here in white it's nice to see if anybody's interested in here you've got the the # low level clouds here embedded and the aerosol above it and here there's <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> aerosol below here are the # higher cirrus clouds and you can also see how you can there's black below here because they've completely attenuated that's the use of the molecular scatter tells you how much optical depth this one hasn't attenuated so much so moving on to the # <trunc>l</trunc>  # lidar was actually flown for a few days with ten hours' data on the shuttle in ninety-four and again here's the clouds running down you can see this is <trunc>s</trunc>  # <trunc>s</trunc>  the super cooled clouds that Robin was referring to and you can see that there in the lidar attenuates completely <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> these ice clouds there's a smaller optical depth and # just in preparation # we looked at the ten hours of data and how often we got these supercooled clouds and for clouds about minus ten at our latitudes they're present actually about thirty percent of the time which is surprising they're rather thin so they're very poorly <trunc>recomend</trunc>  <trunc>re</trunc>  # represented in models and it's interesting to note that in fact the the <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> site here was quite representative from the # # satellite and <trunc>th</trunc>  # from the # L-I-T-E data for these particular same latitudes course if you just take a little bit of ice and turned it into liquid water here you change the radiation by about a hundred watts per square metre so this this is effectively perhaps quite large but # would be interesting to look at that proposal in more detail so how does this high spectral resolution work rather busy slide i'm afraid if you look at the backscatter power here then the molecular is moving at six-hundred metres a second so it's a broad # spectrum whereas the clouds and the aerosol a metre a second so you can that's a sharp peak so you can separate out these two so that's the the trick here to filter out theses two returns and separate them so when we're this is a simulation looking down through two kilometres of aerosol the Rayleigh scattering drops off a little it from what you'd expect which tells you you've got an optical depth here of about point one which you can then use to correct the Mie scattering # i'm sorry to get back to here and this is the extinction so this way we've got the # extinction from how much the Rayleigh has been reduced correct the Mie to get the correct backscatter so we've now got several bits of information for the aerosol in this case <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> we've got the # extinction and the backscatter and that ratio that can vary from ten to a hundred aerosol particles so it gives us some information about the type of aerosol particle and we also have the # cross-polar return which is different from spheres # and # non-spheres so you think with this not completely orthogonal but obviously the anthropogenic aerosol is spherical whereas for example desert aerosol is jagged and gives you different # backscatter extinction ratio and different # different polarisation so this is the sort thing you see in your profile this is what your Rayleigh <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> does there's a bit of cloud here and there's a little jog here because you've lost oh-point-oh-four optical depth about eight percent of what you'd expect so that's the # optical depth that's the forward scatter and this is the backscatter and here again is the aerosol layer and you can # get that optical depth and also the backscatter okay that's that's the lidar in the next five minutes let's just talk a little bit about the radar you've seen this one as well before and again in this case we've done some sums looking at aircraft data and so forth and we think we need # about minus thirty-six D-B-Z on this scale here down here to see most of the radiatively significant clouds those with the optical depth of point-oh-five kilometre and there's # what was indicated if we # from the radar we probably get the ice water to about fifty percent if we have the radar and the lidar <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> better and CloudSat in fact <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> going to be <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> we're very excited about this this summer launched and that will actually have a # one-point-eight metre antenna high orbit see about minus twenty-eight D-B-Z so at this stage you're probably wondering well what does all this D-B-Z mean we all like to use this the radar people and that's the return in D-B # compared to the return from one millimetre drop per cubic metre so we're actually about thirty D-B below that which is of course a factor of a thousand however # all these # trips to # E-E-S-A etcetera do rather tiring so when one's coming back on the last B-M-I flight at eleven at night wondering if you've missed the bus and you're sitting there it's a great pleasure to read the Voyager magazine which actually had a little explanation a few weeks ago on D-B so they have a little they always have these upmarket things this is on Formula One <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> couple of pages written by Tom Clarkson which is a terrible i think there's two of these Clarksons around this is Tom and <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> sixty things so he actually had a little explanation here which may interest you on D-B there so these Formula One each one car pedal to the metal gives a hundred-and-thirty D-B if you've got twenty of them that would be two-thousand-six-hundred so anyway # i'm sure # Jeremy wouldn't have made that kind of of mistake so okay so what they didn't do on there of course which is the main pleasure of the F-One <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> is of course people like to hear the Doppler effect apparently it it gives people tremendous buzz so we measured the Doppler here as well but # unfortunately Clarkson didn't explain so how do you measure this from space because you're looking for a change of the return frequency if it's a metre a second of about one part in a hundred-million so we don't actually do that we look at the return <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> one pulse out when the particle's here pulse out T later when the particle has moved and suppose it just moves a quarter of a wavelength then <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> there's an extra hundred-and-eighty degree phase shift so now rather than being not sensitive enough it is very sensitive and your big problem in fact is that if it's moved more than a quarter of a wavelength and this is your folding velocity we have to send our pulses just just this is just a little bit of technology for a people <trunc>w</trunc>  # makes this slide <trunc>s</trunc>  a little thing we have to think about twenty-one kilometres is the height of the cloud so we in the Tropics so we better have a pulse every point one four milliseconds that's the most rapid it's moved a quarter of a wavelength that gives a <trunc>f</trunc>  folding velocity of six metres a second so why hasn't # haven't these things been done before from space <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> well the problem is of course that if you're moving at seven kilometres a second you look <trunc>int</trunc>  you a certain sin path theta of seven kilometres a second on one side of <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> the other so that's gives you some random phase variation and of course your you've seen a hundred-and-eighty degree shift here the noise mustn't really be more than ninety degree <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> shift in other words your Doppler width mustn't be more than three metres a second or that would be a random ninety degree <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> and if you do this sum you have to have two-point-four metres of antenna so on the three or four trips i've made to Japan each time we went out with Japanese we managed to get the antenna up from one-point-eight to one-point-nine to two and finally # got them to agree to have a two-point-four metre antenna which gives us now means we can do the Doppler and we can also get our extra sensitivity remembering we add rather than multiply okay so what do we need the Doppler for so this again is our flight with <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> two above the Brazilian severe convection and you can see here here's the penetrative here it's penetrating up into the # stratosphere <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> looking at that interesting ice sedimentation and looking at # light precipitation the sort of specs we need for that maybe convection to a metre a second and the ice <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> and of course the drizzle which we're passionately interested in # point-two metre a second course the drizzle actually is quite important seriously for the decoupling of the evaporating drizzle decouples <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> and # when you the trouble is that when <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> to noise that gives you some more random phase noise so # the higher the signal to noise the better you can do the Doppler but basically # we want the convective motion a metre a second with a only a every kilometre of <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> can just about do that <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> and we are allowed to have a longer integration time for the cirrus and drizzle because that's # more homogeneous and # it just <trunc>a</trunc>  about works with this two-point-four metre antenna and at this level here you're seeing actually most of the ice <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> from the aircraft's <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> okay so this is the sort of mock-up people like to produce just to give you an idea of <trunc>s</trunc>  bits of redundancy the radar itself two-hundred kilos three-hundred watts and there's also the imager five-hundred <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> of resolution seven channels in the visible and the infrared and the broadband radiometer looks at ten kilometre pixels three angles # vertical fifty-nine off on either side for the # radiance to flux conversion that gives us our # instantaneous broadband fluxes and the whole satellite a couple of potential # ways of configuring it one-point-two tonnes and just over a kilowatt is needed # just a little remark on # data assimilation so this is data assimilation for geologists here don't need to go through that again i think it's still true there is no explicit analysis of clouds at the moment in global data assimilation so i think that's true yes maybe not # we put global <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> scale probably not true so # how # how is this going to <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> will be working quite a bit with E-C-M-W-F on this particular aspect and they've done some one D-var so this is on the A-R-M data <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> this is the observation this is the model first guess and then this is merging the two <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> particular errors # one D-var but what's coming along as well here just to show you some of the sort of <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> and they've also been calculating a lot of the <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> which of course needed for the correct # # assimilation so if we look at the short wave in the winter so this is how much does the top of the radiation atmosphere radiation change it can change the cloud cover fraction <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> spot <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> here and you can see for the short wave of course reflected sunlight this is the bubble level so this is the water <trunc>c</trunc>  that's the melting layer in in the # water level in the tropics this is the sort of level of the <trunc>stratocu</trunc>  and there's a small effect of reflection from the cirrus long wave radiation of course is rather different because you know north south effect now from reflected sunlight the biggest effect of course is <trunc>ref</trunc>  is is the radiation emitted from the # # cold cirrus and then also the effect of the the melting layer so these sorts of jackovians are being developed by E-C-M-W-F # so the next few years' time hopefully one can assimilate # so that's the particular summary of what we think # we should be able to do and # <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> fundamentally from the high spectral lidar <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> radar <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> aerosols # and their interaction with clouds and also <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> first time to get some ideas of these # convective motions so <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> thank you</u>
