<u who="nm0763"> right well as you can see # <pause dur="0.2"/> i'm all <pause dur="0.2"/> wired up <pause dur="1.1"/><event desc="turns on overhead projector" iterated="n"/> for the benefit of # posterity <pause dur="0.9"/> # <pause dur="1.1"/> the <pause dur="0.2"/> synopsis of this lecture <pause dur="0.2"/> is in the handout <pause dur="0.3"/> that i gave out at two o'clock today <pause dur="1.0"/> and i'm going to be <pause dur="0.4"/> discussing the issue of <pause dur="0.5"/> sequential games <pause dur="0.5"/> # an aspect which in a way develops <pause dur="0.5"/> # quite nicely some of the issues that so far <pause dur="0.4"/> # have as it were cropped up <pause dur="0.5"/> # in the course of these lectures but have frankly <pause dur="0.3"/> # rather been fudged <pause dur="0.8"/><kinesic desc="puts on transparency" iterated="n"/> and the <pause dur="0.2"/> key <pause dur="0.3"/> # issue that we really fudged <pause dur="0.4"/> is exactly in what order <pause dur="0.5"/> # the moves are made <pause dur="0.3"/> within a particular game <pause dur="0.8"/> so what i now want to just review <pause dur="0.5"/> one or two basic concepts <pause dur="0.5"/> # that relate to <pause dur="0.6"/> representing games in a sense a more explicit form <pause dur="0.8"/> # this <pause dur="0.3"/> form is known as the extensive form of the game <pause dur="0.5"/> and it differs from the normal form <pause dur="0.3"/> bit of jargon this the normal form <pause dur="0.4"/> basically is the form of that matrix <pause dur="0.4"/> or bi-matrix that we've been working with in previous lectures <pause dur="0.3"/> we put up a table of rows and columns <pause dur="0.3"/> # we have a pair of numbers <pause dur="0.3"/> in each of the cells in the table <pause dur="0.3"/> 
and that's how we represent the game <pause dur="0.8"/> we then proceed to analyse the game <pause dur="0.3"/> as if each player decided on their strategies <pause dur="0.4"/> independently <pause dur="0.3"/> of <pause dur="0.2"/> what the other <trunc>s</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> player decided <pause dur="0.6"/> but it's quite possible <pause dur="0.4"/> that in many cases a game could be played in such a way <pause dur="0.3"/> that one player moves first and the other moves second <pause dur="0.4"/> in which case the most important point would be <pause dur="0.4"/> that the player that moves second would know <pause dur="0.2"/> the decision <pause dur="0.4"/> that the first player had already made <pause dur="0.8"/> and there are then <pause dur="0.2"/> two possibilities here <pause dur="0.5"/> one is <pause dur="0.5"/> that because the second player <pause dur="0.5"/> is <pause dur="0.3"/> better informed <pause dur="0.4"/> than that is he knows what the first player's already decided <pause dur="0.4"/> whereas the first player when he made his move <pause dur="0.3"/> did not know what the second player was going to do <pause dur="0.4"/> that therefore this gives an advantage to the second player <pause dur="0.4"/> so you could say <pause dur="0.2"/> well the sequence will matter <pause dur="0.4"/> # because <pause dur="0.3"/> whoever moves second is in a stronger position <pause dur="0.4"/> because they have more information <pause dur="1.1"/> but actually there's another side to this <pause dur="0.8"/> and this depends on the following issue <pause dur="0.6"/> 
and that is <pause dur="0.2"/> suppose that each of the players did know the other player's pay-offs <pause dur="0.8"/> you might be able to work out if you knew the other player's pay-offs <pause dur="0.3"/> what they would do under certain conditions <pause dur="0.3"/> given that they knew what you had done <pause dur="0.6"/> and therefore you might as it were have a degree of power <pause dur="0.5"/> because <pause dur="0.2"/> by moving first you could frame <pause dur="0.5"/> the context in which the second decision was made <pause dur="0.6"/> and if you knew the other player's pay-offs <pause dur="0.3"/> you could then <pause dur="0.2"/> work out before you made your move <pause dur="0.4"/> how the other player would respond <pause dur="0.5"/> so it's by no means clear when players do make moves <pause dur="0.4"/> whether the <pause dur="0.2"/> advantage lies with the first mover <pause dur="0.4"/> or with the second mover <pause dur="0.4"/> it all depends to some degree <pause dur="0.2"/> on the nature of the game the structure of the pay-offs on the one hand <pause dur="0.5"/> and how much the players know <pause dur="0.3"/> before the game starts <pause dur="0.3"/> about each other's pay-offs and that <pause dur="0.3"/> brings me to the second point <pause dur="0.4"/> about the <pause dur="0.3"/> information set <pause dur="0.5"/> because <pause dur="0.2"/> the information set is basically what each player knows <pause dur="0.6"/> and <pause dur="0.3"/> # in a game 
played out sequentially <pause dur="0.4"/> the information set changes because as the moves are made <pause dur="0.4"/> new information <pause dur="0.3"/> on what moves have been made <pause dur="0.3"/> is added to the information set <pause dur="0.5"/> and what this means is <pause dur="0.7"/> that the <pause dur="1.0"/> information set changes <pause dur="0.4"/> as the game proceeds <pause dur="0.8"/> now <pause dur="0.2"/> in one sense that then makes the whole analysis much more <pause dur="0.3"/> complicated <pause dur="0.5"/> but <pause dur="0.4"/> in another sense <pause dur="0.3"/> it it actually makes it in some respect simpler too <pause dur="0.5"/> the reason that it makes it in some sense simpler is this <pause dur="0.6"/> that if there is a a final stage of the game <pause dur="0.6"/> then you can imagine <pause dur="0.3"/> what the players would be doing at this final stage of the game <pause dur="0.6"/> if there were a definite last play <pause dur="0.6"/> # a last step in the game <pause dur="0.5"/> then <pause dur="0.2"/> both the players would presumably know <pause dur="0.3"/> everything that had happened up to that stage <pause dur="0.6"/> and you could then construct a series of scenarios <pause dur="0.4"/> if a certain sequence of moves had occurred <pause dur="0.3"/> and the players knew this <pause dur="0.3"/> in the final step <pause dur="0.4"/> they would <pause dur="0.2"/> be equipped with the following information and would <pause dur="0.2"/> behave in the following way <pause dur="0.7"/> so <pause dur="0.4"/> you can construct 
a range of scenarios to work out in principle <pause dur="0.3"/> how the various players would move at the final stage of the game <pause dur="0.5"/> depending on what had gone before <pause dur="0.7"/> and then if the players themselves <pause dur="0.5"/> could work out what was likely to happen at later plays <pause dur="0.4"/> they could make their own <pause dur="0.2"/> earlier plays in the knowledge of what the consequences of those plays would be <pause dur="0.4"/> for later stages of the game <pause dur="0.5"/> and that is basically what is meant by the concept firstly of backward induction <pause dur="0.4"/> that is to solve games that are in a sequential form <pause dur="0.3"/> what one does is begin with the final stage and work backwards <pause dur="0.4"/> towards deciding what each player will do at the outset <pause dur="1.0"/> and the allied concept of <pause dur="0.3"/> subgame perfection <pause dur="0.6"/> is that at any stage in a game <pause dur="0.5"/> each player will look ahead <pause dur="0.6"/> at all the scenarios that could develop <pause dur="0.4"/> as a result of alternative decisions by they might make at that stage <pause dur="0.6"/> and therefore subgame perfection basically means <pause dur="0.3"/> that each player <pause dur="0.3"/> # works <pause dur="0.3"/> # with full use of the information they have at any stage <pause dur="0.3"/> as to what 
the repercussions <pause dur="0.4"/> of that move might be <pause dur="0.6"/> in the context for example of a game of chess <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> a chess player <pause dur="0.3"/> who is operating with backward induction and subgame perfection <pause dur="0.4"/> basically tries to identify <pause dur="0.3"/> all the possible endgames that might <pause dur="0.2"/> develop <pause dur="0.7"/> and then works back to decide which of these endgames he would like to get into <pause dur="0.7"/> and therefore finally arrives at the question <pause dur="0.3"/> if i make this move what endgame am i likely to finish up with <pause dur="0.4"/> if i make that move what endgame am i likely to finish up with <pause dur="0.4"/> and therefore solves the game in that way <pause dur="0.4"/> now chess is a notoriously complex game <pause dur="0.4"/> and one of the <pause dur="0.2"/> # attractive features of it <pause dur="0.2"/> is that it's in fact not normally difficult for people <pause dur="0.3"/> with finite human <pause dur="0.3"/> # rationality <pause dur="0.3"/> to actually approach a game of chess in that way <pause dur="0.4"/> but with the <pause dur="0.2"/> simpler games certainly two by two games of the kind that we've been discussing in this course <pause dur="0.5"/> it is possible to approach them in this way <pause dur="0.3"/> and i will in fact illustrate <pause dur="0.3"/> # how that can be done <pause dur="1.3"/> and # <pause dur="0.2"/> finally this 
analysis of <pause dur="0.3"/> sequential <pause dur="0.3"/> games also provides a discussion <pause dur="0.5"/> of issues relating to <pause dur="0.4"/> credibility <pause dur="0.7"/> and credibility is an important issue in modern economics <pause dur="0.4"/> for example we're told that <pause dur="0.2"/> the independence <pause dur="0.2"/> of the Bank of England <pause dur="0.3"/> gives <pause dur="0.2"/> credibility <pause dur="0.3"/> to monetary policy <pause dur="0.9"/> we're told <pause dur="0.3"/> that # <pause dur="0.8"/> for countries that enter in to treaties <pause dur="0.3"/> through the World Trade Organization <pause dur="0.5"/> give credibility to their competition and trade policies <pause dur="0.4"/> because if they were to change them at some future time <pause dur="0.4"/> they would suffer severe penalties and everybody knows this <pause dur="0.9"/> we also discuss in industrial economics <pause dur="0.4"/> issues about whether <pause dur="0.3"/> particular <pause dur="0.3"/> strategies towards entry deterrents are credible <pause dur="0.7"/> if a firm in an industry <pause dur="0.4"/> says to a potential entrant <pause dur="0.7"/> if you enter <pause dur="0.5"/> i will cut price and that will put you out of business <pause dur="0.6"/> is that threat actually a credible threat which will <pause dur="0.7"/> keep out the entrant <pause dur="0.6"/> or is it a not credible threat <pause dur="0.3"/> because if the entrant were to actually enter <pause dur="0.4"/> they would call the incumbent firm's bluff <pause dur="0.5"/> then the 
incumbent would then be faced with the situation well given <pause dur="0.2"/> that they've entered <pause dur="0.4"/> that we all know they've entered <pause dur="0.5"/> it's no longer <pause dur="0.3"/> # rational for me to carry out my threat <pause dur="0.6"/> so by looking ahead at later stages of the game <pause dur="0.6"/> one can investigate <pause dur="0.3"/> what kind of promises commitments <pause dur="0.2"/> threats and so on <pause dur="0.3"/> can economic agents make to one another <pause dur="0.5"/> and <pause dur="0.3"/> which of them will be discounted <pause dur="0.5"/> as being not credible I-E <pause dur="0.3"/> not rational in the light of <pause dur="0.3"/> what will later materialize <pause dur="0.3"/> and which of them can be identified <pause dur="0.3"/> <kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="2"/> as being # rational <pause dur="0.6"/> so let's start on this <pause dur="0.3"/> # by going back <pause dur="0.2"/> to # a very simple issue <pause dur="0.3"/> of some games we've already looked at <pause dur="1.0"/> the first game we've looked at <pause dur="0.4"/> is the prisoner's dilemma <pause dur="0.6"/> and in the prisoner's dilemma as you will i hope recall <pause dur="0.4"/> # the strategy of cheating <pause dur="0.4"/> in a one shot game is always dominant <pause dur="0.5"/> now what that means is <pause dur="0.4"/> that if you say to one player <pause dur="0.3"/> okay you go first <pause dur="0.3"/> the other player will then go after <pause dur="1.0"/> neither player <pause dur="0.5"/> minds what the other player is going to do because 
whatever the other player does <pause dur="0.8"/> whatever the other player does it always pays them to cheat <pause dur="0.5"/> so the prisoner's dilemma is a special type of game <pause dur="0.4"/> in which the sequence of moves <pause dur="0.2"/> doesn't actually matter <pause dur="0.5"/> because each player has a dominant strategy whatever the other player does <pause dur="0.6"/> they do the same thing <pause dur="0.4"/> so knowing what the other player's going to do <pause dur="0.3"/> doesn't alter <pause dur="0.2"/> the way they will act at all <pause dur="0.7"/> but there are other games we've looked at <pause dur="0.3"/> <kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="2"/> where the sequence does matter <pause dur="0.5"/> and the simplest example of this <pause dur="0.4"/> is the battle of the sexes game <pause dur="0.5"/> where we have Jack and Jill <pause dur="0.4"/> # going either to the wrestling or to the opera <pause dur="0.7"/> and we have two possible <pause dur="0.3"/> scenarios that we can distinguish here <pause dur="0.6"/> in the first Jack <pause dur="0.3"/> makes the decision <pause dur="0.5"/> announces what he's going to do and leaves Jill to respond <pause dur="0.5"/> and in the second Jill moves first <pause dur="0.7"/> now the essence of this as i say <pause dur="0.3"/> is based on the idea <pause dur="0.5"/> that <pause dur="0.2"/> each player <pause dur="0.2"/> may have a knowledge of the other player's pay-offs <pause dur="0.5"/> so let's suppose in this case <pause dur="0.4"/> that Jack knows not only Jack's 
preferences but also Jill's preferences <pause dur="0.5"/> and that Jill knows not only Jill's preferences <pause dur="0.4"/> but also Jack's preferences <pause dur="1.1"/> suppose now we # <pause dur="0.3"/> look at the game and represent it in this <pause dur="0.3"/> # what's called the extensive form <pause dur="0.4"/> the extensive form is usually portrayed <pause dur="0.3"/> in the form of decision trees <pause dur="0.4"/> so if we look at this first decision tree <pause dur="0.4"/> what this says is we start up here <pause dur="0.8"/><kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> and the first person <pause dur="0.4"/> to move to make a decision <pause dur="0.3"/> is Jack and Jack makes a decision <pause dur="0.3"/> either to go wrestling <pause dur="0.4"/> or to go to the opera <pause dur="1.1"/> that decision then becomes known it's obviously known to Jack because he made it <pause dur="0.3"/> but it also becomes known to Jill <pause dur="0.5"/> and when that decision's made <pause dur="0.3"/> then Jill <pause dur="0.4"/> # can decide whether to go wrestling or go to the opera <pause dur="1.0"/> but under these circumstances <pause dur="0.7"/> if <pause dur="0.5"/> Jack <pause dur="0.2"/> knows <pause dur="1.5"/> that # <pause dur="0.9"/> Jill <pause dur="0.3"/> is <pause dur="0.6"/> # aware of his decision <pause dur="1.0"/> then he can calculate what Jill will do <pause dur="0.6"/> because he can say if i go wrestling <pause dur="0.9"/> then given her pay-offs <pause dur="0.5"/> Jill will want to go wrestling too because although she doesn't much like the wrestling <pause dur="0.4"/> she'd rather <trunc>g</trunc> be same place i am <pause dur="0.4"/> rather than somewhere completely different <pause dur="0.9"/> so if i go wrestling <pause dur="0.5"/> then <pause dur="0.8"/> Jill will go wrestling too <pause dur="0.9"/> on the other hand if i go to the opera <pause dur="0.9"/> Jill will also go to the opera she likes going to the opera <pause dur="0.4"/> but she'll go there <pause dur="0.2"/> just to meet me how nice <pause dur="0.7"/> 
so <pause dur="0.2"/> in that case <pause dur="0.2"/> Jack knowing Jill's preferences <pause dur="0.4"/> knows <pause dur="0.4"/> that whatever he does <pause dur="0.4"/> it will pay Jill once she knows what he's done <pause dur="0.4"/> to do the same <pause dur="0.6"/> but he can then use this information to his own advantage <pause dur="0.7"/> because by moving first he can say aha <pause dur="0.8"/> i can go wrestling <pause dur="0.6"/> because i know that even though Jill would rather go to the opera <pause dur="0.7"/> if she knows i am going to the wrestling she'll go to the wrestling too <pause dur="0.5"/> so as long as he makes sure that Jill knows the decision <pause dur="0.5"/> the ability to move first <pause dur="0.4"/> means that he can go to the wrestling <pause dur="0.6"/> # and then Jill goes to the wrestling and he's better off <pause dur="0.9"/> he gets a pay-off of two <pause dur="0.6"/> whereas if <pause dur="0.3"/> he'd gone to the opera <pause dur="0.3"/> he could predict that Jill would go to the opera <pause dur="0.3"/> but he would only get a pay-off of one <pause dur="0.8"/> so here is an example of first mover advantage <pause dur="0.3"/> the advantage here is that <pause dur="0.3"/> although Jill is better informed <pause dur="0.7"/> Jack can anticipate Jill's responses to his actions <pause dur="0.4"/> and therefore he can as it were endogenize Jill's response to his action <pause dur="0.5"/> # in in deciding what he 
will do <pause dur="1.7"/> and if Jill moves first instead <pause dur="0.3"/> then we get a different result <pause dur="0.8"/> because now if Jill <pause dur="0.4"/> can work out <pause dur="0.7"/> how Jack will behave <pause dur="0.2"/> from her knowledge of <pause dur="0.6"/> his preferences <pause dur="0.9"/> then the situation is as follows <pause dur="0.6"/> Jill moves first and if she goes to the wrestling <pause dur="0.4"/> she can predict that Jack will go to the wrestling because <pause dur="0.3"/> he likes to meet her and he likes wrestling <pause dur="0.9"/> but if she goes to the opera <pause dur="0.4"/> Jack will go to the opera because although he doesn't much like opera <pause dur="0.4"/> he'd rather go there <pause dur="0.2"/> than miss meeting her all together <pause dur="0.7"/> so Jill knows that if she goes to the opera Jack will go to the opera provided he knows she's gone to the opera <pause dur="0.6"/> and she <pause dur="0.3"/> will then <pause dur="0.3"/> # get <pause dur="0.4"/> a pay-off of two <pause dur="0.3"/> whereas if she goes wrestling Jack will go wrestling <pause dur="0.4"/> and she will only get a pay-off of one <pause dur="0.6"/> so <pause dur="0.3"/> Jill will then go to the opera <pause dur="0.6"/> so the decision is different <pause dur="0.5"/> according to the sequence <pause dur="0.3"/> in which the game is played <pause dur="0.8"/> so sequence does in fact matter <pause dur="0.7"/> now <pause dur="0.5"/> the only difficulty with this <pause dur="0.4"/> is that it imposes a sequence in 
which one does go first <pause dur="0.4"/> and the other <pause dur="0.3"/> then knows about it <pause dur="0.6"/> this <pause dur="0.7"/> extensive form representation <pause dur="0.4"/> would be a good deal more useful <pause dur="0.4"/> if it also contained the previous kind of game <pause dur="0.4"/> where the two players didn't know what each other had done <pause dur="0.4"/> # within it as well <pause dur="0.4"/> and so what people have done <pause dur="0.4"/> is to <pause dur="0.3"/> take this sequential <kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="3"/> # approach <pause dur="0.3"/> but to introduce a particular <pause dur="0.3"/> refinement of it <pause dur="0.5"/> which is to group together <pause dur="0.7"/> particular <pause dur="0.6"/> # nodes in the decision tree <pause dur="0.5"/> where people in fact do not have the information <pause dur="0.4"/> about the decision that has been made <pause dur="1.2"/> so if we wanted to portray <pause dur="0.5"/> simultaneous moves <pause dur="1.8"/> that is moves where neither party knows the other <pause dur="0.4"/> what we can do <pause dur="0.3"/> is suppose <pause dur="0.4"/> that they actually take place in sequence <pause dur="0.4"/> but that the first decision is not known <pause dur="0.7"/> to the person who acts later <pause dur="0.8"/> so we <pause dur="0.2"/> allow a temporal sequence <pause dur="0.4"/> but we allow a veil of ignorance to surround <pause dur="0.3"/> the initial move <pause dur="0.6"/> and that veil of ignorance is illustrated by drawing this line <pause dur="0.3"/> round these two points <pause dur="0.3"/> implying <pause dur="0.2"/> that Jill cannot 
distinguish between them <pause dur="0.6"/> in other words Jack's moved first he's made his decision <pause dur="0.4"/> Jack knows what he's done <pause dur="0.5"/> but Jill doesn't <pause dur="0.7"/> under these circumstances we're back to the previous <pause dur="0.4"/> # indeterminacy <pause dur="0.4"/> # in the outcome we're back to the previous situation of multiple outcomes <pause dur="0.4"/> because <pause dur="0.8"/> if Jack moves first but <pause dur="0.2"/> but Jill won't know what he's decided <pause dur="0.8"/> then Jack <pause dur="0.3"/> can't really infer exactly what Jill will do <pause dur="0.3"/> unless he has a theory <pause dur="0.5"/> about what beliefs Jill forms in the absence of any information <pause dur="0.4"/> on what he has done and that takes us straight back to the probability <pause dur="0.5"/> calculations <pause dur="0.3"/> that we've been using in the previous lectures <pause dur="0.7"/> but the point is this <pause dur="0.3"/> with the aid of this <pause dur="0.3"/> # device <pause dur="0.3"/> we can now represent any game involving simultaneous moves <pause dur="0.5"/> as a game involving sequential moves <pause dur="0.4"/> and therefore this extensive form of the game <pause dur="0.3"/> which portrays games in the form of decision trees <pause dur="0.3"/> is indeed more general <pause dur="0.5"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> where we are dealing with truly sequential moves <pause dur="0.3"/><event desc="takes off transparency" iterated="n"/> it's much more advantageous <pause dur="0.5"/> # than the <pause dur="0.3"/> # alternative 
approach <pause dur="0.7"/> what i now what to do is simply give an example <pause dur="0.4"/> of a sequential game <pause dur="0.4"/> and link it in <pause dur="0.3"/> to the point that i made <pause dur="0.4"/> about <pause dur="0.2"/> the credibility <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> of commitments and and and threats <pause dur="0.3"/> within the context of a sequential game <pause dur="0.5"/> i am going to take this game because it's a microcourse <pause dur="0.4"/> from <pause dur="0.2"/> microtheory <pause dur="0.4"/> and we're <kinesic desc="puts on transparency" iterated="n"/> going to look at a standard issue <pause dur="0.4"/> in industrial organization <pause dur="0.5"/> # an entry game <pause dur="1.1"/> and <pause dur="0.3"/> what i'm going to do is i'm first going to look at the game <pause dur="0.4"/> in the ordinary normal form that we've used before <pause dur="0.5"/> and see how far you could get <pause dur="0.3"/> using that ordinary <pause dur="0.3"/> normal form <pause dur="0.3"/> and the equilibrium concepts that we've been employing up till now <pause dur="0.8"/> i'll then argue <pause dur="0.4"/> that this game is inherently sequential <pause dur="0.7"/> and that to represent it as if the moves were simultaneous <pause dur="0.5"/> # is really quite misleading <pause dur="0.4"/> and that a good deal of additional insight <pause dur="0.3"/> into what actually goes on in these situations <pause dur="0.4"/> # can be obtained <pause dur="0.4"/> if you switch <pause dur="0.3"/> # to using the extensive form <pause dur="0.3"/> which allows for people to make their moves in their natural 
sequence <pause dur="0.9"/> so <pause dur="0.8"/> let's portray the game in the following way <pause dur="0.4"/> the entrant has a choice of two strategies <pause dur="0.3"/> one of which is simply not to enter <pause dur="0.3"/> the other of which is to enter <pause dur="1.4"/> the incumbent <pause dur="0.5"/> # has a choice of strategies <pause dur="0.3"/> if entry occurs <pause dur="0.7"/> that is he can either <pause dur="0.4"/> acquiesce in the entry <pause dur="0.9"/> or he can fight it <pause dur="0.7"/> if he acquiesces <pause dur="0.3"/> then basically he accepts that the <pause dur="0.4"/> market power that he had before <pause dur="0.5"/> is to some extent diminished by a rival <pause dur="1.8"/> or alternatively <pause dur="0.4"/> he can <pause dur="0.4"/> fight <pause dur="0.7"/> and fight basically means precipitate a price war <pause dur="0.5"/> with a view to damaging <pause dur="0.4"/> the rival's <pause dur="0.2"/> <trunc>th</trunc> <trunc>d</trunc> <trunc>dama</trunc> damaging the entrant's profitability <pause dur="1.8"/> so <pause dur="0.8"/> i've got here a structure of pay-offs what does this structure of pay-offs symbolize well firstly <pause dur="0.6"/> if the entrant stays out <pause dur="0.6"/> the entrant is the row player <pause dur="0.3"/> so their numbers are the first in these pairs <pause dur="0.6"/> if the entrant stays out then he gets no profits i mean that's just <pause dur="0.2"/> a a a null strategy <pause dur="0.5"/> so there's nothing for the entrant if he stays out <pause dur="0.4"/> so far as the incumbent is concerned <pause dur="0.4"/> he retains his 
dominant position in the market <pause dur="0.4"/> and so he gets a handsome return <pause dur="0.4"/> of <pause dur="0.2"/> thirteen units <pause dur="0.5"/> so that's just fine <pause dur="0.3"/> for the <pause dur="0.3"/> # incumbent firm <pause dur="0.7"/> if the entrant enters <pause dur="0.7"/> then the incumbent can acquiesce <pause dur="0.5"/> that means that the incumbent <pause dur="0.3"/> simply switches if he was a monopolist <pause dur="0.5"/> to <pause dur="0.3"/> some form of duopolistic behaviour <pause dur="0.6"/> so perhaps instead of having strong monopoly power <pause dur="0.4"/> there's now some degree <pause dur="0.5"/> of tacit <pause dur="0.5"/> duopolistic collusion <pause dur="0.4"/> the result is that the <pause dur="0.4"/> two firms <pause dur="0.3"/> share a rather diminished profit <pause dur="0.6"/> they share a diminished profit a total profit of six <pause dur="0.4"/> as opposed previously to the profit of thirteen <pause dur="0.4"/> that the incumbent had all for themselves <pause dur="1.4"/> alternatively <pause dur="0.4"/> the <trunc>e</trunc> incumbent can fight <pause dur="0.4"/> and if the incumbent fights then basically he drops the price very dramatically <pause dur="0.4"/> saying to the incumbent basically there's no way you are getting a foothold in this market <pause dur="0.4"/> unless you're prepared to buy market share <pause dur="0.4"/> at a loss-making price <pause dur="0.6"/> as a result of which he can inflict a loss <pause dur="0.4"/> of five <pause dur="0.4"/> on the entrant <pause dur="0.3"/> but only at the expense of 
inflicting a loss <pause dur="0.3"/> of five <pause dur="0.3"/> on himself <pause dur="1.2"/> now <pause dur="0.4"/> if we just look at this in its present form <pause dur="0.6"/> # as a two by two game <pause dur="0.5"/> # with sequential moves <pause dur="0.4"/> then <pause dur="0.2"/> we would proceed to calculate the equilibria <pause dur="0.4"/> # in the usual way i'm only interested here <pause dur="0.3"/> in pure strategy equilibria <pause dur="0.4"/> so we can do that quite simply in terms of best responses <pause dur="0.8"/> # and we can suppose to begin with <pause dur="0.3"/> that the entrant stays out <pause dur="0.7"/> # if the entrant stays out <pause dur="0.3"/> then the incumbent <pause dur="0.7"/> doesn't have to do anything <pause dur="0.5"/> so it doesn't really matter whether he acquiesces or fights <pause dur="0.9"/> # either is a response because nothing has happened <pause dur="0.5"/> so <pause dur="0.4"/> both of these are underlined they're both possible responses <pause dur="0.4"/> to the entrant staying out <pause dur="0.4"/> that's a weakness of the normal form <pause dur="0.3"/> it doesn't really capture the fact <pause dur="0.3"/> that these strategies only really come into being <pause dur="0.3"/> if the entrant really does enter <pause dur="0.5"/> but technically <pause dur="0.4"/> both of these are best responses to the <pause dur="0.4"/> # entrant's play out strategy <pause dur="0.8"/> so far as the incumbent is concerned if the entrant enters <pause dur="0.4"/> this is quite important <pause dur="0.4"/> it pays to acquiesce <pause dur="0.3"/> because three <pause dur="0.4"/> is <pause dur="0.2"/> better than minus-five <pause dur="0.6"/> so <pause dur="0.2"/> if <pause dur="0.3"/> the entrant were to enter <pause dur="0.5"/> and the incumbent <pause dur="0.3"/> # knew that he had <pause dur="0.5"/> then <pause dur="0.2"/> the incumbent would <pause dur="0.4"/> acquiesce <pause dur="1.5"/> 
so far as the entrant is concerned <pause dur="0.4"/> if he thinks <pause dur="0.4"/> the incumbent will acquiesce <pause dur="0.5"/> then he'll enter <pause dur="0.7"/> because if he stays out he gets zero but if he enters and the incumbent acquiesces he gets three <pause dur="0.8"/> so if he thinks <pause dur="0.5"/> that the <pause dur="0.8"/> incumbent will acquiesce then entry will occur <pause dur="1.3"/> alternatively if he thinks that the incumbent will <pause dur="0.2"/> fight <pause dur="0.7"/> then it's better to stay out <pause dur="0.4"/> because he will get zero if he stays out but incur a loss <pause dur="0.4"/> of five if he goes in <pause dur="0.7"/> and so if we now just look at where the equilibria are <pause dur="0.5"/> we see that there are two equilibria <pause dur="0.4"/> in one of which entry <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> is combined with acquiescence <pause dur="0.8"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> the other is that the entrant stays out <pause dur="0.3"/> because in some senses <pause dur="0.4"/> the <pause dur="0.4"/> the table suggests <pause dur="0.3"/> that the <pause dur="0.3"/> entrant <pause dur="0.2"/> that that the incumbent will be prepared <pause dur="0.4"/> to fight <pause dur="0.8"/> now that discussion <pause dur="0.3"/> isn't is partly adequate it's partly adequate because it does capture one insight <pause dur="0.4"/> it captures the insight that <pause dur="0.4"/> if the entrant were to enter <pause dur="0.4"/> it would pay the incumbent to acquiesce which is an important result <pause dur="0.8"/> but it's also <pause dur="0.3"/> # 
a bit unsatisfactory <pause dur="0.5"/> and it's unsatisfactory <pause dur="0.3"/> because the method of analysis we're using <pause dur="0.3"/> suggests <pause dur="0.4"/> that as it were <pause dur="0.3"/> the moves are simultaneous <pause dur="0.4"/> but in fact <pause dur="0.4"/> when you think the situation through <pause dur="0.4"/> this is inherently a sequential game <pause dur="0.5"/> because inherently what happens is <pause dur="0.4"/> that the entrant makes a decision <pause dur="0.7"/> and then the incumbent can decide <pause dur="0.4"/> the incumbent can decide what to do <pause dur="0.4"/> once he knows <pause dur="0.2"/> whether or not entry has occurred <pause dur="0.5"/> that is to say <pause dur="0.2"/> there's no reason <pause dur="0.4"/> for <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> the incumbent to start fighting an entrant who hasn't actually appeared <pause dur="0.8"/> so <pause dur="0.3"/> really <pause dur="0.3"/> # what we need to do is to move <pause dur="0.4"/> to the <kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="1"/> sequential <pause dur="0.2"/> form <pause dur="0.4"/> in order to get a more realistic picture <pause dur="0.6"/> what this sequential form does <pause dur="0.3"/> is it recognizes <pause dur="0.4"/> that the entrant does indeed move first <pause dur="1.1"/> and the incumbent then moves second <pause dur="0.6"/> and the incumbent only has a choice <pause dur="0.4"/> if the entrant enters <pause dur="0.4"/> so so this representation based on the extensive form <pause dur="0.4"/> with its decision tree <pause dur="0.5"/> says <pause dur="0.2"/> okay the entrant makes the first decision <pause dur="0.4"/> the entrant stays out there's nothing 
more to be said <pause dur="0.7"/> the # incumbent firm retains its market power <pause dur="0.4"/> the entrant gets nothing <pause dur="0.5"/> but if <pause dur="0.2"/> the entrant enters <pause dur="0.3"/> then the incumbent has the choice <pause dur="0.4"/> and that's where the pay-offs come in <pause dur="0.3"/> he can then either acquiesce or he can fight <pause dur="1.3"/> now <pause dur="0.3"/> how will this game then be played <pause dur="0.4"/> given <pause dur="0.5"/> that the sequence of moves is in this way <pause dur="0.8"/> well <pause dur="1.2"/> if <pause dur="0.7"/> we invoke the assumption that both players know the other player's pay-offs as well as their own <pause dur="0.9"/> then the entrant can calculate <pause dur="0.4"/> what the incumbent will do <pause dur="0.9"/> because <pause dur="0.4"/> the <pause dur="0.3"/> entrant knows <pause dur="0.4"/> these pay-offs he knows both <pause dur="0.7"/> all the numbers <pause dur="0.9"/> so he can say well right once i enter <pause dur="1.2"/> once i've entered the incumbent knows i've entered <pause dur="0.6"/> and if he acquiesces he gets three <pause dur="0.7"/> and if he fights he gets minus-five <pause dur="0.2"/> so once i've entered <pause dur="1.5"/> he will acquiesce <pause dur="0.2"/> i know that <pause dur="0.4"/> he will acquiesce <pause dur="0.5"/> suppose then that the incumbent <pause dur="0.8"/> says to the entrant if you enter i will fight <pause dur="1.0"/> what does the <pause dur="0.9"/> entrant do just discounts it one-hundred per cent it's just cheap talk <pause dur="0.6"/> it means nothing why because <pause dur="0.5"/> the 
entrant knows the incumbent's pay-offs <pause dur="0.4"/> and knows that although the entrant would like him to believe <pause dur="0.5"/> that he would fight <pause dur="0.8"/> the threat is not credible <pause dur="0.4"/> because once the entrant has entered and the incumbent knows it <pause dur="0.3"/> it won't pay him to implement his threat <pause dur="0.3"/> it'd be stupid of him to implement his threat <pause dur="0.3"/> only if there were further plays <pause dur="0.4"/> in which reputation effects became important <pause dur="0.3"/> might the incumbent wish to implement the threat <pause dur="0.3"/> for the sake of what might happen in some subsequent entry context <pause dur="0.4"/> but if we ignore <pause dur="0.4"/> the the repetition of the game <pause dur="0.4"/> then basically <pause dur="0.5"/> the incumbent's threat <pause dur="0.3"/> has no credibility <pause dur="0.5"/> the incumbent's threat has no credibility <pause dur="0.3"/> because it's not in line with the structure of pay-offs <pause dur="0.3"/> that the entrant knows <pause dur="0.7"/> so what does the entrant do <pause dur="0.6"/> well the entrant knows that if he enters <pause dur="0.5"/> the incumbent will acquiesce and therefore he'll get a pay-off of three <pause dur="0.7"/> whereas if he stays out he will get a pay-off of zero <pause dur="0.6"/> so he enters <pause dur="0.7"/> so in fact we have a unique 
equilibrium <pause dur="0.4"/> we had <pause dur="0.2"/> # multiple equilibria <pause dur="0.3"/> in that rather unsatisfactory analysis based on the normal form <pause dur="0.3"/> once we introduce the sequential structure explicitly <pause dur="0.4"/> we move to a plausible <pause dur="0.3"/> and unique equilibrium <pause dur="0.4"/> of entry <pause dur="0.3"/> followed by acquiescence <pause dur="1.8"/> <event desc="takes off transparency" iterated="n"/> the question then <pause dur="0.4"/> arises <pause dur="0.7"/> as well is there anything that the incumbent can do <pause dur="0.4"/> about this <pause dur="1.0"/> i mean we've seen that the incumbent can't just make threats <pause dur="0.8"/> because they won't <trunc>believ</trunc> be believable <pause dur="0.5"/> under these conditions <pause dur="0.4"/> is there anything the incumbent could do <pause dur="0.8"/> well people who've studied these situations have argued yes there are certain things <pause dur="0.4"/> the incumbent can do <pause dur="0.8"/> and basically <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> the kind of thing that the incumbent can do <pause dur="0.7"/> is to say well look <pause dur="0.5"/> part of the problem in the story i've just told <pause dur="0.7"/> is that the entrant gets to make the first move <pause dur="0.3"/> and therefore frames <pause dur="0.7"/> the decision that i then have to make and he knows that <pause dur="0.4"/> that that he can frame my decision <pause dur="0.7"/> suppose that i as incumbent <pause dur="0.4"/> could do something could could <pause dur="0.2"/> i could make the first move 
before any entrant appears <pause dur="0.5"/> could i do something <pause dur="0.4"/> before the entrant appears <pause dur="1.0"/> in such a way that when an entrant looks at the situation <pause dur="0.7"/> they'll say oh dear i don't want to enter <pause dur="0.5"/> because under the conditions the incumbent has set up <pause dur="0.3"/> it will pay him to fight <pause dur="0.4"/> is there something the incumbent can do while he's incumbent before the  entrant appears <pause dur="0.5"/> that <trunc>w</trunc> can be <pause dur="0.2"/> set up to give credibility <pause dur="0.4"/> to threats that they <pause dur="0.3"/> lacked under the present situation <pause dur="0.9"/> well <pause dur="0.3"/> we can make one or two observations <pause dur="0.3"/> one thing is this <pause dur="0.9"/> that that if the incumbent is going to do this thing at the outset <pause dur="0.8"/> it should ideally be irreversible <pause dur="0.8"/> because if for example the incumbent does something <pause dur="1.2"/> but <pause dur="0.4"/> if the entrant enters <pause dur="0.5"/> it just pays the incumbent to undo it <pause dur="0.9"/> then of course it's as if it'd never been done <pause dur="0.4"/> so it's got to be something that the incumbent does at the outset <pause dur="0.5"/> the entrant comes in <pause dur="0.4"/> but <pause dur="0.7"/> the <pause dur="0.3"/> the <pause dur="0.4"/> the incumbent can't then simply say <pause dur="0.5"/> ah well forget that i'll go back to what i was doing before <pause dur="0.3"/> because the 
entrant would know that <pause dur="0.3"/> and would know then that the circumstances would revert <pause dur="0.4"/> to the original ones <pause dur="0.4"/> so the incumbent if he's going to deter the entrant has to do something <pause dur="0.4"/> and do something in a clearly irreversible fashion <pause dur="0.4"/> what's the most irreversible thing most people can do in an industry <pause dur="0.4"/> is invest <pause dur="0.5"/> invest in highly specific <pause dur="0.3"/><kinesic desc="puts on transparency" iterated="n"/> capacity <pause dur="0.8"/> capacity that has no use <pause dur="0.3"/> outside the industry <pause dur="0.5"/> so what you do <pause dur="0.3"/> is you build a plant <pause dur="1.8"/> and you build it in such a way <pause dur="0.3"/> that its scrap value <pause dur="0.4"/> or its value in producing any alternative product <pause dur="0.4"/> is <pause dur="0.3"/> virtually zero <pause dur="0.7"/> 
so that means that once you've built this plant <pause dur="0.3"/> you might as well operate it <pause dur="0.5"/> now under what conditions would that work <pause dur="0.5"/> that would work under conditions really <pause dur="0.3"/> in which <pause dur="0.2"/> firstly the equipment itself <pause dur="0.3"/> is very rigid not flexible <pause dur="0.6"/> specific not versatile <pause dur="0.6"/> but secondly why you would want it in the first place <pause dur="0.7"/> one reason why you might want it is that although it costs you a lot of money to buy it <pause dur="0.4"/> it brings down the marginal cost of production <pause dur="0.4"/> to a very low level <pause dur="0.8"/> because what this means is that by investing in this very specific equipment <pause dur="0.4"/> that will reduce variable costs <pause dur="0.3"/> by incurring large sunk costs <pause dur="0.4"/> it means that once you've put that <pause dur="0.4"/> spent that money <pause dur="0.4"/> you can't get it back <pause dur="0.3"/> you're simply left with very very low variable costs <pause dur="0.6"/> and this would mean that you could profitably fight a price war <pause dur="1.1"/> so <pause dur="0.3"/> an entrant therefore confronted <pause dur="0.4"/> with an incumbent that has made a very large <pause dur="0.4"/> irrecoverable investment <pause dur="0.3"/> in an asset <pause dur="0.2"/> that will reduce the marginal costs of 
production <pause dur="0.4"/> knows that if they enter <pause dur="0.3"/> they face an entrant who has an economic incentive <pause dur="0.4"/> very probably <pause dur="0.4"/> to actually fight a price war even if <pause dur="0.5"/> entry did occur <pause dur="0.4"/> and that's what this <pause dur="0.2"/> # example shows <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> i don't want to go through all the <pause dur="0.3"/> # precise # <pause dur="1.2"/> numerical details of it <pause dur="0.4"/> but suffice it to say that what we imagine <pause dur="0.3"/> going on here <pause dur="0.6"/> is that <pause dur="0.4"/> the <pause dur="0.3"/> incumbent <pause dur="0.4"/> sinks <pause dur="0.4"/> # nine units of cost <pause dur="1.4"/> into <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> a <pause dur="0.5"/> specific <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> <trunc>i</trunc> <trunc>i</trunc> <trunc>i</trunc> <trunc>i</trunc> into a specific piece of equipment <pause dur="1.0"/> and what this specific piece of equipment allows the entrant <pause dur="0.3"/> <trunc>th</trunc> allows the incumbent to do <pause dur="0.4"/> is to <pause dur="0.2"/> fight a price war <pause dur="0.5"/> without making <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> any # losses <pause dur="0.9"/> and <pause dur="0.3"/> if you then <pause dur="0.4"/> # study the pattern of pay-offs <pause dur="0.5"/> # what you find is <pause dur="0.5"/> that the modification of the pay-offs <pause dur="0.4"/> effected <pause dur="0.4"/> by the <pause dur="0.3"/> investment in the <pause dur="0.3"/> # specific piece of capital equipment <pause dur="0.4"/> means that the entrant's best response <pause dur="0.4"/> to <pause dur="0.5"/> entry the incumbent's best response to entry <pause dur="0.4"/> is to fight <pause dur="1.5"/> that then translates into the fact that the entrant <pause dur="0.2"/> who has the full information available <pause dur="0.4"/> knows that the incumbent now <pause dur="0.4"/> faces 
a situation where the best response to entry <pause dur="0.7"/> is to fight <pause dur="1.5"/> now <pause dur="0.5"/> also <pause dur="0.7"/> the <pause dur="0.4"/> incumbent <pause dur="0.3"/> knows that <pause dur="0.2"/> the entrant will know that he has invested in the equipment <pause dur="1.0"/> and so <pause dur="0.6"/> the <pause dur="0.4"/> incumbent knows that if he buys the equipment <pause dur="0.4"/> the entrant <pause dur="0.3"/> looking at the consequences of entry <pause dur="0.4"/> will see that the consequences of entry will be a fight <pause dur="1.1"/> and therefore <pause dur="0.7"/> the implication of this is <pause dur="0.4"/> that if <pause dur="0.3"/> the incumbent invests <pause dur="0.3"/> the entrant will be deterred from entry <pause dur="0.5"/> because if the entrant tries to enter <pause dur="0.3"/> he will incur losses <pause dur="0.4"/> because it will pay <pause dur="0.2"/> the incumbent to fight <pause dur="1.0"/> on the other hand <pause dur="0.5"/> if the incumbent doesn't invest <pause dur="1.1"/> then he knows that he's back with the game we just discussed <pause dur="0.7"/> back with the game where <pause dur="0.3"/> the entrant will not <pause dur="1.1"/> stay out but will enter <pause dur="0.5"/> and where it will then pay him to acquiesce <pause dur="0.7"/> so what he has to do <pause dur="0.4"/> as the incumbent <pause dur="0.6"/> # is to work out <pause dur="0.4"/> # what <pause dur="0.4"/> # the best strategy is <pause dur="0.4"/> if he doesn't invest <pause dur="0.3"/> then entry will occur <pause dur="0.4"/> and he will <pause dur="0.4"/> acquiesce <pause dur="0.9"/> on the other hand <pause dur="1.4"/> if he does invest <pause dur="0.8"/> then <pause dur="0.2"/> the entrant will stay out <pause dur="0.6"/> and he 
won't in fact <pause dur="0.3"/> have to fight <pause dur="1.0"/> now the incumbent's <pause dur="0.4"/> # pay-offs are the second in these pairs of <pause dur="0.3"/> numbers <pause dur="0.6"/> and if he doesn't invest <pause dur="1.2"/> and entry occurs and he acquiesces he gets a pay-off of three <pause dur="1.0"/> whereas over here if he invests <pause dur="0.6"/> then it will pay the entrant to stay out <pause dur="0.7"/> and he will get a pay-off <pause dur="0.3"/> of four <pause dur="0.8"/> yeah </u> <pause dur="0.8"/> <u who="sm0764" trans="pause"> why do we not count on the bottom right on the slide </u><u who="nm0763" trans="overlap"> yeah </u> <u who="sm0764" trans="latching"> why do we not count the investment on that one <pause dur="1.7"/></u><u who="nm0763" trans="latching"> because of <pause dur="0.2"/> the # <pause dur="0.6"/> saving <pause dur="0.2"/> in costs that's effected by <pause dur="0.2"/> utilizing <pause dur="0.6"/> the investment the investment is a specific investment <pause dur="0.6"/> that <pause dur="0.4"/> reduces marginal costs <pause dur="0.8"/> that reduction in marginal costs <pause dur="0.4"/> is of particular value <pause dur="0.4"/> when you are wishing to expand capacity dramatically <pause dur="0.6"/> in order <pause dur="1.3"/> expand output dramatically because you have effected a major reduction in price <pause dur="1.7"/> so so the so the outlay on sunk cost is recovered <pause dur="0.7"/> by savings in variable costs <pause dur="0.3"/> under the conditions <pause dur="0.3"/> where the <pause dur="0.4"/> entrant enters the market and you fight <pause dur="0.7"/> if you decide not to fight <pause dur="1.4"/> then <pause dur="0.2"/> you don't drop the price <pause dur="0.3"/> the output doesn't need to increase <pause dur="0.3"/> and therefore <pause dur="0.2"/> you don't get substantial 
savings so the savings only accrue <pause dur="1.0"/> in the event of a fight occurring <pause dur="1.2"/> you undertake the investment <pause dur="0.4"/> in order to give credibility <pause dur="0.5"/> to fighting <pause dur="1.1"/> but you don't in fact have to fight because your threat is credible <pause dur="0.7"/> so this is in fact an argument <pause dur="0.3"/> why firms will invest in unused capacity <pause dur="0.5"/> the final punchline of this model <pause dur="0.5"/> is <pause dur="0.2"/> with the firm investing capacity <pause dur="0.6"/> in order <pause dur="0.4"/> to reduce marginal cost <pause dur="0.4"/> which will give it a return <pause dur="0.5"/> in the case <pause dur="0.3"/> that it has to fight <pause dur="0.5"/> but the very fact that it has invested <pause dur="0.6"/> in <pause dur="0.7"/> reducing marginal costs <pause dur="0.3"/> means that its threat to fight an entrant is credible <pause dur="0.4"/> and that keeps the entrant out <pause dur="0.4"/> so what the incumbent has done is invest in capacity <pause dur="0.3"/> with the specific objective of not using it <pause dur="0.6"/> not having to use it to its full capacity <pause dur="0.4"/> in other words incumbent firms it is said <pause dur="0.5"/> it may invest <pause dur="0.3"/> in highly specific <pause dur="0.6"/> excess capacity <pause dur="0.5"/> specifically to keep the incumbents out <pause dur="0.5"/> and this <pause dur="0.2"/> as it were is quite useful because it explains a paradox that one <trunc>or</trunc> does observe <pause dur="0.4"/> in a number of 
industries <pause dur="0.6"/> where they appear <pause dur="0.4"/> to have made investments that are <pause dur="0.3"/> unnecessarily specific <pause dur="1.0"/> unnecessarily large <pause dur="0.4"/> and not properly utilized <pause dur="0.4"/> and yet the firms are relatively profitable <pause dur="0.8"/> and <pause dur="0.4"/> the question why do they do it <pause dur="0.3"/> one answer may be <pause dur="0.3"/> that in fact it's not a case of a firm <pause dur="0.3"/> being incredibly inefficient and still managing to make a profit <pause dur="0.6"/> it actually makes a profit <pause dur="0.5"/> because although the wasted capital <pause dur="0.3"/> underutilized capital is socially inefficient <pause dur="0.8"/> privately it's efficient <pause dur="0.4"/> because it supports credible threats against entrants <pause dur="0.3"/> and therefore sustains the incumbent's monopoly power <pause dur="0.6"/> and so <pause dur="0.2"/> another consequence of that is <pause dur="0.3"/> the social costs of monopoly <pause dur="0.6"/> not only include <pause dur="0.4"/> the costs of higher prices <pause dur="0.3"/> the distortion <pause dur="0.3"/> of <pause dur="0.3"/> # buyers and consumers' decisions <pause dur="0.3"/> the social costs of monopoly are not merely to be found <pause dur="0.4"/> 
in in price distortion <pause dur="0.4"/> and the distortion of consumer buying decisions <pause dur="0.4"/> they're also to be found <pause dur="0.3"/> in the fact that <pause dur="0.2"/> monopolized industries <pause dur="0.2"/> may well <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.8"/> employ <pause dur="0.4"/> excess <pause dur="0.2"/> and overspecialized capital <pause dur="0.4"/> for the specific purposes of deterring entry from the industry <pause dur="0.4"/> so those who are concerned <pause dur="0.4"/> # with # <pause dur="0.2"/> amplifying or <pause dur="0.2"/> finding the maximum possible social costs of monopoly <pause dur="0.3"/> often employ these kinds of arguments <pause dur="0.3"/> to suggest that the <pause dur="0.2"/> social costs of monopoly are found not only <pause dur="0.4"/> # on the consumer side of the situation <pause dur="0.4"/> but also on the capital investment <pause dur="0.3"/> # side of an industry as well <pause dur="1.2"/> okay <pause dur="0.2"/> it's quarter to five <pause dur="0.3"/> # i've had # six hours of lecturing today <pause dur="0.3"/> and i'm going home
