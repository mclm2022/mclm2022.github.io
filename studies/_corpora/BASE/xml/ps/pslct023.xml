<u who="nf0856"><kinesic desc="overhead projector is on showing transparency" iterated="n"/> well good afternoon everybody <pause dur="0.6"/> # today's lecture's topic <pause dur="0.2"/> is tension structures as you can see <pause dur="0.8"/> # this term encompasses all kinds of # <pause dur="0.2"/> three-dimensional structural forms and two-dimensional structural forms <pause dur="0.7"/> # ranging from suspension bridges <pause dur="0.4"/> cable nets cable trusses <pause dur="0.6"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> fabric fabric membranes <pause dur="0.4"/> now all these terms will become clearer as we go <pause dur="0.2"/> through the lecture <pause dur="0.3"/> we've got plenty of illustrative examples to show you <pause dur="1.1"/> the lecture falls into several parts <pause dur="1.1"/> initially <pause dur="0.3"/> <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> is going to <trunc>in</trunc> introduce # <pause dur="0.3"/> the basic principles behind the structural actions <pause dur="0.5"/> in tension structures <pause dur="0.9"/> i will then move on to discussing <pause dur="0.6"/> fabric membranes <pause dur="1.0"/> and then we conclude the lecture or first part of the lecture <pause dur="0.3"/> # with # <pause dur="0.2"/> pneumatic membrane structures <pause dur="1.3"/> # in the second part of the lecture we're going to show you a video <pause dur="0.5"/> on tension structures <pause dur="0.3"/> which will reinforce some of the concepts ideas presented in the first part of the lecture <pause dur="0.7"/> and then finally 
we're going to move on to a workshop where <pause dur="0.4"/> we we're going to be experimenting with # <pause dur="0.2"/> tensegrities <pause dur="0.9"/> and what else # <pause dur="0.5"/> reciprocal frames </u><u who="nm0857" trans="overlap"> reciprocal frame structures yeah </u><pause dur="0.5"/> <u who="nf0856" trans="pause"> # and so on so it's going to be an action packed <pause dur="0.2"/> afternoon <vocal desc="laugh" iterated="n"/> okay i hope <pause dur="0.7"/> you're going to enjoy it <pause dur="0.2"/> now over to <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> </u><gap reason="break in recording" extent="uncertain"/> <u who="nm0857" trans="pause"> right well as # <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> has said i'm going to introduce some of the basic principles <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> of tensile structures <pause dur="0.5"/> and one of the <pause dur="1.0"/> really basic principles is <pause dur="1.2"/> the fact that they are tensile structures <pause dur="0.5"/> and you can demonstrate their efficiency <pause dur="0.5"/><kinesic desc="holds up strip of paper with weight attached" iterated="n"/> by something as simple as a strip of <pause dur="0.3"/> paper <pause dur="0.6"/> which # <pause dur="0.9"/> will carry quite a reasonable load <pause dur="0.3"/> in tension <pause dur="0.5"/> but you try and 
invert this structure so that it's carrying this load in compression <pause dur="0.4"/> turn it the other way up <pause dur="0.3"/><kinesic desc="turns strip of paper with weight attached the other way up" iterated="n"/> and of course <pause dur="0.3"/> it won't even support its own weight <pause dur="0.4"/> so <pause dur="0.7"/> that's the first <pause dur="0.3"/> lesson to learn that tensile structures are highly efficient <pause dur="0.4"/> because they they don't buckle <pause dur="0.8"/> # i'm sure you all know about buckling behaviour of structures <pause dur="1.6"/> and the majority of materials are actually reasonably strong in tension therefore <pause dur="0.7"/> # you can use most materials <pause dur="0.3"/> as # for tension structures <pause dur="1.5"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> the <pause dur="2.2"/><kinesic desc="holds up metal chain" iterated="n"/> second thing we're going to look at is the <pause dur="0.8"/> # behaviour of <pause dur="0.9"/> horizontal <pause dur="1.0"/> tension structures <pause dur="0.5"/> and # the simplest form of that is just a structure hanging under its own weight <pause dur="0.5"/> and here i've got a <pause dur="0.5"/> a chain <pause dur="0.7"/> # which <pause dur="0.8"/> is hanging under its own weight <pause dur="0.4"/> and as you can see it forms a curve <pause dur="0.6"/> and this curve where it's # just acting under its own <pause dur="0.4"/> # self-weight <pause dur="0.3"/> is known as a catenary curve <pause dur="0.5"/> the load is not quite uniform along 
the structure as <pause dur="0.5"/> a a metre of span at the end <pause dur="1.0"/> is # <pause dur="0.2"/> contains a greater length of cable <pause dur="0.4"/> than # a metre <pause dur="0.2"/> in the middle <pause dur="4.7"/><event desc="attaches weight to metal chain" iterated="n"/><kinesic desc="holds up metal chain with weight attached" iterated="n"/> if we then put some load on the structure <pause dur="0.2"/> you see that # <pause dur="0.2"/> in fact <pause dur="0.3"/> it's now changed <pause dur="0.2"/> shape <pause dur="0.7"/> and # a point load in the centre <pause dur="0.2"/> forms <pause dur="0.2"/> approximately a V-shape <pause dur="0.6"/> structure <pause dur="3.0"/> if we then put # <pause dur="0.2"/> an additional load <pause dur="0.9"/><event desc="attaches weight to metal chain" iterated="n"/> on the structure <pause dur="1.4"/><kinesic desc="holds up metal chain with weight attached" iterated="n"/> we see that it's <pause dur="0.9"/> changed shape again <pause dur="0.8"/> and # <pause dur="2.6"/> forming <pause dur="1.8"/> a trapezoidal <pause dur="0.2"/> shape <pause dur="1.0"/> and # <pause dur="0.2"/> <kinesic desc="puts on transparency" iterated="n"/> in the handout you can see <pause dur="0.4"/> that # i've given you the different shapes that # <pause dur="0.2"/> a cable actually takes up <pause dur="0.7"/> # depending on the loading <pause dur="0.5"/> # the top <kinesic desc="indicates point on screen" iterated="n"/> there we have # the catenary under self-weight of the cable <pause dur="0.5"/> and as i said # the weight of the cable actually at the ends is <pause dur="0.2"/> greater per 
metre of span <pause dur="0.3"/> than it is in the middle <kinesic desc="indicates point on screen" iterated="n"/> here <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> if you take a a uniformly distributed load <pause dur="0.7"/> on <pause dur="0.3"/> the <pause dur="0.2"/> the cable or chain <pause dur="0.4"/> then it takes up a parabolic form <pause dur="0.8"/> # if you have a load that's zero in the centre and maximum at the ends then you get an <trunc>n</trunc> <pause dur="0.3"/> an elliptical <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> form of the cable or chain <pause dur="0.7"/> # point load gives you a triangle <pause dur="0.2"/> and that varies depending on the position <pause dur="0.4"/> of the load <pause dur="0.6"/> # trapezoidal where you have two loads <pause dur="0.4"/> and # <pause dur="0.3"/> the more loads you add <pause dur="0.2"/> you get # <pause dur="0.2"/> a polygonal <trunc>sh</trunc> <pause dur="0.4"/> shape <pause dur="0.6"/> so <pause dur="1.1"/> that's # the second leshon lesson to learn about # this type of structure <pause dur="0.5"/> they <pause dur="0.3"/> they are # <pause dur="1.0"/> they change shape <pause dur="0.3"/> as according to the load as the load changes <pause dur="0.4"/> the shape of the structure changes <pause dur="1.7"/> and these are known as funicular <pause dur="0.2"/> structures <pause dur="8.8"/> <event desc="takes off transparency" iterated="n"/> one thing that we we need to look at # <pause dur="1.3"/> for tension structures they <pause dur="0.2"/> can't just act <pause dur="0.4"/> on their own in tension they have to be restrained in some way <pause dur="1.1"/><kinesic desc="puts on transparency" iterated="n"/> and # we can look at various # <pause dur="0.3"/> <trunc>retr</trunc> restraining systems <pause dur="0.2"/> and again 
you've got these <pause dur="0.4"/> in the handout <pause dur="0.6"/> # the most obvious <pause dur="1.4"/> one the most commonly used one <pause dur="0.2"/> is to have <pause dur="0.4"/> <trunc>c</trunc> cables supported on <pause dur="0.6"/> some mast <pause dur="0.2"/> structures <pause dur="1.2"/> and then to tie this structure back <pause dur="0.6"/> # to a foundation in the ground <pause dur="0.4"/> with # another <pause dur="0.2"/> tension element so you have <pause dur="0.3"/> a continuous cable round <pause dur="0.6"/> # this acts <pause dur="0.2"/> is acting in compression the rest is in tension <pause dur="0.5"/> and then you need some form of <pause dur="0.2"/> of anchorage <pause dur="0.2"/> at the bottom <pause dur="3.0"/> an alternative way of # restraining <pause dur="0.2"/><kinesic desc="indicates point on screen" iterated="n"/> this type of structure is to # <pause dur="0.5"/> have some form of buttressing system <pause dur="0.7"/> # where you have inclined supports <pause dur="0.5"/> and # <kinesic desc="indicates point on screen" iterated="n"/> this diagram shows <pause dur="0.2"/> a massive <pause dur="0.3"/> buttressing system <pause dur="0.3"/> where the self-weight of the buttress <pause dur="0.4"/> is causing an overturning moment <pause dur="0.4"/> and that <pause dur="0.6"/> tensions up the cable <pause dur="0.3"/> maintains it in position <pause dur="0.3"/> so the cable's pulling <kinesic desc="indicates point on screen" iterated="n"/> here <pause dur="0.2"/> creating a moment in <kinesic desc="indicates point on screen" iterated="n"/> this direction <pause dur="0.5"/> and the <pause dur="0.8"/> supporting structure <pause dur="1.2"/> the <pause dur="0.4"/> eccentric self-weight <pause dur="0.2"/> creates a moment in the other direction <pause dur="3.9"/> and the third type of system is to actually have a <pause dur="0.2"/> some <pause dur="0.2"/> closed ring <pause dur="0.2"/> round your tension structure <pause dur="0.4"/> so in 
<kinesic desc="indicates point on screen" iterated="n"/> this case here we've got # <pause dur="0.6"/> a series of cables simply <trunc>sp</trunc> <pause dur="0.3"/> spanning <pause dur="0.3"/> # a space here <kinesic desc="indicates point on screen" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.5"/> and # these connect to a a rigid beam round the outside <pause dur="0.7"/> # # which would be in bending <pause dur="0.3"/> and then <pause dur="0.6"/> the force from <kinesic desc="indicates point on screen" iterated="n"/> this side is carried in compression across to <pause dur="0.2"/> the other side so you actually form a <pause dur="0.3"/> a closed circuit <pause dur="2.5"/> so that's # <pause dur="0.9"/> <event desc="takes off transparency" iterated="n"/> three ways of retaining the structure <pause dur="3.7"/> # these are all lightweight structures <pause dur="0.3"/> and therefore <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.8"/> a major problem is to <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.8"/> restrain <pause dur="0.3"/> the structure <pause dur="0.2"/> when you have wind loading <pause dur="0.4"/> # as you know <pause dur="1.0"/> or i hope you know <pause dur="0.5"/> by now <pause dur="0.2"/> # on <pause dur="0.3"/> structures that are fairly flat <pause dur="0.4"/> # you tend to get # <pause dur="0.5"/> suction <pause dur="0.3"/> wind forces <pause dur="0.4"/> and therefore <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> although the dead loads <pause dur="0.2"/> of the structure are acting downwards under gravity <pause dur="0.4"/> the wind loads are trying to lift the structure up <pause dur="0.2"/> and a cable <pause dur="0.7"/> is very resistant <pause dur="0.2"/> when the <pause dur="0.4"/> loads are down <pause dur="0.2"/> but it doesn't have <pause dur="0.4"/> much resistance when you're trying to <pause dur="0.7"/> resist suction forces the structure <kinesic desc="puts on transparency" iterated="n"/> will deform a lot <pause dur="0.8"/> so # <pause dur="0.2"/> there 
are various ways of # <pause dur="2.6"/> restraining <pause dur="0.6"/> # the wind uplift forces <pause dur="0.5"/> the <pause dur="0.9"/> obvious one <pause dur="0.7"/> is to increase the self-weight of the structure <pause dur="1.1"/> over the span so you <trunc>in</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> increase the dead weight <pause dur="0.4"/> # which to me is completely opposed to the idea of having a tension lightweight structure <pause dur="0.4"/> if you then put a lot of load on it to <pause dur="0.2"/> to stop it from <pause dur="0.5"/> moving about in the wind <pause dur="0.6"/> so although that works and is used sometimes it's <pause dur="0.2"/> to me not the ideal solution <pause dur="2.7"/> another way of restraining which is slightly better is to actually put some <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="1.1"/> inverted arch or shell structure <pause dur="0.5"/> # around the cable <pause dur="0.4"/> and that again is <pause dur="1.4"/> a relatively heavyweight structure <pause dur="0.4"/> and # to me is not a <pause dur="0.2"/> particularly good solution although it's lighter than the first one where you're just using dead load <pause dur="0.3"/> you are are actually using a <pause dur="0.5"/> a <kinesic desc="indicates point on screen" iterated="n"/> structure here to to resist the uplift forces <pause dur="2.5"/> # the third way is # to actually have <pause dur="1.0"/> an opposing cable so <pause dur="0.3"/> you have a hanging cable <pause dur="0.5"/> and then you have <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="1.3"/> another cable which is curved in the opposite 
direction <pause dur="0.4"/> and between those in <kinesic desc="indicates point on screen" iterated="n"/> this case you have some struts <pause dur="0.5"/> # there are various ways you can do this you could actually have <pause dur="0.3"/> a cable which runs <pause dur="1.2"/> on another profile <kinesic desc="indicates point on screen" iterated="n"/> down here <pause dur="0.2"/> and have struts in the middle and ties at the ends <pause dur="0.3"/> so there are various combinations or permutations of this but this is <pause dur="0.2"/> forming what's known as a cable truss <pause dur="0.2"/> system <pause dur="0.4"/> and there you are actually having a lightweight <pause dur="0.2"/> # structure <pause dur="1.5"/> this is in one plane <pause dur="0.4"/> but # <pause dur="0.6"/> also you have problems you need to restrain the structure in the other direction <pause dur="0.3"/> so a fourth <pause dur="0.2"/> solution <pause dur="0.2"/> which # <pause dur="0.5"/> is probably <pause dur="1.0"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> the best <pause dur="0.3"/> is to actually have some transverse cables <pause dur="0.4"/> so you've got <pause dur="0.4"/> one set of cables hanging in one direction <pause dur="0.4"/> then in the other direction <pause dur="0.5"/><kinesic desc="indicates point on screen" iterated="n"/> these cables that ran <pause dur="0.6"/> in the planar truss across the top here <pause dur="0.4"/> are running across your structure <pause dur="0.4"/> so you have a system <pause dur="0.8"/> in one direction hanging <pause dur="0.2"/> and in the opposite direction <pause dur="0.4"/> these cables are <pause dur="0.7"/> inverted <pause dur="0.2"/> and they are <pause dur="0.6"/> actually prestressed <pause dur="0.2"/> against each other <pause dur="1.7"/> so that's the the various sort 
of stabilizing systems <event desc="takes off transparency" iterated="n"/> to resist <pause dur="0.6"/> wind <pause dur="0.2"/> uplift <pause dur="2.6"/> right so # <pause dur="0.7"/> that's the sort of theory and # <pause dur="0.7"/> now i'll go on and show you some <pause dur="0.5"/> slides # which demonstrate these types of structures </u><gap reason="break in recording" extent="uncertain"/> <u who="nm0857" trans="pause"><kinesic desc="projector is on showing slide" iterated="n"/> # starting <pause dur="0.2"/> with a <pause dur="1.7"/> an early <pause dur="0.6"/> form of tension structure <pause dur="0.6"/> # a sailing <pause dur="0.2"/> sailing boat of course demonstrates <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> two or three different types of tension structure the stays <pause dur="0.5"/> # the mast <pause dur="0.4"/> and # the membranes the sails <pause dur="1.0"/> very simple membrane structures <pause dur="0.4"/> and these would use # <pause dur="1.2"/> cellulose fibre <pause dur="0.7"/> <trunc>e</trunc> elements <pause dur="0.4"/> # as the tension elements <pause dur="6.1"/> <kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> of course # suspension bridges were also made using # <pause dur="1.0"/> ropes <pause dur="0.7"/> and # rattan <pause dur="0.2"/> binds and so on <pause dur="0.5"/> # to make simple tension <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> suspension <pause dur="0.3"/> bridges <pause dur="1.1"/> but the <pause dur="1.0"/> the earliest long span bridges <pause dur="0.4"/> were made using wrought iron <pause dur="0.6"/> and # this is the Menai Suspension Bridge <pause dur="0.2"/> across to the Island of Anglesey <pause dur="0.4"/> in Wales <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> designed by Thomas Telford # finished in eighteen-twenty-six <pause dur="0.4"/> using 
wrought iron <pause dur="0.2"/> which was <pause dur="0.3"/> sort of the new strong tensile material <pause dur="0.8"/> and # <pause dur="0.3"/> it would actually work to the limit of the of the material <pause dur="0.7"/> eighty-eight # newtons per square millimetre <pause dur="0.3"/> as the tensile strength <pause dur="1.9"/> and this is hanging <pause dur="0.4"/> in <pause dur="1.7"/> a sort of <pause dur="1.2"/> somewhere between the parabolic and # catenary curve <pause dur="3.1"/> <kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> # with # more modern materials high strength steel once steel was developed in the eighteen-fifties <pause dur="0.4"/> then <pause dur="0.4"/> # various processes produced # high strength steel wires <pause dur="0.5"/> and Roebling <pause dur="0.2"/> the # <pause dur="0.3"/> North American engineer <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.9"/> made some <pause dur="1.2"/> very elegant <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="1.1"/> suspension bridges including one over Niagara Falls this is Brooklyn Bridge in # <pause dur="0.5"/> New York <pause dur="0.2"/> and you can see the suspension cables and also some cable stays <pause dur="3.3"/> <kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> as <pause dur="0.4"/> # modern materials and design methods have improved <pause dur="0.4"/> we can see now this is <pause dur="0.2"/> the Severn Bridge which is one of the <pause dur="0.4"/> longest spans in the world although the Japanese have now got # <pause dur="1.4"/> a bridge which is almost two kilometres 
long <pause dur="1.1"/> # you can see the <pause dur="0.2"/> the size of the tension elements have gone down <pause dur="0.7"/> # over the years <pause dur="1.2"/> as material strengths have improved <pause dur="3.3"/> <kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> as an example of the of the buttress <pause dur="0.2"/> system this is # <pause dur="0.2"/> Dulles Airport <pause dur="0.3"/> in Washington <pause dur="0.7"/> where <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> you can see these inclined <pause dur="0.5"/> columns <pause dur="0.4"/> are actually sort of tilted away from <pause dur="0.4"/> the roof <pause dur="0.9"/> span <pause dur="0.5"/> which is cables running between these columns <pause dur="0.3"/> and then <pause dur="0.5"/> to stabilize it it does actually use the inverted <pause dur="0.2"/> shell <pause dur="0.6"/> type structure <pause dur="0.4"/> so you have <pause dur="0.2"/> a system of cables enclosed by <pause dur="0.6"/> # reinforced concrete <pause dur="5.8"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> # one of the <pause dur="0.3"/> earliest # <pause dur="2.1"/> enclosed ring type systems was the <pause dur="1.1"/> Raleigh <pause dur="0.2"/> arena <pause dur="1.4"/> where you have <pause dur="0.2"/> a system of <pause dur="1.1"/> cables running in <kinesic desc="indicates point on slide" iterated="n"/> this direction <pause dur="0.2"/> and another system of cables running in a in the other <trunc>dir</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> opposing direction <pause dur="0.5"/> and that is actually enclosed <pause dur="0.2"/> within this ring <pause dur="1.0"/> of two inclined arches <pause dur="1.0"/> which are <pause dur="0.2"/> self-stressing because the weight of the arch is trying to pull the structure <pause dur="1.7"/><kinesic desc="indicates point on slide" iterated="n"/> this is tending to fall down in <kinesic desc="indicates point on slide" iterated="n"/> this direction tensioning the

<kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> and the cutting pattern model <pause dur="6.5"/> there are various possibilities in which you can <pause dur="0.3"/> cut fabric <pause dur="0.5"/> to get # the required form <pause dur="0.6"/> but this really # is an area of <kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> intensive research <pause dur="2.0"/> now <pause dur="1.0"/> i've already touched upon the subject of # modelling # <pause dur="0.2"/> indicating that one can # use fabric models and soap film models to derive <trunc>sh</trunc> the shape of tension membranes <pause dur="0.3"/> but of course <pause dur="0.4"/> nowadays what we tend to do is to model these shapes using computer <pause dur="1.1"/> # <pause dur="0.8"/> so <pause dur="1.1"/> here is a computational model of a a fabric membrane <pause dur="1.4"/> <kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> the same structure modelled using a soap film and using fabric <pause dur="1.6"/> okay <pause dur="3.5"/> the problem with # <pause dur="0.7"/> <kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> computational modelling is that <pause dur="0.4"/> tension membranes are geometrical non-linear structures they <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.8"/> deflect a lot under given loading <pause dur="0.8"/> so <pause dur="0.6"/> compared to the traditional sort of rigid <trunc>s</trunc> # structural forms <pause dur="0.3"/> in which the displacement of 
the structure corresponds to the amount of loading <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> this relationship is actually <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> not valid for tension structures we cannot describe # the behaviour <pause dur="0.4"/> # by <kinesic desc="indicates point on slide" iterated="n"/> this equation stiffness matrix multiplied by displacement <pause dur="0.2"/> equals load <pause dur="0.4"/> and from from that relationship <trunc>ship</trunc> therefore we can <trunc>d</trunc> calculate displacements and we solve the structure for loads and for displacements <pause dur="0.7"/> if we did that with a tension membrane what we would what we would find we calculate the displacements we feed those displacements back to the original equation and we find we get a different right-hand side not equal to the load <pause dur="0.2"/> applied load P <pause dur="0.5"/> but <pause dur="0.2"/> something <pause dur="0.4"/> P <pause dur="0.2"/> with a tilde <pause dur="0.9"/> and then what we have to do then <pause dur="0.4"/> is to calculate the difference <trunc>be</trunc> between P and P-delta <pause dur="0.5"/> P <pause dur="0.2"/> P-tilde <pause dur="0.5"/> to get an increment in displacement and we have to keep accumulating this <trunc>i</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> increments <pause dur="0.6"/> and substituting <pause dur="0.5"/> to this equation until we actually satisfy this equation so it's <pause dur="0.8"/> the modelling is done <pause dur="0.3"/> in an iterative process and 
on your handout <pause dur="0.4"/> there is a full explanation of with what is actually going on as far as <pause dur="0.4"/> # mathematical modelling or computational modelling is <pause dur="0.4"/> concerned <pause dur="0.9"/> to show you # a stages of numerical modelling i've got a little example <pause dur="0.2"/> # to show you next <pause dur="0.2"/> <kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> if we were to model a membrane such as you see here <pause dur="1.2"/> # on plan <pause dur="1.8"/> # what we would do <kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> we would # <pause dur="1.7"/> if we've got a powerful computer program <pause dur="0.5"/> as a first guess we would say <pause dur="0.6"/> we want to stretch a membrane between <kinesic desc="indicates point on slide" iterated="n"/> these boundaries <pause dur="0.4"/> and it has to reach this <pause dur="0.2"/> this boundary circle <kinesic desc="indicates point on slide" iterated="n"/> here <pause dur="0.3"/> so initially we we say it's flat except for the last roof elements <pause dur="0.4"/> and if we iterate <pause dur="1.1"/> # <pause dur="0.9"/> and start refining the shape until we get <pause dur="0.6"/> an equilibrium <pause dur="0.5"/> <kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> then we get <pause dur="0.9"/> # <pause dur="2.0"/> <kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> the actual this is a plan view of the shape we <trunc>s</trunc> we get a <pause dur="0.4"/> elements which are distorting on on plan kind of spider <pause dur="0.2"/>

to follow a quotation from <pause dur="1.0"/> i forget who the author of this book is one of the # recently published book on <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.8"/> structural architecture <pause dur="2.2"/> or structural art <pause dur="1.0"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> the message that comes across is this <reading>for an efficient structure use tension <pause dur="0.2"/> rather than compression <pause dur="1.0"/> and either in preference to bending</reading> <pause dur="1.2"/> ironically what we teach you here <pause dur="0.7"/> is nothing but bending bending bending bending of beams bending of columns bending of slats <pause dur="0.7"/> okay <pause dur="0.3"/> so this course has been put on to <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> <kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="11"/> take you away from this <pause dur="0.2"/> a little bit <pause dur="5.7"/> now <vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/> <pause dur="0.3"/> we need to consider the difference the basic differences between tension membranes and conventional structures so if we were to summarize <pause dur="0.5"/> the main features of tension membranes <pause dur="0.4"/> the first point that has to be made is that <pause dur="0.4"/> the shape of a tension membrane has to be found <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> there is no mathematical function that will describe the surface this is the problem <pause dur="0.5"/> so you
