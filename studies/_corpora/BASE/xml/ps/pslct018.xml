<u who="nm0796"> okay shall we start </u><u who="sf0797" trans="latching"> yes </u><pause dur="0.7"/> <u who="nm0796" trans="pause"> yep <pause dur="3.4"/> okay well you'll see that today we're <pause dur="0.3"/> we have <pause dur="1.2"/> a silent visitor in the front row <pause dur="0.9"/> what's actually happening today <pause dur="0.4"/> is that the lecture is being <pause dur="0.5"/> recorded <pause dur="0.4"/> and i think i mentioned to you last week <pause dur="0.2"/> the purposes <pause dur="0.3"/> of this so you know what's happening <pause dur="0.6"/> # by and large i think we'll carry on as normal <pause dur="0.3"/> and ignore what's going on over here <pause dur="1.0"/> and # <pause dur="1.1"/> so <pause dur="0.7"/> that's where we are if you can <pause dur="0.9"/> carry on like that <pause dur="0.3"/> we'll work in a normal way <pause dur="0.6"/> # what i wanted to say to you this morning <pause dur="0.3"/> is that i think <trunc>w</trunc> <pause dur="0.5"/> today's session is going to be <pause dur="0.3"/> the last <pause dur="0.3"/> of the lecture sessions <pause dur="0.4"/> for the course <pause dur="0.6"/> or if it isn't there'll only be about ten or fifteen minutes next week <pause dur="0.4"/> and we will then <pause dur="0.6"/> come back and look at some example sheets <pause dur="0.2"/> now so far <pause dur="0.5"/> i believe you've had <pause dur="0.8"/> three example sheets am i right </u><pause dur="1.9"/> <u who="sm0798" trans="pause"> yep </u><u who="nm0796" trans="latching"> have you had example sheet four </u><u who="sm0799" trans="latching"> <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> yep </u><pause dur="0.5"/> <u who="nm0796" trans="pause"> right <pause dur="0.6"/> well then i've got <pause dur="1.2"/> today for you example sheets five <pause dur="0.3"/> and six which makes the complete set <pause dur="0.6"/> so i'll give those out <pause dur="0.5"/> at the end of <pause dur="1.0"/> the lecture <pause dur="1.3"/> 
so apart from that we're <pause dur="0.4"/> working on <pause dur="0.4"/> i think page five <pause dur="1.1"/> of your printed notes <pause dur="1.1"/> set three <pause dur="2.9"/> and just to bring you back to where we were last week we had looked at the <pause dur="0.5"/> example <pause dur="1.1"/> which was a quite a complicated <pause dur="0.2"/> one <pause dur="0.7"/> at the top of that page <pause dur="0.7"/> # to do with the motion of the rocker arm and that was the last thing <pause dur="0.6"/> we went through <pause dur="1.0"/> so that's that's where we <pause dur="0.4"/> are at <pause dur="0.3"/> and now we're going to proceed a little bit further <pause dur="0.9"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> through these notes <pause dur="0.3"/><vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.4"/> so the first <pause dur="0.3"/> thing we're going to do is take a look <pause dur="1.0"/> at <pause dur="0.5"/> a problem which involves rotational momentum <pause dur="1.5"/> and that's the next <pause dur="1.0"/> problem that's on the list <pause dur="1.6"/> which is example three-E <pause dur="1.6"/> and what we're doing here <pause dur="0.4"/> is looking at the rotational <pause dur="0.3"/> equivalence of a collision <pause dur="0.5"/> so where <pause dur="0.2"/> previously we've looked at collisions of particles one particle <pause dur="0.4"/> striking another <pause dur="0.7"/> one body striking another <pause dur="0.9"/> # here we're looking at <pause dur="0.2"/> collisions that occur in rotation <pause dur="0.6"/> which is not nearly such a common <pause dur="0.3"/> idea <pause dur="0.6"/> and it's a concept that perhaps is a little bit difficult to perceive <pause dur="0.7"/> what we are going to be 
doing <pause dur="0.5"/> here is looking at a problem <pause dur="0.4"/> where a clutch of an engine <pause dur="0.5"/> is put in <pause dur="0.2"/> so that <pause dur="0.6"/> what we're <trunc>ha</trunc> what is happening is there's an <pause dur="0.2"/> a an engine with its flywheel <pause dur="0.2"/> has a certain amount of rotational momentum <pause dur="0.6"/> and then this is suddenly connected <pause dur="0.5"/> to the drive shaft <pause dur="0.3"/> and the wheels <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> of a vehicle <pause dur="0.5"/> so in fact you have a rotational impact between the engine system on the one hand <pause dur="0.6"/> and the driven system on the other hand <pause dur="0.6"/> and what happens is that the total <pause dur="0.4"/> rotational momentum <pause dur="0.6"/> of the system is conserved <pause dur="0.4"/> although as we shall see <pause dur="0.4"/> the energy <pause dur="0.7"/> is some of the energy is lost <pause dur="0.2"/> in the process <pause dur="1.4"/> so it works <pause dur="0.5"/> in exactly the same way <pause dur="0.4"/> as linear <pause dur="0.3"/> momentum <pause dur="0.4"/> problems work <pause dur="1.3"/> so let's just take a quick look at what the <pause dur="0.2"/> problem says then <pause dur="1.0"/> # <reading>the engine of a car is revved up to five-thousand R-P-M</reading> <pause dur="0.6"/> which is slightly unconventional units <pause dur="0.4"/> but i'll say a bit more about that in a minute <pause dur="1.0"/> <reading>the clutch is then engaged over a short <pause dur="0.3"/> time interval <pause dur="0.4"/> to get <pause dur="0.2"/> the vehicle moving from rest</reading> <pause dur="1.8"/> we'll presume that the vehicle's in 
first gear <pause dur="2.2"/> the effective <pause dur="0.8"/> moment of inertia <pause dur="0.4"/> in a flywheel engine is given <pause dur="1.1"/> the driven system is rather less <pause dur="1.7"/> five times less <pause dur="1.1"/> in first gear <pause dur="0.6"/> # do note that when you've got a system like that when you're in second gear or third gear or fourth gear <pause dur="0.7"/> the effective <pause dur="0.8"/> moment of inertia of that system <pause dur="0.5"/> becomes greater <pause dur="0.6"/> as you go up through the gears <pause dur="2.4"/> that in fact is quite <pause dur="0.2"/> a a complicated thing <pause dur="0.3"/> to work out and you have to know something about gear boxes and gear ratios <pause dur="0.2"/> but we're not concerned with that here <pause dur="2.2"/> # determine the speed of the engine after clutch </u><u who="sm0800" trans="overlap"> do we do that <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> </u><u who="nm0796" trans="latching"> yes next year <pause dur="1.6"/> determine the speed of the engine after clutch engagement and the amount of energy lost <pause dur="0.3"/> okay so there's our <pause dur="0.4"/> problem <pause dur="5.1"/><kinesic desc="puts on transparency" iterated="n"/><vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/> let's take a look at how we solve this one then <pause dur="8.1"/> now i'm going to work in some <pause dur="0.4"/> slightly unorthodox units here <pause dur="0.5"/> just for convenience <pause dur="0.7"/> # if you don't like what i'm doing <pause dur="1.6"/> # <pause dur="0.9"/> by all means <pause dur="1.0"/> convert this problem for yourself <pause dur="0.2"/> into S-I <pause dur="0.2"/> units <pause dur="1.4"/> but i think when you see me go through this <pause dur="0.2"/> 
you'll realize that # <pause dur="0.2"/> the mixed units that i'm using <pause dur="0.3"/> are actually very convenient for the first <pause dur="0.2"/> part of this problem <pause dur="5.8"/> so <trunc>h</trunc> here we have then <pause dur="3.2"/> first of all <pause dur="0.3"/> a determination <pause dur="0.3"/> of the <pause dur="0.4"/> angular momentum the I-theta-<pause dur="0.2"/>dot <pause dur="0.7"/> of the engine before <pause dur="0.3"/> you engage the clutch <pause dur="3.2"/> the <pause dur="0.4"/> angular velocity the theta-dot is five-thousand remember that's in R-P-M <pause dur="1.0"/> # the moment of inertia is point-five <pause dur="0.3"/> which is in standard S-I units <pause dur="0.5"/> multiply the <pause dur="0.9"/> two together <pause dur="0.4"/> and you get a figure of two-thousand-five-hundred <pause dur="0.4"/> in some <pause dur="0.3"/> hybrid <pause dur="0.2"/> units <pause dur="0.7"/> and provided i <pause dur="0.2"/> stick with these hybrid units throughout <pause dur="0.6"/> everything will be all right <pause dur="1.6"/> as i say you can convert to S-I if you want to <pause dur="1.6"/> # after <pause dur="0.3"/> the so-called impact in other words <pause dur="0.7"/> once the clutch has been engaged <pause dur="0.3"/> then you've got the two systems rotating <pause dur="0.4"/> together <pause dur="0.9"/> at some speed <pause dur="0.6"/> which we're about to determine <pause dur="1.4"/> what has happened is that the <pause dur="0.2"/> moment of inertia of the total system has gone up <pause dur="0.7"/> to be the sum of the two <pause dur="0.3"/> so <pause dur="0.2"/> the total moment of inertia is point-five <pause dur="0.5"/> plus <pause dur="0.2"/> point-one <pause dur="0.9"/> for the driven system <pause dur="3.2"/> so 
we've got <pause dur="0.2"/> moment of inertia point-six <pause dur="2.3"/> this then is an expression for the angular momentum after <pause dur="0.4"/> engagement <pause dur="0.7"/> and if you <pause dur="0.3"/> equate <pause dur="0.9"/> this expression to two-thousand-five-hundred <pause dur="1.3"/> presuming that we have <pause dur="0.4"/> conservation of angular momentum <pause dur="0.4"/> then <pause dur="0.4"/> the theta-dot works out <pause dur="1.1"/> to be four-one-six-seven <pause dur="0.3"/> and because we're using these hybrid units we know that that must be <pause dur="0.4"/> also <pause dur="0.5"/> in R-P-M <pause dur="5.5"/> so that is a very straightforward <pause dur="0.4"/> calculation i hope you will agree <pause dur="1.3"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> very similar to <pause dur="0.6"/> linear momentum conservation <pause dur="3.8"/> now let's have a look <pause dur="0.9"/> at the energy <pause dur="0.6"/> the second part of the problem <pause dur="0.8"/><kinesic desc="adjusts transparency" iterated="y" dur="9"/> tell me if i move this up too far <pause dur="6.6"/> now at this point i've chickened out and i've gone into S-I units 'cause i want to work in <pause dur="0.3"/> straightforward joules <pause dur="0.6"/> # in other words S-I energy units <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> and here what i'm doing <pause dur="0.2"/> is working out the energy before <pause dur="0.5"/> kinetic energy before <pause dur="0.4"/> half-I-theta-dot-squared <pause dur="0.3"/> and the energy after <pause dur="1.1"/> so <pause dur="1.0"/> this is an expression then for <pause dur="0.2"/> half-<pause dur="1.1"/>I of the engine moment of inertia of the engine <pause dur="0.3"/> times the theta-dot-squared <pause dur="0.2"/> 
and you'll see <pause dur="0.6"/> that i've made a conversion <pause dur="0.4"/> from five-thousand R-P-M <pause dur="0.4"/> into radians per second <pause dur="1.4"/> and five-thousand divide by <pause dur="0.6"/> sixty <pause dur="0.4"/> tells me how many radians per <pause dur="0.5"/> sorry how many revs per second i've got <pause dur="0.8"/> and a rev is two-pi-radians <pause dur="0.3"/> so <pause dur="0.4"/> the conversion factor here is <pause dur="0.3"/> two-pi-over-sixty <pause dur="1.8"/> then square it <pause dur="1.9"/> if you put your calculators around that one <pause dur="0.4"/> you get this figure for the kinetic energy sixty-eight-<pause dur="0.8"/>odd-thousand <pause dur="0.2"/> joules <pause dur="2.1"/> # after the clutch has been engaged we've now got <pause dur="0.7"/> an increased <pause dur="0.5"/> moment of inertia to point-six <pause dur="0.6"/> but a decreased <pause dur="0.2"/> speed to four-one-six-seven <pause dur="0.7"/> according to the calculation we've just done <pause dur="1.5"/> and that will tell us <pause dur="0.8"/> the energy <pause dur="0.8"/> kinetic energy of the system <pause dur="0.9"/> after <pause dur="1.0"/> the clutch engagement <pause dur="1.8"/> so you see that we've got <pause dur="0.8"/> a loss of something like twenty per cent <pause dur="0.6"/> of the energy in that process <pause dur="4.2"/> which is probably a realistic <pause dur="0.6"/> sort of loss <pause dur="0.4"/> where does where does the energy go to </u><pause dur="0.7"/> <u who="sf0801" trans="pause"> heat </u><pause dur="0.7"/> <u who="sm0802" trans="pause"> <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/></u><u who="nm0796" trans="overlap"> heat yeah <pause dur="0.6"/> and where's the heat going to <pause dur="0.2"/> appear </u><pause dur="1.0"/> <u who="sm0803" trans="pause"> on the clutch plates </u><u who="nm0796" trans="latching"> on the clutch plates right <pause dur="0.5"/> okay <pause dur="5.0"/> so that 
then is a fairly straightforward sort of problem isn't it but <pause dur="0.2"/> the the key thing here <pause dur="0.3"/> is to see the parallel <pause dur="0.4"/> here between linear <pause dur="0.3"/> particle motion <pause dur="0.3"/> and rotational motion <pause dur="0.7"/> and we did a very similar thing for that trivial problem to do with <pause dur="0.3"/> railway trucks colliding with each other if you remember it <pause dur="2.3"/> all right moving <pause dur="0.5"/> on then <pause dur="1.2"/> just in passing <pause dur="0.3"/> there is a chart at the back of your notes showing # <pause dur="0.4"/> the comparison between <pause dur="0.6"/> translational motion <pause dur="0.3"/> and <pause dur="1.1"/> rotational motion <pause dur="0.4"/> i don't want to dwell on that <pause dur="0.6"/> or to describe it in any detail <pause dur="0.4"/> but i would like you <pause dur="1.0"/> # some time in your own time <pause dur="0.3"/> just to take a look at that <pause dur="1.3"/> and see what is said there there are one or two comments <pause dur="0.3"/> about the vector <pause dur="1.0"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> the vector properties of some of these quantities <pause dur="0.3"/> and as we said at the beginning of the course <pause dur="0.2"/> you can ignore these for the moment but there are one or two little oddities there <pause dur="0.3"/> they won't concern you <pause dur="1.0"/> just look at the <pause dur="0.5"/> fact <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> the key fact <pause dur="0.3"/> that <pause dur="0.4"/> there is a one to one <pause dur="0.4"/> correspondence between what happens in linear particle motion <pause dur="0.2"/> and what happens in rotational motion <pause dur="0.5"/>  
i know i've said that about ten times but <pause dur="0.6"/> people do sometimes forget it <pause dur="0.2"/> even though i say it ten times <pause dur="2.3"/> well now finally what we're going to come on and look at <pause dur="0.3"/> is # the general <pause dur="0.2"/> type of motion <pause dur="0.3"/> in which we have got <pause dur="0.3"/> a mixture <pause dur="0.6"/> of linear motion <pause dur="0.5"/> according to your second set of notes and rotational motion <pause dur="0.5"/> which is according to these notes <pause dur="0.4"/> and sometimes this can become <pause dur="0.4"/> a little bit complex <pause dur="1.0"/> # the key features of this <pause dur="1.4"/> and the key things that you need to remember <pause dur="0.3"/> are first of all <pause dur="0.5"/> that you need to work <pause dur="0.7"/> as at the centre of gravity of the system <pause dur="0.4"/> that is the safest possible thing to do <pause dur="1.5"/> just occasionally though secondly <pause dur="1.0"/> there is a fixed centre of rotation for a <pause dur="0.4"/> a set of <pause dur="0.9"/> bodies or a body <pause dur="0.5"/> and we'll see one of those in a minute <pause dur="0.5"/> in that case it's sometimes more convenient <pause dur="0.3"/> to work <pause dur="0.2"/> at the centre of rotation <pause dur="0.4"/> but you have to be a little bit careful <pause dur="0.3"/> how you handle that <pause dur="0.6"/> it's always safe to 
work at the centre of gravity <pause dur="4.6"/> all right so the first <pause dur="0.6"/> problem we're <trunc>d</trunc> we're going to look at this morning is example three-F at the bottom of that page <pause dur="0.7"/> # this one <pause dur="0.6"/> is a <pause dur="0.6"/> relatively straightforward <pause dur="0.7"/> problem of the <pause dur="0.2"/> what i call the direct kind <pause dur="0.3"/> the direct kind if you remember <pause dur="0.5"/> is where you know <pause dur="0.4"/> forces applied and you can work out accelerations <pause dur="1.4"/> or vice versa <pause dur="0.4"/> you know the motion and you have to work out the forces <pause dur="0.8"/> this particular one <pause dur="0.4"/> is in the first category <pause dur="0.6"/> what we've got here is a thing like a bobbin or a cotton reel <pause dur="0.2"/> resting on the surface <pause dur="0.5"/> a piece of <pause dur="0.2"/> cord <trunc>ar</trunc> <pause dur="0.3"/> is wound around it and we pull on the cord <pause dur="0.5"/> and the bobbin is going to roll <pause dur="0.5"/> along the surface <pause dur="1.8"/> that's the nature of the problem <pause dur="1.5"/> and what we have to do <pause dur="0.9"/> is work out what that motion is going to be <pause dur="0.4"/> under the <pause dur="0.3"/> conditions that are applied <pause dur="3.0"/> now <trunc>thi</trunc> this problem <pause dur="0.4"/> does get a little bit <pause dur="0.3"/> complicated for two reasons can you anybody think what those two reasons might be <pause dur="7.5"/> no </u><pause dur="0.7"/> <u who="sm0804" trans="pause"> the mass has been reduced <pause dur="0.7"/> has it </u><pause dur="1.4"/> <u who="nm0796" trans="pause"> we're not going we're 
not going to take that into account it could <pause dur="0.4"/> be a problem yes if the cord were heavy <pause dur="0.6"/> we would have to take that into account but we'll assume it's a light cord </u><pause dur="3.1"/> <u who="sm0805" trans="pause"> as it unwinds <unclear>so the</unclear> radius reduces </u><pause dur="1.2"/> <u who="nm0796" trans="pause"> no <pause dur="1.1"/> we'll assume the cord's all on one radius <pause dur="2.5"/> okay <pause dur="0.2"/> well <trunc>i</trunc> <pause dur="0.4"/> just i'll tell you what they are <pause dur="0.2"/> two things <pause dur="0.3"/> first of all <pause dur="1.1"/> you don't know whether this thing <pause dur="0.5"/> is going to slip on the surface or roll <pause dur="1.2"/> so somehow or other we've got to <pause dur="0.4"/> cope with that <pause dur="0.4"/> and the way in which we cope with it <pause dur="0.4"/> is we assume one thing <pause dur="0.7"/> work out what the answers are going to be <pause dur="0.6"/> and if they turn out to be daft <pause dur="0.2"/> we've made the wrong assumption <pause dur="0.4"/> and then we go back <pause dur="0.6"/> and try the other assumption <pause dur="1.1"/> # usually if you get it wrong <pause dur="0.2"/> something quite inconsistent will appear <pause dur="0.5"/> and you know that you've <pause dur="0.2"/> got it wrong <pause dur="1.3"/> so that's the first problem <pause dur="0.3"/> slipping or rolling <pause dur="2.0"/> # the second problem is <pause dur="0.2"/> which way is it going to roll if it's rolling let's assume it's going to roll <pause dur="1.2"/> is it is this bobbin going to roll <pause dur="0.3"/> to the right <pause dur="0.2"/> or is it going to roll to the left </u><pause dur="2.1"/> <u who="sm0806" trans="pause"> to the left </u><pause dur="1.1"/> <u who="nm0796" trans="pause"> well 
that's <pause dur="0.2"/> you see the interesting thing 'cause <pause dur="0.2"/> seeing that you think <pause dur="1.1"/> it's going to unwind so the bobbin's going to have to go to the left <pause dur="0.6"/> in fact that's impossible <pause dur="0.6"/> it always goes to the right <pause dur="0.3"/> if you pull on anything in one direction <pause dur="0.7"/> it will go <pause dur="0.6"/> in that direction unless there's some other reaction <pause dur="0.3"/> that stops it doing so <pause dur="1.1"/> this thing will roll to the right <pause dur="3.7"/> and you'll notice that i put that <pause dur="1.9"/> at the bottom there <pause dur="2.7"/> well you may not believe that <pause dur="1.8"/> but just <shift feature="voice" new="laugh"/> think about it <shift feature="voice" new="normal"/><pause dur="1.5"/><kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="10"/> okay <pause dur="0.5"/> so <pause dur="1.6"/> let's then see <pause dur="0.3"/> how <pause dur="0.6"/> we are going to <pause dur="1.0"/> tackle the problem <pause dur="3.6"/> as with any of these sort of problems we'll work through this in a <pause dur="0.7"/> fairly well <pause dur="0.4"/> defined order <pause dur="5.5"/> perhaps before i <pause dur="0.2"/> do that i should just recite <pause dur="0.5"/> the main features of the problem to you which are <pause dur="0.5"/> written into it <pause dur="0.6"/> # first of all <pause dur="1.4"/> it's two-hundred millimetre radius <pause dur="1.3"/> <trunc>o</trunc> or point-two of a metre <pause dur="0.9"/> mass twenty-five kilograms <pause dur="1.1"/> it tells you the radius of gyration <pause dur="0.2"/> at one-seventy-five millimetres <pause dur="0.3"/> <trunc>poi</trunc> point-one-seven-five metres <pause dur="1.6"/> tells you the <pause dur="1.0"/> radius of the groove <pause dur="0.3"/> which 
appears also on the <pause dur="0.5"/> picture underneath <pause dur="1.0"/> the force applied is twenty newtons <pause dur="1.5"/> and <pause dur="1.0"/> what you're being asked is to calculate the angular <pause dur="0.4"/> acceleration <pause dur="1.6"/> and it tells you <pause dur="0.2"/> the coefficient of friction if you need <pause dur="0.3"/> to know it <pause dur="0.3"/> between <pause dur="0.6"/> this bobbin <pause dur="0.3"/> and the surface <pause dur="5.3"/> right so <pause dur="0.3"/> at the top here of the solution <pause dur="0.2"/> first two things i write down is first of all the mass <pause dur="0.7"/> of <pause dur="0.6"/> the bobbin <pause dur="0.7"/> and secondly <pause dur="0.3"/> i need to calculate <pause dur="0.2"/> the moment of inertia because we're actually told <pause dur="0.4"/> the radius of gyration <pause dur="0.9"/> and remember that the <pause dur="0.2"/> moment of inertia about the centre is going to be <pause dur="0.3"/> mass <pause dur="0.2"/> times radius of gyration squared M-K-squared <pause dur="0.9"/> so <pause dur="0.6"/> that <pause dur="0.4"/> moment of inertia <pause dur="0.4"/> is going to be twenty-five times point-one-seven-five-squared <pause dur="0.4"/> and that <pause dur="0.3"/> result is given here <pause dur="3.8"/> now i'm going to make my big assumption <pause dur="1.2"/> i'm going to assume <pause dur="0.9"/> that <pause dur="1.1"/> this thing rolls <pause dur="1.7"/> and doesn't slip <pause dur="1.7"/> and i've <pause dur="0.2"/> put a note there that i must check <pause dur="0.5"/> at the end <pause dur="0.5"/> that that is a reasonable assumption to make <pause dur="2.3"/> or at least check for consistency <pause dur="1.4"/> we'll see how <pause dur="0.3"/> we do that when 
we get there <pause dur="4.0"/> and then the next <pause dur="0.6"/> and a final <pause dur="0.3"/> preliminary to looking at the dynamics <pause dur="0.3"/> is to actually look at the kinematics i haven't actually written that word on this overhead but <pause dur="0.4"/> usually i do <pause dur="0.4"/> you might like to just <pause dur="0.6"/> write <pause dur="0.2"/> kinematics here <pause dur="0.3"/> remember that kinematics is looking <pause dur="0.3"/> just at the motion <pause dur="0.5"/> nothing to do with forces or <pause dur="1.1"/> anything <pause dur="0.3"/> of that kind <pause dur="2.3"/> so i'm assuming it's rolling <pause dur="0.8"/> here is a picture of what <pause dur="0.3"/> is happening <pause dur="0.5"/> if it's rolling there is an instantaneous <pause dur="0.4"/> centre <pause dur="0.2"/> of rotation <pause dur="0.7"/> at the point of contact between <pause dur="0.4"/> the bobbin and the surface <pause dur="1.6"/> so in other words <pause dur="0.5"/> looking at that <pause dur="0.4"/> bobbin it's just rolling about this point of contact <pause dur="1.0"/> at that instant <pause dur="0.3"/> course as soon as it rolls a little distance <pause dur="0.8"/> the point of instantaneous centre is going to move round the rim but it's always at the point of contact <pause dur="1.8"/> so <pause dur="2.1"/> if we assume that in this rolling the <pause dur="0.2"/> linear motion of the centre of gravity is X <pause dur="0.8"/> to the right <pause dur="1.1"/> and the <pause dur="0.6"/> angular motion <pause dur="0.4"/> angular displacement is theta <pause dur="1.8"/> # angular motion is not <pause dur="0.4"/> confined to a single point on 
the body <pause dur="0.4"/> if you've got <pause dur="0.3"/> what's called the rigid body in other words it doesn't <pause dur="0.6"/> change its shape <pause dur="0.5"/> an angular motion <pause dur="0.6"/> is the same for any point on that body <pause dur="1.4"/> so in fact the angular displacement about the instantaneous centre is theta as well <pause dur="0.6"/> which means that <pause dur="0.2"/> the centre is going to move by <pause dur="0.3"/> the corresponding <pause dur="0.2"/> value of R-theta <pause dur="1.4"/> R is point-two of a metre <pause dur="1.6"/> so <pause dur="0.4"/> there is a relationship here <pause dur="0.3"/> between the X <pause dur="0.4"/> at the centre <pause dur="0.4"/> and the angular movement <pause dur="0.6"/> and X is going to be point-two-theta that's the R <pause dur="0.9"/> and that's the theta <pause dur="3.8"/> the other part of the kinematics that's important <pause dur="0.7"/> is if we differentiate this twice <pause dur="0.5"/> so X-<pause dur="0.2"/>double-dot <pause dur="0.8"/> is then going to be <pause dur="0.4"/> point-two-theta-double-dot <pause dur="2.5"/> so that's the kinematics <pause dur="4.8"/> now we move on to the dynamics and we need the free-body diagram <pause dur="0.6"/> for this <pause dur="0.8"/> bobbin <pause dur="0.5"/> remember what <pause dur="1.0"/> this is it must have all <pause dur="0.5"/> forces <pause dur="0.3"/> and moments shown <pause dur="0.5"/> including the inertia <pause dur="0.3"/> force and the inertia moment <pause dur="2.0"/> and according to me there are six <pause dur="0.5"/> such forces <pause dur="3.8"/> only one of which is <pause dur="0.4"/> explicitly applied the only applied 
force to this thing is the twenty newtons down here <pause dur="0.9"/> all of the others come about either <pause dur="0.4"/> by virtue of contact <pause dur="0.4"/> with other <pause dur="0.2"/> <trunc>poin</trunc> other <pause dur="0.2"/> bodies <pause dur="1.0"/> hence <pause dur="0.9"/> the <pause dur="0.3"/> reaction <pause dur="0.7"/> and <pause dur="0.3"/> the frictional <pause dur="0.2"/> traction force <pause dur="3.0"/> and i've put a little note here that this frictional traction force <pause dur="0.2"/> ought to be less than mu-R <pause dur="2.2"/> if it isn't less than mu-R <pause dur="0.5"/> then this thing is going to slip <pause dur="0.6"/> so our assumption is wrong <pause dur="1.0"/> so <pause dur="0.5"/> one of the checks that we have to do at the end <pause dur="1.3"/> is to check <pause dur="0.6"/> whether <pause dur="0.5"/> F actually is less than <pause dur="0.2"/> mu-R <pause dur="0.7"/> 
<vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.5"/><vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/><pause dur="6.4"/> then <pause dur="0.9"/> the other <pause dur="0.3"/> forces there are two inertia forces the <pause dur="0.9"/> M-X-double-dot which must be in the opposite sense to positive-X <pause dur="0.2"/> or positive-X-double-dot <pause dur="0.5"/> and the I-theta-double-dot <pause dur="0.7"/> in the opposite sense <pause dur="0.3"/> to positive-theta <pause dur="2.8"/> and <pause dur="0.3"/> last <pause dur="0.5"/> but not least <pause dur="0.9"/> the weight of the object the M-G <pause dur="0.6"/> downwards which acts at the centre of gravity <pause dur="3.4"/> well as always <pause dur="0.3"/> it's important to get that <pause dur="0.4"/> picture right <pause dur="0.3"/> once you've got that picture <pause dur="0.2"/> right and complete <pause dur="0.8"/> then everything else should be easy <pause dur="0.6"/> but it's always that first step <pause dur="0.2"/> where <pause dur="0.4"/> things go wrong <pause dur="1.1"/> you either forget one of the forces you ought to <pause dur="0.2"/> put in <pause dur="1.4"/> or you get one of them wrong <pause dur="0.4"/> there are there are too many of them <pause dur="1.5"/> so i hope that you agree <pause dur="1.0"/> that i have got <pause dur="0.3"/> the correct number of forces <pause dur="0.2"/> here <pause dur="0.4"/> remember the things you have to check inertia forces <pause dur="0.4"/> wherever the body contacts something else <pause dur="0.5"/> and any applied forces <pause dur="0.3"/> three <pause dur="0.4"/> types and they're all there <pause dur="6.6"/> so that is your picture <pause dur="1.9"/><kinesic desc="puts on transparency" iterated="n"/> and 
i'll try and keep this on the screen at the same time as showing you <pause dur="0.9"/> the equations <pause dur="3.2"/> so you can see where they've come from <pause dur="16.7"/> can you can you see that all right <pause dur="1.3"/> # so the first and simple one is the horizontal <pause dur="0.3"/> equilibrium from the picture that's just disappearing <pause dur="0.4"/> at the top <pause dur="1.3"/> so the <trunc>t</trunc> the twenty <pause dur="0.7"/> is balanced by <pause dur="2.4"/> the <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> M-X-double-dot and the F so i've written it this way round <pause dur="0.6"/> # F <pause dur="0.6"/> equals <pause dur="0.6"/> F to the left is twenty to the right <pause dur="0.4"/> minus <pause dur="0.2"/> M-X-double-dot to the right <pause dur="2.8"/> the <pause dur="2.5"/> M is twenty-five kilograms <pause dur="0.8"/> the X-double-dot <pause dur="0.5"/> we saw from kinematics is point-two-<pause dur="0.2"/>theta-double-dot <pause dur="0.3"/> so <pause dur="1.2"/> a fairly simple expression for F <pause dur="0.4"/> comes out of there <pause dur="3.0"/> and then the other equation that we need <pause dur="0.4"/> is the moment <pause dur="1.1"/> equation <pause dur="7.6"/> i'll take that off <pause dur="1.5"/> i think <pause dur="8.5"/> well you've got the picture in front of you haven't you <pause dur="0.8"/><event desc="takes off transparency" iterated="n"/><kinesic desc="adjusts transparency" iterated="y" dur="12"/> i think i'll take the picture away and then this can go higher up <pause dur="0.4"/> you can see what's going on <pause dur="8.1"/> right so i've i've taken moments about the centre <pause dur="1.9"/> of <pause dur="0.2"/> the bobbin <pause dur="0.3"/> now you'll notice that several of the forces actually pass through that 
centre <pause dur="0.3"/> so they don't have moments which is handy <pause dur="1.0"/> # the ones that do <pause dur="0.9"/> are the inertia moment I-theta-double-dot <pause dur="0.2"/> which is <pause dur="0.6"/> anti <pause dur="1.4"/> anticlockwise is it <pause dur="4.2"/> yep <pause dur="0.8"/> and the twenty <pause dur="0.4"/> times the <pause dur="0.6"/> radius <pause dur="0.3"/> of the groove <pause dur="1.3"/> which is anticlockwise <pause dur="0.3"/> balanced by <pause dur="1.5"/> the friction or tractional force of F times that radius point-two <pause dur="0.4"/> none of the other forces <pause dur="0.3"/> have a moment about them <pause dur="0.2"/> in the middle <pause dur="2.6"/> and then i substitute directly for F from what we've found up here <pause dur="2.8"/> and put some numbers in <pause dur="0.3"/> so there's the value of I <pause dur="0.3"/> that i calculated <pause dur="0.4"/> right at the beginning <pause dur="1.2"/> that comes to one-point-five <pause dur="1.5"/> F <pause dur="0.4"/> here goes into there <pause dur="1.7"/> and you end up there then <pause dur="0.3"/> with <pause dur="0.2"/> an equation which is <pause dur="0.4"/> solely in terms of the angular acceleration so we can work out what it is <pause dur="0.8"/> i haven't <trunc>sho</trunc> shown the detailed algebra <pause dur="0.3"/> but that tells you <pause dur="0.7"/> what the result comes out to be <pause dur="1.9"/> so that's the <pause dur="1.1"/> solution to the problem <pause dur="0.3"/> except that we must now check <pause dur="0.3"/> our assumption <pause dur="1.3"/> <trunc>w</trunc> and if you remember <pause dur="0.8"/> what we need to check <pause dur="1.4"/> is that the traction force is less than mu-R <pause dur="2.6"/> well the 
traction force from <pause dur="0.6"/> the equation for the horizontal equilibrium is twenty minus <pause dur="1.1"/> five-<pause dur="0.4"/>theta-double-dot <pause dur="2.0"/> and that comes to about thirteen <pause dur="0.3"/> newtons <pause dur="0.4"/> so a traction force <pause dur="0.4"/> if it's rolling is thirteen newtons <pause dur="2.2"/> the value of the reaction is the same as the rate which is twenty-five kilograms times nine-point-eight-one <pause dur="0.9"/> in newtons which is <trunc>ab</trunc> <pause dur="0.6"/> more or less two-hundred-and-forty-five <pause dur="1.6"/> so mu-R is point-one times that <pause dur="0.2"/> which is <pause dur="1.0"/> twenty-four-and-a-half newtons <pause dur="2.5"/> so <pause dur="0.3"/> it is indeed the case that the traction force <pause dur="0.5"/> is <pause dur="0.7"/> less than mu-R <pause dur="0.4"/> it's about a half of it <pause dur="1.0"/> so in fact the assumption <pause dur="0.5"/> that it's rolling <pause dur="0.8"/> is okay <pause dur="9.2"/> right so what we've seen there then is a <pause dur="0.4"/> mixture of linear <pause dur="0.3"/> and rotational motion <pause dur="0.9"/> <trunc>a</trunc> and it's <pause dur="0.2"/> had a slight complication because of this business of the rolling or slipping <pause dur="0.2"/> which may not appear in <pause dur="0.8"/> many problems <pause dur="0.3"/> but you often get a little <pause dur="0.3"/> complication of that sort to deal with <pause dur="6.7"/> right so now if we turn over then <pause dur="0.6"/> to the final page of the notes <pause dur="0.7"/> page six <pause dur="12.8"/> and <pause dur="0.7"/> here is a problem in 
the <pause dur="0.4"/> next <pause dur="0.2"/> category that i <pause dur="0.3"/> usually <pause dur="0.8"/> look at <pause dur="0.3"/> you remember we have three <trunc>k</trunc> types of problems <pause dur="0.5"/> direct problems of the sort we've just <trunc>solv</trunc> solved <pause dur="1.3"/> the <pause dur="0.2"/> impact momentum type problems which i'm about to do <pause dur="0.6"/> and thirdly <pause dur="0.4"/> the <pause dur="0.2"/> energy <pause dur="0.6"/> conservation of energy type problems <pause dur="0.4"/> which <pause dur="0.4"/> is the final one so there are two problems on this page <pause dur="0.2"/> one is to do <pause dur="0.3"/> with <pause dur="0.4"/> impact <pause dur="0.3"/> momentum <pause dur="0.8"/> on a mixed body in which we've got rotational and linear momentum going on together <pause dur="1.0"/> and the second problem <pause dur="0.5"/> is of energy <pause dur="0.4"/> conservation problem <pause dur="3.6"/> the <pause dur="0.3"/> the thing that i've chosen for <pause dur="0.2"/> this next problem is what is sometimes known as the cricket bat <pause dur="0.2"/> problem those of you who play <pause dur="0.3"/> cricket <pause dur="0.7"/> will be familiar <pause dur="0.6"/> with the fact that when you <pause dur="0.7"/> are batting and you strike the ball <pause dur="0.3"/> if the ball doesn't hit the right place <pause dur="0.4"/> on the bat <pause dur="0.3"/> it stings your hands <pause dur="0.6"/> and the reason for that <pause dur="0.3"/> is that you have an impulsive <pause dur="0.5"/> reaction at your hands the ball striking <pause dur="0.3"/> the bat <pause dur="0.4"/> <trunc>i</trunc> <pause dur="0.6"/> causes an impulse <pause dur="0.3"/> a linear impulse on the bat <pause dur="0.7"/> and <pause dur="0.5"/> because of the <pause dur="0.2"/> the way in 
which equilibrium of <trunc>imp</trunc> of <pause dur="0.4"/> impulses occurs <pause dur="0.3"/> there will be <pause dur="0.2"/> in general <pause dur="0.7"/> # an impulsive reactions where you're hanging on to it the hinge if you like <pause dur="0.3"/> of the bat <pause dur="1.0"/> except in <pause dur="0.3"/> certain very special circumstances if you happen <pause dur="0.5"/> to get the ball hitting the bat in the right place <pause dur="0.5"/> it doesn't sting <pause dur="0.7"/> and such a <pause dur="0.3"/> a place is called the centre of percussion <pause dur="0.5"/> and you can easily work out <pause dur="0.3"/> from the dynamics <pause dur="0.2"/> where that position <pause dur="0.8"/> happens to be <pause dur="0.4"/> in the case of a cricket bat <pause dur="0.4"/> it's probably about that much from the bottom of the bat <pause dur="0.5"/> which if you look at the way in which <pause dur="0.2"/> cricket bats are shaped <pause dur="0.3"/> is where the bat <pause dur="0.5"/> is actually thickest and chunkiest and that's really where you should hit it <pause dur="0.6"/> if the ball comes up and hits it <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> higher up the bat then you're <pause dur="0.6"/> going to suffer <pause dur="2.0"/> the ball goes even higher you'll need your <pause dur="0.4"/> guard on <pause dur="0.2"/> but there you are <pause dur="3.2"/> okay so let's have a look see what the problem says <pause dur="1.1"/> i've done this in very general terms that <pause dur="0.3"/> picture in the notes <pause dur="0.4"/> is not meant to be a cricket bat <pause dur="2.8"/> i 
think i can draw a bit better than that <pause dur="0.3"/><vocal desc="laugh" iterated="n"/><pause dur="1.0"/> but essentially it's the same <pause dur="0.4"/> problem what we've got here <pause dur="0.3"/> is a body that is <pause dur="0.2"/> hinged <pause dur="0.7"/> at the top at O <pause dur="1.6"/> centre of gravity <pause dur="0.4"/> is somewhere <pause dur="0.3"/> further down distance L beneath <pause dur="0.6"/> and we're actually going to strike <pause dur="0.5"/> the thing <pause dur="0.3"/> with an impulse <pause dur="0.4"/> at <pause dur="0.6"/> a point H below the hinge <pause dur="1.0"/> # and there are one or two bits missing on the diagram <pause dur="1.8"/> for which my apologies <pause dur="3.2"/> so i'd <pause dur="0.2"/> like you to just add <pause dur="8.1"/><kinesic desc="writes on transparency" iterated="y" dur="8"/> the first thing that's missing <pause dur="0.6"/> is that there's an arrow round there <pause dur="0.4"/> with nothing on it <pause dur="0.2"/> that should have theta-dot <pause dur="3.7"/><kinesic desc="writes on transparency" iterated="y" dur="3"/> put against it that is the angular motion that's going to occur <pause dur="0.5"/> after <pause dur="0.3"/> the impact now the impact is <trunc>sh</trunc> <pause dur="0.3"/> shown at the point <pause dur="0.2"/> A here by a line <pause dur="1.3"/> it's a very defective drawing i'm sorry about this <trunc>th</trunc> there should be an arrowhead there <pause dur="1.1"/><kinesic desc="writes on transparency" iterated="y" dur="1"/> on there and also that should be called P <pause dur="0.6"/><kinesic desc="writes on transparency" iterated="y" dur="1"/> P <pause dur="0.5"/> is going to be <pause dur="0.5"/> what i call the impact the impulse <pause dur="0.2"/> it's not a force it's an impulse <pause dur="3.1"/> and then over at the right of the diagram you see <pause dur="0.7"/> hanging in mid-air <pause dur="0.7"/><kinesic desc="writes on transparency" iterated="y" dur="3"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> V and theta-<pause dur="0.2"/>dot <pause dur="1.1"/> or actually i think it says

and now we do <pause dur="0.5"/> a rather similar thing <pause dur="0.4"/> to the previous problem we look at the linear <pause dur="0.2"/> motion <pause dur="0.3"/> and then the <pause dur="0.4"/> angular motion <pause dur="0.5"/> in the previous problem it was <pause dur="0.7"/> linear equilibrium of forces and <pause dur="1.4"/> moment equilibrium <pause dur="1.2"/> but you need to do the two because we've got mixed motion <pause dur="0.7"/> so the first <pause dur="2.6"/> first thing <pause dur="0.5"/> is looking at the linear impulse the total linear impulse on this object <pause dur="0.3"/> is <pause dur="0.5"/> primarily the P to the left <pause dur="0.4"/> but we must <pause dur="0.5"/> also <pause dur="0.4"/> see that there is the reaction R at the top <pause dur="0.4"/> which is to the right so <pause dur="0.3"/> the total linear impulse on the body is P minus R <pause dur="1.1"/> and that's going to result <pause dur="1.1"/> in the linear momentum <pause dur="0.6"/> of this thing at the <trunc>sin</trunc> centre of gravity <pause dur="1.0"/> so it's going to be equal to M-V <pause dur="2.6"/> i've used the kinematic straightaway <pause dur="0.3"/> to find out an expression for P <pause dur="1.9"/> so that's a fairly simple one <pause dur="1.6"/> slightly more complicated the <pause dur="0.4"/> angular <pause dur="0.3"/> impulse now we haven't actually used this before <pause dur="2.2"/> # the angular <pause dur="0.4"/> impulse <pause dur="0.7"/> let me just recap on that for you <pause dur="0.8"/> the moment <pause dur="0.2"/> of an impulse <pause dur="0.2"/> gives you <pause dur="0.4"/> a change <pause dur="0.4"/> in angular momentum <pause dur="2.2"/> 
so <pause dur="0.2"/> what i'm doing here is taking <pause dur="0.8"/> a moment <pause dur="1.8"/> of the impulses P and R about the centre of gravity i'm working at the centre of gravity <pause dur="0.6"/> so P <pause dur="1.8"/> gives you <pause dur="0.4"/> # a <trunc>cl</trunc> <pause dur="0.3"/> a clockwise moment of impulse of P times the distance H-minus-L <pause dur="0.8"/> and the R gives you <pause dur="0.5"/> a <pause dur="0.2"/> also a clockwise <pause dur="0.4"/> moment of impulse <pause dur="0.5"/> of R times L <pause dur="1.1"/> so you've got these two terms <pause dur="4.2"/> in the expression for the moment of impulse <pause dur="1.0"/> and that <pause dur="1.0"/> will result in a change in angular momentum <pause dur="1.0"/> I-theta-dot <pause dur="0.6"/> so what we're # assuming here is that the <pause dur="0.4"/> object starts stationary <pause dur="0.3"/> but is struck <pause dur="0.4"/> and then ends up with these velocities <pause dur="1.4"/><vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.2"/> so we've got a change of linear momentum and a change of angular momentum <pause dur="0.3"/> both determined <pause dur="0.4"/> by these <pause dur="0.4"/> # impulse equations <pause dur="4.7"/> so that's what happens in general <pause dur="7.0"/> and now the problem becomes easy because what i'm going to do <pause dur="0.3"/> is to see <pause dur="0.5"/> what the value of H has got to be <pause dur="0.2"/> for R-equals-zero <pause dur="1.4"/> so i simply put R-equals-zero in those two equations that we've got <pause dur="1.8"/> these two here <pause dur="0.2"/> that one <pause dur="0.2"/> put R-equals-zero <pause dur="0.4"/> this one put R-equals-zero <pause dur="2.0"/> and 
what will then happen is <pause dur="0.4"/> that <pause dur="1.4"/> a value of H <pause dur="0.7"/> the height will be defined <pause dur="4.2"/> well how have i <trunc>do</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> done this let's just have a <pause dur="0.2"/> quick <pause dur="0.2"/> look <pause dur="0.8"/> this <pause dur="0.3"/> first equation here comes from this one <pause dur="2.1"/> # P <pause dur="0.3"/> P is going to be M-L-theta-dot from there so <pause dur="0.4"/> putting that into there <pause dur="0.5"/> M-L-theta-dot times H-minus-L <pause dur="0.3"/> plus nought <pause dur="0.6"/> is I-theta-<pause dur="0.7"/>dot <pause dur="1.4"/> and you'll see that the theta-dots cancel out <pause dur="2.1"/> and <pause dur="1.9"/> if we substitute I-equals-M-K-squared then the Ms cancel out as well <pause dur="3.3"/> and so you get a purely <pause dur="0.5"/> geometric <pause dur="0.2"/> equation <pause dur="0.7"/> for H <pause dur="0.6"/> the value of H is in terms <pause dur="0.3"/> of the radius of gyration <pause dur="1.1"/> and <pause dur="0.6"/> the L <pause dur="1.2"/> distance from the hinge <pause dur="0.4"/> to the <pause dur="0.2"/> centre of gravity <pause dur="6.1"/> so this is a rather general <pause dur="0.4"/> abstract <pause dur="0.5"/> sort of analysis <pause dur="1.9"/> # probably more usually <pause dur="0.3"/> this would be couched in terms of a <pause dur="0.3"/> very specific problem <pause dur="0.4"/> # an object of a specific size <pause dur="0.4"/> and mass <pause dur="0.7"/> and so on <pause dur="1.0"/> but what you've got here <pause dur="0.3"/> is a general formula <pause dur="0.5"/> that will enable you to work out centre of percussion for any object you care to choose <pause dur="1.1"/> and what the problem <trunc>f</trunc> says in its final sentence is <pause dur="0.3"/> apply the theory <pause dur="0.3"/> to find 
the centre of percussion for a uniform bar <pause dur="0.6"/> hinged at one end <pause dur="0.6"/> so a uniform bar at <pause dur="0.4"/> hinged at one end we have to <pause dur="0.6"/> decide what we mean by K <pause dur="0.4"/> and L <pause dur="10.3"/> <kinesic desc="puts on transparency" iterated="n"/> so this takes us back to something that i asked you to remember <pause dur="0.7"/> couple of weeks ago <pause dur="9.1"/> i can get this lot to stay on board <pause dur="9.0"/> i'll move it up in a minute if you can't see the bottom <pause dur="3.5"/> right so if you've got a uniform bar <pause dur="0.2"/> length <pause dur="0.5"/> big L <pause dur="2.1"/> the the little L in our picture is the distance from the hinge to the centre of gravity in other words from the top of the bar <pause dur="0.2"/> to a point halfway down it <pause dur="0.6"/> so the little L <pause dur="0.8"/> that we had in the general formula <pause dur="0.3"/> is going to be the big L divided by two it's half the length <pause dur="0.3"/> distance from the end to the middle <pause dur="3.7"/> and then the formula that i asked you to remember <pause dur="1.1"/> was that <pause dur="0.2"/> the moment of inertia of a bar hinged about one end was M-L-squared-over-twelve <pause dur="0.7"/> so <pause dur="0.5"/> K-squared <pause dur="4.9"/> sorry about the centre i mean what am i talking about <pause dur="0.7"/> # moment of inertia about the centre for a bar is M-L-squared-over-twelve so the K-squared <pause dur="0.3"/> is big-L-squared-over-twelve <pause dur="1.6"/> and 
all that remains to <pause dur="0.2"/> work out the <pause dur="0.2"/> corresponding value of H <pause dur="0.3"/> is to substitute these two <pause dur="0.4"/> into that formula <pause dur="1.5"/> and what you <trunc>f</trunc> <pause dur="0.3"/> find <pause dur="0.4"/> is that the centre of percussion <pause dur="0.4"/> is about two-thirds <pause dur="0.2"/> of the length <pause dur="0.4"/> and the that <pause dur="0.3"/> corresponds fairly well with a cricket bet doesn't it <pause dur="0.8"/> although a cricket bat isn't actually a uniform bar <pause dur="8.6"/> all right <pause dur="1.8"/> now we're going to cheat <vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="y" dur="1"/><pause dur="0.9"/> example three-H <pause dur="0.6"/> is one which i'm not going to <trunc>re</trunc> <pause dur="0.4"/> do on the overhead at all <pause dur="1.4"/> what i'm going to do here <pause dur="0.2"/> is give you a handout for your notes <pause dur="3.1"/> and # <pause dur="2.0"/> then superficially i will work <pause dur="0.4"/> through this <pause dur="1.5"/> over the next two minutes <pause dur="14.3"/><event desc="passes out handouts" iterated="n"/> # this problem is one in the final category of making use <pause dur="0.4"/> of the principle of conservation of energy <pause dur="3.1"/> and it's also <pause dur="0.8"/> closely related to # a piston <pause dur="1.9"/> mechanism <pause dur="0.3"/> used in an internal combustion engine <pause dur="0.4"/> so looking first of all at the picture in the notes <pause dur="1.4"/> if i can find them <pause dur="4.2"/> sorry <pause dur="1.2"/> # what you see here <pause dur="0.6"/> is <pause dur="1.1"/> a link A-B which corresponds with a <pause dur="0.2"/> connecting rod <pause dur="0.5"/> in an engine <pause dur="0.9"/> the force P applied <pause dur="0.2"/> would <pause dur="0.5"/> correspond <pause dur="0.4"/> to the <pause dur="0.7"/> force 
applied by exploding gases on a piston <pause dur="0.9"/> # B-C is the crank <pause dur="0.3"/> on the crankshaft <pause dur="0.3"/> so what is happening is that B-C is going round and round <pause dur="0.6"/> # connecting <pause dur="0.2"/> rod <pause dur="0.4"/> is following it at B <pause dur="0.3"/> but point A <pause dur="0.2"/> moves in a straight line in other words it moves up and down the cylinder <pause dur="0.3"/> so you can see the mechanism can you <pause dur="1.5"/> right <pause dur="0.4"/> so <pause dur="0.2"/> the thing is actually starting <pause dur="0.5"/> with <pause dur="1.0"/> a rotational velocity of ten radians per second for B-C in other words the rotation <pause dur="0.3"/> rate of the crankshaft <pause dur="1.1"/> 
and <pause dur="0.3"/> a constant force is applied <pause dur="0.2"/> through <pause dur="0.3"/> half a cycle of the engine <pause dur="1.3"/> hundred newtons <pause dur="1.1"/> # that means that that force moves <pause dur="0.3"/> through a distance of how much <pause dur="2.5"/> <trunc>i</trunc> <pause dur="0.4"/> if B-C goes all the way <trunc>th</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> round through a hundred-and-eighty degrees <pause dur="0.4"/> how far <pause dur="0.3"/> has point <pause dur="0.2"/> A moved </u><pause dur="0.2"/> <u who="sm0807" trans="pause"> nought-point-four metres </u><pause dur="0.2"/> <u who="nm0796" trans="pause"> yes <pause dur="0.2"/> point-four metres <pause dur="1.4"/> so <pause dur="0.6"/> the work done by P is a hundred newtons times point-four which is forty newtons <pause dur="0.2"/> forty <pause dur="0.5"/> joules <pause dur="1.2"/> so the work you're putting in is forty joules <pause dur="0.2"/> and that work is going to result <pause dur="0.4"/> in an increase <pause dur="0.5"/> in the kinetic energy of the mechanism of the same amount <pause dur="0.2"/> forty joules <pause dur="2.4"/> and <pause dur="0.3"/> the interesting <pause dur="0.4"/> feature of this type of calculation <pause dur="0.4"/> is that you are not actually working out anything to do with accelerations and what have you <pause dur="0.3"/> during the course of the process <pause dur="0.3"/> if you did that it gets very complicated 'cause you've got to take all the angles into account <pause dur="0.8"/> and this is one of the great virtues of using <pause dur="0.5"/> the 
conservation of energy <pause dur="0.4"/> as a principle you simply look at the initial state <pause dur="0.2"/> and the final state <pause dur="1.0"/> you don't worry at all <pause dur="0.2"/> about what happens in between <pause dur="3.1"/> right so let's have a quick look then <pause dur="0.6"/> at the script <pause dur="0.3"/> which i've just given out <pause dur="1.8"/> principle at the top <pause dur="0.4"/> now there's a useful formula given here which you can work out for yourself <pause dur="0.3"/> if you have a bar hinged at one end <pause dur="1.6"/> fixed at one end with a linear velocity V at the other end <pause dur="0.3"/> the kinetic energy of that bar is M-V-squared-over-six <pause dur="1.8"/> that's a little magic formula <pause dur="0.9"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> it actually <shift feature="voice" new="laugh"/> is very useful <shift feature="voice" new="normal"/> in this problem <pause dur="0.3"/> because you can use it at every stage in what happens <pause dur="1.6"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> but you can easily prove it for yourself <pause dur="2.7"/> the third stage the initial kinetic energy <pause dur="0.8"/> point B is moving down <pause dur="0.4"/> at two metres per second <pause dur="0.4"/> that <pause dur="0.3"/> arises from the fact that B-C is going round at ten radians per second it's the <pause dur="0.2"/> R-theta-dot <pause dur="1.3"/> so <pause dur="1.1"/> that velocity V applies to both rods at that position <pause dur="0.6"/> the left hand rod A-B <pause dur="0.8"/> fits the category of <pause dur="0.9"/> paragraph two <pause dur="0.2"/> with a V of <pause dur="1.0"/> whatever it is two 
metres per second <pause dur="0.3"/> and it also applies to the other one the crank <pause dur="1.1"/> so we can very easily use the <trunc>M-V-s</trunc> squared-over-six <pause dur="0.2"/> for both to tell us what the total kinetic energy is <pause dur="0.6"/> and that's at the end of section <pause dur="0.2"/> three <pause dur="0.6"/> you'll see that the kinetic energy initially is quite small about two joules <pause dur="1.9"/> # this <pause dur="0.2"/> works because the centre of gravity does not have <pause dur="0.3"/> any <pause dur="0.3"/> horizontal <pause dur="0.2"/> component of velocity <pause dur="0.5"/> for this particular problem <pause dur="0.4"/> in either the initial or the final state <pause dur="0.5"/> if it did <pause dur="0.3"/> working out the kinetic energy gets a bit more complicated <pause dur="2.0"/> and then the final kinetic energy <pause dur="0.3"/> point B has gone all the way round through a hundred-and-eighty degrees <pause dur="0.2"/> and now it's moving upwards with a different velocity which is unknown V <pause dur="0.4"/> but we can use the same formula <pause dur="0.6"/> same formula is going to apply <pause dur="0.4"/> to work out <pause dur="0.2"/> kinetic energy <pause dur="0.6"/> except we simply put V <pause dur="0.5"/> instead of two <pause dur="0.7"/> in the expression above <pause dur="1.6"/> five is work done which we've just talked about <pause dur="1.5"/> six is making use of the principle at the top <pause dur="1.4"/> which tells us that V 
is nine-point-four-seven <pause dur="0.3"/> so it's gone up from two metres per second <pause dur="0.2"/> downwards at the beginning <pause dur="0.4"/> to nine-point-four-seven upwards at the end <pause dur="2.5"/> and <pause dur="0.6"/> then theta-dot comes directly out of that <pause dur="0.5"/> by the same <pause dur="0.2"/> means <pause dur="0.6"/> so actually when you get into it it's a very simple problem isn't it <pause dur="0.3"/> looks complicated to start with <pause dur="0.3"/> but once you've got a few tricks <pause dur="0.4"/> in your armoury <pause dur="0.8"/> it's very straightforward <pause dur="4.7"/> thank you that will <pause dur="0.2"/> do us for today<pause dur="0.4"/>  now <trunc>ne</trunc> next week what we're going to do <pause dur="0.3"/> is take a look at some of the example sheets <pause dur="1.1"/> # i've got <pause dur="3.8"/> two <pause dur="0.2"/> more of these here for you today <pause dur="0.3"/> can you <pause dur="0.5"/> take one each of those <pause dur="1.0"/> and next week i want you to come <pause dur="0.4"/> prepared and ready to ask some questions <pause dur="0.5"/> about things that you've had a try at <pause dur="0.4"/> so <pause dur="0.4"/> if you could put a little bit of effort <pause dur="0.5"/> into looking at perhaps the earlier <pause dur="0.2"/> example sheets <pause dur="0.8"/> # particularly example sheet four <pause dur="0.9"/> and we'll have a look at that next week <pause dur="0.8"/> and in the final week of term <pause dur="0.2"/> we'll look at these two <pause dur="5.3"/> all right any anything else
