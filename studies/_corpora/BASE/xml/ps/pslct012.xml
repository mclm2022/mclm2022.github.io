<pause dur="0.8"/> more specific examples of that # <pause dur="0.3"/> as i get into topic # five on pricing but for the moment if you simply <pause dur="0.4"/> note <pause dur="0.4"/> that the new industrial organization approach <pause dur="0.4"/> put particular emphasis on this notion of commitment <pause dur="0.3"/> and that that commitment then offered <pause dur="0.3"/> credible threats <pause dur="0.2"/> to potential entrants <pause dur="0.7"/> my final point about this approach under <pause dur="0.5"/> three was that they were or <trunc>hi</trunc> they continue to be highly critical of the Chicago school <pause dur="0.2"/> approach to the <trunc>a</trunc> analysis of market structure <pause dur="0.2"/> and performance <pause dur="0.7"/> in particular <pause dur="0.8"/> this group <pause dur="0.2"/> thinks that the <trunc>chicag</trunc> the implicit model used by the Chicago school <pause dur="1.3"/> is oversimplified <pause dur="0.9"/> implicitly in much of their <trunc>ma</trunc> of the Chicago school's market analysis is the theory of perfect competition <pause dur="0.8"/> and the new industrial organization school regards this as highly <pause dur="0.3"/> suspect for the purposes for which it's put <pause dur="0.5"/> # by the Chicago school <pause dur="1.5"/> an extension to that is that they <pause dur="0.7"/> argue that is the new industrial organization <pause dur="0.6"/> # group <pause dur="0.4"/> argue that the Chicago school <pause dur="1.3"/> ignores the <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> fact that in most real world markets information <pause dur="0.4"/> is highly imperfect <pause dur="1.3"/> and that that imperfect information <pause dur="0.5"/> either particularly on the part of potential entrants that they would have far less information available to them <pause dur="0.4"/> than is available to <pause dur="0.3"/> the incumbent firms <pause dur="1.5"/> that imperfect information <pause dur="0.2"/> may make strategies on the part of incumbent firms <pause dur="0.8"/> much more plausible <pause dur="0.4"/> than if you are operating or theorizing in a world of perfect information <pause dur="0.2"/> if everybody's got perfect information <pause dur="0.4"/> the Chicago school <pause dur="0.3"/> argument may make more sense <pause dur="0.8"/> in real world markets that information <pause dur="0.5"/> # is far from perfect <pause dur="0.6"/> and <pause dur="0.4"/> # that may therefore make <pause dur="0.2"/> it possible and logical for incumbent firms to pursue a number of strategies <pause dur="0.5"/> # to deter <pause dur="0.3"/> or coerce <pause dur="0.5"/> potential and actual <pause dur="0.3"/> entrants <pause dur="0.2"/> and again i will <pause dur="0.5"/> refer back to that point when i'm talking about various aspects of pricing policies <pause dur="0.3"/> which i'm about to come on to <pause dur="1.2"/> so they are highly critical of the Chicago school particularly for its <pause dur="0.5"/> 
oversimplified theoretical approach <pause dur="0.4"/> for their <pause dur="0.2"/> # assumption that there is usually <pause dur="0.5"/> something like perfect information <pause dur="0.2"/> and if you drop those <pause dur="0.2"/> assumptions then you can come up with quite <pause dur="0.3"/> different conclusions <pause dur="1.0"/> finally on on this # <pause dur="0.7"/> # topic of entry conditions i want to mention <pause dur="0.5"/> a theory that i'm sure a number of you are already familiar with from other courses <pause dur="0.6"/> the theory of perfectly contestable markets note the word contestable <pause dur="0.3"/> not <pause dur="0.4"/> competitive <pause dur="1.1"/> in fact one of the points that i will <pause dur="0.5"/> draw to your attention if you're not already aware of it is that <pause dur="0.4"/> this theory the new one <pause dur="1.3"/> <vocal desc="cough" iterated="n"/> comes to the same conclusions as far as the performance of the markets are concerned <pause dur="0.3"/> as the perfectly competitive model <pause dur="1.0"/> but it has some quite <pause dur="0.5"/> # different <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="1.1"/> prediction <trunc>w</trunc> <trunc>i</trunc> it the the the structure of of the markets involved are quite different <pause dur="0.3"/> from those involved <pause dur="0.4"/> in the perfectly competitive model <pause dur="2.9"/> perfectly <trunc>conte</trunc> a perfectly contestable market <pause dur="0.3"/> is one where there are zero entry barriers and zero exit costs <pause dur="0.7"/> it's that emphasis <pause dur="0.5"/> on zero entry barriers is which is why i particularly thought it appropriate to mention it <pause dur="0.3"/> in the present context <pause dur="1.9"/> the notion of zero exit barriers <pause dur="1.2"/> implies that the any entrant firm to that market incurs zero sunk costs <pause dur="2.0"/> so a firm <pause dur="0.7"/> <trunc>th</trunc> <trunc>th</trunc> <trunc>th</trunc> the theory isn't assuming that a firm doesn't actually have to incur production costs if it enters the market but what it is <vocal desc="cough" iterated="n"/> <pause dur="0.4"/> in its perfect form assuming <pause dur="0.6"/> is that an entrant can come in <pause dur="0.6"/> and produce 
without incurring <pause dur="0.3"/> any sunk costs there are zero <pause dur="0.2"/> entry barriers <pause dur="0.3"/> that <pause dur="0.6"/> theory in its perfect form has quite dramatic <pause dur="0.5"/> predictions <pause dur="1.4"/> in particular it predicts that the properties of a perfectly contestable market will be exactly the same as those of a perfectly <pause dur="0.2"/> competitive market <pause dur="2.6"/> however it predicts that those results will hold even if you've only have <pause dur="0.5"/> two or three firms operating in the market <pause dur="1.2"/> now that of course is quite dramatically different from what you predict from the theory of perfect competition <pause dur="1.8"/> the theory of perfectly contestable markets is saying that if you have free entry and free exit <pause dur="1.0"/> you will have in equilibrium <pause dur="0.5"/> prices equal to marginal costs you will have all firms producing at minimum unit costs <pause dur="0.7"/> they will <pause dur="0.3"/> the industry output will be produced at minimum cost and they will <pause dur="0.4"/> the market would clear <pause dur="1.1"/> all consumers will be satisfied at a price which is equal to marginal cost <pause dur="2.2"/> even if you only have two firms <pause dur="0.3"/> or three or four firms in the market <pause dur="0.8"/> now that <pause dur="0.4"/> seems at first glance perhaps counter-intuitive <pause dur="0.6"/> because one has <pause dur="0.2"/> normally <trunc>gr</trunc> <trunc>gr</trunc> grown up with the idea that if you have a highly concentrated market that is consisting of only two or three firms <pause dur="0.4"/> they will in fact <pause dur="0.2"/> be able to wield considerable market power <pause dur="1.2"/> what is driving the whole of that result <pause dur="0.9"/> in <trunc>perfe</trunc> the the perfectly <trunc>con</trunc> <pause dur="0.6"/> # testable <pause dur="0.3"/> market <pause dur="0.3"/> 
 # theory what it drives the entire result <pause dur="0.4"/> is the free entry and the free exit <pause dur="0.6"/> without going into too much detail <pause dur="0.9"/> essentially what # the theory <pause dur="0.2"/> predicts is that if the an incumbent firm in such a market tries to raise its price above marginal cost <pause dur="0.6"/> an entrant can <trunc>m</trunc> immediately appear <pause dur="0.5"/> undercut <pause dur="0.3"/> that price <pause dur="0.5"/> so long as it's in excess of marginal cost <pause dur="0.3"/> make a profit <pause dur="0.4"/> if the incumbent firm responds <pause dur="0.4"/> to that price cut <pause dur="1.8"/> if the incumbent for example drops its own price to marginal cost <pause dur="0.7"/> then the <pause dur="0.4"/> new firm having made a profit <pause dur="0.3"/> previously <pause dur="0.3"/> can then leave costlessly <pause dur="2.1"/> the knowledge on the part of the incumbent firm <pause dur="0.4"/> that that is the case that is if it tries to rise its price or if there are two or three or firms <pause dur="0.4"/> incumbent firms if they try <trunc>t</trunc> try to raise their price <pause dur="0.7"/> it would immediately provoke entry <pause dur="1.0"/> and the price will then sink to marginal cost <pause dur="0.3"/> will mean that the incumbent firms will be unable to raise their price <pause dur="1.0"/> above <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="1.6"/> marginal cost <pause dur="0.8"/> the significance therefore of the notion of perfectly free <pause dur="0.6"/> entry and exit <pause dur="0.6"/> you can see it's i hope it's significant that here was a theory which was saying <pause dur="1.3"/> even if you've got very highly concentrated 
 oligopolies <pause dur="1.1"/> if these conditions hold <pause dur="0.4"/> then you needn't worry there are there are very few policy <pause dur="0.4"/> policies you need adopt towards such industries because they will <pause dur="0.3"/> produce a performance which is <pause dur="0.3"/> in line with that of a perfectly competitive market <pause dur="0.8"/> the problem with the theory <pause dur="1.9"/> <vocal desc="cough" iterated="n"/> is well sorry before i get on to that let me simply emphasize <pause dur="0.5"/> that the theory first made its appearance in the late seventies by the early eighties <pause dur="0.5"/> it had <pause dur="0.4"/> it had already been fed in to policy decisions in the United States and by the mid-eighties <pause dur="0.5"/> it was having an influence on policy decisions in Britain as well <pause dur="0.6"/> in a white paper in the middle of nineteen-eighties for example <pause dur="0.4"/> on the <pause dur="0.5"/> # deregulation of the local bus markets <pause dur="0.2"/> the notion of a contestable market <pause dur="0.5"/> was <pause dur="0.4"/> # actually used and it was discussed at some length the argument being that these markets were <pause dur="0.3"/> contestable and therefore <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> they would be put in a competitive performance <pause dur="0.5"/> notice <pause dur="0.7"/> i there said contestable <pause dur="0.2"/> rather than perfectly contestable <pause dur="0.7"/> the problem <pause dur="0.5"/> as it arose in the debate in the <trunc>uni</trunc> over this in the United States <pause dur="0.6"/> was that a number of policy makers were saying well <pause dur="0.4"/> these markets are approximately contestable <pause dur="0.6"/> 
 therefore there is no need for us to worry <pause dur="0.3"/> particularly in civil aviation which the Americans were deregulating at that time <pause dur="0.9"/> a lot of mergers were proposed <pause dur="1.1"/> under the influence essentially of this theory of perfectly <trunc>con</trunc> perfect contestability <pause dur="0.5"/> the authorities then said well <pause dur="0.2"/> although this <pause dur="0.3"/> these mergers will concentrate the industry or <trunc>the</trunc> they will concentrate these particular <pause dur="1.2"/> parts of the <pause dur="0.4"/> of the market <pause dur="1.4"/> we will not intervene to try to prevent these mergers or look at them more closely because we are advised that these are contestable markets if you <pause dur="0.5"/> if an entrant <pause dur="0.3"/> <trunc>i</trunc> if they try to raise their price <pause dur="0.4"/> after the merger <pause dur="0.2"/> entrants would come in and drive the price down <pause dur="2.0"/> 
 # <pause dur="1.2"/> so <pause dur="0.5"/> it's a relatively recent theory it has an almost <trunc>im</trunc> <pause dur="0.5"/> # immediate impact on policy discussions both in the United States and in Britain and elsewhere <pause dur="0.5"/> the notion of contestability has passed very much into the economic literature <pause dur="0.9"/> the problem with it all however is that the theory is non-robust <pause dur="0.9"/> i'm using that term <pause dur="0.4"/> in its technical sense <pause dur="1.2"/> any scientific theory to be robust <pause dur="1.2"/> has to have the following characteristic <pause dur="1.2"/> that if you <pause dur="0.8"/> if the assumptions of the theory <pause dur="1.3"/> do not hold completely <pause dur="0.2"/> or perfectly <pause dur="0.2"/> but they hold approximately <pause dur="1.7"/> then for a theory to be robust <pause dur="0.2"/> under those circumstances the predictions <pause dur="0.5"/> must only change slightly <pause dur="1.0"/> you could say that the theory of perfect competition is a robust theory because <pause dur="0.3"/> if the assumptions <pause dur="0.3"/> are not met completely but approximately in such a theory <pause dur="0.4"/> the results don't change very much <pause dur="1.0"/> you still get <pause dur="0.6"/> prices approximately in line with marginal cost <pause dur="0.4"/> in the theory of perfect competition <pause dur="0.7"/> if the assumptions don't hold completely <pause dur="0.9"/> so a robust theory is one where if the <pause dur="0.2"/> assumptions don't hold perfectly but approximately the predictions don't change very much <pause dur="1.3"/> my <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> critique or # <trunc>th</trunc> the critique of others as well <pause dur="0.3"/> 
 about the theory of perfect contestability <pause dur="0.6"/> is that if you change the assumptions slightly <pause dur="1.5"/> the predictions change dramatically it's very unstable <pause dur="2.0"/> let me give you an example of how <pause dur="0.6"/> what i mean by that <pause dur="2.1"/> if <trunc>fo</trunc> let us say in a particular market which a number of people have said is contestable <pause dur="0.8"/> if <pause dur="0.7"/> there are inevitable delays <pause dur="1.1"/> between a firm announcing that it's coming into the market and it actually <pause dur="0.5"/> managing to <pause dur="0.2"/> produce <pause dur="2.4"/> and if in coming into the market <pause dur="0.6"/> the <trunc>f</trunc> the entrant has to incur <pause dur="0.4"/> some sunk costs they can only be they only need be slight <pause dur="0.2"/> sunk costs <pause dur="1.1"/> so if there's a delay a slight delay between saying i will come into the market the firm has to build up its capacity <pause dur="1.1"/> there's a delay between the announcement and the actual production <pause dur="0.5"/> and also <pause dur="0.4"/> if <pause dur="1.4"/> there are some slight exit costs sunk costs <pause dur="0.6"/> incur for the firm has to incur to come into the market <pause dur="0.6"/> then the predictions of the the model <pause dur="0.7"/> are dramatically different <pause dur="1.7"/> 
an incumbent firm in such a market <pause dur="0.4"/> can charge the monopoly price <pause dur="0.5"/> or if it's two or three firms they can charge <pause dur="0.3"/> near the monopoly price <pause dur="0.8"/> they can charge near the monopoly price <pause dur="0.7"/> until the entrant appears <pause dur="1.0"/> they can then immediately drop their price to marginal cost <pause dur="1.6"/> the entrant <pause dur="0.5"/> having <pause dur="0.2"/> finally come in to production <pause dur="0.9"/> would then make no money <pause dur="0.3"/> in fact it would make a loss it would make a loss equal to its sunk costs <pause dur="1.6"/> if the entrant is aware of that <pause dur="1.3"/> it would not come into the market <pause dur="2.0"/> so the sequence is this that <pause dur="0.8"/> with slight alterations <trunc>i</trunc> if the <pause dur="0.6"/> the notion of a perfectly contestable market is not met if you make slight changes in the assumptions even though the market may be approximately <pause dur="0.9"/> contestable <pause dur="0.6"/> it may has a dramatic difference in the prediction because it means that the incumbent firms <pause dur="0.2"/> will continually be able to charge <pause dur="0.3"/> something approaching a monopoly price <pause dur="0.3"/> entry will not occur because the entrants will say <pause dur="0.8"/> i will have to incur slight sunk costs to get into this market <pause dur="0.5"/> and i won't be able to recover them and i won't make any money because as soon i appear and produce <pause dur="0.3"/> the price will collapse to marginal cost <pause dur="2.0"/> now <pause dur="1.2"/> the emphasis in this theory on sunk costs i think is important that's possibly its most important contribution <pause dur="1.4"/> i'm really i suppose offering you a warning that whenever you see <pause dur="0.5"/> # contestability or contestable markets mentioned in the literature <pause dur="0.3"/> ask yourself the question <pause dur="0.4"/> is this a fudge <pause dur="1.9"/> is the person talking about <pause dur="0.2"/> market X as being contestable do do they mean that it's approximately <pause dur="0.4"/> contestable in which case <pause dur="0.5"/> you need to ask the further question what does 
that actually mean does it mean that the firms are able to charge a near monopoly price <pause dur="1.3"/> because <pause dur="0.2"/> as i've indicated <pause dur="0.4"/> the theory is non-robust and <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> the predictions <pause dur="0.6"/> are <pause dur="0.4"/> or can be very dramatically different if you alter the <pause dur="0.2"/> assumptions only slightly <pause dur="0.3"/> from the perfect <pause dur="0.2"/> case <pause dur="0.7"/> the reason for emphasizing that <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> is that it has had a very <trunc>im</trunc> wide impact on the literature i'm sure that you've <pause dur="0.4"/> in your microeconomics for example you may well have encountered discussions of this <pause dur="1.0"/> as a <pause dur="0.4"/> an abstract theory the the notion of perfect contestability works <pause dur="0.4"/> but as soon as you move away from the <pause dur="0.5"/> perfect the the the <pause dur="0.2"/> <vocal desc="cough" iterated="n"/> perfect version of it <pause dur="0.8"/> the predictions <pause dur="0.2"/> go all over the place <pause dur="1.6"/> entry conditions therefore are quite crucial <pause dur="0.3"/> in the predictions <pause dur="0.3"/> <kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="3"/> for <pause dur="0.3"/> market <pause dur="0.8"/> conduct and market performance <pause dur="0.9"/> 
what i want to <kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="1"/> do now is to go on to a very large topic indeed <pause dur="0.3"/> this is topic five <pause dur="0.7"/> on <pause dur="0.6"/> page two of the course outline <pause dur="0.9"/> pricing decisions <pause dur="2.5"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> it is a very large topic and i want to <vocal desc="cough" iterated="n"/> <pause dur="2.0"/> deal with it under two main headings i'm assuming that you have <pause dur="1.1"/> a pretty good knowledge of let us say the theory of simple monopoly the theory of perfect competition <pause dur="1.5"/> i'm going to be dealing with <pause dur="0.4"/> essentially with two forms of imperfect competition <pause dur="2.4"/> and i'm going to <pause dur="3.2"/><kinesic desc="reveals covered part of transparency" iterated="n"/> divide that up essentially into <pause dur="3.7"/> a market structure which i will characterize as being <pause dur="1.9"/> a structure with one dominant firm <pause dur="0.5"/> and i'll say a word in a moment about what i mean with <pause dur="0.2"/> by dominance as opposed to monopoly <pause dur="1.4"/> there are <trunc>var</trunc> a number of variations on the theme of pricing in dominant markets which i've listed here <pause dur="0.3"/> all of this incidentally will take me quite a long while to get through so there's no need to make a note of <pause dur="0.3"/> all of it now <pause dur="0.4"/> i think perhaps if you went down to there <kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> for the moment <pause dur="0.4"/> that would cover what i'm going to say this morning <pause dur="1.4"/> # <pause dur="7.1"/> so the first market structure <pause dur="2.1"/> concerns <pause dur="1.8"/> not monopoly but something approaching that <pause dur="0.6"/> # a market structure with a dominant firm <pause dur="0.3"/> the second one <trunc>w</trunc> the second group of <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> markets that i want to talk about which is not on this # slide but which will be on another one <pause dur="0.7"/> is oligopoly <pause dur="0.4"/> which you're <trunc>a</trunc> familiar with i'm sure from microeconomics in a general way <pause dur="0.4"/> i will make <pause dur="0.8"/> # that much more precise when i come on to it but it forms the second group <pause dur="0.3"/> of <pause dur="0.3"/> topics within this general <pause dur="0.4"/> under this general heading <pause dur="0.4"/> of pricing decisions which if you look at the course outline <pause dur="0.4"/> gives under the subheading two pricing problems in oligopoly <pause dur="2.4"/> what do i then mean by the <trunc>di</trunc> or making the distinction between dominance and monopoly we all know what a monopoly is that it's a 
single firm case where <pause dur="1.2"/> the firm is in sole control of a market and it's protected by <pause dur="0.4"/> such high entry barriers that its position is <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="1.0"/> not vulnerable to competition <pause dur="0.2"/> and the <trunc>f</trunc> and we can then analyse <trunc>i</trunc> from the simple theory of monopoly what the <pause dur="0.3"/> predictions about price and output will be <pause dur="1.2"/> as i've said in some contexts # <pause dur="2.7"/> already <pause dur="4.3"/> # <pause dur="2.6"/> it's very rare in the real world for firms to be in that happy position of being a complete monopoly <pause dur="0.6"/> in the real world you very often however <pause dur="0.2"/> have an approximation <pause dur="0.3"/><event desc="looks through transparencies" iterated="y" dur="14"/> to <pause dur="1.1"/> dominance <pause dur="0.9"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> for example <pause dur="6.3"/> seem to have lost my example at the moment oh here we are <pause dur="2.7"/> i undertook a study in the middle eighties from # a large number of monopolies as it was then called the monopolies and mergers commission <pause dur="0.4"/> and i was quite it was quite easy for me to find twenty-two markets this # the the period covered was the middle seventies to the <pause dur="0.2"/> middle eighties <pause dur="0.8"/> it was quite easy to find a number of markets that they had investigated where the first firm had <pause dur="0.8"/> a share of fifty per cent or above in some cases it was much higher than that it was sort of eighty or ninety per cent <pause dur="0.9"/> and the second largest firm or firms were were more than <trunc>ha</trunc> <pause dur="0.6"/> were only half or less of the size in terms of market share <pause dur="0.3"/> of the dominant firm <pause dur="1.4"/> so although in many cases <pause dur="0.3"/> # in the real world you don't have monopoly you only have those usually in the case of natural 
monopoly <pause dur="0.5"/> the notion of dominance as i want to use it <pause dur="0.2"/> is quite frequent <pause dur="1.0"/> you do <pause dur="0.3"/> frequently find <pause dur="0.2"/> one firm with a very sizeable market share <pause dur="0.3"/> as a rule of thumb if you like <pause dur="0.6"/> upwards of fifty per cent of the market possibly much higher than that <pause dur="0.6"/> and where the second largest firm is much smaller <pause dur="0.4"/> with a a share of <pause dur="0.3"/> perhaps under ten per cent or a number of firms <pause dur="0.3"/> all of whom have quite <pause dur="0.2"/> small <pause dur="0.5"/> # market shares <pause dur="0.8"/> now my <pause dur="0.2"/> # i will therefore mean by dominance that sort of market structure <pause dur="0.4"/> the size distribution of firms is highly skewed you've got one firm <pause dur="1.3"/> in pretty much in command of the market but a number of other firms <pause dur="1.3"/> operating in the market <pause dur="0.3"/> in competition <pause dur="1.5"/> that <pause dur="0.4"/> market structure can be <pause dur="0.3"/> modelled by <pause dur="0.5"/> the dominant firm and the competitive fringe <pause dur="0.2"/> case <pause dur="1.6"/> an example of which i have given round as a diagram and which i want to say something <pause dur="0.5"/> # about now <pause dur="7.8"/> <kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="4"/> the essential questions that i want to address in talking about this model are the following <pause dur="0.2"/> and this is exactly the <pause dur="0.3"/> diagram that you should have in front of you <pause dur="2.2"/> the sort of questions i want to address are these <pause dur="1.9"/> to what extent is a firm <pause dur="0.3"/> in this dominant position to what extent is it constrained in its pricing behaviour <pause dur="2.2"/> by the presence of the the smaller fringe of firms <pause dur="1.0"/> and what strategies does it have for trying to control 
that fringe to its own advantage <pause dur="3.1"/> right well this <pause dur="0.4"/> diagram which may at first glance look extremely complicated does <pause dur="0.3"/> or can be broken down into <trunc>s</trunc> i hope <pause dur="0.2"/> some fairly straightforward components <pause dur="1.1"/> we start out with the line M-D which stands for market demand <pause dur="1.9"/> the related marginal revenue curve or line is denoted <pause dur="0.3"/> M-R <pause dur="3.3"/> the <trunc>l</trunc> the horizontal line <pause dur="0.3"/> M-C-D is the marginal costs of the dominant firm <pause dur="2.6"/> so you've got a market demand curve its related marginal revenue curve <pause dur="0.2"/> treating <pause dur="0.6"/> or <pause dur="0.2"/> on the assumption for the moment that we have a monopoly <pause dur="2.6"/> our dominant firm's marginal costs are horizontal <trunc>a</trunc> at # M-C <pause dur="0.4"/> but they are made horizontal for to make the diagram rather simpler than it would be if we had a curve <pause dur="0.2"/> doesn't actually affect <pause dur="0.3"/> the result <pause dur="1.0"/> now let's start with the position let's suppose that this is not a dominant firm it's a monopoly <pause dur="1.4"/> if it was to charge a simple monopoly price <pause dur="0.3"/> then on well known principles it would seek out this equality here between marginal revenue and marginal cost <pause dur="0.4"/> and the monopoly price is P-M <pause dur="1.6"/> and as a monopolist it would charge <pause dur="0.6"/> Q-M for that output <pause dur="2.9"/> 
now that's if you like the starting point <pause dur="0.2"/> remember <trunc>on</trunc> one of the questions i wanted to pose of this model is well <pause dur="0.2"/> how is the behaviour of such a firm constrained by the presence of a fringe <pause dur="0.2"/> small much smaller competitors <pause dur="2.5"/> we've now got a line <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> an upward sloping line marked S-F which <trunc>s</trunc> stands for the supply by small fringe firms <pause dur="3.1"/> 
that is upward sloping for <pause dur="0.3"/> normal supply reasons that is if the price is higher it <trunc>th</trunc> <trunc>th</trunc> <pause dur="0.3"/> <trunc>th</trunc> the price that the output can command is higher more will be <trunc>supri</trunc> supplied <pause dur="2.0"/> we can note as well that if we look at the point P-zero or P-O <pause dur="0.3"/> on the vertical axis <pause dur="1.5"/> at a price below that the fringe doesn't supply anything at all <pause dur="1.7"/> in other words the fringe <pause dur="0.6"/> fringe's costs are higher <pause dur="0.9"/> than the costs of the dominant firm by assumption <pause dur="3.7"/> at a price P-zero or below they will supply nothing <pause dur="1.4"/> let's look at a <trunc>pr</trunc> at # <pause dur="0.3"/> the <pause dur="1.0"/> the equivalent point <pause dur="0.5"/> on the demand curve opposite P-F
in this diagram <pause dur="0.3"/> which i'm <pause dur="0.6"/> showing by the position of my pencil at the moment <pause dur="1.0"/> we trace that through onto the demand curve if the price rose to P-F <pause dur="1.0"/> the implications from basic analysis is that the fringe at that price would be supplying the whole <pause dur="0.3"/> output the whole market it would be supplying enough to clear the market <pause dur="0.3"/> at the price <pause dur="0.3"/> P-F <pause dur="2.7"/> for our purposes therefore the relevant price range <pause dur="0.4"/> is P-F<pause dur="0.6"/>P-0 <pause dur="0.5"/> over that range <pause dur="0.9"/> the fringe <pause dur="1.5"/> supplies part <pause dur="0.5"/> or all in the limit <pause dur="0.5"/> of the market <pause dur="1.6"/> and it's upward sloping as i've indicated because the <trunc>pri</trunc> the higher the price the more will be supplied <pause dur="1.6"/> we make the further assumption now given this structure that we if we had our dominant firm <pause dur="0.7"/> with the fringe <pause dur="0.8"/> the dominant firm <pause dur="1.7"/> makes the price <pause dur="1.3"/> it optimizes given the presence of that fringe <pause dur="0.8"/> the fringe suppliers because they're so small by assumption <pause dur="0.3"/> simply take that as a <trunc>para</trunc> parametric price they can't <trunc>affor</trunc> # can't # affect it <pause dur="0.9"/> they will simply supply according to that <pause dur="0.6"/> # as if you if you 
like as a fixed market price <pause dur="0.4"/> depending on what price has been fixed <pause dur="0.4"/> by the dominant firm <pause dur="2.1"/> now <pause dur="0.7"/> what how therefore does under those assumptions and this # market structure how does the dominant firm determine its price and output <pause dur="0.8"/> well the line that i have marked in this diagram as R-D which is this line here <pause dur="2.2"/><kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> this is that stands for residual demand <pause dur="1.6"/> and it is simply the market demand <pause dur="0.4"/> minus <pause dur="0.9"/> whatever amount at the price specified is supplied by the fringe suppliers <pause dur="2.3"/> the line R-D <pause dur="1.5"/> is residual demand <pause dur="1.3"/> we are taking away from the market demand <pause dur="0.5"/> the amount supplied by the fringe <pause dur="0.3"/> suppliers <pause dur="0.3"/> to leave us with a residual demand R-D <pause dur="2.6"/> that is the demand <pause dur="0.5"/> given the presence of the fringe <pause dur="0.5"/> that is the demand on which the dominant firm optimizes <pause dur="3.4"/> related to that curve or line R-D is the residual marginal revenue curve M-R-R in the diagram <pause dur="3.6"/> so we've got the dominant firm <pause dur="0.7"/> taking account of the fringe suppliers <pause dur="0.8"/> it goes through or in in <pause dur="0.5"/> # in principle <pause dur="0.4"/> it goes through the mental process of 
actual subtracting from the market demand <pause dur="0.2"/> what <pause dur="0.4"/> the fringe will supply and then optimizes <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.8"/> on that residual demand curve <pause dur="0.4"/> we can then proceed <pause dur="0.4"/> to see what the the dominant firm does this is still its marginal cost <pause dur="0.4"/> this is now its marginal revenue <pause dur="0.6"/> so the relevant intersection <pause dur="0.4"/> is this point here <pause dur="3.3"/><kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> on the residual demand curve that implies because it's directly above the intersection of marginal cost and marginal revenue <pause dur="0.4"/> that implies <pause dur="0.2"/> a price of P-R <pause dur="5.4"/> the dominant firm is optimizing given its marginal cost <pause dur="0.7"/> and given its relevant marginal revenue which is M-R-R <pause dur="0.3"/> the relevant intersection is at this point here <pause dur="3.0"/> <kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> reading off from the demand curve <pause dur="0.2"/> the optimizing for the monopolies the optimizing price <pause dur="0.5"/> is P-R <pause dur="2.1"/> you may well say well the market won't the whole market won't clear at that price <pause dur="0.5"/> because if this firm is only supplying Q-R at that which it would do the dominant firm <pause dur="0.4"/> is only supplying Q-R <pause dur="1.5"/> at that price an amount Q-S is demanded <pause dur="1.1"/> well of course the gap <pause dur="0.9"/> this <pause dur="0.4"/> dashed line 
here <pause dur="1.3"/><kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> the gap is filled <pause dur="0.3"/> by <pause dur="1.0"/> the fringe <pause dur="0.3"/> they <pause dur="0.3"/> account for <pause dur="0.3"/> an amount of the supply Q-R-Q-S <pause dur="2.0"/> and the market will clear at the price P-R <pause dur="0.6"/> so what we've got <pause dur="0.5"/> is the dominant firm producing Q-R <pause dur="1.0"/> optimizing its position <trunc>i</trunc> its position <pause dur="0.3"/> given the constraint <pause dur="0.7"/> offered by the fringe suppliers <pause dur="1.4"/> the fringe suppliers will <pause dur="0.7"/> take that market that that price has given <pause dur="0.3"/> they're not going to try to effect it because they're too small in relation to the total <pause dur="0.4"/> they supply Q-R-Q-S <pause dur="3.8"/> what we can note about this is compared with the <pause dur="2.1"/> simple monopoly case <pause dur="0.7"/> where we had a price of P-M and an output Q-M <pause dur="0.5"/> the price <pause dur="1.1"/> because of the presence of <pause dur="0.5"/> apparently insignificant small firms the price is <pause dur="0.3"/> quite different the price has dropped to P-R <pause dur="2.2"/> and the amount supplied by the fringe is is as i've indicated so the price is quite <trunc>amoun</trunc> an amount lower <pause dur="0.4"/> as a result of the presence of the fringe <pause dur="0.3"/> and of course the amount sold <pause dur="0.4"/> is lower <pause dur="0.5"/> consumers therefore undoubtedly benefit from the presence of the fringe even
though <pause dur="0.7"/> they may appear on the face of it to be <pause dur="0.2"/> rather <pause dur="0.2"/> insignificant <pause dur="2.1"/> let me stop there for a moment and ask if anybody <pause dur="0.4"/> wants me to go through any of that again because i know at # first <pause dur="0.4"/> this is your first <pause dur="1.1"/> look at that it it's quite complicated <pause dur="0.6"/> does anybody want me to go through any of it again <pause dur="1.9"/> yes can you pinpoint <pause dur="0.2"/> where you would like me to <pause dur="0.3"/> to go through </u> <pause dur="0.4"/> <u who="sm0755" trans="pause"> yeah just <pause dur="0.2"/> one small bit i didn't catch <pause dur="0.2"/> why the range between P-nought and <pause dur="0.5"/> P-F i understand the lower range being P-nought but not <pause dur="0.2"/> why the upper range should be P-F </u><pause dur="1.3"/> <u who="nm0754" trans="pause"> well <trunc>o</trunc> the the upper range <pause dur="0.3"/> # it where the supply curve of the fringe cuts the demand curve <pause dur="0.4"/> on basic <pause dur="0.3"/> supply and demand principles <pause dur="0.3"/> the fringe would simply be <pause dur="0.3"/> would would sell <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="1.1"/> well it <trunc>a</trunc> it it looks as if it's <trunc>a</trunc> almost identical with Q-R but that was an unintentional <pause dur="0.5"/> the fringe would supply the entire market demand at a price as high as P-F <pause dur="1.7"/> and the lower level as is as you've <pause dur="0.4"/> indicated is simply <pause dur="0.2"/> that as its costs are higher <pause dur="0.9"/> at a price P <trunc>no</trunc> P-<pause dur="0.4"/>O or below it doesn't supply anything <trunc>a</trunc> they they don't supply anything at all <pause dur="1.4"/> yes </u><u who="sf0756" trans="latching"> just ask what was residual demand is that for <gap reason="inaudible" extent="2 secs"/></u><u who="nm0754" trans="latching"> no <pause dur="0.2"/> it's <pause dur="0.2"/> it's <pause dur="0.2"/> the the <trunc>do</trunc> the # the mental process we assume that the

over quite a long period of time <pause dur="0.3"/> but on the whole there are some <pause dur="0.2"/> spectacular exceptions but on the whole <pause dur="1.0"/> dominant firms once they've achieved a position <pause dur="0.8"/> <trunc>a</trunc> as i've been talking about in their market <pause dur="1.2"/> they don't give up their dominance very easily <pause dur="0.8"/> some firms <pause dur="0.2"/> # in <trunc>w</trunc> # in our <pause dur="0.3"/> theoretical terms # in our fringe <pause dur="0.3"/> may encroach <pause dur="0.3"/> on the be able to encroach on the position of the dominant firm <pause dur="0.5"/> but their ability to do that <trunc>ap</trunc> apparently from the historical records seems to be quite <pause dur="0.5"/> # limited <pause dur="1.8"/> in addition to that we must reckon with the fact that the dominant firm may have as long as it can get away with it from a policy perspective <pause dur="0.4"/> may have a number of strategies open to it <pause dur="0.4"/> for ensuring that <pause dur="0.3"/> even if its market share has declined for a 
little while over a few years <pause dur="1.2"/> it can try to regain that <pause dur="0.6"/> # position <pause dur="0.9"/> # by using a number of strategies <pause dur="1.1"/> # the most extreme of those i suppose until quite recently <pause dur="0.4"/> was the dominant firm in the British <trunc>s</trunc> # cement industry <pause dur="0.4"/> where # <pause dur="0.3"/> for for a number of <pause dur="0.2"/> # extraneous reasons <pause dur="0.2"/> the market share of this dominant firm is known for a very long period indeed throughout <pause dur="0.5"/> # the nineteen-hundreds <pause dur="0.6"/> # sorry throughout the from nineteen-hundred to the year <pause dur="0.5"/> about nineteen-eighty nineteen-ninety <pause dur="0.5"/> its market share <pause dur="0.9"/> almost remained unchanged what happened was that this dominant firm <pause dur="0.6"/> achieved its dominance through # a massive merger in just prior to the First World War <pause dur="0.9"/> it had # a very large market share then it started declining <pause dur="0.2"/> somewhat <pause dur="0.2"/> what it did was to <pause dur="0.2"/> to <trunc>o</trunc> over a number of decades it simply <pause dur="0.2"/> when that happened it simply acquired its nearest rival <pause dur="1.4"/> now you could say well that is now that sort of behaviour is now constrained <pause dur="0.4"/> by # competition policy and that would be <pause dur="0.2"/> correct <pause dur="0.7"/> but it seems to have 
been able to get away with that strategy for a quite long while so even though the <pause dur="0.4"/> the fringe if you like <pause dur="0.2"/> # in that market was <pause dur="0.8"/> the the the <trunc>w</trunc> the the amount to this <pause dur="0.5"/> # fringe supply curve <pause dur="0.4"/> getting more elastic the fringe would be supplying more and more <pause dur="0.5"/> to recover its position <pause dur="0.3"/> in that example the firm simply acquired <pause dur="0.5"/> its nearest rival <pause dur="0.3"/> so one way of retrieving <pause dur="0.2"/> its market share was by acquisition <pause dur="1.8"/> # <vocal desc="cough" dur="1" iterated="y"/> another way of shifting this curve <pause dur="0.2"/> to the dominant firm's advantage <pause dur="0.3"/> may be for example <pause dur="0.2"/> if the dominant firm <pause dur="1.2"/> in a sense overbuys a crucial input <pause dur="0.2"/> both the dominant firm <pause dur="0.8"/> and <pause dur="0.3"/> the fringe firms may have to <trunc>sup</trunc> <pause dur="0.3"/> have to use certain crucial inputs <pause dur="1.1"/> if the dominant firm deliberately as a piece of strategy <pause dur="1.0"/> buys up in any a particular time period more than it knows it's going to use for its own output <pause dur="0.4"/> that will tend to push up the price of that input <pause dur="0.5"/> and raise the cost not only to the dominant firm <pause dur="0.5"/> but to the fringe firm <pause dur="0.3"/> and you may say well <pause dur="0.7"/> why push up its own costs <pause dur="1.2"/> <trunc>i</trunc> i know 
that the fringe firm's costs are # rising as well but why do that surely as a piece of strategy it seems very shortsighted <pause dur="0.3"/> but as far as the dominant firm is concerned <pause dur="0.5"/> it can do a rough calculation <pause dur="0.6"/> that if it can impose on the <trunc>admitted</trunc> already higher cost fringe firms <pause dur="0.5"/> greater burdens than itself <pause dur="0.2"/> 'cause as the dominant firm it may be more capital intensive <pause dur="0.5"/> and these may be <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> variable costs rather than fixed costs <pause dur="0.2"/> so long as the <pause dur="0.3"/> amount of cost increased that it can impose <pause dur="0.2"/> on the fringe <pause dur="0.3"/> are greater <pause dur="1.2"/> than on itself <pause dur="0.5"/> and if it does retrieve <pause dur="0.3"/> its market share <pause dur="0.2"/> in so doing that is it therefore generates more revenue <pause dur="1.1"/> it will be worthwhile it doing that <pause dur="0.3"/> 
so one way of shifting <pause dur="1.0"/> the fringe supply to its own advantage <pause dur="0.3"/> would be to overbuy <pause dur="0.2"/> on a crucial input <pause dur="1.3"/> thus pushing up the price both to itself <pause dur="0.3"/> and to <pause dur="0.4"/> # its fringe rivals but so long as its retrieval of its market share <pause dur="0.3"/> generates an <trunc>a</trunc> increase in revenue greater than the increase in cost for it <pause dur="0.4"/> it will be worth its while <pause dur="1.7"/> another more # <pause dur="0.3"/> the same sort of strategy might be for the dominant firm to try to press <pause dur="0.3"/> through lobbying <pause dur="0.5"/> for <pause dur="0.5"/> a change in the regulations for example governing the industry <pause dur="1.0"/> which may have a greater impact on the smaller fringe firms than on it as the established dominant <pause dur="0.2"/> firm <pause dur="1.4"/> there are a number of ways <pause dur="0.2"/> that it might be able to do that <pause dur="0.2"/> for example if the change regulation affects <pause dur="0.3"/> only new entrants <pause dur="0.3"/> rather than established firms <pause dur="0.2"/> their costs <pause dur="0.3"/> may be <pause dur="0.2"/> higher <pause dur="0.6"/> or the increase in cost may be 
higher <pause dur="0.2"/> than the increase in costs for the dominant firm <pause dur="2.6"/> a number of strategies might be possible therefore for changing <pause dur="0.4"/> the <pause dur="0.5"/> # the position of this <kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> fringe supply <pause dur="0.2"/> if it's successful what that would mean <pause dur="0.2"/> is that it would be moving up in that direction it'd be rising <pause dur="0.7"/> so that at each price <pause dur="0.2"/> the fringe will be able <pause dur="0.2"/> to supply <pause dur="0.3"/> less <pause dur="0.8"/> if the dominant firm is successful <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> in raising <pause dur="0.9"/> both its own <pause dur="0.3"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> costs to the fringe <pause dur="1.8"/> as another piece of strategy it might attempt to shift the residual demand curve we <trunc>talk</trunc> i talked about <pause dur="0.3"/> shifting <pause dur="0.5"/> the fringe supply curve <pause dur="1.2"/> what it might also try to do is to <pause dur="0.2"/> shift <pause dur="0.2"/> the residual demand curve <pause dur="2.4"/><kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> it might do this and this will depend of <trunc>cou</trunc> to a <trunc>s</trunc> # a large extent on the nature of the product <pause dur="0.2"/> it might do this by undertaking for example a very heavy <pause dur="1.0"/> # advertising campaign to swing demand towards its product away from the products of the fringe supply <pause dur="0.7"/> now that what that would do <pause dur="0.2"/> would be to push out the <pause dur="0.4"/> residual <pause dur="0.2"/> demand curve <pause dur="0.3"/> meaning that it 
would <trunc>comm</trunc> not only command a higher price <pause dur="1.5"/> but the dominant firm would supply more of the market <pause dur="0.6"/> than <pause dur="0.2"/> previously <pause dur="1.8"/> and again <pause dur="0.3"/> as long as the <pause dur="1.0"/> shift in the demand which would generate more revenue for the firm the dominant firm so long as that is greater <pause dur="0.7"/> than the increasing cost that it's incurring through in my example the advertising <pause dur="0.3"/> it would pay it <pause dur="0.3"/> to <pause dur="0.4"/> # to do that <pause dur="2.5"/> as an alternative <pause dur="0.3"/> to <pause dur="0.2"/> that sort of strategy <pause dur="0.4"/> that is in in shifting <pause dur="0.6"/> directly shifting the residual demand or the fringe supply <pause dur="0.4"/> much more aggressively <pause dur="0.3"/> the dominant firm and i think i'm # i <pause dur="0.7"/> hinted at this <trunc>a</trunc> in my one of my earlier lectures <pause dur="0.5"/> the dominant firm may actually <pause dur="2.8"/> decide to <pause dur="0.7"/> try to exploit much more aggressively the learning curve you remember i mentioned that <pause dur="0.5"/> in some industries not by no means all but in some industries learning effects are very very important <pause dur="1.5"/> the dominant firm may therefore try to move very very rapidly down that learning curve which implies that it would charge a very low price <pause dur="1.1"/> now 
in the limit in our <pause dur="0.5"/> theoretical scheme of of the such a market <pause dur="0.6"/> it may actually push the price towards or at or near P-<pause dur="0.2"/>0 <pause dur="0.6"/> in which case <pause dur="0.4"/> the amount of fringe supply would be very very small <pause dur="1.6"/> note that by assumption i don't think it's a <pause dur="0.6"/> # it's not a very <trunc>imp</trunc> i think it's very plausible assumption <pause dur="0.3"/> the assumption however is that the dominant firm has lower costs to start with <pause dur="1.5"/> if <pause dur="0.3"/> and we'd have to change <pause dur="0.5"/> in my learning curve case <pause dur="0.3"/> we'd probably have to <trunc>ma</trunc> <pause dur="0.3"/> draw a different sort of marginal cost curve <pause dur="0.7"/> but if there are important learning effects <pause dur="0.3"/> the dominant firm may be able <trunc>t</trunc> or may <pause dur="0.7"/> # <trunc>mo</trunc> or try to move very rapidly down that <pause dur="0.3"/> learning curve <pause dur="0.2"/> charge a very low price <pause dur="0.4"/> which means that the fringe supply <pause dur="0.6"/> # would be the {st}fringe suppliers would be struggling <pause dur="0.3"/> and their <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.8"/> market share <pause dur="0.2"/> would be reduced <pause dur="1.9"/> important <pause dur="0.2"/> questions i will leave you with because i want to take it up bit later on in a later lecture is this <pause dur="0.5"/> if the dominant firm did see it is it in its own interests as <pause dur="0.3"/> 
as charging a price below P-zero <pause dur="0.4"/> or P-O in this diagram <pause dur="0.9"/> if it decided that it would be in in its own interests in the short run to price below P-<pause dur="0.3"/>O <pause dur="0.4"/> is that predatory <pause dur="1.3"/> is it <pause dur="0.4"/> anti-competitive <pause dur="2.2"/> and i will take up the question <pause dur="0.4"/> of # <pause dur="2.2"/> predatory behaviour in a subsequent lecture in more detail and try to <pause dur="0.5"/> address <pause dur="0.2"/> that question which for the moment <pause dur="0.4"/> i will leave you with <pause dur="0.7"/> let me sum up then on the <pause dur="0.4"/> # outcome of a model of this kind <pause dur="1.8"/> the prices <pause dur="0.3"/> if you have a structural of of market where you have a dominant firm and a fringe supply the prices <pause dur="2.5"/> with the fringe are lower <vocal desc="cough" iterated="n"/> than without the fringe <pause dur="0.2"/> and of course the output is therefore higher <pause dur="0.4"/> consumers therefore benefit <pause dur="9.6"/> historically <pause dur="0.7"/> it's the second point historically <pause dur="0.6"/> dominant firms' shares have tended to erode but that erosion <pause dur="0.2"/> is very slow <pause dur="0.5"/> generally <pause dur="2.7"/> even if they can't <pause dur="0.3"/> use <trunc>mer</trunc> the merger route to reclaim their or regain their market share <pause dur="2.7"/> because of competition policy <pause dur="0.6"/> they may be able to recover <pause dur="0.2"/> their market share <pause dur="0.3"/> more <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> subtly if
you like <pause dur="0.5"/> by <pause dur="0.3"/> trying to shift either the fringe supply curve <pause dur="0.3"/> or the residual demand curve <pause dur="2.6"/> my final point on that is that in the same study which i referred to earlier on this morning <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> over a quite a long period it varied a little bit but it was something of the order of forty or fifty years in a sample of nineteen <pause dur="0.4"/> dominant firms defined in the way that i <trunc>defi</trunc> <pause dur="0.3"/> i mentioned earlier on <pause dur="0.5"/> that is the dominant firm had fifty plus <pause dur="0.3"/> share of the market <pause dur="1.6"/> thirteen of those shares declined in this thirty to forty year period <pause dur="1.0"/> or remained unchanged <pause dur="0.2"/> <vocal desc="cough" iterated="n"/> within a <pause dur="0.2"/> percentage point or two thirteen of <pause dur="0.2"/> a sample of <pause dur="0.4"/> nineteen <pause dur="1.2"/> declined or remained unchanged <pause dur="0.9"/> and six increased <pause dur="0.4"/> in this period <pause dur="0.2"/> so these they were already dominant <pause dur="0.3"/> they increased <pause dur="0.2"/> their share <pause dur="1.5"/> the final point <vocal desc="cough" iterated="n"/> i will make on this <pause dur="0.4"/> # from that same study is that <pause dur="0.5"/> in each case even though they declined <pause dur="0.5"/> they remained the market leader <pause dur="1.3"/> so i will leave you <pause dur="0.2"/> with <pause dur="0.2"/> two things <pause dur="1.2"/> dominant firms take a long while to decline but they <trunc>re</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> tend to <trunc>re</trunc> 
even if they do decline they retain their dominance or their <pause dur="0.3"/> leading <trunc>p</trunc> position in the market <pause dur="1.3"/> secondly <pause dur="1.1"/> which i will open with # next Friday second question <pause dur="1.3"/> if dominant firms remain <trunc>a</trunc> around a long while and apparently their market share only declines fairly gently <pause dur="1.7"/> in addition to the strategies that i have already mentioned are there other strategies that they can use <pause dur="0.4"/> to <pause dur="0.2"/> prevent <pause dur="0.2"/> their share from eroding from new entry <pause dur="0.6"/> and the question i will address at the beginning of next time <pause dur="0.2"/> is precisely that <pause dur="0.4"/> is it <pause dur="0.2"/> logical for example for dominant firms <pause dur="0.2"/> to use limit pricing that is <pause dur="0.5"/> to charge a lower price in the short run <pause dur="0.6"/> to deter entry <pause dur="1.4"/> in order to maintain a higher profits <pause dur="0.4"/> for themselves in the long run <pause dur="0.9"/> and i will stop there
