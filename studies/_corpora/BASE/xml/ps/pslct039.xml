<u who="nf0955"> i wanted to start by saying that at the end <trunc>o</trunc> <trunc>o</trunc> well not quite at the end <pause dur="0.2"/> of the lecture i'd made a correction but somebody came and asked me at the end about the correction <pause dur="0.5"/> so can you just check in your notes where i was <pause dur="2.4"/> writing the <pause dur="1.3"/> <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="14"/> variance of G <trunc>da</trunc> <pause dur="0.3"/> G-of-X <pause dur="1.4"/> approximately equal to <pause dur="0.5"/> G-dashed at mu <pause dur="3.9"/> right i forgot the squared initially can you check you've all i think you've probably all checked that <pause dur="0.3"/> i'd put the squared into all the other formulae but just not in here <pause dur="1.4"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="2"/> so can you just check that you've got that correct in your notes or you might get <pause dur="0.8"/> slightly puzzled when you come back to them <pause dur="15.7"/> right i was then going on to talk about the Kaplan-Meier estimate <pause dur="3.6"/> <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="14"/> so Kaplan-<pause dur="2.0"/>Meier <pause dur="2.2"/> estimator <pause dur="2.2"/> and <pause dur="2.0"/> it just incidentally was a paper published by two people 
called Kaplan and Meier in nineteen-fifty-eight <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="1.1"/> just to show you that quite a lot of the stuff <pause dur="1.0"/> we do isn't <pause dur="0.4"/> late well second half of the twentieth century <pause dur="0.4"/> sometimes if you try to explain to people you're doing research in statistics they look at <trunc>b</trunc> you blankly and say what is there to do they seem to think all these things just <pause dur="0.6"/> appeared instantly <pause dur="0.9"/> # and nobody ever thought about them <pause dur="4.4"/> right and the notation i was <pause dur="0.2"/> using <pause dur="0.4"/> <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="4"/> was <pause dur="4.9"/> you should just about be at this stage in your notes anyway this should already be written down <pause dur="0.9"/> so the notation was we're looking at <pause dur="0.8"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="3"/> T-zero T-one <pause dur="0.9"/> up to <pause dur="0.2"/> did i say T-N or T-K <pause dur="1.5"/> N </u><u who="sf0956" trans="overlap"> N </u><pause dur="0.9"/> <u who="nf0955" trans="pause"> <vocal desc="laugh" iterated="n"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="4"/> # <pause dur="0.8"/> and we <pause dur="0.2"/> as usual have <pause dur="0.8"/> T-nought equal to zero <pause dur="4.7"/> and then i gave you a description of the 
intervals which i did <pause dur="0.2"/> correctly verbally and not correctly <pause dur="0.5"/> in the written form <pause dur="0.4"/> we think about the intervals <pause dur="0.6"/> <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="8"/> I-I <pause dur="0.3"/> being <pause dur="1.3"/> zero <pause dur="0.3"/> T-one <pause dur="4.6"/> sorry i knew <unclear>i just</unclear> <pause dur="1.7"/> that's what got me confused you have to have that <pause dur="0.2"/> square bracket <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="5"/> of the initial zero <pause dur="1.6"/> T-one <pause dur="0.2"/> to T-two <pause dur="0.8"/> and so on so the intervals are <pause dur="0.8"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="13"/> <vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/> with the exception of at zero <pause dur="2.3"/> T-I <pause dur="1.9"/> <vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/><pause dur="1.8"/> T-I-plus <pause dur="1.7"/> T-I-plus-one <pause dur="0.8"/> with the square bracket <pause dur="3.2"/> so that you're actually including <pause dur="2.8"/> the interval <pause dur="8.7"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="8"/> doesn't really make sense <trunc>t</trunc> <pause dur="1.2"/> to put that down as an equation <pause dur="2.4"/> okay then we need exactly the same thing as in an actuarial life table <pause dur="1.2"/> except that instead of looking at intervals <pause dur="0.5"/> <vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/> <pause dur="0.4"/> we're looking at point estimates so that <pause dur="4.0"/> <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="22"/> for <pause dur="1.9"/> all those intervals I equals <pause dur="1.8"/> one <pause dur="1.0"/> up to N <pause dur="0.6"/> we let <pause dur="0.8"/> D-of-T-<pause dur="0.3"/>I <pause dur="0.9"/> be equal to the number <pause dur="0.8"/> who died <pause dur="2.0"/> at <pause dur="0.5"/> T-I <pause dur="0.7"/> and now we are requiring 
that we have the <trunc>exec</trunc> exact death time so it's not in an interval it's at a particular time <pause dur="6.3"/> and we're going to need again we're going to need to know how many people <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="27"/> there are <pause dur="0.3"/> so <pause dur="1.7"/> for I-equals-one up to <pause dur="1.0"/> N <pause dur="2.6"/> <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> <pause dur="1.9"/> and zero <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> N-of-T-I is <pause dur="0.7"/> the number <pause dur="1.7"/> alive and at risk <pause dur="2.3"/> at <pause dur="1.8"/> time I <pause dur="11.1"/> so those two are <trunc>r</trunc> <pause dur="0.3"/> really no different from <pause dur="1.4"/> the actuarial life tables <pause dur="0.4"/> the difference comes in <pause dur="0.4"/> in the censoring <pause dur="2.1"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="13"/> which <trunc>i</trunc> so again <pause dur="2.1"/> for any time we want to know <pause dur="1.6"/> C ah <trunc>s</trunc> <pause dur="0.4"/> C-of-T-I <pause dur="1.6"/> but this time <pause dur="2.1"/> it's in a different interval so <pause dur="0.3"/> <vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/> it's the number censored <pause dur="2.6"/> <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="18"/> sorry the number <pause dur="1.6"/> censored <pause dur="3.2"/> in <pause dur="4.8"/> T-I-minus-one <pause dur="0.4"/> T-<pause dur="0.2"/>I <pause dur="1.6"/> and the <pause dur="1.3"/> equality and inequality changed round <pause dur="4.2"/> <vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/> <pause dur="0.4"/> we defined the time points to be the point at which deaths occur not at which points at which censoring occur <pause dur="0.8"/> so we can actually get things happening in an 
interval for censorings unlike for deaths <pause dur="0.8"/> <vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.2"/> and this is the point i was making that if we actually had a death <pause dur="3.3"/> <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="20"/> at <pause dur="0.3"/> some value say <pause dur="1.1"/> eight doesn't matter what the eight is <pause dur="1.2"/> then <pause dur="1.4"/> the <pause dur="0.5"/> number of deaths at point eight would be equal to one <pause dur="1.0"/> but if there was a censored observation <pause dur="2.4"/> at <pause dur="0.9"/> time eight as well <pause dur="0.9"/> we regard that as happening <pause dur="0.2"/> after that death <pause dur="0.3"/> in other words <pause dur="0.4"/> it has to go <pause dur="0.4"/> <vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/> <pause dur="0.9"/> if the because the interval will be <pause dur="1.0"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="6"/> something <pause dur="2.1"/> eight for the censoring where that's strictly <pause dur="1.3"/> values less than eight <pause dur="0.2"/> the censoring goes into the interval above this <pause dur="3.7"/> it's actually much easier to do this often than to <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> <vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/> <pause dur="0.3"/> think about the <pause dur="1.4"/> worry too much about the formulae <pause dur="0.7"/> what it does 
mean of course is that you can also say <pause dur="2.2"/> <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="11"/> therefore <pause dur="2.2"/> the number at time <pause dur="1.0"/> I-plus-one <pause dur="2.1"/> <vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/> well what's going to be there at the number at time I-plus-one <pause dur="2.1"/> <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="3"/> it'll start off with a number <pause dur="1.7"/> at the beginning <pause dur="1.0"/> at the previous interval <pause dur="2.0"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="1"/> and we're going to have to subtract <pause dur="0.9"/> the deaths <pause dur="4.6"/> that happened at that time <pause dur="1.1"/> and then we're going to subtract the censoring <pause dur="0.5"/> from <pause dur="0.7"/> the next time <pause dur="9.2"/> <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="3"/> # oh <pause dur="1.1"/> sorry <pause dur="0.8"/> just <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="8"/> used an abbreviated notation sorry <pause dur="1.7"/> minus <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="4.8"/> sorry you quite often do land up writing D-I it's putting in the T-I just to make it explicit that it's on the <pause dur="0.3"/> original <pause dur="1.2"/> all the times <pause dur="0.7"/> the other thing obviously we <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="20"/> need is <pause dur="2.8"/> that <pause dur="0.8"/> the number <pause dur="1.5"/> at time zero is <pause dur="0.5"/> the total number in the study <pause dur="9.3"/> okay i've said obviously that in fact yesterday we were 
discussing how you modify this <pause dur="1.1"/> in the occasions when <vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/><pause dur="1.1"/> when that doesn't actually happen there's some interesting situations <pause dur="3.1"/> so this is really by way of setting up definitions which actually give us <pause dur="3.2"/> <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="3"/> unsurprisingly an estimator that looks the same <pause dur="0.6"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="2"/> just make that T <pause dur="1.5"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> once again we're going to have a product <pause dur="1.4"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="5"/> this time i'm going to write the product as all T-I <pause dur="0.9"/> such that <pause dur="1.5"/> T-I is less than or equal to T <pause dur="4.8"/> and <pause dur="2.4"/> <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="10"/> not surprisingly that's the product over <pause dur="0.7"/> all those <pause dur="0.4"/> D-T-Is <pause dur="1.4"/> N-T-Is <pause dur="11.8"/> what we can also notice from this is that <pause dur="1.6"/> you can <trunc>r</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="1"/> write this more directly <pause dur="0.2"/> as a recursion <pause dur="1.0"/> by <pause dur="1.4"/> <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="4"/> using the same <pause dur="3.7"/> product <pause dur="0.2"/> but let's write each of these as <pause dur="1.3"/> <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="3"/> S-of-<pause dur="1.5"/>T-I <pause dur="14.2"/> 
and writing it in this product form <pause dur="0.6"/> is the background to the other name that this is given <pause dur="0.7"/> <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="26"/> which is this <pause dur="2.5"/> is also <pause dur="2.2"/> known <pause dur="1.1"/> as the <pause dur="1.4"/> product <pause dur="3.8"/> limit <pause dur="1.4"/> estimator <pause dur="15.6"/> one of the other things that can be established on this is that <pause dur="0.3"/> again it can be <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="13"/> shown to be <pause dur="2.5"/> the maximum likelihood estimator <pause dur="9.2"/> okay <pause dur="0.3"/> well you may need to <pause dur="1.0"/> essentially specify <pause dur="0.2"/> conditions on <pause dur="0.2"/> nothing <pause dur="0.6"/> the <unclear>how is it</unclear> not changing when there's no information <pause dur="1.5"/> and <pause dur="0.7"/> the other thing we're going to want to know is the formula <pause dur="0.6"/> and <pause dur="0.7"/> sorry the the variance <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="28"/> and <pause dur="3.0"/> we don't need to derive the variance of it again because the <pause dur="0.9"/> variance <pause dur="2.8"/> is <pause dur="0.8"/> <vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/> <pause dur="1.2"/> similar <pause dur="2.1"/> in the obvious way <pause dur="0.7"/> to Greenwood's formula for the <trunc>l</trunc> # <pause dur="0.2"/> life table <pause dur="29.6"/> if you do do some reading around on the survival <pause dur="0.2"/> analysis books you might find a couple of other <pause dur="0.8"/> 
<trunc>approxim</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> <vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/> approximations to the variance <pause dur="0.5"/> that you can use particularly if there's no censoring <pause dur="1.6"/> if there is no censoring then at any point you're just using a simple binomial estimate <pause dur="0.8"/> so you can just use <pause dur="0.2"/> the binomial formula <pause dur="0.9"/> # <pause dur="0.9"/> in general <pause dur="0.2"/> you're going to be doing this kind of thing where you've got enough data to want to use a package which will calculate the variance for you <pause dur="0.4"/> so the simple approximations are not that critical <pause dur="1.1"/> okay i put some data up <pause dur="0.2"/> on <pause dur="1.6"/> Wednesday <pause dur="0.8"/> and <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="1.5"/> i have got an estimator Kaplan-Meier curve for that <pause dur="0.6"/> which i shall hand out in due course the main reason i'm not handing it out yet is i'm going to ask you to do something <pause dur="0.3"/> which has a solution on the back of the sheet <pause dur="1.2"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> and that just goes through the calculation <pause dur="0.9"/> <vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/> <pause dur="0.5"/> for you so <pause dur="0.9"/> you've got the list of times <pause dur="0.2"/> and for practice you can try doing it yourselves and then <pause dur="0.3"/> see whether you get the same answers <pause dur="1.1"/> one of 
the other things that's useful to do <pause dur="0.4"/> which may or may not endear me entirely to <pause dur="1.6"/> # people fiddling around watching what i'm up to <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="26.6"/> <event desc="turns on overhead projector" iterated="n"/><kinesic desc="puts on transparency" iterated="n"/> right i should get these lights out <pause dur="3.6"/><event desc="turns off lights" iterated="n"/> okay what's quite often <pause dur="0.4"/> you'll do with an actuarial life test like a life table <pause dur="0.5"/> is draw a survival curve <pause dur="1.3"/> and <pause dur="6.3"/> you can see the fact that we have estimates only at times in which events occur <pause dur="1.3"/> by the jumps whenever there's an event <pause dur="0.4"/> and you can see that the jumps don't <pause dur="0.8"/> always happen at <pause dur="0.4"/> identical intervals <pause dur="1.6"/> you can also see in this group this is actually gastric cancer with a couple of comparisons <pause dur="1.2"/> with time and days <pause dur="1.5"/> you can see a <pause dur="0.4"/> a very dramatic <pause dur="0.6"/> drop in <pause dur="0.7"/> survival <pause dur="0.5"/> so that <pause dur="0.3"/> five-hundred days you've only got about a third of the people still alive <pause dur="0.9"/> and then <pause dur="0.6"/> the survival <pause dur="0.2"/> levels off a little bit <pause dur="3.0"/> but the other reason for showing this <pause dur="0.2"/> curve again there's a there's a printed one in the handout i'll give you so <pause dur="0.2"/> you can <pause dur="0.2"/> have a look at that being drawn up <pause dur="0.6"/> 
the other reason for showing the curve is that of course generally what we're interested in <pause dur="0.4"/> is not just the survival <pause dur="0.2"/> i mean we may well want to know what the median survival is <pause dur="0.4"/> looks like about a <pause dur="0.6"/> a year in the radiation group with chemotherapy <pause dur="0.7"/> and maybe about <pause dur="0.5"/> a year and a half to two years in the other group <pause dur="0.8"/> but we actually would want to do a comparison of those <pause dur="0.7"/> in that group it looks as though the dotted line <pause dur="1.2"/> has got a better survival <pause dur="0.9"/> which is the chemotherapy-only group <pause dur="0.7"/> but how would we think about formally testing that <pause dur="2.4"/> well that's where we get <pause dur="0.5"/> back to a log-rank test <pause dur="1.3"/> which i'll talk about <pause dur="0.3"/> in formulae for in a minute i'm just trying to see if i can pick up <pause dur="0.6"/> let's <kinesic desc="writes on transparency" iterated="y" dur="4"/> concentrate on <pause dur="3.1"/> just that little bit of the <pause dur="0.3"/> graph at the moment <pause dur="0.9"/> what we could say at <kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> that point is that <pause dur="0.6"/><kinesic desc="writes on transparency" iterated="y" dur="15"/> in the one group <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> there will be some number <pause dur="0.3"/> at whatever the 
time is <pause dur="1.1"/> and that's going to be the number from the chemotherapy and radiation group <pause dur="1.3"/> and <pause dur="0.4"/> of those <pause dur="0.9"/> chemotherapy and radiation group <pause dur="0.5"/> there was a death at that <pause dur="0.4"/> we cannot count the number of deaths at that time <pause dur="0.9"/> in this case <pause dur="0.5"/><kinesic desc="writes on transparency" iterated="y" dur="1"/> just here <kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> there are no deaths <pause dur="1.6"/> whereas <kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> here <pause dur="0.2"/> there'll be <kinesic desc="writes on transparency" iterated="y" dur="12"/> some fixed number in the chemotherapy-only group <pause dur="1.3"/> and the death at that time <pause dur="1.0"/> we can see there is <pause dur="0.9"/> a jump so there must have been a death <pause dur="1.5"/> and we can think of that <pause dur="0.7"/> as then being a comparison of two binomials <pause dur="0.5"/> we could even set it up <pause dur="1.0"/> as a small <pause dur="0.2"/> two by two table <pause dur="0.6"/> and do a formal comparison of <pause dur="1.1"/> given the numbers in the two groups so if there were equal numbers in the two groups at this point at risk <pause dur="1.0"/> and we saw one death <pause dur="1.0"/> then we would divide that one death in terms of expectation <pause dur="0.5"/> into half in one group half in another <pause dur="1.6"/> 
and provided we can assume <trunc>th</trunc> independence we can actually do that <pause dur="0.7"/> along the whole curve and that's the basis of the log-rank test <pause dur="2.8"/> so to come back to the <pause dur="0.8"/> blackboard <pause dur="2.0"/> and <pause dur="0.3"/> i'll leave that a minute 'cause i can see a couple of pens <pause dur="2.1"/> blackboard and chalk in fact i think we're coming back to <pause dur="1.0"/> a couple of minutes of you <pause dur="0.2"/> talking about what i've just said and whether it makes sense while i clean the blackboard <pause dur="6.6"/><event desc="wipes board" iterated="y" dur="unknown"/> or anything else you want to talk about </u><gap reason="break in recording" extent="uncertain"/> <u who="nf0955" trans="pause"> okay have you got any questions on that <pause dur="1.4"/> no okay <pause dur="0.4"/> log-rank test <pause dur="11.1"/> <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="8"/> i'm not really sure where the word log comes into <pause dur="0.7"/> this <pause dur="0.8"/> but the reason we talk about ranks is that we simply look at the order <trunc>inven</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> which the events occur <pause dur="0.6"/> and we don't look at how far apart they are in other words we've got the rank times <pause dur="0.6"/> but not <pause dur="0.2"/> the actual 
values of the times <pause dur="0.7"/> and the point of a log-rank test is <pause dur="2.0"/> <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="32"/> to compare two survival <trunc>gr</trunc> <pause dur="0.4"/> two or more survival curves so if we <pause dur="2.1"/> wish to <pause dur="2.1"/> test <pause dur="1.5"/> whether <pause dur="1.6"/> two survival curves are equal <pause dur="14.5"/> in a non-parametric <pause dur="0.6"/> context so non-parametrically <pause dur="8.7"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="13"/> we <pause dur="2.6"/> can use <pause dur="2.1"/> the log-rank test <pause dur="10.4"/> okay as an aside that you don't need to write down but it's probably <pause dur="0.4"/> quite useful general knowledge <pause dur="1.1"/> non-parametric tests are essentially tests based on things like ranks that don't take <pause dur="0.2"/> the actual values into account <pause dur="1.7"/> we don't happen to teach very much about them at all on MORSE i think in fact this course is the only one that <pause dur="0.5"/> probably mentions them <pause dur="0.5"/> although i know at least some of you have discovered them in doing your reading of the literature <pause dur="1.1"/> # <pause dur="1.6"/> they tend to be very popular in the social sciences <pause dur="0.2"/> probably historically as much as anything else <pause dur="1.3"/> i've said we can use the log-rank test because 
there is also <pause dur="0.3"/> a Wilcoxan <pause dur="4.6"/> i've been asked about the Wilcoxan test this morning and the name of the Wilcoxan test <pause dur="1.3"/> that actually relates to survival has just escaped me there is a Wilcoxan test that's related to survival <pause dur="0.4"/> so if you're reading any of the survival texts <pause dur="0.4"/> you might find reference to both of them <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> anything based on ranks tends to <trunc>in</trunc> require a lot more hard work which is why i'm not going to describe it but it does exist <pause dur="0.5"/> <sic corr="non-parametric">non-paracmetric</sic> tests are around <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> so if somebody at an interview or anything asks you about them <pause dur="0.4"/> you've heard of them <pause dur="0.3"/> you just haven't studied them <pause dur="1.0"/> # <pause dur="2.1"/> so <trunc>e</trunc> end of that aside we're being non-parametric we're comparing two groups <pause dur="0.4"/> and as i said what we're really wanting to do <pause dur="0.9"/> is <pause dur="0.8"/> what we're going to do is look at each point but let's think about if we're comparing and doing a significance test we need a null hypothesis <pause dur="0.8"/> and it's slightly complicated in this <pause dur="0.2"/> <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="48"/> context <pause dur="1.6"/> to 
write it down <pause dur="0.6"/> it's not quite as trivial as some other things so that the null hypothesis <pause dur="4.4"/> is <pause dur="2.0"/> that <pause dur="0.3"/> the <trunc>cur</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> <vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/> the <pause dur="1.4"/> curves <pause dur="1.5"/> are <pause dur="3.0"/> identical <pause dur="4.4"/> I-E <pause dur="2.9"/> S for group one <pause dur="0.2"/> of T <pause dur="1.2"/> equals S for group two <pause dur="0.2"/> of T <pause dur="0.8"/> that's a form we <pause dur="0.2"/> usually can write hypotheses in but here <pause dur="0.6"/> we have to add in the comment for all T <pause dur="0.7"/> T greater than or equal to <pause dur="0.2"/> zero <pause dur="6.3"/> and <pause dur="0.5"/> you probably <vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/> want to write what i just said <pause dur="0.7"/> <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="18"/> where <pause dur="0.8"/> S-one <pause dur="1.6"/> S-two <pause dur="3.0"/> are the curves <pause dur="3.1"/> for <pause dur="2.3"/> groups one and two <pause dur="10.0"/> the for all T <pause dur="0.5"/> is <pause dur="0.8"/> the most powerful way of doing things in other words we want to compare what's happening on the whole survival <pause dur="0.7"/> it is actually very common in medicine to look at <pause dur="0.5"/> survival up to thirty days after an operation <pause dur="0.7"/> or survival up to one year <pause dur="0.4"/> that's certainly convenient as a summary <pause dur="0.3"/> it's just not as <pause dur="0.4"/> informative as it could be <pause dur="0.5"/> as a test <pause dur="0.6"/> so yesterday # # <pause dur="0.2"/> one of the medical professors was talking 
about survival after <pause dur="0.2"/> a difficult operation <pause dur="0.5"/> and that was expressed in terms <pause dur="0.5"/> of survival to thirty days for <pause dur="0.2"/> general discussion <pause dur="0.7"/> but the formal tests were done in terms of complete survival curves <pause dur="1.1"/> what we actually do is we again think of at about each point <pause dur="1.3"/> <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="24"/> so at each <pause dur="2.2"/> time <pause dur="1.4"/> T-I <pause dur="1.5"/> at which a death occurs <pause dur="0.8"/> at which at least i should say <pause dur="2.3"/> one death occurs <pause dur="7.2"/> okay and that's one death occurs in either group <pause dur="4.8"/> what we do is we <pause dur="0.2"/> <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="7"/> form <pause dur="1.8"/> a two by two <pause dur="0.3"/> table <pause dur="3.4"/> okay i mean in reality we don't form the whole table but that's what we're doing conceptually <pause dur="1.7"/> and what does that table look like <pause dur="2.2"/> <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="6"/> died <pause dur="2.6"/> not dead <pause dur="12.0"/> <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="7"/> group one <pause dur="2.9"/> group two <pause dur="3.2"/> and i'm <pause dur="0.2"/> probably going to swap to a yeah i'm going to swap to a shorthand notion <pause dur="0.6"/> drop the T so let's just make that <pause dur="0.5"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="1"/> D-one-I <pause dur="1.1"/> which 
can of course now be zero because just 'cause somebody's died in group one they don't have to have died in group <pause dur="0.2"/> two <pause dur="0.2"/> as i showed <pause dur="1.2"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="13"/> D-one-I D-two-I <pause dur="1.6"/> and this is total <pause dur="1.8"/> at risk at that point so <pause dur="1.6"/> N-<pause dur="0.3"/>one-I <pause dur="0.7"/> N-<pause dur="0.3"/>two-I <pause dur="12.5"/> two by two tables you've seen before <pause dur="0.8"/> and the standard way of dealing with those is look <pause dur="0.4"/> doing an observed minus expected comparison <pause dur="0.8"/> so <pause dur="2.5"/> the <pause dur="0.4"/> expected <pause dur="3.7"/> number <pause dur="2.2"/> of deaths <pause dur="2.6"/> in <pause dur="2.5"/> group <pause dur="1.5"/> one <pause dur="0.3"/> at time I <pause dur="6.0"/> <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="50"/> is <pause dur="2.1"/> expected value of the random variable <pause dur="0.5"/> D-one-I <pause dur="1.4"/> we will put down as <pause dur="1.0"/> N-one-I <pause dur="1.6"/> N-one-I plus <pause dur="0.6"/> N-two-I <pause dur="1.5"/> times the total number of deaths that occur <pause dur="0.4"/> at that particular point <pause dur="10.1"/> okay that's nothing new to probably <pause dur="2.2"/> first year <pause dur="3.2"/> what i'm not sure is whether you're going to remember the variance expression for that <pause dur="2.9"/> anybody remember the variance <pause dur="9.5"/> <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="4"/> might just

that's why we tend to use Z <pause dur="0.2"/> compared <pause dur="2.7"/> to the standard normal <pause dur="9.7"/> there's another way in which it's quite commonly done <pause dur="1.0"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="19"/> alternatively <pause dur="6.4"/> Z-squared <pause dur="2.3"/> in other words something that's <pause dur="1.4"/> obviously looks like a chi-squared term <pause dur="0.9"/> O-minus-E squared <pause dur="1.8"/> over V <pause dur="1.8"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="4"/> is compared to a <pause dur="0.8"/> chi-squared on one <pause dur="0.2"/> degree of freedom <pause dur="2.2"/> and there's a reason for mentioning <pause dur="0.3"/> that </u><gap reason="break in recording" extent="uncertain"/> <u who="nf0955" trans="pause"> it's not immediately obvious how we're going to generalize a two by two table which is quite a nice thing to say a two by three table <pause dur="1.4"/> which is why one can think of a simpler version <pause dur="0.7"/> than the log-rank <pause dur="0.7"/> the log-rank is what you would use if you've only got two groups <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="10"/> but if you want to think about a generalization <pause dur="1.3"/> alternatively <pause dur="2.3"/> we can <pause dur="0.7"/> use <pause dur="2.5"/> and as i don't use this very often i definitely don't remember it <pause dur="0.8"/> we use something that requires us <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="15"/> to think about E-two <pause dur="1.3"/>
