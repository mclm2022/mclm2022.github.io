<u who="nm0919"> well good morning everybody # just to start off <pause dur="0.7"/> just like to remind you of the misprint <pause dur="1.5"/> we had in the # <pause dur="0.2"/> on the notes on bottom of page eight <pause dur="0.6"/> equation four-seven <pause dur="1.2"/> when we're doing the fit to the exponential-Y-A exponential-K-X <pause dur="0.8"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="1:26"/> what we do is we transform it by taking natural logs of each side <pause dur="0.6"/> which is log-Y is log-A <pause dur="1.0"/> and i put <trunc>l</trunc> Ls so that L-Ns of E to remind ourselves it's logs to the base E <pause dur="1.7"/> log-A plus K-X i think there was a log in there by mistake <pause dur="0.7"/> and therefore if we plot # of the individual data points Y-I and X-I those <pause dur="0.7"/> pairs if we plot the log of Y-I against X-I <pause dur="0.6"/> then if this is a reasonable <pause dur="0.7"/> law <pause dur="0.5"/> we would expect it to be something like a straight line the gradient would be K <pause dur="0.4"/> and the intercept would give us an idea of <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> log-A <pause dur="0.8"/> in which case we can take the <trunc>l</trunc> <pause dur="0.5"/> antilog and get <pause dur="0.2"/> A <pause dur="0.9"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> just <pause dur="0.9"/> realize <pause dur="0.2"/> what might have been the confusion last year if we had a power law which could also be a <pause dur="0.3"/> quite a reasonable behaviour <pause dur="0.4"/> for some transducer <pause dur="0.4"/> say Y equals A-X-to-the-K now instead of 
E-to-the-<pause dur="0.3"/>X <pause dur="0.8"/> in this case <pause dur="0.4"/> obviously when we take logs we get log-Y <pause dur="0.4"/> is log-A and this time it is of course plus K-log-X <pause dur="0.5"/> and in this case one # would indeed plot log-Y <pause dur="0.2"/> against log-<pause dur="0.5"/>X-I <pause dur="1.7"/> that should be X-I i suppose for each individual data point <pause dur="0.5"/> K would be now the gradient <pause dur="0.3"/> which exponent the the power law here <pause dur="0.4"/> and log-A <pause dur="0.5"/> the intercept so hopefully <pause dur="0.5"/> if you could correct your <pause dur="0.4"/> written copy there <pause dur="0.3"/> from that misprint <pause dur="1.7"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> next week is # <pause dur="0.5"/> week four <pause dur="1.1"/> or is it week five </u><pause dur="0.2"/> <u who="ss" trans="pause"> week five </u><u who="nm0919" trans="overlap"> week five yes it's week four this week isn't it yes <pause dur="0.3"/> next week is week five thank you <pause dur="0.7"/> and # <pause dur="1.8"/> this is week four <pause dur="0.8"/> so there's no lecture next Thursday <pause dur="0.6"/> i'm actually <pause dur="0.6"/> not in Canada next Thursday i actually arrive <pause dur="0.4"/> back from Canada at about <pause dur="0.2"/> seven-thirty A-M <pause dur="1.0"/> so # <pause dur="0.3"/> i <trunc>m</trunc> thought i might not be tremendously alert <pause dur="0.3"/> so we won't have a lecture next Thursday <pause dur="0.5"/> but what will occur next week since the lab is going to start in week six <pause dur="0.3"/> will be for the three groups <pause dur="0.2"/> who you know you are <pause dur="0.5"/> you will have your lab briefing <pause dur="1.1"/> # next 
week before the week in week five before the labs start proper week six seven eight nine ten okay five weeks <pause dur="0.4"/> Tuesday ten A-M Thursday ten A-M <pause dur="0.5"/> and Friday for the easy people i'm not quite sure <pause dur="0.9"/> presume you know what time it is yeah <pause dur="1.2"/> right <pause dur="0.4"/> and then so next week i will be # recovering from my jet lag in the morning <pause dur="0.5"/> and we'll then have some lectures on <pause dur="0.3"/> twenty-second of Feb <pause dur="0.6"/> and the first of March okay <pause dur="1.6"/> right let me now we'll go through we've got quite a few of these problems to go through so let's go through those <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> take a <trunc>c</trunc> <pause dur="0.9"/> couple of minutes now to hand these out i'm afraid <trunc>lo</trunc> <gap reason="name" extent="2 words"/> <pause dur="0.8"/> sorry <trunc>tho</trunc> those of you who are wondering what's going on # <pause dur="0.6"/> if you want some <pause dur="0.2"/> cut on the fee you'll have to see my agent okay <pause dur="0.7"/> for this # <pause dur="0.2"/> sorry the last few minutes hasn't been terribly interesting television has it <pause dur="0.5"/> <gap reason="name" extent="2 words"/> <gap reason="name" extent="2 words"/> anybody <pause dur="0.5"/> <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> <pause dur="0.4"/><gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> no okay <pause dur="0.8"/> let me also while we're doing that hand out this attendance sheet <pause dur="1.4"/> okay so let's just quickly have a look at these # particular aspects and # <pause dur="0.5"/> if you remember the first part of this question <pause dur="0.6"/> is to do with # <pause dur="1.5"/> 
if i can find the # <pause dur="0.2"/> particular sheet i'm looking for <pause dur="0.9"/> is to do with # <pause dur="0.2"/> yes # <pause dur="1.6"/> we have # <pause dur="3.7"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="1:30"/> twenty-five measurements we have T-bar <pause dur="1.3"/> # plus-or-minus sigma <pause dur="0.8"/> and we're told that that is five-point-five <pause dur="0.2"/> degrees centigrade <pause dur="0.6"/> and the standard deviation <pause dur="1.8"/> is equal to one degree centigrade <pause dur="0.4"/> so that means that our distribution looks something like this <pause dur="0.4"/> this is five degrees <pause dur="0.5"/> and sixty-eight per cent <pause dur="0.5"/> of our values are within one degree <pause dur="0.4"/> and so the standard error <pause dur="1.9"/> which is how accurately we can work out this <pause dur="0.2"/> bit at the top there <pause dur="0.5"/> is obviously equal to sigma <pause dur="0.7"/> which is the standard deviation divided by root-N <pause dur="0.4"/> and we have N is twenty-five <pause dur="0.6"/> 'cause there are actually twenty-five readings in this frequency diagram against the temperature <pause dur="1.5"/> that's T-bar <pause dur="1.3"/> and so it's obviously not a smooth curve it's a bit of a histogram <pause dur="0.3"/> and therefore that is # root of twenty-five is five <pause dur="0.4"/> so the standard <pause dur="0.2"/> deviation standard error i should say <pause dur="0.3"/> is plus-or-minus # <pause dur="0.3"/> <trunc>fi</trunc> # <pause dur="0.2"/> one <pause dur="0.4"/> over five-<pause dur="0.4"/>point-two degrees 
centigrade <pause dur="0.5"/> so we could say that the value of T <pause dur="0.7"/> is <pause dur="0.2"/> is equal to five <pause dur="0.4"/> plus-or-minus nought-point-two degrees centigrade with N equals twenty-five <pause dur="1.8"/> and we would expect sixty-eight per cent <pause dur="0.2"/> with to be within one standard <pause dur="0.3"/> deviation of these twenty-five values <pause dur="0.4"/> and what are the assumptions we've made <pause dur="0.3"/> well one or two people sort of said things like oh well <pause dur="0.4"/> sort of <pause dur="1.4"/> things are pretty accurate and people have been rather careful that's not the the <trunc>as</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> i mean if you were not accurate and you were not careful <pause dur="0.4"/> then this <trunc>sord</trunc> it'd just be a broader wouldn't it you'd have a bigger standard deviation <pause dur="0.4"/> so the assumptions that you've made <pause dur="0.3"/> are two basically <pause dur="0.3"/> one is that there are no systematic errors <pause dur="0.6"/> it's all random <pause dur="3.5"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="21"/> in other words <pause dur="0.5"/> it's not as if the the mean is up here and they're all shifted there's no systematic errors <pause dur="1.2"/> and <trunc>th</trunc> that the errors are normally distributed <pause dur="1.9"/> in other words they obey this Gaussian curve those are the two <pause dur="1.0"/> # normal distribution of errors <pause dur="0.5"/> okay <pause dur="0.7"/> 
those are the two assumptions <pause dur="0.4"/> and all this business about that everyone's been a bit accurate and you haven't been too careful <pause dur="0.5"/> that's all in here if you weren't very accurate and there was <trunc>m</trunc> <pause dur="0.5"/> more spread that would just come through on the standard deviation wouldn't it <pause dur="0.5"/> so let's just go through this a little bit i've been doing a little bit of <trunc>re</trunc> research as i indicated i would over the weekend <pause dur="0.8"/> so here we have our situation <pause dur="1.9"/> frequency of <pause dur="1.1"/> time <trunc>w</trunc> of of # numbers of # values of X <pause dur="0.5"/> this is our mean <pause dur="0.8"/> and they're spread in this bell-shape curve sixty-eight per cent of them <pause dur="0.4"/> should be in within sigma what we call the standard deviation <pause dur="0.5"/> and of course as we get more and more and this gets smoother and smoother <pause dur="0.4"/> we can tell where the peak is better and better <pause dur="0.5"/> that's my <pause dur="0.3"/> standard error in the estimate S-M and that's sigma <pause dur="0.4"/> divided by root-N <pause dur="0.9"/> so the standard deviation doesn't <pause dur="0.4"/> matter really how many <pause dur="0.2"/> readings you have <pause dur="1.1"/> # but as you get more and more you should be <trunc>s</trunc> define the peak 
better and better so anyway i've done then a little bit of research here 'cause as i was indicating <pause dur="1.4"/> last week <pause dur="1.1"/> # <pause dur="1.3"/> there's a slight problem in my opinion anyway in the # nomenclature here when you look at these two terms they're not self-explanatory <pause dur="0.6"/> and i promised you i'd do a bit of research on this so i've asked one or two i was at an international meeting <pause dur="1.0"/> # on <trunc>m</trunc> in London on Monday so i asked the Italian people what the Italian terms were to see if they were <pause dur="0.5"/> any more self-explanatory and this was absolutely hopeless <pause dur="0.8"/> because <pause dur="0.5"/> the Italian for standard deviation is <distinct lang="it">deviazione standard</distinct> <pause dur="0.4"/> and the Italian for standard error is <distinct lang="it">errore standard</distinct> so those are not very much better <pause dur="0.7"/> however the French term is much better <pause dur="1.5"/> the French term for mean is <distinct lang="fr">moyenne</distinct> <pause dur="0.6"/> and for standard deviation is <distinct lang="fr">écart type</distinct> <pause dur="0.4"/> so <distinct lang="fr">écart</distinct> actually means a sort of spreading out typical so it's a typical spreading out <pause dur="0.8"/> so that's quite a <pause dur="0.8"/> i'm sure you'll agree that's a very 
logical term <pause dur="0.5"/> and nobody as yet i've raised this with several people has been able to tell me <pause dur="0.3"/> got a few e-mails on the go <pause dur="0.7"/> what the word for standard error is and have you have you managed to <pause dur="0.2"/> find this out </u><u who="sm0920" trans="latching"> no i haven't </u><pause dur="0.7"/> <u who="nm0919" trans="pause"> i asked a few people <pause dur="0.2"/> when i was <pause dur="0.2"/> at a <pause dur="0.4"/> dinner in Paris and they <pause dur="0.2"/> gave me some funny looks <pause dur="0.3"/> when i raised it and started talking about something else <pause dur="1.6"/> right <pause dur="0.3"/> what about the German term <pause dur="1.0"/> now the German for average is quite good i think it's <distinct lang="de">durchschnitt</distinct> <pause dur="1.2"/> <distinct lang="de">durch</distinct> <pause dur="0.3"/> means # <pause dur="0.2"/> through # cut through <pause dur="0.7"/> right <pause dur="0.6"/> so it's a cut through the middle <pause dur="1.1"/> and then the next term is <trunc>s</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> standard <pause dur="0.2"/> <distinct lang="de">abweichnung</distinct> <pause dur="0.9"/> okay <pause dur="0.8"/> which means again deviation or divergence i'm afraid doesn't it and then i asked these people that at were <pause dur="0.2"/> big statisticians and all they could come up with for standard error was <pause dur="0.4"/> <distinct lang="de">normalisiert abweichnung</distinct> well i don't think that's right actually <pause dur="0.6"/> 'cause i think the <distinct lang="de">normalisiert abweichnung</distinct> is sometimes you express a standard <pause dur="0.4"/> a fractional standard devation <pause dur="0.5"/> in 
other words what's the fraction of sigma-<pause dur="0.4"/>over-X you know if X was ten centimetres <pause dur="0.5"/> and this is standard deviation is one you could say the fractional standard deviation <pause dur="0.9"/> <trunc>i</trunc> is is ten per cent <pause dur="0.4"/> which i think would be this <distinct lang="de">normalisiert</distinct> one <pause dur="1.1"/> and nobody could tell me this one either so obviously # <pause dur="0.2"/> it's an international problem <pause dur="0.7"/> what to call this thing <pause dur="1.9"/> 
right let's go on to the # next one <pause dur="0.7"/> okay <pause dur="0.9"/> and in the next one number two here <pause dur="2.4"/> we have that the area <pause dur="1.5"/> equals <trunc>pi-R-squa</trunc> one person actually managed to get that wrong <pause dur="0.5"/> pi-R-squared <pause dur="1.1"/> and R D or equals to <pause dur="0.4"/> pi-D-squared over four if you like and D <pause dur="0.5"/> apparently is equal to twenty centimetres <pause dur="0.7"/> plus-or-minus point-one centimetre <pause dur="2.2"/> # <pause dur="1.6"/> right <pause dur="0.9"/> that's what it says here which is one part <pause dur="0.3"/> one in two-hundred <pause dur="2.3"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="20"/> that error <pause dur="4.8"/> right so # <pause dur="0.8"/> well we know what the error is it's # <pause dur="1.5"/> a hundred-pi <pause dur="0.5"/> that's twenty metres squared <pause dur="0.4"/> sorry we know what the area itself is <pause dur="2.4"/> which is three-hundred-and-fourteen <pause dur="0.3"/> <trunc>s</trunc> square centimetres so the question 
now is what's the # error in that <pause dur="2.0"/> and at this stage # we realize here we've got a formula of the form Z <pause dur="0.6"/> it's a product isn't it here <pause dur="1.1"/> in that # # my R is <pause dur="0.2"/> squared <pause dur="0.2"/> so the problem is if i've got an error in R and i square it what happens to the error in R-squared <pause dur="1.2"/> and # <pause dur="0.2"/> basically <pause dur="1.1"/> well <pause dur="0.5"/> what i'm going to do now actually <pause dur="0.5"/> i presented these formula before <pause dur="0.5"/> # for combination of errors when you had a product or a square or a power as you've got here <pause dur="0.8"/> just # as # <pause dur="2.0"/> out of the hat so to speak <pause dur="0.4"/> so let's actually just do <pause dur="0.3"/> these things properly <pause dur="0.4"/> which just involves a little bit of calculus <pause dur="0.5"/> and is also what is required <pause dur="0.7"/> for question three <pause dur="0.7"/> of the long problems that i'll hand out in a few minutes okay <pause dur="0.4"/> so <pause dur="1.9"/> right let's just <pause dur="0.6"/> go through these errors a little bit more formally <pause dur="1.4"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="2"/> and those <pause dur="0.5"/> formula that are just <pause dur="0.2"/> quoted on the sheet let's just see where they come from <pause dur="0.7"/> and let's just have the formula Z <pause dur="0.3"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="8"/> i'm going to derive <pause dur="0.4"/> from A a constant time some<pause dur="0.9"/>thing i measure called X <pause dur="0.5"/> and something 
i measure called Y which could also be married by B <pause dur="0.7"/> and i'm interested in let's suppose there's an <pause dur="0.5"/> so what's <trunc>i</trunc> the first thing is what's the effect <pause dur="1.2"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="1:12"/> on Z <pause dur="0.6"/> of an error <pause dur="1.3"/> D-X <pause dur="0.7"/> okay <pause dur="0.3"/> well i can work that out by differentiating if i just differentiate this with respect to X and i get D-Z D-partial <pause dur="0.5"/> D-X <pause dur="0.5"/> which means that means differentiate keeping <pause dur="1.6"/> keep Y constant when you do this <pause dur="0.9"/> okay <pause dur="0.4"/> because i'm only interested in the effect of the error on X <pause dur="0.5"/> so this is a constant <pause dur="0.4"/> and that is of course equal to # A <pause dur="1.3"/> and similarly <pause dur="1.5"/> the effect <pause dur="1.3"/> well i could do the same thing here <pause dur="0.5"/> on Z <pause dur="0.7"/> of an error <pause dur="1.6"/> D-Y <pause dur="0.4"/> if X is constant <pause dur="0.9"/> right <pause dur="0.6"/> and that of course is D-Z <pause dur="0.5"/> D-Y is lo and behold equal to B <pause dur="0.5"/> right <pause dur="2.6"/> in other words i've got my error <pause dur="0.3"/> one <pause dur="0.6"/> shall we call it D-Z here <pause dur="0.5"/> is equal to A-D-X <pause dur="0.6"/> and the error two <pause dur="1.3"/> D-Z <pause dur="0.5"/> is equal to B-D-Y <pause dur="0.7"/> okay now we make the # assumption <pause dur="1.0"/> that # supposing # <pause dur="0.3"/> if it's true <pause dur="0.2"/> that the errors in X and Y are independent <pause dur="0.8"/> then if one is high the other can be low et cetera et cetera <pause dur="0.4"/> then 
these two <pause dur="0.3"/> error terms don't add up algebraically <pause dur="0.4"/> they add up as the sums of the squares don't they <pause dur="0.2"/> okay <pause dur="1.9"/> so # <pause dur="1.1"/> whoops that's not too good <pause dur="0.8"/> the # <pause dur="0.9"/> so we're now going to have these two error terms <pause dur="3.8"/> that's not much better either <pause dur="1.7"/> error one and error two <pause dur="3.3"/> ah <pause dur="1.8"/> we'll go back to this one i think for the moment <pause dur="1.8"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="36"/> error <pause dur="0.6"/> one <pause dur="0.2"/> and error two <pause dur="0.9"/> are independent <pause dur="4.9"/> therefore total-error-squared <pause dur="2.3"/> equals error-one-squared <pause dur="2.3"/> plus <trunc>error-two-squa</trunc> you can see what's coming here can't you <pause dur="1.0"/> two-squared and therefore <pause dur="0.8"/> D-Z-<pause dur="0.8"/>squared <pause dur="0.3"/> equals A-<pause dur="1.8"/>D-X-squared <pause dur="0.8"/> plus B-<pause dur="0.8"/>D-Y-squared okay <pause dur="2.6"/> that's the first formula <pause dur="0.7"/> right <pause dur="0.9"/> now we can now go on to the second one <pause dur="0.3"/> which i'll do under here <pause dur="2.8"/> and this is a slightly more # complicated one <pause dur="0.2"/> # let's write up here <pause dur="0.6"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="9"/> Z <pause dur="0.6"/> equals # A <pause dur="0.4"/> which A is a constant <pause dur="0.7"/> X-<pause dur="0.2"/>to-the-alpha <pause dur="0.2"/> Y-<pause dur="0.5"/>to-the-beta <pause dur="1.1"/> so this is the general term now where we have a product <pause dur="0.4"/> of two terms there could be an X-variable and a Y-variable <pause dur="0.9"/> raised perhaps to some term alpha and beta <pause dur="0.5"/> or there could be just one of 
those which is the situation we've got there isn't it right <pause dur="0.4"/> where alpha is two <pause dur="0.8"/> and now we're going to do exactly the same thing <pause dur="0.6"/> right <pause dur="1.3"/> we're going to do D-Z D-X we're going to find the error due to the error <pause dur="0.2"/> error in Z due to X <pause dur="0.5"/> and error in X <pause dur="1.3"/> and the error due to an error in Y okay <pause dur="0.5"/> so we do the partials again here D-Z <pause dur="1.3"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="55"/> how does <trunc>e</trunc> Z change if there's a change in X <pause dur="0.2"/> keeping Y constant <pause dur="0.6"/> well that's A and then X-to-the-alpha goes as <trunc>al</trunc> X-<pause dur="0.6"/>alpha-minus-one <pause dur="2.2"/> Y-<pause dur="0.9"/>B <pause dur="0.9"/> and let's write that as <pause dur="0.2"/> A-<pause dur="0.2"/>alpha-X <pause dur="0.2"/> over X i haven't done very much there Y-<pause dur="0.5"/>to-the-B <pause dur="1.0"/> except i now realize i'm back where i started with X-A <pause dur="0.2"/> X-S <pause dur="0.4"/> this thing here <pause dur="1.5"/> X <pause dur="0.2"/> whoops X-to-the-alpha <pause dur="0.9"/> Y-to-the-beta <pause dur="0.4"/> so what i've got there therefore <pause dur="0.3"/> is alpha-<pause dur="0.2"/>Z <pause dur="0.7"/> over <pause dur="0.2"/> X <pause dur="0.5"/> okay <pause dur="0.7"/> in other words D-Z-one <pause dur="1.5"/> error one <pause dur="1.0"/> is equal to # <pause dur="0.5"/> alpha-Z-<pause dur="2.3"/>D-X <pause dur="0.3"/> over X <pause dur="0.6"/> there's my fractional error coming in can you see <pause dur="0.5"/> that's why it's a fractional error in this term <pause dur="0.4"/> when these two are multiplied okay <pause dur="0.8"/> and i've actually # so that's my 
error there straight away <pause dur="0.3"/> and in fact this is the one i want <pause dur="0.2"/> over here isn't it i could do this one now <pause dur="0.4"/> straight away <pause dur="1.9"/> if there's only an error in X term here <pause dur="0.2"/> then i've got that the error D <pause dur="0.3"/> # error in A the fractional error in A <pause dur="0.6"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="38"/> is equal to twice <pause dur="0.4"/> the fractional error in D shall we say or # <pause dur="0.9"/> B-B over D <pause dur="0.2"/> okay <pause dur="2.3"/> so <pause dur="0.4"/> D-D the error <pause dur="0.3"/> in D <pause dur="1.9"/> is one part in two-hundred <pause dur="0.8"/> so the error in A is worse <pause dur="1.2"/> it's twice as bad 'cause we've squared it okay <pause dur="0.3"/> so it's one in one-hundred <pause dur="0.9"/> so i can say my area <pause dur="1.1"/> is equal to three-hundred-and-fourteen <pause dur="0.2"/> square centimetres <pause dur="0.4"/> plus-or-minus three-point-<pause dur="0.6"/>one <pause dur="0.2"/> square <pause dur="0.6"/> centimetres <pause dur="1.8"/> okay <pause dur="4.4"/> # <pause dur="1.2"/> the point about it as you'll see when you get to question three on the other sheet <pause dur="0.7"/> is that i gave you some special formulae these two here <pause dur="0.2"/> we haven't quite finished this one yet <pause dur="0.8"/> but in question three on the second sheet we have a slightly different arrangement don't we <pause dur="0.5"/> for the # <pause dur="0.5"/> platinum resistance thermometer <pause dur="0.7"/> so if you understand what we're doing here no let's so that's <pause dur="0.3"/> 
this is the <pause dur="0.2"/> now let's next one oh good this one works <pause dur="0.4"/> D-Z D-Y we'll do now <pause dur="0.9"/> what's the error change in Z <pause dur="0.4"/> for a change in Y <pause dur="0.5"/> okay <pause dur="0.6"/> and that is # A-X-to-the-alpha 'cause that's constant for the moment <pause dur="0.4"/> beta-<pause dur="0.3"/>Y-to-the-beta-minus-one <pause dur="1.3"/> okay <pause dur="1.1"/> # if i can <pause dur="0.7"/> i can now write this as A-X-to-the-alpha-Y # <pause dur="0.8"/> we'll have a beta out here <pause dur="0.5"/> Y-to-the-beta <pause dur="0.5"/> over Y and i realize this thing here is what i started with Z <pause dur="0.5"/> so the <pause dur="0.4"/> D-Z error two if you like <pause dur="0.6"/> the second error term due to a change in Y <pause dur="0.6"/> 'cause X and Y can have errors on <pause dur="0.4"/> is now beta <pause dur="1.4"/> # <pause dur="3.6"/> and i'll i'll bring the Y over here Z <pause dur="0.2"/> D-Y <pause dur="0.3"/> over Y 'cause there's a Y under there 'cause i've had to put a Y back in because i lost a Y when i differentiated the beta-minus-one you see that's where the Y underneath comes from <pause dur="1.9"/> okay so now <pause dur="0.2"/> if these are independent <pause dur="3.9"/> 
in other words <pause dur="0.5"/> if <pause dur="2.0"/> usual thing if Y goes high with an error or <pause dur="0.3"/> high there's no reason for X to have a high error <pause dur="0.3"/> they're totally independent <pause dur="1.7"/> then i can say that the total error in Z-squared <pause dur="5.3"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="56"/> is those squared is alpha-<pause dur="0.2"/>Z <pause dur="1.0"/> D-X over X <pause dur="0.8"/> all squared plus <pause dur="0.5"/> beta-<pause dur="0.2"/>Z <pause dur="0.6"/> D-Y over Y <pause dur="0.4"/> all squared <pause dur="0.6"/> and therefore i could write this bring i'll take the Zs out here <pause dur="0.3"/> and therefore D-Z over Z <pause dur="1.2"/> all squared is equal to alpha-<pause dur="0.4"/>D-X over X all squared that's the <pause dur="0.2"/> term we were left with there when there was only X <pause dur="0.6"/> and of course if two things squared are equal to each other we can <pause dur="1.7"/> then the things themselves are equal if A-squared equals B-squared A equals B plus <pause dur="0.5"/> we've got the other one <pause dur="0.3"/> beta <pause dur="0.2"/> if that's the power <pause dur="0.5"/> D-Y over Y <pause dur="0.6"/> all squared <pause dur="1.6"/> and the we notice here <pause dur="1.2"/> as we said before when we get these product terms involved or power law <pause dur="0.4"/> it's the fractional error that's important can you see it here <pause dur="0.5"/> D-Z over Z the 
fraction D-X over X D-Y over Y <pause dur="10.7"/> okay so # rather than producing them out of the hat as before <pause dur="1.0"/> it's little bit of calculus a nice little exercise in calculus okay <pause dur="1.0"/> just <pause dur="0.7"/> differentiating <pause dur="1.3"/> X-to-the-N is N-X minus X-to-the <pause dur="0.2"/> N-X-to-the-N-minus-one isn't it <pause dur="3.7"/> right <pause dur="4.2"/> everybody happy everybody read that yeah <pause dur="0.3"/> okay <pause dur="1.0"/> no <pause dur="1.7"/> yes no <pause dur="10.1"/> sorry <pause dur="7.1"/> shall we do number three </u><pause dur="6.3"/> <u who="sf0921" trans="pause"> excuse me </u><pause dur="0.2"/> <u who="nm0919" trans="pause"> yes </u><pause dur="0.2"/> <u who="sf0921" trans="pause"> how did you get <pause dur="0.2"/> error in A as one in one-thousand </u><pause dur="1.7"/> <u who="nm0919" trans="pause"> sorry </u><u who="sf0921" trans="latching"> <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/></u><u who="sf0922" trans="overlap"> i got the answer as twenty-two </u><pause dur="1.2"/> <u who="sf0921" trans="pause"> i got the error in B as one in two-hundred </u><pause dur="0.5"/> <u who="nm0919" trans="pause"> okay <trunc>i</trunc> what <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="33"/></u><u who="sf0921" trans="overlap"> and error in A is one in one-thousand </u><u who="nm0919" trans="latching"> oh sorry it was one in a hundred then sorry that's okay A equals pi-R-squared <pause dur="0.8"/> twice over four <pause dur="1.3"/> D-squared <pause dur="0.6"/> so D-A <pause dur="0.7"/> over A equals twice <pause dur="0.2"/> D-D <pause dur="0.6"/> over D <pause dur="0.2"/> okay <pause dur="2.4"/> this one here was one in <pause dur="0.6"/> two-hundred <pause dur="0.8"/> so this is one <pause dur="0.5"/> in one-hundred <pause dur="0.7"/> so A <pause dur="0.5"/> equals three-hundred-and-fourteen plus-or-minus three <pause dur="0.4"/> did i write one in a thousand there </u><pause dur="0.7"/> <u who="sf0923" trans="pause"> yeah </u><pause dur="0.2"/> <u who="nm0919" trans="pause"> okay so once i've done this right <pause dur="9.0"/> this is half a per cent <pause dur="1.5"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="4"/> and twice it is <pause dur="0.2"/> one per cent <pause dur="4.0"/> so the other <pause dur="0.2"/> this is the inverse isn't it of the one we did <pause dur="0.4"/> last week <pause dur="0.6"/> where we had the <trunc>t</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> the the <pause dur="0.2"/> period 
of a pendulum <pause dur="0.4"/> was proportional to L to the <trunc>h</trunc> the length to the half <pause dur="0.7"/> in which case the period to the fractional error in the period was <pause dur="0.3"/> half <pause dur="0.2"/> the error in the length <pause dur="0.6"/> here since it's length's <pause dur="0.9"/> squared it's twice <pause dur="1.0"/> just goes as the power law doesn't it <pause dur="5.4"/> well i think most people who got there got number three correct <pause dur="1.4"/> got that far <pause dur="0.6"/> it's V <pause dur="0.7"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="3"/> equals K-U-minus-C <pause dur="0.5"/> and K here this is a velocity <pause dur="0.7"/> in metres per second <pause dur="2.2"/> # K is # <pause dur="0.8"/> three-point-two volts per metre per second <pause dur="0.6"/> so no volts <pause dur="0.2"/> sorry that's a voltage in volts <pause dur="1.3"/> and C <pause dur="0.4"/> was equal to six-point-four volts <pause dur="3.4"/> and if you think about that <pause dur="0.6"/> you <trunc>ou</trunc> you've got a <pause dur="1.4"/> that means there's a a characteristic looking something like this <pause dur="0.5"/> if this is V <pause dur="2.2"/> then # it's a straight line <pause dur="0.4"/> # if we put # <pause dur="1.1"/> # <pause dur="5.9"/> so we can substitute our value in here we're also given so that # <pause dur="0.3"/> yeah this # if if U is equal this is U <pause dur="0.3"/> U equals to nought that's minus-six-point-four <pause dur="0.7"/> down there comes up here <pause dur="0.4"/> and we're interested in a point we're given the point U equals what is it <pause dur="0.6"/> 
U <trunc>e</trunc> U-I equals # <pause dur="0.3"/> ten metres per second <pause dur="0.6"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="1:10"/> and we measure a voltage I equal to twenty-six volts <pause dur="0.8"/> and if you substitute that point in there <pause dur="1.1"/> what value do you get <pause dur="0.2"/> in the formula <pause dur="1.7"/> and then whereabouts is my actual data point does it lie on that line or not <pause dur="0.4"/> and that's the residual i'm interested in <pause dur="0.4"/> so if i substitute <pause dur="3.1"/> U equals ten <pause dur="0.2"/> metres per second i get V <pause dur="0.7"/> that's the one on the line <pause dur="0.4"/> is equal to thirty-two <pause dur="0.6"/> minus six-point-four <pause dur="0.4"/> is twenty-five-point-six volts <pause dur="1.0"/> so that's the # formula <pause dur="2.9"/> which is this point here <pause dur="0.8"/> twenty-five-point-six <pause dur="0.4"/> and the actual data point is up here <pause dur="1.1"/> at twenty-six volts so the residual <pause dur="0.8"/> which is how far my data point is off the line <pause dur="0.4"/> is obviously equal to <pause dur="3.4"/> equals data point <pause dur="1.3"/> minus # <pause dur="1.1"/> # <pause dur="1.0"/> fit <pause dur="1.4"/> and that's obviously equal to twenty-six minus twenty-five-point-six equals nought-point-four volts <pause dur="0.5"/> i think everybody actually got that one right apart from the odd person who got an arithmetic # <pause dur="0.6"/> substitution # <pause dur="0.5"/> in error <pause dur="1.9"/> right so next time let's go now we've got quite a few of these 
to go through this time <pause dur="1.0"/> some more problem sheets here these are the longer ones # <pause dur="6.3"/> well i think # <pause dur="0.4"/> everybody who did question one <pause dur="0.8"/> which is really # <pause dur="2.4"/> # i don't know if i really need to go through this in all its gory detail because i think most people did get this one <pause dur="0.2"/> correct <pause dur="10.7"/> i think everybody who tackled this clearly could # <pause dur="0.5"/> work out we had these <pause dur="0.6"/> ten <trunc>val</trunc> <pause dur="1.5"/> what did i do with my # <pause dur="0.2"/> good one <pause dur="2.0"/> we had our ten values of # <pause dur="0.2"/> T <pause dur="4.8"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="20"/> 
and people most people got that T-bar was equal to ten-point-two-four <pause dur="1.2"/> degrees centigrade <pause dur="0.9"/> and that they got the standard deviation was equal to what did i get # <pause dur="0.8"/> plus-<pause dur="0.3"/>nought-point-one-five degrees centigrade <pause dur="1.1"/> okay <pause dur="1.0"/> one or two people made an error but i think i've identified that when they got the # <pause dur="0.2"/> arithmetic wrong <pause dur="2.0"/> and then # the <trunc>stan</trunc> the # standard then we also found that seven <pause dur="0.5"/> out of ten <pause dur="1.6"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="6"/> were within <pause dur="1.8"/> sigma of <pause dur="0.3"/> T-bar <pause dur="1.8"/> and that seems it's fairly reasonable and were supposed to mention there <pause dur="0.5"/> that when we had this distribution <pause dur="0.5"/> we would 
normally expect if you had ten <pause dur="1.4"/> readings here you'd expect sixty-eight per cent you'd expect seven within that so six you know <pause dur="0.3"/> seven <pause dur="0.3"/> you'd expect sixty-eight per cent so seventy is pretty good <pause dur="2.2"/> and then the next thing you had was that # the standard error <pause dur="0.9"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="20"/> was equal to nought-point-one-five over root-<pause dur="0.2"/>ten <pause dur="0.7"/> which is something like nought-<pause dur="0.3"/>point-o-five degrees centigrade <pause dur="0.6"/> so you could then say that your final error <pause dur="0.4"/> if you like <pause dur="0.4"/> is ten-point-two-four <pause dur="2.8"/> plus-or-minus nought-point-nought-five <pause dur="0.3"/> that's the standard error <pause dur="1.4"/> that's how accurately you think you've got <pause dur="0.5"/> that mean <pause dur="1.1"/> even though quite a lot most of the <pause dur="0.5"/> points are <pause dur="0.2"/> further away from that <pause dur="0.6"/> what is the assumption you've been making here <pause dur="5.1"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="2"/> and again the assumption # is not that people are being careful with the thermometer et cetera et cetera hopefully that's all in <pause dur="0.5"/> these standard errors and standard deviations <pause dur="0.3"/> the <trunc>sys</trunc> <pause dur="0.3"/> the # <sic corr="assumption">assumetion</sic> is that it's a normal distribution <pause dur="4.8"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="11"/> and that there's no 
systematic error <pause dur="3.8"/> if i was using the thermometer that was one degree out because there was a break in the # mercury <pause dur="0.5"/> then of course this would all be invalid <pause dur="0.4"/> so these are the two <pause dur="0.9"/> that they're distributed <pause dur="0.6"/> according to this bell-shape curve they're random <pause dur="0.5"/> like the property of noise <pause dur="0.7"/> and then the last question was if <pause dur="0.4"/> if you have <pause dur="0.4"/> you have an eleventh reading T is eleven-point-<pause dur="0.6"/>two degrees <pause dur="0.6"/> what do you do with it <pause dur="1.6"/> and some people sort of wrote and said whoa <pause dur="0.4"/> looks a bit far out <pause dur="1.6"/> you know this looks a bit dodgy that one it's a bit far from there <pause dur="0.5"/> i'd probably throw it <shift feature="voice" new="laugh"/>away <shift feature="voice" new="normal"/>that's not correct <pause dur="0.5"/> the correct version here is to say <pause dur="0.7"/> what is the difference of that from that and the answer it's one degree centigrade <pause dur="0.7"/> different <pause dur="1.1"/> the standard deviation is point-one-five so this is six standard deviations outside there <pause dur="0.7"/> so this is one standard deviation six is right out here <pause dur="0.7"/> we know there's a ninety-nine-point-nine-and-a-half per cent chance of everything being within 
three standard deviations <pause dur="0.6"/> so you must say if this is six standard deviations away from the mean <pause dur="0.4"/> therefore i will reject it <pause dur="0.5"/> that's correct just to see ooh it looks a bit dodgy it's a bit <pause dur="0.3"/> different from all the others <pause dur="0.2"/> is not correct <pause dur="1.3"/> the whole point is we can do this analytically <pause dur="0.4"/> okay <pause dur="2.8"/> that's what we're learning hopefully here <pause dur="1.8"/> right now we get to the rather amusing little bit number <pause dur="0.2"/> two <pause dur="0.3"/> number one <pause dur="1.6"/> most people <pause dur="0.4"/> didn't have too much bother with that one okay <pause dur="4.2"/> and i'm afraid no it wouldn't <pause dur="0.7"/> i suppose the <pause dur="0.3"/> advantage of number <pause dur="0.2"/> two <pause dur="0.8"/> is if you struggled over it and got it wrong <pause dur="1.4"/> and i <pause dur="0.3"/> and i explain or i've explained <pause dur="0.7"/> on the sheet where you got it wrong <pause dur="0.8"/> <trunc>y</trunc> you'll certainly get the message as to what the difficulty is so basically <pause dur="1.4"/> we have <pause dur="0.6"/> R equals <pause dur="0.2"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="4"/> A-<pause dur="1.0"/>exponential-<pause dur="0.2"/>B-<pause dur="0.2"/>T <pause dur="1.3"/> and what we have in this particular situation is the resistance <pause dur="0.6"/> of a <pause dur="0.5"/> thermistor yes </u><pause dur="0.2"/> <u who="sm0924" trans="pause"> would it be over T <unclear>too</unclear></u><pause dur="1.0"/> <u who="nm0919" trans="pause"> it is indeed yes thank you <pause dur="3.2"/> right <pause dur="3.7"/> okay so <pause dur="0.3"/> we're we're trying to measure temperature and we've got 
something in resistance and it's not linear <pause dur="0.7"/> okay <pause dur="1.2"/> in fact # if we plot R <pause dur="0.9"/> against T <pause dur="0.4"/> it looks something like # <pause dur="0.4"/> this <pause dur="0.9"/> if it was <pause dur="0.3"/> B-T it would look something like <pause dur="0.4"/> that <pause dur="0.4"/> so thanks very much for pointing out i've got it i've written i copied it down wrong <pause dur="2.0"/> right so the question is <pause dur="0.2"/> what is the sensitivity of the device <pause dur="3.2"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="38"/> what do we mean by sensitivity <pause dur="0.7"/> we mean what's the change in resistance <pause dur="5.8"/> for a change in temperature <pause dur="3.0"/> in other words it's going to be in ohms per K shall we say it's in <pause dur="0.2"/> K is absolute temperature there T big-T is the absolute temperature right <pause dur="1.2"/> now everybody realizes that's what's we mean <pause dur="0.9"/> but the problem is that most people <pause dur="2.7"/> have # remember <pause dur="0.9"/> a little example we did before where we had V against T <pause dur="0.5"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="30"/> and V was equal to B-T <pause dur="0.4"/> and that was a straight line through the origin <pause dur="0.6"/> so they then said the sensitivity <pause dur="2.8"/> is actually # the change in voltage here <pause dur="0.4"/> over the change in temperature <pause dur="1.1"/> and they then said that's V-over-T well 
in fact what you're interested in here clearly for a given temperature <pause dur="0.7"/> is the change in temperature <pause dur="1.1"/> resulting in a change in voltage which is the gradient <pause dur="2.0"/> okay <pause dur="0.7"/> and so you're interested in that gradient a little change in V over a little change in T <pause dur="0.4"/> and it so happens that this is a straight line through the origin <pause dur="0.4"/> so <pause dur="0.3"/> # if you actually also <pause dur="0.3"/> work out # <pause dur="0.4"/> V-<pause dur="0.4"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="35"/>-over-T <pause dur="0.3"/> you will also <pause dur="0.2"/> get the right answer <pause dur="0.2"/> for the gradient <pause dur="2.7"/> so something like # half the class here <pause dur="0.4"/> said the sensitivity is <trunc>gr</trunc> equal equal to R-<pause dur="0.4"/>over-T <pause dur="0.5"/> and as we take a point here <pause dur="0.8"/> what we're actually interested in <pause dur="0.3"/> is a change delta-T here <pause dur="1.5"/> what does that give <pause dur="0.2"/> as a change delta-R <pause dur="0.2"/> that's what we really want isn't it <pause dur="0.5"/> is D-R <pause dur="0.2"/> D-T <pause dur="1.6"/> okay <pause dur="0.5"/> now if it's linear that's constant and it's the straight line through the origin <pause dur="0.6"/> but if you then suddenly decide oh well let's say that's R-over-T <pause dur="0.8"/> what you're actually calculating the sensitivity i think everybody can see is this local gradient <pause dur="0.7"/> what most if you calculate R-over-T 
you're actually calculating that gradient <pause dur="5.0"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="2"/> which is <pause dur="0.5"/> not the same thing <pause dur="1.2"/> so if you look back at the notes when we talked about that <pause dur="0.6"/> i think we did actually say that if it's a non-linear relationship <pause dur="1.7"/> then it's <trunc>n</trunc> <pause dur="0.7"/> then this gradient you have to work out the gradient and the gradient as you can see here <pause dur="0.6"/> is changing that's because it's non-linear isn't it <pause dur="1.5"/> so as we <pause dur="0.4"/> we got different gradients here <pause dur="0.4"/> and different gradients there <pause dur="2.0"/> right so basically <pause dur="2.3"/> hopefully those who ploughed through this using the wrong values <pause dur="0.5"/> when you see that diagram you can see what you've done wrong okay <pause dur="5.7"/> right so what we actually have to do now <pause dur="1.0"/> is to differentiate this thing here <pause dur="0.9"/> in other words we have to work out D-R D-T <pause dur="2.2"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="2"/> okay and we realize that this is # <pause dur="0.6"/> we have to use the chain rule here <pause dur="1.5"/> if it was D-D-X of exponential-X <pause dur="0.2"/> we get exponential-X <pause dur="1.1"/> okay but it's exponential-B-over-T so we first of all differentiate the exponential and get what we started with <pause dur="0.7"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="5"/> which is A-<pause dur="0.5"/>exponential-<pause dur="0.6"/>B-over-T <pause dur="0.2"/> 
and then we have to differentiate what's in the exponential okay <pause dur="0.8"/> and so the D-D-T <pause dur="0.4"/> of B-over-T <pause dur="4.3"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="7"/> is equal to minus-B over T-squared <pause dur="1.4"/> so this is minus-B <pause dur="0.3"/> over T-squared and i could if i wanted write that back as minus-B over T-squared and this is <pause dur="0.5"/> back what i started with times R <pause dur="0.5"/> probably makes <pause dur="0.5"/> some people left it like that but this <pause dur="0.6"/> is a bit easier to see <pause dur="1.8"/> this looks correct doesn't it because the gradient is in fact negative okay <pause dur="0.3"/> when D # <pause dur="0.2"/> when D-T goes up <pause dur="0.2"/> okay <pause dur="0.9"/> and we increase # <pause dur="1.3"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> T when we decrease R <pause dur="1.2"/> that is negative <pause dur="3.4"/> right <pause dur="0.2"/> hopefully people <pause dur="0.2"/> if you can't follow the maths there you'd better have a word with your maths people <pause dur="0.3"/> integrating differentiating a function of a function <pause dur="1.7"/> right so at this stage now # <pause dur="0.5"/> we're asked what is the sensitivity <pause dur="0.5"/> so we have to work out <pause dur="0.2"/> D-R D-T at two temperatures <pause dur="4.9"/> so D-R <pause dur="0.8"/> D-T the first one we need to do is at # <pause dur="2.4"/> two-hundred-and-seventy-three <pause dur="0.6"/> and then we also need D-R <pause dur="0.5"/> D-T <pause dur="0.6"/> at # <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="2"/> three-hundred-and-seventy-three okay so we're 
interested in the gradient here at two-seven-three <pause dur="1.7"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="6"/> and the one down here which we think is probably a bit less at three-seven-three <pause dur="1.7"/> what i need to do also is to work out what the value of R is and if i substitute in there <pause dur="0.9"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="8"/> # # the values i get two-thousand <pause dur="0.5"/> twenty-three-thousand-<pause dur="0.4"/>and-eighty-two ohms <pause dur="1.0"/> is the value here <pause dur="1.3"/> right <pause dur="0.4"/> at <trunc>two-s</trunc> # whereas at R <trunc>th</trunc> <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="2"/> just putting A and B in with the values <pause dur="0.2"/> on the sheet <pause dur="0.8"/> leave you to do that <pause dur="0.6"/> R three-seven-three <pause dur="0.4"/> is quite a lot less it's only four-hundred-and-fifty-four ohms okay <pause dur="2.7"/> so we could put those in in <pause dur="0.8"/> green i suppose here <pause dur="0.5"/> this one down here is actually four-hundred-and-<pause dur="0.8"/>fifty-four <pause dur="0.6"/> this one up here <pause dur="0.7"/> is twenty-three-thousand <pause dur="1.6"/> so it's a big change isn't it <pause dur="1.2"/> and the question is now <pause dur="0.7"/> so by changing a hundred degrees i seem to have changed the resistance by about <pause dur="0.3"/> twenty-three-thousand ohms <pause dur="0.6"/> so it looks as if i'm going to get some rather large changes in # <pause dur="1.1"/> for a degree temperature change i'm going to get a lot of ohms change so it looks potentially as if i've got rather a good # sensitivity <pause dur="1.8"/> 
so this is equal to # <pause dur="0.3"/> B <pause dur="0.7"/> is equal to # <pause dur="0.4"/> what is B equal to four-thousand <pause dur="2.0"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="2"/> and T is equal to in this one two-seven-three <pause dur="0.5"/> so the one the value here <pause dur="0.4"/> is equal to # <pause dur="0.6"/> let's do this # <pause dur="0.2"/> this one here R which is two-three <pause dur="0.8"/> this is two-seventy-three so that's <pause dur="0.2"/> the value of the resistance twenty-three-thousand-and-eighty-two <pause dur="0.6"/> then it's B four-thousand <pause dur="0.9"/> over two-seven-three <pause dur="0.2"/> two-seven-three <pause dur="0.4"/> minus <pause dur="0.5"/> and that comes out to equal minus # <pause dur="3.5"/> one-two-three-eight <pause dur="0.3"/> ohms per K <pause dur="0.4"/> okay <pause dur="5.2"/> this is <pause dur="0.2"/> <trunc>four-thou</trunc> that's about <trunc>twen</trunc> yeah that's about a twentieth of that number right <pause dur="0.3"/> this one here <pause dur="0.6"/> what i'm doing is i'm substituting here obviously an R <pause dur="0.7"/> minus R-<pause dur="0.4"/>B over T-squared so in this case <pause dur="0.3"/> the resistance is at lot less <pause dur="0.4"/> four-five-four <pause dur="0.5"/> so i think my gradient's also going to be a <trunc>bo</trunc> lot less <pause dur="0.3"/> it's not quite in the ratio <pause dur="0.4"/> because my T is now three-seven-three-<pause dur="0.4"/>squared <pause dur="0.4"/> instead of two-seven-three <pause dur="0.8"/> and if i put those numbers you can see that one there cancels with that <pause dur="0.5"/> that goes into that it's going to be 
about ten isn't it in fact it's <pause dur="0.4"/> minus-<pause dur="0.2"/>thirteen <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="2"/> ohms per K <pause dur="4.4"/> right now the next thing i get here <pause dur="0.5"/> is what happens if <pause dur="0.2"/> A <pause dur="0.6"/> changes by one degree <pause dur="3.4"/> okay <pause dur="0.7"/> so let's have a look at this first one here A changed by one degree <pause dur="1.0"/> then this means <pause dur="0.7"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="2"/> A changes by one per cent <pause dur="0.3"/> right <pause dur="0.5"/> so what's going to happen here if A changes by one per cent <pause dur="0.5"/> is that my value of R is going to change by one per cent <pause dur="8.3"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="15"/> so R changes <pause dur="1.6"/> by <pause dur="0.3"/> one per cent <pause dur="0.2"/> of <pause dur="0.5"/> twenty-three-thousand ohms <pause dur="2.4"/> and that is going to equal therefore two-hundred-and-thirty ohms <pause dur="6.9"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="4"/> and what is that equivalent to in temperature <pause dur="0.5"/> well twelve-thirty-eight ohms <pause dur="1.5"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="16"/> is equivalent to one K <pause dur="0.5"/> so two-hundred-and-thirty ohms <pause dur="2.7"/> is equivalent to # <pause dur="0.4"/> two-hundred-and-thirty over twelve-thirty-eight <pause dur="0.6"/> which i got to be nought-point-one-eight degrees centigrade <pause dur="0.2"/> okay <pause dur="4.1"/> now you <trunc>c</trunc> you can you see that it's the A changing the R that's the big effect we've also changed D-R D-T <pause dur="0.4"/> by one part in a <pause dur="0.2"/> hundred <pause dur="0.4"/> in other words this number <pause dur="0.4"/> here <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> twelve-thirty-eight has changed 
by one per cent but that's rather a small change <pause dur="0.6"/> changing twelve-thirty-eight by one per cent <pause dur="0.9"/> the main thing is the change in the value of R <pause dur="1.0"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> giving a drift <pause dur="0.4"/> which looks like a change of temperature of point-one-eight degrees centigrade <pause dur="2.7"/> and then the last one here <pause dur="1.2"/> let's have a look at this one <pause dur="2.3"/> now R changes by <pause dur="1.9"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="30"/> one per cent <pause dur="0.2"/> of a <pause dur="0.2"/> four-hundred-and-fifty-four <pause dur="1.4"/> and that to my reckoning is four-point-five ohms <pause dur="1.7"/> and we've got thirteen ohms is <trunc>e</trunc> equivalent to one K <pause dur="0.4"/> so four-point-five ohms here <pause dur="0.6"/> is equal to # <pause dur="1.0"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> four-point-five over thirteen <pause dur="0.4"/> and that's actually almost <pause dur="0.2"/> it's a it's a little bit worse isn't it it's about a <trunc>quar</trunc> a third that <pause dur="4.4"/> okay so basically <pause dur="0.3"/> this region here <pause dur="1.2"/> at the lower temperature with the higher resistance and the steeper slope it's more sensitive <pause dur="0.8"/> and less sensitive at the higher <pause dur="0.2"/> temperatures <pause dur="0.8"/> i think you can see here that allegedly if you # <pause dur="0.7"/> you know if you had an ohmeter <pause dur="0.9"/> that read to an ohm here <pause dur="0.6"/> then you might think you'd be able to measure <pause dur="0.3"/> this 
temperature that's a resolution problem isn't it <pause dur="0.4"/> suppose i could <trunc>reme</trunc> measure a change of one ohm <pause dur="0.7"/> i might say to myself oh i can measure the temperature to a thousandth of a degree K <pause dur="0.8"/> 'cause that's the resolution of the instrument <pause dur="0.5"/> but in fact suppose A due to ageing and this is what happens it changes by one per cent <pause dur="0.8"/> and the fact i can resolve these ohms to one ohm one part in a thousand <pause dur="0.6"/> doesn't really tell me <pause dur="0.4"/> it's just like having a voltmeter and putting a few more extra decimal places at the end <pause dur="0.6"/> that doesn't mean to say i might have got a more accurate instrument <pause dur="0.4"/> might have more resolution <pause dur="0.6"/> but supposing that A is changing as the thing ages from month to month <pause dur="0.6"/> then that's my limit there <pause dur="0.5"/> rather than just saying i can measure ohms incredibly accurately <pause dur="1.1"/> it's a difference between resolution <pause dur="0.5"/> and accuracy <pause dur="3.0"/> right let's take a little bit of a break then <pause dur="0.4"/> now <pause dur="0.8"/> hopefully # <pause dur="0.6"/> having tried these and struggled with them going through them <pause dur="0.5"/> is helping you to follow a little bit what's going on
