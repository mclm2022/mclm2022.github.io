<u who="nm0925"> okay <pause dur="1.1"/> # <pause dur="1.9"/> problem sheet four i wanted to say a word or two about problem sheet four <pause dur="0.2"/> which # <pause dur="0.3"/> # i guess <pause dur="0.2"/> you had back the other week <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> i had <pause dur="1.2"/> vibrations from people that # <pause dur="0.5"/> # people were a bit shocked at the marks <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> and there was # <pause dur="0.2"/> a very straightforward reason why the marks on that sheet <pause dur="0.3"/> were somewhat lower than the marks on the earlier ones <pause dur="0.6"/> and the reason was <pause dur="0.4"/> that nearly not quite but very nearly all of you <pause dur="0.4"/> got in a mess with signs <pause dur="0.7"/> and the result was that # <pause dur="0.3"/> # one way or another you nearly all <pause dur="0.3"/> not quite all but nearly all got <pause dur="0.3"/> incorrect answers because somewhere along the line <pause dur="0.3"/> you'd got into a mess with signs <pause dur="0.8"/> and i'm afraid i did mark it harshly because i think it's quite important to make the point <pause dur="0.5"/> that we're now at a stage where signs matter <pause dur="0.4"/> they're not just a sort of frill that we add on at the end of a calculation <pause dur="0.3"/> you've actually got to keep track of the signs as you go through it <pause dur="0.3"/> otherwise <pause dur="0.2"/> you'll get a silly answer <pause dur="0.7"/> so i i want to just remind you of a couple of points which 
will come in again and again in <pause dur="0.4"/> # later problems <pause dur="0.3"/> # to do with getting signs right i suspect these calculations <pause dur="0.3"/> involving thermal wind shear <pause dur="0.5"/> are amongst the most awkward <pause dur="0.6"/> or have the most potential <pause dur="0.4"/> for getting signs wrong <pause dur="0.3"/> but the same goes for other calculations you'll do <pause dur="0.7"/> first thing to remind you is <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> that # in nearly all these problems <pause dur="0.3"/> you do best if you break the wind down into <pause dur="0.3"/> components <pause dur="0.6"/> so let me just remind you of <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="2"/> the usual convention that we use <pause dur="0.4"/> we imagine an X axis which points from the west to the east <pause dur="0.7"/> a Y axis that points from the south to the north <pause dur="0.8"/> and if you are told <pause dur="0.7"/> that there is a wind of particular magnitude <pause dur="1.8"/> shall we call it U <pause dur="1.7"/> with a particular direction and there's various ways of measuring that direction <pause dur="0.3"/> the meteorologists <pause dur="0.4"/> talk about the direction from which the wind blows and they measure the angle from true north <pause dur="0.4"/> the <pause dur="0.2"/> # mathematicians and this is probably the convention i will stick to <pause dur="0.3"/> will measure the angle of the wind vector <pause dur="0.2"/> from the X axis in the anticlockwise sense so if we have <pause dur="0.5"/> theta there <pause dur="0.3"/> which describes the <pause dur="0.3"/> # direction of the wind vector <pause dur="0.4"/> then 
we have two components <pause dur="0.6"/> we have a component along the X axis which i'll call <pause dur="0.3"/> little-U <pause dur="0.6"/> and little-U is big-U <pause dur="0.4"/> times <pause dur="0.4"/> the cosine <pause dur="0.2"/> of that angle theta <pause dur="1.1"/> and then we have <pause dur="0.3"/> a component <pause dur="0.3"/> parallel to the <pause dur="0.3"/> Y axis i call that little-V <pause dur="0.4"/> and little-V is capital-U <pause dur="0.2"/> times <pause dur="0.3"/> the <pause dur="0.2"/> sine <pause dur="0.2"/> of theta <pause dur="1.2"/> now <pause dur="1.0"/> the way i've drawn it there it's easy because <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> both U and V are positive <pause dur="0.9"/> if the wind vector points into these various other quadrants then different signs apply <pause dur="0.5"/> so here <pause dur="0.2"/> we have both U-positive <pause dur="0.8"/> and V-positive <pause dur="1.9"/> if the wind vector was down in this quadrant <pause dur="1.2"/> then of course U <pause dur="0.3"/> would be still positive but in this case V would be directed down the negative Y axis so <pause dur="0.4"/> V would be negative <pause dur="1.3"/> similarly if the wind vector turned up in this <pause dur="0.2"/> quadrant here <pause dur="0.4"/> we'd have U-negative <pause dur="0.4"/> and V-<pause dur="0.2"/>positive still <pause dur="0.3"/> down here both U and V would be negative <pause dur="1.0"/> always worth drawing a sketch like that <pause dur="0.3"/> so that when you've done the calculation you can just check that the signs <pause dur="0.5"/> check out against that diagram <pause dur="1.4"/> if you're using a calculator to 
calculate the # vectors <pause dur="0.8"/> then <pause dur="0.4"/> strictly you should automatically get the signs right if you've got this angle theta and you put in an angle of <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> two-hundred-and-eighty degrees or something like that it should automatically <pause dur="0.3"/> take care of the signs <pause dur="0.4"/> provided you've got your calculator set up right <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> but even so it's a very good idea when you're doing these calculations not just to blindly trust that you've got the signs right <pause dur="0.4"/> but at each stage <pause dur="0.3"/> to check things and a diagram is often the # easy way of doing that <pause dur="2.4"/> so that's getting the wind components right and many of you fell over at that stage because you just said well you just call U and V positive no matter which quadrant the wind vector was pointing into <pause dur="1.2"/> the other <pause dur="0.7"/> bit where <pause dur="0.3"/> people went wrong and i think probably more people went wrong here <pause dur="0.6"/> # was when <pause dur="0.2"/> we were required to take vertical derivatives <pause dur="1.1"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> we have things like D-U-by-D-P <pause dur="0.2"/> and D-V-by-D-P <pause dur="1.5"/> and what i want to do <pause dur="0.2"/> is just to remind you how we would estimate <pause dur="0.3"/> any 
vertical derivative <pause dur="0.4"/> so suppose we have any <pause dur="0.2"/> meteorological quantity i'll just call it F for the moment <pause dur="0.4"/> it might be wind or temperature or whatever <pause dur="1.5"/> and we're required to estimate D-F-by-D-P <pause dur="0.3"/> the vertical rate of change of F <pause dur="1.3"/> well let's draw a little diagram once again to illustrate what we're doing <pause dur="0.3"/> very typically we might be <pause dur="0.3"/> given the value of F at say a hundred kilopascals near the surface <pause dur="0.4"/> and the value of F <pause dur="0.4"/> at fifty kilopascals halfway up through the atmosphere <pause dur="1.4"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> there's a pressure difference between those two levels <pause dur="1.0"/> delta-P which in this case is fifty kilopascals <pause dur="1.3"/> well <pause dur="0.2"/> the way i will estimate derivatives always <pause dur="0.4"/> is <pause dur="0.3"/> by what we call finite differences we just take the value at one level <pause dur="0.3"/> minus the value at the other level <pause dur="0.3"/> divided by the delta-P <pause dur="0.7"/> and that's an estimate of the derivative <pause dur="0.6"/> not <pause dur="0.4"/> necessarily a terribly accurate one but it is an estimate <pause dur="1.9"/> the critical bit is getting it the right way round so you get the signs right <pause dur="0.2"/> and people do get in a muddle here i have 
to say i get into a muddle often if i'm not thinking <pause dur="2.5"/> the way it works is like this <pause dur="0.4"/> we have to take the value of F at the higher pressure <pause dur="0.2"/> a hundred kilopascals in this case <pause dur="0.9"/> minus <pause dur="0.5"/> the value of F at the lower pressure <pause dur="1.2"/> fifty kilopascals <pause dur="1.1"/> divided by the pressure difference <pause dur="1.0"/> delta-P <pause dur="2.6"/> and <pause dur="1.4"/> this will give us the right sign <pause dur="0.8"/> notice that very often <pause dur="0.8"/> we're dealing with situations where the wind speed increases with height <pause dur="1.0"/> in other words the wind speed decreases with pressure <pause dur="0.3"/> so if this was say the U component of wind we might very frequently have the situation <pause dur="0.4"/> where U at fifty kilopascals is larger <pause dur="0.4"/> than U at a hundred kilopascals and so <pause dur="0.4"/> D-U-by-D-P would be negative <pause dur="1.1"/> and people get in a real muddle with this because of course the wind increases with height <pause dur="0.6"/> but that means it decreases with pressure <pause dur="0.4"/> so the sign is often <pause dur="0.2"/> perhaps a bit counter-intuitive <pause dur="0.4"/> so do remember that <pause dur="0.3"/> again <pause dur="0.2"/> i think the diagram always helps and a little thumbnail diagram <pause dur="0.3"/> along with your problems <pause dur="0.3"/> just to check out what 
it is that you're taking differences between to estimate <pause dur="0.4"/> these derivatives will not go amiss and again <pause dur="0.5"/> don't just trust that you've done the algebra correctly when you work out the signs <pause dur="0.4"/> just check it against the diagram to make sure the sign seems to make sense to you <pause dur="0.4"/> and that way <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> you will get lots of marks and feel gratified and everyone'll be happy <pause dur="1.3"/> right <pause dur="1.5"/> so much for the the the the problems <pause dur="0.2"/> let me just say as a <pause dur="0.2"/> parting shot the problems really aren't meant to be hard if you're finding <pause dur="0.4"/> that you're spending hours and hours on the problems <pause dur="0.4"/> i suggest you've rather missed the point <pause dur="0.4"/> most of the problems are a matter of either picking <pause dur="0.5"/> formulae or equations out of the lecture notes <pause dur="0.4"/> and then <pause dur="0.2"/> in a subsequent problem <pause dur="0.3"/> # rearranging them maybe <pause dur="0.6"/> or putting some numbers in them <pause dur="0.2"/> or what have you it really shouldn't take hours and hours and hours to do that <pause dur="0.6"/> so <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="2.9"/> do bear that in mind <pause dur="1.4"/> 
right let's get on to today's topic <pause dur="2.0"/> # today <pause dur="0.9"/> can't find the right page in my lecture notes <pause dur="8.3"/> oh here we are <pause dur="5.6"/> today our topic is called <pause dur="0.2"/> thermal advection <pause dur="6.0"/> which is a rather grand word for a rather simple concept <pause dur="2.5"/> i'd like to start off by thinking about the weather <pause dur="0.9"/> it was a cold morning this morning wasn't it </u><u who="ss" trans="latching"> mm </u><pause dur="0.7"/> <u who="nm0925" trans="pause"> it certainly was <pause dur="0.4"/> it was quite a nice afternoon yesterday wasn't it </u><pause dur="0.3"/> <u who="ss" trans="pause"> yes </u><u who="nm0925" trans="latching"> yes <pause dur="0.6"/> it was quite warm wasn't it if you went out for a walk in the sun <pause dur="0.8"/> right anyone like to give me an explanation of why <pause dur="0.2"/> it was <pause dur="0.5"/> five or ten degrees colder <pause dur="0.3"/> this morning <pause dur="0.3"/> than it was say at three o'clock yesterday afternoon <pause dur="1.1"/> yeah </u><pause dur="0.2"/> <u who="sm0926" trans="pause"> was a <pause dur="0.4"/> clear night last night </u><u who="nm0925" trans="latching"> yes </u><u who="sm0926" trans="latching"> a lot of the thermal # a lot of the infrared radiation <unclear>goes</unclear> <pause dur="0.8"/> <gap reason="inaudible" extent="2 secs"/></u><u who="nm0925" trans="overlap"> right <pause dur="0.6"/> good <pause dur="0.9"/> it was a clear night what's more it was dry air as well which is important which means there wasn't much water vapour <pause dur="0.3"/> and so the infrared radiation from the earth's surface could actually escape rather more readily <pause dur="0.6"/> # not everyone knows of course that water vapour is the most important greenhouse gas in the atmosphere <pause dur="0.3"/> although it's not the one the environmentalists 
make such a fuss about <pause dur="0.4"/> but # <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> the difference between a <pause dur="0.6"/> a clear night that's got dry air and a <pause dur="0.2"/> clear night that's got moist air is actually quite dramatic <pause dur="0.3"/> last night it was <pause dur="0.3"/> clear and dry <pause dur="0.6"/> so yeah <pause dur="1.1"/> lots of radiation from the earth's surface the earth's surface and the layers of air lying immediately above it got pretty cold <pause dur="0.5"/> hence our frost this morning <pause dur="0.8"/> let me take you back <pause dur="0.8"/> to # <pause dur="0.5"/> Friday <pause dur="1.9"/> don't know if you can remember Friday i have difficulty remembering events before the weekend <pause dur="0.4"/> but if we go back to <shift feature="voice" new="laugh"/>Friday <shift feature="voice" new="normal"/><pause dur="1.0"/> # the <pause dur="0.4"/> <trunc>m</trunc> minimum <pause dur="0.3"/> at about six o'clock in the morning <pause dur="0.5"/> was a great deal higher it was about four degrees or so <pause dur="1.0"/> so it was four or five it was five degrees probably six degrees warmer than it was this morning <pause dur="0.7"/> so what was different <pause dur="0.9"/> about <pause dur="0.3"/> Thursday night Friday morning from Sunday night <pause dur="0.4"/> Monday morning <pause dur="1.3"/> any ideas <pause dur="2.8"/> why was it <pause dur="0.8"/> <trunc>fi</trunc> four or six degrees warmer <pause dur="0.5"/> the same time on Friday morning <pause dur="0.3"/> as this morning </u><pause dur="0.2"/> <u who="sf0927" trans="pause"> <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/></u><pause dur="1.2"/> <u who="nm0925" trans="pause"> a front went past well done <pause dur="0.3"/> you've 
got the right answer straight away i was hoping someone was going to witter on about clouds and so on <pause dur="0.5"/> well <pause dur="0.2"/> there are there are two things actually <pause dur="0.3"/> we might have said well it was a cloudy night and therefore <pause dur="0.2"/> the radiative effect we've just talked about couldn't operate <pause dur="2.3"/> but you're dead right <pause dur="0.8"/> the difference was <pause dur="0.4"/> that a front went through <pause dur="0.3"/> we were actually sitting in a different air mass <pause dur="0.3"/> on <pause dur="0.2"/> Thursday morning <pause dur="0.5"/> and over the weekend <pause dur="0.3"/> the front came through it went dramatically colder it snowed <pause dur="0.8"/> as we shall talk about later on this morning <pause dur="0.5"/> in some places anyway <pause dur="0.4"/> and # <pause dur="0.4"/> # so it's altogether colder one mass of air <pause dur="0.2"/> with one set of thermodynamic properties <pause dur="0.5"/> has been replaced by another <pause dur="0.6"/> and it's that replacement of air with one set of characteristics by air with a different set of characteristics <pause dur="0.6"/> which is what's meant by advection <pause dur="0.2"/> and that's what we're going to talk about today <pause dur="1.3"/> you see if i sit at a particular met station let's just focus our minds on the temperature for the 
moment although the same arguments apply to other meteorological quantities <pause dur="0.6"/> if i sit at a meteorological station <pause dur="0.7"/> and i observe a change in the temperature <pause dur="1.5"/> then there are two <pause dur="0.3"/> alternative explanations for that change in temperature <pause dur="0.3"/> and in many cases of course <pause dur="0.2"/> both of of them operate <pause dur="1.0"/> either <pause dur="1.0"/> the air sitting at that station has actually changed its properties in some sense <pause dur="0.5"/> so your explanation that <pause dur="0.2"/> there was lots of radiation going on last night lots of infrared <pause dur="0.3"/> escaping <pause dur="0.2"/> and therefore the air got colder <pause dur="0.7"/> that could be the case in one set of situations <pause dur="2.3"/> and that's what we sometimes call heating or or diabatic processes <pause dur="2.2"/> on the other hand <pause dur="0.2"/> the temperature at a station <pause dur="0.3"/> may change <pause dur="0.8"/> simply because <pause dur="0.5"/> the individual air parcels are are not changing they retain their temperature but they move away from your station <pause dur="0.4"/> and they're replaced by another set of air parcels that come along with different properties <pause dur="0.9"/> so <pause dur="0.3"/> during the course of Friday and Saturday <pause dur="0.5"/> warm moist air <pause dur="0.3"/> moved 
away from the <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> area <pause dur="0.3"/> to be replaced by much colder drier air <pause dur="1.5"/> and that's what we call advection <pause dur="1.0"/> so the concept is simple enough what we need to do now <pause dur="0.3"/> is to <pause dur="0.2"/> # put some # quantitative details on it <pause dur="1.3"/> so i'm going to draw a diagram to fix the ideas in our head <pause dur="0.3"/> let's draw a diagram shall we <pause dur="0.3"/> of <pause dur="0.3"/> temperature <pause dur="0.9"/> and <pause dur="0.5"/> let's consider one space direction i'll call it X for the moment <pause dur="0.7"/> and suppose i have an observing site here <pause dur="1.0"/> i'll call this <pause dur="0.2"/> point A <pause dur="0.9"/> and at the observing site we observe a particular temperature <pause dur="0.4"/> there we are that's the temperature <pause dur="0.5"/> at <pause dur="0.5"/> # point A <pause dur="5.3"/> but the point is i'm going to suppose that the temperature varies as we go along the X axis so if i was to go to another observing site at a different position along X <pause dur="0.3"/> i'd observe a different temperature <pause dur="0.6"/> so <pause dur="0.3"/> let's # imagine that the temperatures along this X axis <pause dur="0.5"/> they go like this i i'll draw a rather simple example where they just go along a <pause dur="0.2"/> an increasing line like that <pause dur="0.9"/> so stations to the east of A <pause dur="0.2"/> are 
warm <pause dur="0.6"/> stations to the west of A in this case are cold <pause dur="2.6"/> # let us now suppose that a wind is blowing <pause dur="0.2"/> okay and i'm going to keep things dead simple <pause dur="0.4"/> by supposing that the wind is blowing parallel to the X axis <pause dur="0.6"/> # in general it won't of course in which case we'll have to consider the component of the wind parallel to the X axis <pause dur="0.4"/> but let's just suppose there is a wind <pause dur="0.4"/> blowing along the X axis <pause dur="1.0"/> there we are wind magnitude U <pause dur="0.4"/> <trunc>pa</trunc> blowing parallel to the the X-axis <pause dur="2.4"/> and <pause dur="0.3"/> time passes <pause dur="2.0"/> so <pause dur="0.8"/> after <pause dur="0.2"/> some time interval delta-T <pause dur="1.2"/> our observing site is no longer seeing this parcel of air with a temperature T-A <pause dur="0.7"/> what it will actually be sampling is an air parcel that started off <pause dur="0.5"/> some distance upstream <pause dur="0.7"/> so <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="1.8"/> let's suppose we take that point <pause dur="0.4"/> B shall we say <pause dur="0.9"/> that point B is a distance U <pause dur="0.7"/> times the time interval delta-T <pause dur="0.2"/> upstream <pause dur="2.7"/> and so after a time delta-T <pause dur="0.4"/> the parcel that started off at B <pause dur="0.9"/> will have reached <pause dur="0.3"/> A <pause dur="0.9"/> and so i'll measure a new temperature at station A after this time interval <pause dur="0.5"/> # i'll 
measure this temperature i'll call that T-B <pause dur="10.3"/> let's see if i can write down <pause dur="1.3"/> a relationship <pause dur="1.0"/> between those two temperatures <pause dur="2.9"/> well i think i can actually i i've a feeling i didn't use quite the same notation in the lecture notes if you're following in the lecture notes <pause dur="0.4"/> you might want to adjust the notation as as we're going along <pause dur="1.7"/> what we're interested in now is the temperature T-B <pause dur="0.8"/> which is the temperature that's now reached my observing site <pause dur="2.1"/> and we can see here <pause dur="0.2"/> that if this <pause dur="0.6"/> curve here <pause dur="0.7"/> doesn't depart too much from a straight line between stations A and B <pause dur="0.3"/> and it won't provided that time interval delta-T is sufficiently small <pause dur="1.0"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> then it's rather easy to do the calculation we could say that T-<pause dur="0.3"/>B is going to be T-A <pause dur="0.8"/> minus <pause dur="1.5"/> the distance delta-X <pause dur="0.4"/> to point B <pause dur="1.0"/> multiplied by the gradient <pause dur="2.7"/> D-T-by-D-X the rate of change of temperature along the X axis <pause dur="0.5"/> so that distance there is delta-X and we can see that that is equal to <pause dur="0.4"/> U times delta-T <pause dur="4.3"/> 
so <pause dur="0.8"/> if i rearrange that expression <pause dur="0.4"/> i can <pause dur="0.2"/> get an expression for the <pause dur="0.2"/> rate of change <pause dur="0.3"/> of temperature <pause dur="0.7"/> at <pause dur="0.3"/> station <pause dur="0.6"/> A <pause dur="6.8"/> so rate of change of temperature at <pause dur="0.3"/> my station A <pause dur="0.5"/> well <pause dur="0.2"/> i'm i'm going to approximate it by T-B <pause dur="0.4"/> minus T-A <pause dur="0.6"/> divided by the time interval <pause dur="0.4"/> delta-T <pause dur="3.1"/> and i can write an expression for that from the preceding expression by rearranging it if i take the T-A over to that side <pause dur="0.6"/> then i get an expression for T-A <pause dur="0.4"/> minus T-B <pause dur="0.2"/> and then i've just to divide it by delta-T and if i do that <pause dur="0.2"/> and don't tell me to keep the signs i've got a minus sign here <pause dur="0.7"/> i've got a delta-X over a delta-T <pause dur="1.8"/> times <pause dur="1.0"/> D-T-by-D-X <pause dur="6.4"/> it's not hard it's just simple algebra here <pause dur="1.3"/> what i'm going to do now <pause dur="0.4"/> is my usual calculus trick <pause dur="0.7"/> i'm going to suppose <pause dur="0.4"/> that delta-T and delta-X become very small <pause dur="0.2"/> i'm going to take the limit <pause dur="0.3"/> in which delta-X and delta-T tend to zero <pause dur="0.7"/> if i do that <pause dur="0.6"/> then that simply becomes the rate of change <pause dur="0.7"/> of temperature with respect to time <pause dur="0.7"/> if you want to 
you can say that's at the point A <pause dur="2.1"/> and that's going to be equal to <pause dur="0.6"/> well in the limit <trunc>del</trunc> of delta-X and delta-T becoming very small <pause dur="0.7"/> delta-X over delta-T that's just the rate of change of position <pause dur="0.4"/> of an air parcel <pause dur="0.4"/> along the X axis <pause dur="0.5"/> it's the <pause dur="0.2"/> velocity it's the speed U <pause dur="1.3"/> so i'm going to get minus-<pause dur="0.2"/>U <pause dur="0.7"/> times <pause dur="0.5"/> D-T-by-D-X <pause dur="3.5"/> and so <pause dur="1.5"/> that is an expression which tells us about the rate of change <pause dur="0.4"/> of temperature <pause dur="0.5"/> at <pause dur="0.5"/> a fixed point <pause dur="0.3"/> in space a fixed observing site <pause dur="0.9"/> on the assumption <pause dur="0.6"/> that the only process that's changing the temperature <pause dur="0.3"/> is this advection effect in other words <pause dur="0.3"/> the replacement of one air parcel <pause dur="0.4"/> with an air parcel of different properties <pause dur="4.5"/> so we'll put a box round that 'cause it's important <pause dur="1.3"/> so it's the rate of change <pause dur="3.2"/> due to <pause dur="1.1"/> advection <pause dur="4.2"/> and the # <pause dur="3.2"/> rate of change due to advection is given a name <pause dur="1.5"/> it's sometimes called <pause dur="0.4"/> the Eulerian <pause dur="0.3"/> rate of change <pause dur="2.0"/> Euler was a famous <pause dur="0.8"/> French mathematician <pause dur="0.9"/> who had more laws and formulae named after him <pause dur="0.6"/> # than most of us have <pause dur="0.6"/> and this 
is one that's named after him <pause dur="6.9"/> put a little a box round that it's an important bit of terminology you'll hear referred to <pause dur="0.4"/> the Eulerian rate of change <pause dur="0.4"/> is the rate of change <pause dur="0.2"/> at a fixed point in space <pause dur="0.9"/> the rate of change you would estimate for example <pause dur="0.5"/> if you're a meteorologist sitting <pause dur="0.3"/> at a fixed observing site on the earth's surface <pause dur="0.4"/> watching the winds blow past you <pause dur="2.3"/> course it's not the only rate of change <pause dur="0.3"/> that we might consider <pause dur="0.8"/> suppose we didn't sit at a fixed observing site <pause dur="0.4"/> suppose we attached ourselves to <pause dur="0.2"/> some sort of balloon <pause dur="0.5"/> which was wafted around by the winds <pause dur="1.4"/> in that case <pause dur="0.2"/> if we had a thermometer attached to that balloon <pause dur="0.8"/> # we wouldn't see the Eulerian rate of change at all <pause dur="1.1"/> in fact if we designed the balloon very carefully <pause dur="0.5"/> we would actually see the rate of change of individual air parcels because our balloon <pause dur="0.4"/> would effectively be always embedded in the same lump of air as it moved around <pause dur="0.6"/> actually that's a pretty bad example 'cause it's very hard <pause dur="0.4"/> to design a 
balloon that does that <pause dur="0.3"/> the problem is that the <pause dur="0.3"/> balloon usually floats at a constant height <pause dur="0.3"/> so it follows the winds at that height but it doesn't rise and sink with the air parcels <pause dur="0.6"/> # anyway that's # <pause dur="0.2"/> that's a that's a technical difficulty let's suppose we could do that <pause dur="2.3"/> so we have this other rate of change <pause dur="0.7"/> the rate of change following an individual fluid element <pause dur="1.4"/> and that in fact is identical to the rate of change that we mentioned earlier on if if an air parcel cools <pause dur="0.4"/> because of radiation <pause dur="0.4"/> we're actually talking there about this rate of change following the fluid element we're thinking of this air parcel <pause dur="0.3"/> that's sitting there <pause dur="0.3"/> radiating infrared radiation to space and thereby changing its temperature <pause dur="1.2"/> so we need another notation for that <pause dur="0.6"/> and so i'm going to introduce a notation and this is where some people get a bit confused 'cause they're a bit sloppy <pause dur="0.5"/> with notation on occasions <pause dur="0.2"/> so <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="1.7"/> i'm now going to consider the rate of change <pause dur="4.5"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="16"/> following <pause dur="5.2"/> an 
individual <pause dur="3.6"/> fluid parcel <pause dur="4.9"/> so what we would do here <pause dur="0.3"/> is to measure the temperature of our air parcel at some time T <pause dur="0.5"/> we would then measure the <pause dur="0.3"/> # temperature of our air parcel at some later time T-plus-delta-T shall we say <pause dur="0.4"/> we'd subtract the two divide by the time interval <pause dur="0.4"/> take the limit as delta-T tends to zero <pause dur="0.3"/> and we'd have a rate of change of temperature <pause dur="0.5"/> following the fluid parcel <pause dur="0.7"/> and we'll use a special notation for that <pause dur="1.2"/> we will define that <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="11"/> as capital-D <pause dur="2.3"/> D-T <pause dur="0.3"/> i'm using too many Ts here but still <pause dur="2.1"/> by D-little-T <pause dur="2.0"/> and that's the notation we will use <pause dur="0.7"/> this is sometimes called <pause dur="2.0"/> it's the rate of change for an individual fluid parcel <pause dur="0.3"/> and this is sometimes called the Lagrangian <pause dur="4.4"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="11"/> rate of change <pause dur="5.7"/> Lagrange was also <pause dur="0.3"/> an eighteenth century French mathematician <pause dur="0.4"/> who has <pause dur="0.3"/> # a vast number of equations and formulae named after him and this is just one of them <pause dur="1.3"/> so they they they were good at getting their names on equations in the eighteenth century French republic anyway <pause dur="0.3"/> 
# <pause dur="0.6"/> rates of change <pause dur="0.3"/> so <pause dur="0.5"/> we've got these two rates of change <pause dur="0.4"/> and very important they are too <pause dur="0.5"/> the rate of change at a fixed point in space <pause dur="0.7"/> now that's the sort of thing you might say meteorologists are interested in 'cause we have <pause dur="0.4"/> fixed observing sites <pause dur="0.4"/> we're required to produce weather forecasts for fixed points on the earth's surface <pause dur="0.3"/> the forecast for <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> or whatever <pause dur="1.5"/> and in other words <pause dur="0.4"/> the meteorologist is interested in the <pause dur="0.5"/> Eulerian <pause dur="0.2"/> rate of change of air properties <pause dur="2.8"/> but in a sense <pause dur="0.2"/> more physically fundamental is the <pause dur="0.2"/> Lagrangian rate of change if i follow an individual air parcel what happens to it <pause dur="0.6"/> does heat enter or leave it <pause dur="0.9"/> does it rise or sink in the atmosphere changes pressure <pause dur="0.6"/> whatever <pause dur="1.8"/> and if you cast your mind back to <pause dur="0.8"/> your work last term <pause dur="0.3"/> and our work this term <pause dur="0.9"/> most of the physical laws that we've written down <pause dur="0.2"/> that apply to air <pause dur="0.4"/> for example <pause dur="0.3"/> the first law of thermodynamics <pause dur="0.6"/> for example Newton's laws of motion <pause dur="0.9"/> they all apply to air parcels <pause dur="0.8"/> we ask how does an air parcel 
accelerate <pause dur="0.3"/> how does its temperature change when you pump heat into it <pause dur="0.2"/> and so on <pause dur="1.1"/> most of the physical laws <pause dur="0.3"/> that govern the atmosphere <pause dur="0.4"/> are expressed in terms of Lagrangian <pause dur="0.2"/> rates of change <pause dur="0.8"/> so we have this problem <pause dur="0.7"/> what we measure and what we want to predict are Eulerian rates of change <pause dur="1.3"/> what our physics tells us about are Lagrangian <pause dur="0.2"/> rates of change <pause dur="0.6"/> 
so <pause dur="0.4"/> what's going to be the relationship <pause dur="0.6"/> between <pause dur="0.5"/> the <pause dur="0.2"/> Eulerian and the Lagrangian rate of change <pause dur="0.6"/> well it's fairly straightforward <pause dur="0.4"/> that of course is the rate of change of temperature the Eulerian rate of change of temperature <pause dur="0.4"/> if i assume air parcels are not changing <pause dur="0.7"/> it's the rate of change in other words if capital-<pause dur="0.3"/>D-T-by-D-T <pause dur="0.3"/> is zero <pause dur="0.9"/> all that's happening is that one air parcel is moving away <pause dur="0.3"/> and another one with different properties is taking its place but the individual air parcels aren't changing their properties <pause dur="2.7"/> if <pause dur="0.4"/> the air parcels are actually <pause dur="0.4"/> changing their properties at the same time so suppose that i had this 
curve that was advecting along but at the same time all the air parcels were getting colder <pause dur="0.4"/> with time so that curve was dropping down as <pause dur="0.2"/> as it was moving along <pause dur="1.0"/> then <pause dur="0.3"/> i'd have to add into that formula <pause dur="0.5"/> the Lagrangian rate of change <pause dur="0.6"/> so <pause dur="0.4"/> what i will write is that # <pause dur="0.6"/> in general <pause dur="7.0"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="47"/> when <pause dur="2.4"/> there are both <pause dur="2.7"/> Lagrangian <pause dur="4.1"/> and Eulerian <pause dur="0.3"/> changes <pause dur="4.8"/> then we can say <pause dur="0.2"/> the rate of change at a particular <pause dur="0.5"/> location <pause dur="1.7"/> D-U-by-D-T <pause dur="0.4"/> is going to be the Lagrangian rate of change <pause dur="2.4"/> capital-<pause dur="0.5"/>D-by-D-T <pause dur="0.3"/> minus <pause dur="0.2"/> this advective rate of change <pause dur="0.4"/> minus-U times D-T-by-D-X <pause dur="2.3"/> and that's really the central result <pause dur="0.2"/> of today's lecture <pause dur="4.3"/> it gives us the relationship between rates of change at a position <pause dur="1.3"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> the rate of change for an individual parcel <pause dur="1.2"/> and they're related <pause dur="0.6"/> via <pause dur="0.2"/> the velocity <pause dur="0.3"/> and the temperature gradient <pause dur="5.0"/> i've deliberately kept things terribly simple in this discussion because i supposed that temperature was only varying in the X direction and the wind was only blowing parallel to the X 
axis <pause dur="0.6"/> it's dead easy to generalize this <pause dur="0.3"/> if i have a general wind <pause dur="0.4"/> then that will have components parallel to all three axes X Y and Z <pause dur="0.9"/> and of course the temperature may vary in all three directions X Y and Z as in general it does <pause dur="0.6"/> so i can generalize this <pause dur="0.5"/> for # three-dimensional <pause dur="0.2"/> motion <pause dur="3.0"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="52"/> and i won't go through the arguments of course they just work exactly the same way <pause dur="0.9"/> but just write a result down <pause dur="1.1"/> in three dimensions then we can say the rate of change at a fixed position the Eulerian rate of change <pause dur="0.4"/> is equal to the Lagrangian rate of change <pause dur="1.0"/> the rate of change <pause dur="0.4"/> for an individual air parcel <pause dur="0.4"/> minus well the same term <pause dur="0.8"/> U times D-T-by-D-X U remember now is the component of wind parallel to the X axis <pause dur="1.2"/> minus <pause dur="0.2"/> V <pause dur="0.2"/> times D-T-by-D-Y <pause dur="0.7"/> V is the component of wind parallel to the Y-axis <pause dur="0.5"/> D-T-D-Y <pause dur="0.3"/> is the <pause dur="0.2"/> rate of change of temperature along the Y-axis <pause dur="0.4"/> and then of course we've got the vertical one minus-W <pause dur="0.4"/> times D-T-by-D-Z <pause dur="0.6"/> it looks a bit long <pause dur="0.6"/> but that's just because <pause dur="0.7"/> we've written

changing at a particular place in the atmosphere <pause dur="0.5"/> due to <pause dur="0.2"/> advection <pause dur="0.7"/> replacement of one air parcel by another <pause dur="0.8"/> and i <pause dur="0.4"/> i'm going to make an additional assumption <pause dur="2.0"/> suppose we have a situation where the wind is essentially <pause dur="0.3"/> geostrophic <pause dur="1.1"/> that's the situation that's we've been # <pause dur="0.4"/> # assuming in most of our analysis of synoptic weather charts <pause dur="2.5"/> then we get <pause dur="0.2"/> a very <pause dur="0.2"/> useful <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.9"/> set of relationships <pause dur="1.4"/> and the reason that we get them you see is that # <pause dur="0.5"/> thermal wind relationship <pause dur="0.8"/> if you # recall <pause dur="0.4"/> tells us the relationship between the change of temperature in the horizontal things like D-T-by-D-X and D-T-by-D-Y <pause dur="0.7"/> and the change of the wind in the vertical <pause dur="0.3"/> D-P-by-D-Z <pause dur="0.2"/> or sorry D # sorry <pause dur="0.3"/> D-U-by-D-P <pause dur="0.4"/> or #<pause dur="0.2"/> D-V-by-D-P <pause dur="1.4"/> so <pause dur="0.2"/> there's an intimate relationship <pause dur="0.2"/> between advection <pause dur="0.6"/> and the wind changing with height <pause dur="1.3"/> and # <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> i want to <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.9"/> take a look at that now <pause dur="1.8"/> you'll remember that at the end of the # lecture two lectures ago when we talked about thermal wind balance <pause dur="0.4"/> i introduced this concept of the thermal wind <pause dur="3.4"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="6"/> as a 
reminder the thermal wind <pause dur="1.7"/> which <pause dur="0.2"/> # i'll just write its magnitude down for the moment i called it V-subscript-T for thermal <pause dur="1.1"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> it's equal to G-over-F <pause dur="1.1"/> times the gradient of the thickness so it's D-by-D-Y <pause dur="1.0"/> of <pause dur="0.5"/> Z at some high level minus-Z-one at some lower level <pause dur="1.3"/> typically Z-two would be the fifty kilopascal <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> pressures at the height of the <pause dur="0.3"/> fifty kilopascal surface <pause dur="0.3"/> Z-one would be the height of the hundred kilopascal <pause dur="0.5"/> pressure surface <pause dur="2.8"/> so <pause dur="0.3"/> we could plot it on a chart <pause dur="0.5"/> # it bears just the same relationship to lines of thickness as the geostrophic wind vector bears to <pause dur="0.3"/> lines of constant pressure or geopotential height <pause dur="4.6"/> and <pause dur="0.5"/> we can use these ideas now to <pause dur="0.2"/> discuss a number of <pause dur="0.7"/> typical cases of the wind varying with height <pause dur="0.6"/> and i'm going to give you three examples and you'll be able to look later on this morning at your charts and spot <pause dur="0.5"/> what's happening <pause dur="2.2"/> let's take the simplest case first of all <pause dur="0.4"/> where the wind speed <pause dur="0.2"/> changes with height but the wind direction does not <pause dur="0.8"/> so we have a 
geostrophic wind near the surface which is in a particular direction <pause dur="0.5"/> the wind at say five-hundred millibars is in the same direction but stronger <pause dur="1.0"/> not an uncommon situation <pause dur="1.0"/> let's do a little drawing of what's going on <pause dur="2.6"/> # let me draw thickness contours <pause dur="0.5"/> in <pause dur="1.9"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="35"/> red <pause dur="1.3"/> and let me <pause dur="0.4"/> draw # <trunc>s</trunc> the # <pause dur="0.4"/> # height contours at the lower level <pause dur="2.2"/> and <pause dur="0.7"/> i'll draw them looking like that so that's shall we say the hundred kilopascal <pause dur="2.1"/> Z <pause dur="1.4"/> and the red contours <pause dur="0.3"/> show the thickness lines <pause dur="1.5"/> so that's the <pause dur="0.5"/> hundred to fifty kilopascal <pause dur="1.4"/> thickness <pause dur="1.4"/> if you look on the charts in the corridor you'll see that's what we actually plot <pause dur="0.4"/> people <pause dur="0.3"/> tend to <pause dur="0.2"/> put the surface pressure say <pause dur="0.3"/> but with lines of constant thickness on as well <pause dur="0.8"/> now in this case the surface geostrophic wind <pause dur="1.4"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="20"/> looks like that <pause dur="0.6"/> # i'm going to call that <pause dur="0.3"/> V-one <pause dur="3.8"/> and the thermal wind well remember that's parallel to lines of constant thickness <pause dur="2.3"/> and inversely proportional to their spacing so <pause dur="0.9"/> there's going to be <pause dur="0.3"/> V-two <pause dur="0.2"/> in the same direction <pause dur="1.8"/> and if i add the 
two together <pause dur="0.3"/> i'll get the wind at the <pause dur="0.3"/> second height at # the five-hundred millibar level <pause dur="0.5"/> so the wind at the five-hundred millibar level <pause dur="0.3"/> is just going to be the sum of those two <pause dur="0.5"/> it's going to look like that <pause dur="3.9"/> notice <pause dur="0.8"/> that both those wind vectors V-one and V-two are parallel <pause dur="0.9"/> to the thickness contours <pause dur="0.8"/> thickness remember is proportional to temperature <pause dur="0.4"/> that means <pause dur="0.3"/> that there are no variations of temperature <pause dur="0.3"/> in the direction the wind is blowing <pause dur="1.3"/> so although the air parcel's moving past we're not replacing it by an air parcel with a different temperature we're replacing the air parcel <pause dur="0.4"/> with one of the same temperature <pause dur="0.7"/> in other words in this situation <pause dur="0.6"/> there is no <pause dur="0.2"/> thermal advection <pause dur="0.6"/> the 
temperature <pause dur="0.2"/> change <pause dur="0.4"/> <trunc>i</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> is not due to replacing air parcels 'cause we're just replacing one air parcel with another one <pause dur="0.2"/> of the same temperature <pause dur="1.3"/> so we have <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="8"/> no <pause dur="1.1"/> thermal <pause dur="0.3"/> advection <pause dur="6.3"/> i have to say that's not an uncommon situation but it's a <pause dur="0.2"/> boring situation <pause dur="0.7"/> let's <pause dur="0.2"/> consider a much 
more exciting and interesting situation <pause dur="4.7"/> what we've had over this weekend is a situation which is called cold advection <pause dur="1.0"/> that is to say warm air <pause dur="0.3"/> has been displaced by cold air blowing down from the north <pause dur="0.9"/> let's have a look at what that implies in terms of <pause dur="0.3"/> the height and thickness <pause dur="2.1"/> let me again draw the thousand millibar height <pause dur="0.2"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="10"/> contours looking like that <pause dur="0.3"/> and V-one is going to be the same as in the previous diagram i really ought to underline these Vs 'cause i i i <trunc>w</trunc> i ought to stress that i'm talking about vectors here <pause dur="0.4"/> the direction is important as well as the magnitude <pause dur="0.6"/> so <pause dur="0.9"/> there's V-one <pause dur="0.2"/> that's the surface geostrophic wind but now this time <pause dur="0.5"/> i'm going to suppose <pause dur="0.6"/> that the <pause dur="0.2"/> # height contours <pause dur="0.4"/> are no longer <pause dur="0.2"/> is the sorry the thickness contours are no longer parallel <pause dur="0.2"/> to these height contours <pause dur="0.4"/> so i'm going to draw my <pause dur="0.3"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="3"/> thickness contours <pause dur="0.7"/> looking like that <pause dur="1.4"/> and i'm going to suppose it's colder <pause dur="0.3"/> here <pause dur="0.5"/> so that's low values of thickness <pause dur="0.4"/> and it's warmer here <pause dur="0.3"/> so we have <pause dur="0.3"/> large values of 
thickness here <pause dur="1.5"/> in this case <pause dur="0.7"/> the thermal wind vector <pause dur="0.7"/> is going to be <pause dur="0.6"/> parallel to the thickness contours <pause dur="1.1"/> and with <pause dur="0.2"/> cold air on the left so the thermal wind vector <pause dur="0.4"/> is going to <pause dur="0.2"/> look like that <pause dur="2.3"/> okay <pause dur="1.8"/> now <pause dur="0.2"/> what about the wind at five-hundred millibars <pause dur="1.0"/> well it's simply going to be the vector sum <pause dur="0.4"/> of the low level wind <pause dur="0.5"/> plus the thermal wind <pause dur="0.7"/> so if i # <pause dur="0.5"/> construct that using my usual <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> triangle <pause dur="0.8"/> construction <pause dur="3.8"/> i will find that V-two will look like that <pause dur="2.4"/> very interesting isn't it <pause dur="0.4"/> what you will see is there <pause dur="0.3"/> that as you go up from the surface <pause dur="0.4"/> to the upper layer <pause dur="1.5"/> the wind vector <pause dur="0.4"/> turns <pause dur="2.5"/> it turns in an anticlockwise sense <pause dur="0.7"/> and we describe this <pause dur="0.4"/> as the wind <pause dur="1.7"/> backing with height <pause dur="4.7"/> and this is a situation where we have cold advection <pause dur="7.7"/> that's the sort of situation we might look out for this weekend and if i can get hold of some charts <pause dur="0.5"/> for the weekend <pause dur="0.2"/> later on we'll we'll we'll take a look at that <pause dur="4.0"/> let me finish <pause dur="0.6"/> by <pause dur="0.2"/> taking the opposite case i hope you can guess what's going to happen now <pause dur="0.3"/> we're now going 
to consider warm advection <pause dur="8.1"/> once again i'll put my low level height contours in the same direction <pause dur="0.4"/> my V-one <pause dur="0.3"/> same direction and same strength <pause dur="1.5"/> that's my surface geostrophic wind and my near-surface geostrophic wind <pause dur="0.6"/> this time <pause dur="0.3"/> i'm going to tip <pause dur="0.3"/> the <pause dur="0.4"/> <trunc>hei</trunc> thickness contours in the opposite <pause dur="0.3"/> sense <pause dur="0.4"/> so this time i'm going to draw thickness contours that look like this with the warm air down here <pause dur="1.3"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="4"/> cold air <pause dur="1.3"/> here <pause dur="1.5"/> and <pause dur="0.7"/> again the <pause dur="0.3"/> thermal wind vector is parallel to the thickness contours <pause dur="0.4"/> cold air on the left <pause dur="0.7"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="3"/> so <pause dur="0.2"/> it's going to look like that <pause dur="0.9"/> that's my thermal wind vector <pause dur="1.7"/> let's get the winds now at the upper level by doing the vector sum <pause dur="0.2"/> of the low level wind and the thermal wind <pause dur="1.0"/> usual parallelogram construction <pause dur="1.5"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="5"/> like so <pause dur="1.4"/> that's V-two <pause dur="4.0"/> this time <pause dur="0.2"/> you will see <pause dur="0.2"/> that the wind <pause dur="0.2"/> has turned in a clockwise sense <pause dur="0.3"/> with height <pause dur="2.2"/> and so warm advection <pause dur="0.4"/> is associated with the wind <pause dur="1.5"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="10"/> veering <pause dur="3.8"/> with height <pause dur="4.4"/> i find this very fascinating <pause dur="0.4"/> it means that if i have a single radiosonde ascent that returns the the the winds <pause dur="0.5"/> 
by looking at the way the wind vector is changing <pause dur="0.4"/> as the # balloon ascends i can actually say something about the spatial distribution of the temperature <pause dur="0.6"/> can work out what direction the thickness contours <pause dur="0.3"/> must have <pause dur="0.5"/> at that station <pause dur="7.8"/> gosh i've drawn all over my lecture notes in my excitement <pause dur="1.0"/> right <pause dur="1.3"/> # you'll have a chance to see these ideas in practice as we go through the present case study we'll be looking at the winds at different levels we'll be analysing <pause dur="0.4"/> the thickness <pause dur="0.4"/> and if you all say i don't know how to analyse thickness well you've got a treat in store because <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> # <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/>'s going to tell you all about that in in a couple of minutes <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> so <pause dur="0.9"/> that's the next stage in our practicals <pause dur="0.2"/> i'm going to hand over # to <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> in a moment <pause dur="0.4"/> # i just want to make one announcement the # <pause dur="0.2"/> # the lads down in the lab have fixed the radiosonde system <pause dur="0.3"/> they have soldered the wire <pause dur="0.3"/> back onto its connector <vocal desc="laughter" n="ss" iterated="y" dur="1"/> inside the # receiver <pause dur="0.4"/> and i'm assured it works <pause dur="0.3"/> so <pause dur="0.2"/> we are 
hoping <pause dur="0.6"/> when <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/>'s finished <pause dur="0.3"/> that we will have a a second launch today <pause dur="0.3"/> i don't think we all need to troop down to see the equipment 'cause you saw it last time but we will do a launch <pause dur="0.4"/> and # we'll try and # plot an ascent <pause dur="0.4"/> during the course of the morning <pause dur="0.3"/> so <pause dur="0.2"/> # if the people who wanted to volunteer to <pause dur="0.3"/> write down some numbers can remember who they were <pause dur="0.3"/> arms jerking there <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> then # <pause dur="0.2"/> we'll we'll arrange a rota for you to go down <pause dur="0.2"/> i i'll let <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> finish and then we'll sort out the timing <pause dur="0.6"/> okay <pause dur="3.2"/> <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> you've got to be wired for sound today
