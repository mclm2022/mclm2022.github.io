<u who="nm0785"> on this i've printed it off in a machine which was a clever machine 'cause it 'cause it's given you the <pause dur="0.8"/> the home page address on this <pause dur="0.3"/> thing as well <pause dur="0.6"/> okay so <pause dur="0.3"/> what i advise you to do <pause dur="0.3"/> is <pause dur="0.4"/> to <pause dur="0.5"/> go <pause dur="0.2"/> to the home page for this course to find it either straight from this address or just the department's home page <pause dur="0.3"/> my home page there's a link in there to this M-S-C <pause dur="0.9"/> labour market economics home page <pause dur="0.3"/> okay <pause dur="0.5"/> so <pause dur="0.5"/> let me <pause dur="0.5"/> so i thought this would be a non-paper course it's just all going to be an electronic course <pause dur="0.3"/> and then i thought well you can't not give handouts <pause dur="0.4"/> and when <pause dur="0.4"/> when people come round universities doing teaching quality assessments <pause dur="0.4"/> all they do is they # they don't look at films like this <pause dur="0.4"/><kinesic desc="indicates camera" iterated="n"/> they # <pause dur="0.3"/> all they do <pause dur="0.2"/> is they # <pause dur="1.0"/> they go to filing cabinets and they flick through filing cabinets and they want to see lots of handouts <pause dur="0.2"/> okay so i've had to do a handout </u><gap reason="break in recording" extent="uncertain"/> <u who="nm0785" trans="pause"> now to some extent <pause dur="0.5"/> because i've just downloaded it all you know you <trunc>n</trunc> you now need not go and look at the home 
page 'cause you've got it all here <pause dur="0.5"/> but what i'm going to be <trunc>tr</trunc> what i'm going to be doing as i go through the course is <pause dur="0.3"/> sometimes i'll be saying <pause dur="0.2"/> i'm not going to cover this in the lectures <pause dur="0.5"/> it's and it might not be fully explained in the in the download of it because i've updated the home page <pause dur="0.3"/> so periodically i will be adding things to the and and updating the home page <pause dur="0.2"/> when i do that i will try and put within the home page <pause dur="0.3"/> # a recent edition blinking <pause dur="0.2"/> # icon <pause dur="0.3"/> that <trunc>s</trunc> that <pause dur="0.2"/> that warns you that there is something new that you might want to look at <pause dur="0.2"/> so it might be something that you want to keep up to date with to some extent <pause dur="0.4"/> and indeed <pause dur="0.2"/> this relates <pause dur="0.6"/> what i've just given you now <pause dur="0.2"/> relates to this first topic <pause dur="0.2"/> i'll say a few words in a minute about the course outline i'm going to go through in these five weeks <pause dur="0.5"/> but this relates just to this topic <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.9"/> over Christmas i spent a good fortnight of my time putting all this together on the home page which is a slightly tedious 
business <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> i haven't yet got round to putting all the material in for topic two <pause dur="0.6"/> but i will be doing that hopefully before next week <pause dur="0.9"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> and for topics three four and five <pause dur="0.3"/> it <trunc>m</trunc> <pause dur="0.6"/> # as my time becomes more and more precious through term rather than through <pause dur="0.2"/> Christmas and New Year et cetera <pause dur="0.4"/> my ability to deliver on my promise to have everything on the home page <pause dur="0.3"/> might become less and less credible <pause dur="0.6"/> so # by <pause dur="0.3"/> topics three four and five finishing off the course <pause dur="0.3"/> it might simply say <pause dur="0.4"/> here's a link to a few of the things <pause dur="0.3"/> # but it's <trunc>n</trunc> might not be as complete as this but i intend it <trunc>th</trunc> i intend that it should be <pause dur="1.7"/> okay <pause dur="0.2"/> so that's all by way of <pause dur="0.2"/> of introduction <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="1.7"/> so let me turn now <trunc>m</trunc> to more somewhat more substantive matters albeit still by way of some introduction <pause dur="0.9"/> if you turn <pause dur="0.3"/> <trunc>d</trunc> in this handout to the third page of it <pause dur="0.9"/> that gives you the course outline <pause dur="1.5"/> and <pause dur="1.2"/> i've indicated here that we're going to be having five lecture topics <pause dur="0.3"/> now they might not correspond exactly <pause dur="0.5"/> because of my inability to time 
things perfectly <pause dur="0.6"/> to <pause dur="0.3"/> each of our five meetings <pause dur="0.2"/> in fact some of these topics <trunc>in</trunc> inherently are bigger than others <pause dur="0.3"/> so for example <pause dur="0.4"/> this lecture one material that i'm going to <pause dur="0.3"/> to motivate in a few minutes <pause dur="0.4"/> # is going to certainly run into next week <pause dur="0.7"/> and i'd suspect that it will probably run into the <trunc>fu</trunc> first full hour of next week <pause dur="0.8"/> trade and wages will then occupy the second part and maybe just kick into week three <pause dur="0.4"/> and as we go through the topics become <pause dur="0.3"/> a bit smaller <pause dur="0.5"/> so we'll catch up with ourselves hopefully and cover all this material <pause dur="0.6"/> the first four topics <pause dur="0.3"/> are all pretty much integrated around the central theme <pause dur="0.6"/> and the theme is <pause dur="0.7"/> what determines wages in labour markets <pause dur="0.5"/> especially labour markets where there was imperfect competition <pause dur="0.3"/> both on the labour market side in terms of the presence of trade unions or other forms of bargaining by workers <pause dur="0.4"/> and also imperfect competition on the product market side <pause dur="1.0"/> now that's a <trunc>s</trunc> a theme which has <pause dur="0.5"/> still <pause dur="0.2"/> has relatively 
little attention in the literature <pause dur="0.9"/> i i'll say a few more words about that in a minute <pause dur="0.8"/> so that's that's the main theme in a sense <pause dur="0.3"/> within that theme we say <pause dur="0.3"/> well this imperfect competition in the product market <pause dur="0.4"/> has an international <pause dur="0.4"/> competition element as well <pause dur="0.2"/> so product markets are typically <pause dur="0.3"/> internationally <pause dur="0.4"/> competed increasingly through globalization regionalizing <pause dur="0.4"/> of <trunc>econ</trunc> of of product markets <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> and through <trunc>int</trunc> in a European context through the increasing <trunc>ec</trunc> economic integration that we're seeing <pause dur="0.3"/> in a global sense but <trunc>al</trunc> but # specifically not least after the # the Euro was introduced <pause dur="0.4"/> in a <trunc>i</trunc> in a European context <pause dur="0.4"/> and i want to address questions to do with <pause dur="0.3"/> how that <pause dur="0.6"/> international context of product markets <pause dur="0.2"/> especially that increasing integration of product markets in the international context <pause dur="0.3"/> how that impacts on <pause dur="0.3"/> labour markets <pause dur="0.4"/> # wage determination in particular <pause dur="0.5"/> and of course the endogeneity of that <pause dur="0.3"/> how those <pause dur="0.3"/> labour market institutions and labour 
market processes <pause dur="0.3"/> themselves <pause dur="0.2"/> shape the kind of influences that we'll expect to see from economic integration <pause dur="1.3"/> so much of that focus will be on a in a in a U-K European context <pause dur="0.4"/> but bearing in mind that there are analogies for <trunc>f</trunc> for North American labour markets <pause dur="0.4"/> # which we'll also be bearing in mind <pause dur="1.1"/> another aspect of that trade and wages literature of course is that that we we know that in the U-K <pause dur="0.4"/> and in the North America there have been tremendous growth in wage inequalities <pause dur="0.4"/> in in in the nineties perhaps starting earlier than that <pause dur="0.4"/> which in the wider European context <pause dur="0.2"/> has not seen <pause dur="0.4"/> the same impact <pause dur="0.4"/> # on wage inequality but there have been other impacts in terms of unemployment in the way that labour markets have adjusted <pause dur="0.5"/> and we want to address that question of <pause dur="0.3"/> to what extent have these changes in the labour market outcomes <pause dur="0.2"/> wage inequality and unemployment <pause dur="0.4"/> to what extent <pause dur="0.5"/> do those reflect <pause dur="0.3"/> the changing nature of trade that we're seeing in product markets or that they have 
other causes <pause dur="0.4"/> and that will be our <pause dur="0.2"/> our second topic <pause dur="1.6"/> the third <pause dur="0.4"/> <trunc>a</trunc> and we'll be mostly focusing now on things to do with empirical evidence <pause dur="0.9"/> in the third topic <pause dur="0.4"/> i'm going to say <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> let's look at some recent models <pause dur="0.2"/> of <pause dur="0.8"/> the economic theory of trade unions in the context of international competition <pause dur="0.2"/> but in which we also look explicitly at international trade in the theoretical models <pause dur="0.9"/> # <pause dur="1.5"/> lecture four <pause dur="0.5"/> then still has that same theme of thinking about <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> # wages and institutions like unions and and like imperfect competition <pause dur="0.5"/> and more explicitly says well <pause dur="0.4"/> are these things of unions are these institutions are they exogenously determined do we just say some labour markets are unionized <pause dur="0.2"/> let's think about the impact of that <pause dur="0.4"/> or shouldn't we have <pause dur="0.4"/> more of a <trunc>r</trunc> of a role in saying well what determines whether we'll <pause dur="0.2"/> observe <pause dur="0.5"/> different kinds of bargaining arrangements in different labour markets <pause dur="0.3"/> so we look there at union formation <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> in a <trunc>eu</trunc> in a U-K context <pause dur="0.7"/> we ought to look at the 
question of <pause dur="0.3"/> well <pause dur="0.4"/> this formation of unions <pause dur="0.9"/> this issue of whether unions are present or not <pause dur="0.3"/> isn't only to do with <pause dur="0.4"/> a supply side response by workers wanting to form unions <pause dur="0.2"/> but it might also depend on the attitudes of firms <pause dur="0.3"/> in whether they're prepared to accommodate unions <pause dur="0.7"/> and and in the U-K context that means looking at the issue of recognition <pause dur="0.4"/> the issue of whether firms <pause dur="0.2"/> recognize <pause dur="0.3"/> unions for the purposes of bargaining with them <pause dur="0.3"/> in the determination of wages and or other conditions <pause dur="0.8"/> that's very relevant as we as <trunc>w</trunc> at the moment because <pause dur="0.6"/> the new Labour government <pause dur="0.3"/> is proposing big changes in the way in which <pause dur="0.7"/> unions <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> can <pause dur="0.4"/> obtain recognition <pause dur="0.8"/> for the purposes of bargaining <pause dur="1.0"/> # <pause dur="0.8"/> in the <trunc>U</trunc> in the U-S for a long time there's been a long literature now <pause dur="0.4"/> on the fact that <pause dur="0.3"/> workers <pause dur="0.9"/> in the <trunc>f</trunc> # through organizing elections <pause dur="0.6"/> can # <pause dur="0.3"/> can have a legal right to have recognition by their by their employers <pause dur="0.6"/> in the U-K there haven't been there hasn't been that kind of legislative 
environment and that's what's being introduced <pause dur="0.3"/> so we'll look at the context for that in terms of <pause dur="0.3"/> the <trunc>li</trunc> # any literature on recognition <pause dur="0.6"/> and a related issue to that is <pause dur="0.3"/> what determines why individual members might want to join unions <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> to the extent that unions are a public good <pause dur="0.5"/> or or a collective good <pause dur="0.9"/> then there's a there's a dilemma for <pause dur="0.2"/> for <pause dur="0.2"/> economic theory to explain why unions form <pause dur="0.5"/> let let me make that a bit more concrete <pause dur="1.2"/> suppose we're we we are a workforce <pause dur="0.3"/> the the eight or nine people of us in this room are a workforce <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> then we can all agree that jointly we might want to get together <pause dur="0.4"/> and form some <pause dur="0.2"/> some kind of bargaining unit let's call it a union might not always be formalized through channels like unions <pause dur="1.6"/> in the belief that <pause dur="0.2"/> if all of us in this workforce <pause dur="0.5"/> are are a <trunc>m</trunc> are a part of this group <pause dur="0.4"/> then our collective bargaining power is greater than our individual bargaining powers depending upon the nature of the work we do <pause dur="0.2"/> perhaps <pause dur="0.7"/> but if that is 
the case <pause dur="0.5"/> then <pause dur="0.2"/> we can hope that by exerting that kind of bargaining power we can raise our wage <pause dur="0.5"/> if we're able to do that typically <pause dur="0.2"/> in labour markets <pause dur="0.3"/> any wage increase that we're able to bargain <pause dur="0.2"/> is then <trunc>bai</trunc> paid to all the members of that workforce <pause dur="0.7"/> not only to those people who have got themselves together <pause dur="0.2"/> # and and obtained through bargaining that wage <pause dur="1.1"/> so that generates a free rider problem for each and every one of us each one of us thinks well i'll let the other guys get together <pause dur="0.3"/> and spend their evenings and and their resources on forming this union <pause dur="0.2"/> and maybe also risking <pause dur="0.5"/> the wrath of employers depending on the attitude of of firms to unions <pause dur="1.1"/> and if they're successful in raising the wage <pause dur="0.4"/> i will then have a higher wage as well without incurring the costs <pause dur="0.4"/> so there's <pause dur="0.4"/> especially when there's a large workforce <pause dur="0.5"/> not when there's a small group like this perhaps but especially when there's a large workforce <pause dur="0.3"/> that kind of <pause dur="0.3"/> free rider incentive <pause dur="0.5"/> that kind of <pause dur="0.3"/> 
prisoner's dilemma problem <pause dur="0.5"/> can undermine <pause dur="0.4"/> the generation of <pause dur="0.5"/> <trunc>u</trunc> # of unions of bargaining groups <pause dur="0.4"/> and so we'll be looking at questions <pause dur="0.2"/> to the <trunc>ex</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> # about have <trunc>y</trunc> have <pause dur="1.2"/> economists in the literature <pause dur="0.5"/> adequately explained that kind of thing <pause dur="0.8"/> and that's particularly important in a context in which <pause dur="0.3"/> union membership <pause dur="0.3"/> in economies like the U-K and in Europe generally <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> have observed <pause dur="0.3"/> such <pause dur="0.3"/> dramatic changes <pause dur="0.3"/> in the in the kind of levels of membership <pause dur="0.9"/> U-K <pause dur="0.4"/> is not necessarily representative throughout Europe but in the U-K <pause dur="0.8"/> in nineteen-seventy-nine something like fifty-five per cent of all workers were members of trade unions <pause dur="0.6"/> anyone know for the figure for nineteen-ninety <pause dur="0.2"/> where are we now nineteen-ninety-nine <pause dur="1.1"/> roughly </u><pause dur="1.2"/> <u who="sm0786" trans="pause"> thirty </u><pause dur="0.5"/> <u who="nm0785" trans="pause"> yeah it's possibly even less than thirty per cent around twenty-five twenty-seven per cent <pause dur="0.3"/> that's a dramatic change <pause dur="0.4"/> that's happened in a number of European countries it's not happening in all European countries <pause dur="0.3"/> indeed there's a literature on the 
diversity <pause dur="0.2"/> and the causes of the diversity <pause dur="0.2"/> in union membership <pause dur="0.2"/> across European countries <pause dur="0.4"/> and not only the diversity in the level but the diversity in the pattern of change <pause dur="0.6"/> and that's something that we'll address in in topic four <pause dur="1.7"/> that then <pause dur="0.2"/> finishes the theme <pause dur="0.2"/> of <pause dur="0.9"/> of wages bargaining <pause dur="0.2"/> institutions imperfect competition <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> and in # and in some ways it it finishes the course <pause dur="0.2"/> and it might occupy all five of our meetings <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> but i'm <pause dur="0.3"/> wanting to have <pause dur="0.2"/> time to cover lecture five <pause dur="0.5"/> which if i find that our time is squeezed out by the other <pause dur="0.2"/> material <pause dur="0.3"/> becoming larger than than we <trunc>in</trunc> intend now <pause dur="0.4"/> i'll offer as a on a purely voluntary basis an additional lecture <pause dur="0.6"/> where i cover two other <pause dur="0.2"/> aspects <pause dur="0.5"/> # which are <pause dur="0.3"/> very relevant to current policies <pause dur="1.3"/> the first of those <pause dur="0.3"/> is <pause dur="0.2"/> what i call here <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> the analysis of monopsony <pause dur="1.1"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> now the analysis of monopsony has A a very long tradition <pause dur="0.7"/> # and B a more recent tradition in terms of models of dynamic monopsony <pause dur="0.2"/> but i'm not concerned with either of those <pause dur="0.3"/> 
i'm concerned with <pause dur="0.3"/> the issue of explaining <pause dur="0.3"/> not <pause dur="0.4"/> levels of employment and wages but <pause dur="0.3"/> the number of hours that people work <pause dur="0.9"/> at the moment <pause dur="0.6"/> in <pause dur="0.3"/> the European Union <pause dur="0.3"/> and impacting perhaps <pause dur="0.2"/> exclusively on the U-K <pause dur="0.4"/> you <pause dur="0.3"/> may well be aware that <pause dur="0.5"/> there is an E-U directive on maximum hours legislation <pause dur="0.7"/> which proposes <pause dur="0.4"/> a maximum of forty-eight hours per week <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> as a as a required contractual maximum by firms on workers <pause dur="0.3"/> firms and workers will be entitled <pause dur="0.4"/> to negotiate <pause dur="0.4"/> voluntarily and jointly <pause dur="0.3"/> hours in excess of forty-eight hours but firms will not be legally allowed <pause dur="0.2"/> to require workers <pause dur="0.2"/> without that kind of <pause dur="0.5"/> bargaining or voluntary contracting <pause dur="0.4"/> # it will they will not be require <pause dur="0.2"/> able to require workers to work <pause dur="0.3"/> for more than forty-eight hours per week <pause dur="0.6"/> now in many European countries that's irrelevant <pause dur="0.3"/> 'cause no one works that <pause dur="0.2"/> or very very few workers <pause dur="0.4"/> work that number of hours per week <pause dur="0.8"/> but the U-K is an outlier <pause dur="0.5"/> at least in Europe <pause dur="0.4"/> for having a very large number of workers <pause dur="0.2"/> who are working very long 
hours <pause dur="0.6"/> and so i'm going to be concerned with <pause dur="0.4"/> addressing the question of <pause dur="0.4"/> why might workers be working very long hours <pause dur="0.2"/> and what might be the impacts of <pause dur="0.3"/> <trunc>br</trunc> introducing legislation on that <pause dur="0.3"/> and the context for examing that # examining those kind of issues will be <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> a comparison or a contrast of competitive models of labour markets with monopsonic models of labour markets <pause dur="0.2"/> in that context <pause dur="0.7"/> and <pause dur="0.9"/> and # underlining the <trunc>emph</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> the importance of that kind of issue <pause dur="0.6"/> in terms of that regulation of of <pause dur="0.3"/> <trunc>eur</trunc> of labour markets within Europe and impacting perhaps exclusively on the U-K <pause dur="0.3"/> at a time when other labour markets in Europe <pause dur="0.3"/> are bringing in national legislation <pause dur="0.4"/> to bring in maximum hours much less than that more like forty thirty-eight or even thirty-seven hours <pause dur="0.5"/> in the case of France <pause dur="0.3"/> Italy and Germany <pause dur="0.5"/> all through different methods <pause dur="0.2"/> some <pause dur="0.3"/> by being imposed by government some by being <pause dur="0.3"/> # voluntarily <pause dur="0.3"/> # negotiated through union and firm kind of arrangements <pause dur="1.2"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> but at the same time as 
that's happening in the U-K <pause dur="0.3"/> we also know that the new Labour government is bringing in minimum wage legislation which is another kind of regulation on the labour market <pause dur="0.3"/> i'm interested in <pause dur="0.3"/> the combination of those two forces <pause dur="0.4"/> on <pause dur="0.3"/> on labour market outcomes in terms of wages hours worked and employment <pause dur="1.0"/> okay <pause dur="0.3"/> so that's one of the <pause dur="0.5"/> # two issues i want to cover in lecture five <pause dur="0.7"/> and the second issue i want to look at <pause dur="0.3"/> is more to do with <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> # it's a <trunc>r</trunc> # a rather narrowly U-K focus <pause dur="0.4"/> and it's geared around some work that i'm doing with Jeremy Smith in the department <pause dur="0.4"/> # in which we're looking at <pause dur="0.4"/> evidence on U-K students <pause dur="0.4"/> and addressing questions like <pause dur="0.5"/> # does your does A your degree performance but <trunc>m</trunc> perhaps more importantly for our focus on this course <pause dur="0.4"/> do your earnings after graduation <pause dur="0.6"/> vary very much <pause dur="0.3"/> with the following kinds of characteristics <pause dur="0.2"/> firstly <pause dur="0.3"/> which university you went to <pause dur="0.3"/> so is there a big premium on going to some universities and not others <pause dur="0.5"/> secondly <pause dur="0.2"/> the subject you've taken <pause dur="0.8"/> 
is there a big premium for economics versus business studies or whatever <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> and thirdly perhaps more interestingly <pause dur="0.3"/> to what extent <pause dur="0.2"/> do your does your labour market outcome <pause dur="0.4"/> depend upon your personal characteristics <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> age and gender being <pause dur="0.2"/> # marital status being one set <pause dur="0.3"/> but others being <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> your <pause dur="0.2"/> schooling schooling information <pause dur="0.3"/> prior to university so <pause dur="0.5"/> does it depend on what kind of school you went to <pause dur="0.7"/> and are there big differences for example between <pause dur="0.3"/> private schools and state schools in your labour market outcomes even for those people who graduate <pause dur="0.6"/> does it also depend upon the degree class you obtain <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> and does it depend upon demographic characteristics or social background characteristics <pause dur="0.4"/> such as the <pause dur="0.4"/> occupational background of the <pause dur="0.3"/> <trunc>f</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> of the parental background from which you <pause dur="0.2"/> you come <pause dur="0.6"/> so that's one set of issues <pause dur="0.2"/> related to that <pause dur="0.5"/> issue <pause dur="0.5"/> is <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> how can we explain different performances in the labour market across different universities <pause dur="0.2"/> if we observe a big premium for 
going to Oxbridge rather than to other universities <pause dur="0.4"/> is that <pause dur="0.3"/> because of some kind of signalling in the labour market some kind of discrimination maybe in the labour market <pause dur="0.4"/> or is it to do with <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> different characteristics of those universities which can be explained <pause dur="0.3"/> which aren't some kind of residual <pause dur="0.3"/> to be attributed perhaps to discrimination <pause dur="0.8"/> okay <pause dur="0.3"/> so those are the things to do to do in lecture five <pause dur="1.1"/> okay <pause dur="0.5"/> so i've spent quite a bit of time motivating lectures two to four to five and had # <trunc>s</trunc> said very little about lecture one so now now let's get <pause dur="0.3"/> down to the <pause dur="0.4"/> business of looking at the material for lecture one <pause dur="1.8"/> so <pause dur="0.9"/> this <pause dur="0.4"/> material <pause dur="3.1"/><kinesic desc="puts on transparency" iterated="n"/> for lecture one and hopefully this is going to be a sufficiently large font size <pause dur="4.1"/> <trunc>o</trunc> our our heading our title is <pause dur="0.2"/> wages bargaining and product market competition <pause dur="0.7"/> with <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> <pause dur="0.2"/> in the first part of # <pause dur="0.6"/> the academic year in this on this course in part one <pause dur="0.4"/>

something which <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/>'s done a lot of work on <pause dur="0.5"/> and <pause dur="0.4"/> and one of his assumptions is that there are rents <pause dur="0.5"/> and then <pause dur="0.7"/> <trunc>a</trunc> and he <trunc>m</trunc> and he <pause dur="0.2"/> demonstrates using a lot of evidence <pause dur="0.4"/> # about the existence of these rents and the and speculates what are the determinants of those rents <pause dur="0.6"/> so he's looked a lot at rent sharing <pause dur="0.6"/> i'm <pause dur="0.7"/> going to be <pause dur="0.3"/> initially asking the question well what does what generates those rents <pause dur="0.3"/> but primarily for us then to address the question <pause dur="0.3"/> of <pause dur="0.7"/> assuming those rents exist <pause dur="0.3"/> <reading>under what conditions are workers best able to capture a share of those rents</reading> <pause dur="0.4"/> 'cause you can imagine situations in which firms are generating huge rents because of monopoly power <pause dur="0.7"/> but that same monopoly power <pause dur="1.7"/> or <pause dur="0.4"/> reasons <pause dur="0.2"/> associated with that monopoly power <pause dur="0.3"/> might give those firms a great bargaining power over workers and prevent those workers from <trunc>ex</trunc> <trunc>ec</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> from generating <pause dur="0.8"/> # a share of those rents <pause dur="0.2"/> from capturing a share 
of those rents <pause dur="0.4"/> okay indeed it might be the case that firms which are very powerful in their product markets <pause dur="0.3"/> also exert enormous <trunc>m</trunc> <pause dur="0.4"/> labour market power <pause dur="0.3"/> and <trunc>com</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> and # which enable them to pay wages below competitive levels <pause dur="1.5"/> so <pause dur="0.5"/> it it doesn't follow that just because rents exist workers are going to be <pause dur="0.2"/> capturing a share of them <pause dur="0.5"/> so we'll be # addressing the question of what <trunc>ena</trunc> <reading>under what conditions are workers best able to capture a share <pause dur="0.3"/> of any such rents</reading> <pause dur="0.3"/> which firms are <kinesic desc="reveals covered part of transparency" iterated="n"/> are are are are are <trunc>re</trunc> are receiving <pause dur="1.4"/> so what are the <trunc>re</trunc> sources of rents on the first <pause dur="0.2"/> of those two questions what are the sources <pause dur="0.4"/> of any such rents <pause dur="1.6"/> the most <pause dur="0.2"/> obvious starting point is to say that <pause dur="0.7"/> imperfect competition in the product market can generate rents <pause dur="2.4"/> two <pause dur="0.6"/> forms of <pause dur="0.2"/> product market imperfect competition would be monopoly and duopoly <pause dur="0.9"/> models <pause dur="1.2"/> of unions the economic theory of the trade union <pause dur="1.1"/> almost exclusively <pause dur="0.2"/> focuses <pause dur="0.4"/> on monopoly <pause dur="0.9"/> okay <pause dur="0.4"/> you will have looked at a number of <pause dur="0.4"/> of 
models <pause dur="0.6"/> where <pause dur="1.1"/> you <trunc>s</trunc> you say that <pause dur="0.7"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="20"/> there's a union <pause dur="0.4"/> downward sloping labour demand curve <pause dur="1.7"/> wages employment <pause dur="0.3"/> and maybe unions have got <trunc>s</trunc> # in a monopoly in a model <pause dur="0.7"/> unions are trying to <pause dur="2.0"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> aim at <pause dur="0.5"/> this utility maximizing point <pause dur="0.4"/> with a wage in excess of <pause dur="0.6"/> some competitive wage <pause dur="0.9"/> and so they're extracting some rents in the form of wages being higher than they otherwise would be <pause dur="0.3"/> and those rents are pretty much assumed to come from <pause dur="0.2"/> monopoly power <pause dur="0.6"/> by firms <pause dur="0.4"/> or <pause dur="0.5"/> if not from that <pause dur="0.3"/> from a second <pause dur="0.3"/><kinesic desc="reveals covered part of transparency" iterated="n"/> source <pause dur="0.4"/> of <trunc>p</trunc> of rents <pause dur="0.4"/> and this is arguably even more common in the literature <pause dur="1.3"/> this this source being <pause dur="0.3"/> the diminishing marginal <pause dur="0.5"/> product of labour <pause dur="0.5"/> okay so <trunc>i</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> in models like that <pause dur="1.0"/> you've <pause dur="0.7"/> the argument goes that the firm's profits <pause dur="0.7"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="15"/> are equal to price <pause dur="0.2"/> which is <pause dur="1.8"/> parametric exogenously given <pause dur="0.8"/> at some competitive price level <pause dur="1.4"/> times output <pause dur="1.4"/> output being some function of labour inputs <pause dur="0.4"/> minus <pause dur="0.8"/> costs <pause dur="0.2"/> 
themselves some function of wages and so often the argument goes that <pause dur="0.3"/> the <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="1"/><kinesic desc="indicates point on board" iterated="n"/> price is parametric price is exogenously given at some competitive price level <pause dur="0.6"/> and then <pause dur="0.8"/> what's enabling workers to have <pause dur="0.3"/> wages above a competitive level <pause dur="0.3"/> is that <pause dur="1.7"/> the production function exhimits exhibits diminishing marginal product of labour <pause dur="5.0"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="4"/> and <pause dur="0.4"/> that then is used <pause dur="0.3"/> to # <pause dur="0.2"/> to generate the result that wages <pause dur="0.6"/> set by unions or bargained between unions and firms <pause dur="0.3"/> might be greater than the competitive level <pause dur="0.6"/> now <pause dur="0.5"/> if you think about <kinesic desc="indicates board" iterated="n"/> that model <pause dur="0.4"/> it's not <pause dur="0.4"/> very satisfying from an empirical point of view <pause dur="0.5"/> because <pause dur="0.3"/> if the <pause dur="0.3"/> product market is <pause dur="0.3"/> competitive <pause dur="0.7"/> then we're going to assume pretty much that at least <pause dur="0.9"/> even in the medium term but certainly in the long run <pause dur="0.3"/> firms are not going to be able to persist in paying <pause dur="0.3"/> wages above competitive levels <pause dur="0.6"/> okay <pause dur="0.4"/> so a much more satisfactory it seems to me <pause dur="0.9"/> motivation for the existence of rents being used to share <pause dur="0.3"/> is the existence of <pause dur="0.3"/> 
imperfect competition in the product market <pause dur="2.2"/> and <pause dur="0.3"/> monopoly is an extreme version of that which the literature <pause dur="0.4"/> has <pause dur="0.2"/> taken on board and has focused on when it's not <pause dur="0.4"/> adopted this kind of approach <pause dur="0.6"/> but of course we know that monopoly is <pause dur="0.5"/> a rather extreme form of market competition perhaps no more likely than perfect competition <pause dur="0.8"/> and <pause dur="0.3"/> it strikes me that oligopoly <pause dur="1.0"/> # i have <trunc>in</trunc> indicated here two firm oligopoly but perhaps <trunc>m</trunc> i should <trunc>s</trunc> more generally say oligopoly <pause dur="0.4"/> is a more likely context to explain the existence of rents being as we capture them <pause dur="0.4"/> so what i'm going to be wanting to do quite early on in <pause dur="0.2"/> <trunc>i</trunc> in this hour <pause dur="0.4"/> is look <pause dur="0.3"/> at <pause dur="0.3"/> extending the traditional model of union-<pause dur="0.2"/>firm bargaining <pause dur="0.3"/> to a context where there's oligopoly <pause dur="0.6"/> and <pause dur="0.4"/> and a reason for doing that is because that forces us <pause dur="0.4"/> to look to think more seriously and more formally about interaction between labour markets and product markets <pause dur="0.3"/> which <kinesic desc="indicates board" iterated="n"/> these kind of models ignore <pause dur="0.7"/> because <pause dur="1.1"/> if <pause dur="0.4"/> we're dealing either with perfect competition where price is 
parametric <pause dur="0.3"/> or with monopoly <pause dur="0.2"/> unless we're thinking about entry deterrents <pause dur="0.3"/> then there there's no strategic behaviour going on in the product market <pause dur="0.6"/> and perfect competition <pause dur="0.5"/> there's no strategic behaviour because you are a such a small part of the big product market you needn't think about the impact of your behaviour <pause dur="0.2"/> on other firms <pause dur="0.6"/> and if you're a monopolist <pause dur="0.2"/> there are no other firms so again there's no strategic behaviour <pause dur="0.5"/> so those two traditional approaches <pause dur="2.1"/> free us from the requirement to <pause dur="0.7"/> or more critically don't <pause dur="0.9"/> encourage us to think <pause dur="0.3"/> more formally about <pause dur="0.2"/> the importance <pause dur="0.2"/> what will be in the real world the important interactions between <pause dur="0.8"/> labour markets and product market outcomes in terms of strategic behaviour <pause dur="0.5"/> let me give you a more concrete example on all of that <pause dur="0.4"/> if we are a workforce <pause dur="0.5"/> if we are a unionized workforce <pause dur="0.2"/> and we are <pause dur="0.2"/> determining what wage to set <pause dur="0.3"/> do we merely think in terms of the wage and employment combinations <pause dur="0.6"/> in some <pause dur="0.2"/> way <pause dur="0.3"/> abstracted from <pause dur="0.6"/> the the 
wider world outside us or do we recognize that the higher is our wage <pause dur="1.2"/> the less <pause dur="0.2"/> potentially at least <pause dur="1.0"/> the the the # <pause dur="0.2"/> potentially at least <pause dur="0.4"/> the higher is our wage <pause dur="0.4"/> the less competitive will be the product market position of our firm in its <pause dur="0.5"/> product market <pause dur="0.2"/> decision making <pause dur="0.5"/> so we <pause dur="0.6"/> perhaps ought to be aware as a union of the dangers of setting a high wage <pause dur="0.9"/> # in terms of the impact that that will have on the product market competition <pause dur="0.5"/> # competitiveness <pause dur="0.5"/> of the firm that we're bargaining with <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.9"/> and so there are strategic behaviours that we should consider and that's what we'll analyse in a few moments <pause dur="0.7"/><kinesic desc="reveals covered part of transparency" iterated="n"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> course other <trunc>f</trunc> <pause dur="0.5"/> other forms <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> of the generation of rents <pause dur="0.3"/> would include imperfect competition in the labour market rather than the product market <pause dur="0.8"/> okay so <pause dur="0.4"/> it might <pause dur="0.8"/> be for example that firms have monopoly power which is <trunc>generat</trunc> monopsony power which is generating rents for them <pause dur="3.1"/> and there is an increasing literature on <pause dur="0.5"/><kinesic desc="reveals covered part of transparency" iterated="n"/> monopsony power <pause dur="3.4"/> or other <trunc>v</trunc> 
other forms of imperfect competition in the labour market might <pause dur="0.3"/> you might interpret efficiency wage models and even insider-outsider models in terms of <pause dur="0.3"/> imperfectly competitive labour markets <pause dur="0.8"/> okay <pause dur="0.5"/> and see those as forms of of rent generation <pause dur="0.4"/> but i'm going to pretty much exclusively concentrate <pause dur="0.4"/> on this issue of oligopoly <pause dur="0.6"/> so what i want to do <pause dur="0.6"/> # <kinesic desc="reveals covered part of transparency" iterated="n"/> within this theoretical motivation <pause dur="0.5"/> is look at actually three models <pause dur="0.7"/> of <pause dur="0.6"/> union-firm bargaining in a wider context of imperfect competition in the product market <pause dur="0.3"/> in order for us to get some feel for the kind of important issues that are <pause dur="0.4"/> that are going on there <pause dur="1.5"/><kinesic desc="reveals covered part of transparency" iterated="n"/> so let's look at the three models the first of and i label the models one-one-one <pause dur="0.3"/> one-one-two and one-one-three <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> and the first two of these <pause dur="0.6"/> are closely related to a paper published by Steve Dowrick in the Economic Journal <pause dur="0.5"/> of nineteen-eighty-nine <pause dur="5.7"/><event desc="takes off transparency" iterated="n"/> okay so let's think first <pause dur="0.2"/> about <pause dur="0.7"/> # <trunc>th</trunc> the model one <pause dur="2.8"/> and model one <pause dur="0.4"/> is <pause dur="0.3"/>

into the profit equation <pause dur="0.7"/> and from the <pause dur="0.4"/> point of view of the handout that's giving you equation four <pause dur="1.0"/> and when we then <pause dur="0.4"/> maximize profits with respect <pause dur="0.2"/> to the choice of <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="9"/> output by <pause dur="0.3"/> firm I <pause dur="0.2"/> so when we look at D-pi-I by D-X-I <pause dur="1.0"/> we get equation five <pause dur="1.1"/> which is A minus <pause dur="0.5"/> W-I <pause dur="0.4"/> A of course is the reservation price from the product demand <pause dur="0.8"/> equation so okay so always be thinking about A as the reservation price <pause dur="0.3"/> intercept on the vertical axis <pause dur="0.6"/> in a price quantity diagram <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> minus the wage that the firm has to pay <pause dur="2.4"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="2"/> minus B which is the slope <pause dur="0.3"/> parameter from the market demand equation <pause dur="0.3"/> times <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="12"/> the following thing <pause dur="0.3"/> X-I <pause dur="1.6"/> times D <pause dur="1.5"/> over the sum of X-Is and i'll explain this in a moment <pause dur="5.5"/> D-X-I <pause dur="0.7"/> plus the sigma <pause dur="0.5"/> X-<pause dur="0.5"/>I I going from one <pause dur="0.5"/> to N <pause dur="2.4"/> and that's the first order condition for product maximizing by the firm <pause dur="0.9"/> # <pause dur="0.8"/> in this way that's equation <pause dur="0.3"/> five from the handout <pause dur="0.9"/> okay you <pause dur="0.3"/> it's relatively straight forward to to to to demonstrate 
this for yourselves i'll leave that as an exercise if anyone wants <pause dur="0.4"/> any guidance on it by all means at any point come and see me <pause dur="0.3"/> i have a generally a an open door policy for people on this course so come by my office any time you like <pause dur="0.9"/> # <pause dur="1.7"/> then what what this is saying <pause dur="0.2"/> is that <pause dur="0.6"/> # if we <pause dur="0.9"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="1"/> if we rearrange it <pause dur="0.5"/> it's <pause dur="0.2"/> becomes easier to <pause dur="0.4"/> to see it # i guess well let's just think about it from this point of view <pause dur="2.0"/> W-<pause dur="0.5"/>I of course <pause dur="0.3"/> is the firm's <pause dur="0.3"/> marginal cost of an extra unit of output <pause dur="0.3"/> terms of having to employ an extra worker <pause dur="1.5"/> and and then the rest of the thing is giving us the <pause dur="0.2"/> the marginal <pause dur="0.4"/> # revenue <pause dur="0.4"/> to the firm from an extra unit of output <pause dur="0.8"/> and that's being made up <pause dur="0.4"/> not only of the <pause dur="0.3"/> price it's going to obtain from any <pause dur="0.5"/> increase in its own output but it has to bear in mind how a change in its output <pause dur="0.4"/> affects <pause dur="0.3"/> the output of other firms so <kinesic desc="indicates point on board" iterated="n"/> this is where the conjectural variation parameter's going to come in <pause dur="2.1"/> and let's let's see that <pause dur="0.9"/> this thing here <pause dur="0.4"/><kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> oops i've <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="1"/> missed
