<u who="nm5300">okay I'm not going to speak for very long here but I should just talk # # a bit about the the the exact aims of this morning this morning's event # and I think # we can # narrow it down into to three main aims so you are going to be working # in in groups as i say all through this term and all through the year and you may not know the other people in that group very well yet you've probably met some of them but it's # it's really # an icebreaker to get to know the other people in your group that's a <trunc>goo</trunc>  good start for getting to work with them so that's one of the first important things # </u>
<u who="su">have you got any <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/></u>
<u who="nm5300"># second # main aim then so that the first is just to get to know the other people secondly and that # # i think even you'd agree that's that would already be a good achievement second aim is then to improve your teamwork hopefully by the end of the morning you will have some thoughts about what you can do in the future to make sure the teams you are working in work better and thirdly and maybe the most importantly we really hope you can have a bit of fun this morning the sun's out again it's going to be nice and warm some of the activities as I told you yesterday well all the activities are outside so # enjoy yourselves <trunc>an</trunc>  and and have a good time we've got a series of activities # lined up for you as i said <trunc>th</trunc>  these are going to take place outside and # what the the format of the morning really is that you you do the activity and then hopefully afterwards # with the help of your group facilitator you'll learn something about # how you worked as a team in during that activity and maybe learn some lessons or maybe not but at least hopefully you'll have fun and get to know the other people in in your group okay # this exercise is not assessed # however there will be a photographic record of it that's about the # # the only thing we can say # and in this morning you are particularly lucky not just to have still photographs taken which # which # happened yesterday and <trunc>w</trunc>  will happen to all groups but # you can see we've also got some # # got some # looks like a whole team of movie cameras here okay so we've got four groups here today i think it should be groups one two three and four yes </u>

<gap reason="new phase of event" extent="uncertain"/>
<u who="nf5302">okay i think we should we should stop this this is going to get better as we go along we will have a chance # after the first activity to get to know each other a bit better this is just to kind  of wake us up a little bit and # get ready for the first activity so if you sit down there's not going to be a whole load of briefing here # but each activity will be followed by an important activity and the important activity is thinking about what you did so i can warn you before we start there's two things going on here you're trying to achieve a task which are challenging and you're going to develop yourself as a team and your own role within the team so you are looking at three things getting it done working as a team and <trunc>be</trunc>  being aware of your own contribution so after each activity i will be asking you to think along these three lines i think that's probably enough</u>
<gap reason="new phase of event" extent="uncertain"/>
<u who="nm5301">so the point is to learn how to work in teams and how learn something about your own the way you learn yourself # so some ground rules we need to start off with simply you know to establish how we are going to work for today one of the ones down at the bottom here you might want to be sort of thinking if you are going to stand there that's quite a good one maintain confidentiality what happens today is for you and you alone don't go round telling people about it unless you've got permission of the people you know you're telling about don't sort of say somebody did this and it was great and they did that and somebody was stupid because they did this just don't do that please maintain confidentiality about everything unless you've got permission from the rest of the people who are in the group anyway so the idea is we're going to take you're going to start to take well learn how to take responsibility for your own learning you are at university you are actually all legally adults now i think unless anybody's is seventeen no you're all eighteen you're all legally adults you all you can all vote there's not much you can't do in this country you can't drive a HGV i think that's one of the few things you can't do you're legally adults we're going to encourage you to take responsibility for your own learnings by the time you've left us with a degree you're fully functioning # well fully functioning adults gloss over that quickly you're fully functioning # learn and you know how to # educate yourself as well as be educated by other people so in order to # maintain a work <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> one of the things you're going to have to to do is speak for yourself don't be bullied by other people don't be bullied by me speak for yourself but at the same time keep an open mind if somebody's saying something maybe you want to listen to that person before you sort of butt in and sort of say no you're wrong or i know how to do it or something like that be honest</u>
<gap reason="new phase of event" extent="uncertain"/>
<u who="nf5302">in other words be honest about your # successes and failures so listen to others it's quite a skill actually listening some of us are better at talking be constructive when you're making critical comments say how it could be better rather than what went wrong so so try to sort of talk about how you would improve, rather than saying i don't like that</u>
<gap reason="new phase of event" extent="uncertain"/>
<u who="nm5301"># maintain confidentiality i mentioned and final thing safety we're not doing anything particularly dangerous today but if i say stop you stop please you don't think about it you stop </u>
<gap reason="new phase of event" extent="uncertain"/>
<u who="nf5302">now to anything you think's missing from this list is there anything you'd like to put on are you all happy with this happy to use this as a kind of code of practice # this is part i'm quite keen on #  it's it's about learning about yourself i suppose # i think this is about as much as we need to do alright then we're on time so we're going to go down to the first activity which is down there so if you need coats or jumpers you don't need to take anything else with you </u>
<gap reason="new phase of event" extent="uncertain"/>
<u who="nm5301">so we're going to go out and do an exercise it will not be dangerous </u>
<u who="sf5304">is this room going to be locked</u>
<u who="nm5301">no it won't be locked but you can bring your bags and put them outside and they'll be fine just i don't know</u>
<gap reason="new phase of event" extent="uncertain"/>
<u who="nf5302">the only thing that needs to be said about this is that all the instructions you need are on the piece of paper # so you don't need to refer to any of us lurking unless it's something you know urgent to do with you know you've broken your ankle or something but otherwise you're on your own and all the information you need is here but we want to have some responsibility of telling you when things finish</u>
<u who="su">yes and there will be strict penalties</u>
<u who="nf5302">and <trunc>the</trunc>  these are very strictly time limited as i pointed out before okay so whoever's going to take these instructions okay </u>
<u who="su"><gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/></u>
<u who="nf5302">okay</u>
<u who="su">i'll read them out loud</u>
<u who="nf5302">you're on your own you come with me</u>
<u who="sf5306">your company is bidding to build a pipeline connecting a recently discovered oil field to on-shore facilities on the north east coast of Scotland your team has been invited to take part in the final qualifying round to select members of the project team final selection will be judged on the degree to which team working skills are displayed during this task the task is to be <trunc>establi</trunc>  is to establish a pipeline to carry material between the recently commissioned positioned on one side of the room to the on-shore collection facilities on the other side of the room. </u>
<u who="su">is that the bucket </u>
<u who="sf5306">is that the bucket right</u>
<gap reason="new phase of event" extent="uncertain"/>
<u who="sm5318">the task will be completed when four mini-barrels containing black gold have been successfully transferred via the pipeline into the reservoir the gap marked with tape represents the North Sea and anything or anyone touching the ground in-between the tape will be swept away therefore the pipeline must remain suspended at all times and should have a minimum of three human supporters when completed</u>

<u who="su">right okay</u>
<u who="sf5306">right so therefore the pipeline must be remain suspended at all times and should have a minimum of three human supporters when completed </u>
<gap reason="new phase of event" extent="uncertain"/>
<u who="sm5318">supporters can stand on islands represented by the tiles but only one person can stand on an island at any one time however you are fortunate in that you can position these to suit your favoured route they represent the only way to cross the gap in safety there are various resources available to you but there are also some constraints </u>
<gap reason="new phase of event" extent="uncertain"/>
<u who="sm5319">materials are available for constructing the pipeline lengths of high quality pipe and highly sophisticated connectors pipes and connectors are the only materials which can be used to construct the pipeline which must have no gaps pipes can be joined together using the special connectors the <trunc>m</trunc>  mini-barrels can be can only be transferred across the North Sea by travelling through the pipeline only one mini-barrel can be transferred at a time </u>
<gap reason="new phase of event" extent="uncertain"/>
<u who="sf5306">in order to stimulate the hazards in the real environment simulate even the mini-barrels can only be handled by somebody wearing the correct safety gear to protect the eyes blindfolds please note whenever the blindfolds are worn these people will need constant supervision you have twenty-five minutes</u>
<u who="su"> jesus this is pretty difficult</u>
<gap reason="new phase of event" extent="uncertain"/>

<u who="sm5318">where are the mini-barrels </u>
<u who="su">i don't know </u>
<u who="su">i don't know </u>
<u who="su">that's the bucket what's it you know that's</u>
<u who="su">they get they get given to us when we finish <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> </u>
<u who="sf5306">yeah it's going to go all over the place <vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" dur="2"/></u>
<u who="su">and it's a maximum of three people </u>
<u who="su">how are we supposed to get </u>
<u who="su">is it a maximum is it</u>
<u who="sf5310">was it a minimum minimum or maximum </u>
<u who="su">minimum</u>
<u who="su">three people but</u>
<u who="sm5318">these are the islands so you have to get people you have to get these islands across</u>
<u who="sm5320">just grab a handful and use them as stepping stones like two or whatever is it there's three</u>
<u who="sm5318">there's one person on each island </u>
<u who="su">yeah </u>
<u who="sm5318">but you can have three people in the middle </u>
<u who="su">so you can have three minimum</u>
<u who="sm5318">minimum of three it's going to be more than three</u>
<gap reason="new phase of event" extent="uncertain"/>
<u who="su5322">yeah these islands so we connect it but you can only have three people holding it and we're not allowed to go in </u>
<u who="sf5309">and the pipe's not allowed to touch the ground then </u>
<u who="su5322">the pipe's not allowed to touch the ground </u>
<u who="su">what </u>
<u who="sm5319">yeah that's alright we'll just hold it # so you have to connect these pipes using what sorry was it</u>
<u who="su5322">these bits </u>
<u who="sm5319">these</u>
<u who="su">which are all bent </u>
<u who="su">but they're all bent so we so we can't even have a straight line</u>
<u who="sm5319"><gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> you what</u>
<u who="sf5309">kind of fiddling</u>
<u who="sm5319">oh yeah</u>
<u who="su">how many of these have we got </u>
<u who="su">six </u>
<u who="sm5319">six yeah </u>
<u who="su">ok have we got enough bits for the pipe </u>
<u who="su5322">zigzag but if there's six ok yeah so then we'd have like three corners we'd have three a person on each corner but if that's going to be <trunc>trans</trunc>  if the ball's got to go through we've got to like have a it on a bit of a bit of a  tilt but we could i suppose we could all like tilt if its a zigzag like if i'm holding like this triangle here i can just lift it up and it will go down </u>
<gap reason="new phase of event" extent="uncertain"/>
<u who="sm5320">so we've got five so we can have six pipes </u>
<u who="sm5318">we've got four long ones and four small ones </u>
<u who="su5326">so you want the long one like that and then short one then long one yeah</u>
<u who="su5325">yeah that makes sense</u>
<u who="sm5318">if you want the long one yeah long one straight up and the short ones across </u>
<u who="sm5320">so we've got to roll a little thing down it so it's got to go downhill </u>
<u who="su5325">yeah so it's got to</u>
<u who="sm5318">yeah but you can move it </u>
<u who="su">oh can you</u>
<u who="su5326">yeah we've got people holding it</u>
<u who="su5325">somebody can just sort of  who's down here just hold it up and</u>
<u who="sm5318">if you have one person in each corner then you can move it down to the next corner yeah</u>
<gap reason="new phase of event" extent="uncertain"/>
<u who="su">these are all the same yeah</u>
<u who="su">they're not at right-angles are they</u>
<u who="su">it's not quite a corner is it</u>
<u who="su">who are the blindfolded people</u>
<u who="su">they are the only people that can touch the barrels</u>
<gap reason="new phase of event" extent="uncertain"/>
<u who="sm5319">and what are the mini-barrels</u>
<u who="su5322">and then is it the golf ball </u>
<u who="sm5319">okay well</u>
<u who="su">isn't that gold black gold</u>
<u who="sm5319">the mini-barrels can only be handled by someone wearing the correct safety gear</u>
<u who="su5322">so that means you have to put it in the end i think and we have to like tip it and as it's going down you have to be guided to collect at the other end so we have to like hold it about half way along so you can go through but we're only allowed one person on each of those islands so you're going to have to go on one on your own and someone's going to have to guide you on it and off it</u>
<gap reason="new phase of event" extent="uncertain"/>
<u who="su5325">so where are the</u>
<u who="sm5312">yeah where are the barrels</u>
<u who="sf5306">one at this side one at the other side to collect and put it in</u>
<u who="sf5310">yeah</u>
<u who="su">right</u>
<u who="sm5318">so we're going to have to have one yeah</u>
<u who="sm5320">we should all just get in a line and just push it along </u>
<u who="su">unless you want to make the pipe line first</u>
<u who="sm5320">yeah build it over here and just pass it along</u>
<u who="sm5312">yeah and then like put the islands out</u>
<u who="su5326">yeah get people in position then</u>
<u who="sf5306">yeah then we can pass the pieces across</u>
<u who="su">yeah</u>
<gap reason="new phase of event" extent="uncertain"/>
<u who="sf5306">i take it as soon as we get across the sea you can stand on that side without the islands</u>
<u who="sm5321">so would it be a good idea if we split into two groups and we build half the pipe work each end</u>
<u who="sm5313">you can't get round</u>
<u who="sf5305">you can't</u>
<u who="sm5321">we can go across with the islands can't we</u>
<u who="sm5313">yeah one person sort can pick up all of them <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/></u>
<u who="sm5321">is that a good idea or not</u>
<u who="sm5313">and # we're going to have to make the islands in a zigzag pattern</u>
<u who="su">yeah</u>
<u who="sm5315">yeah i think that that's probably best if we did half and half idea in the middle</u>
<u who="sm5314">now we've got an idea of like the zigzag of it</u>
<u who="sf5306">are we allowed to move the islands once we've laid them down</u>
<u who="sm5314">no</u>
<u who="su">we're not</u>
<u who="sm5314">no i don't think so</u>
<u who="sf5306">well</u>
<u who="sm5315">it doesn't say that</u>
<u who="sm5314">what does it say <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> i don't know</u>
<u who="sf5306">it says that however you are fortunate you can position these to suit your favoured route so it doesn't say you can't change them it just says one on each island so you can yeah lie it down step on that one then</u>
<u who="sf5305">lift that one up and <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/></u>
<gap reason="new phase of event" extent="uncertain"/>
<u who="su5322">see isn't that the island that we're getting to and then we're bringing them over here cause of course we wouldn't start on the island would we so we have to get over there get them and bring them back oh blimey</u>
<gap reason="new phase of event" extent="uncertain"/>
<u who="sm5321">so we've had about ten minutes or we could # do you reckon we could get a route through that we just don't know how many zigzags yet do we</u>
<u who="sf5305">if we make</u>
<u who="sf5306">yeah you can't well</u>
<u who="sm5315">it's not too it's not really that much of a zigzag really cause it comes back</u>
<u who="sm5321">you can make it come back on itself</u>
<u who="sm5315">so it's just it's not it's pretty straight basically really</u>
<u who="sm5314">it's a bit of a jump though you won't be able to get across will you</u>
<u who="sm5315">this is yeah</u>
<u who="su">you have to it doesn't look far but it is</u>
<u who="sm5315">so basically we need an island there island there island there</u>
<u who="su">we've got eight islands</u>
<u who="su">well not if you're building it first</u>
<u who="sm5315">suppose</u>
<u who="sf5306">you don't need a <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> if you're building it first</u>
<u who="sm5315">oh i suppose yeah yeah true true</u>
<u who="su">no you could just go straight across can't we </u>
<u who="sf5306">you just need one like there and one there</u>
<u who="su">we could build them in a line i don't know</u>
<u who="sm5315">it's probably best for someone to be holding it there there</u>
<u who="su">yeah</u>
<gap reason="new phase of event" extent="uncertain"/>
<u who="su5322">all you have to do is get all you have to do is get from there to here that's all</u>
<u who="sm5319">or you could go over there and get it</u>
<u who="su5322">you're the only one that can touch them so you have to get from there to here but like before the ball gets here if that makes sense so we can hold the pipes but we can't touch what's inside there </u>
<u who="su5323">touch what these pipes</u>
<u who="sm5319">no the stuff over there</u>
<u who="su5323">oh is there something over there ah now i get it right</u>
<u who="su5322">but we could we don't have to do them one at a time it cause says four so we could put them all in and we just have to like wait while she jumps</u>
<u who="sf5311">i thought we did have to <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/></u>
<u who="su5322">oh do we </u>
<u who="sf5311">i don't know</u>
<u who="su5322">i think we best read it</u>
<gap reason="new phase of event" extent="uncertain"/>
<u who="sm5315">in the middle of the long ones or actually at the joints i don't know where is it</u>
<u who="sm5313">cause if we going to be passing the barrels from the middle we're going to have someone to direct them okay i think we should build it first </u>
<u who="sf5306">so do you want to yeah i think we should build it</u>
<u who="su">okay</u>
<u who="su">let's build it</u>
<u who="sm5314">well the half and half could work though cause if you joined up in the middle </u>
<u who="sf5305">well what if they don't meet in the middle</u>
<u who="su">and we're standing there</u>
<u who="sm5315">we're standing on the islands and it's like # cause otherwise it's just going to probably fall down</u>
<u who="su">it'll be difficult to yeah</u>
<u who="sf5306">yeah okay then so</u>
<u who="sm5315">if we try and get half to the other side </u>
<u who="sm5314">hold up that means we've got to try and do the islands remember</u>
<u who="sm5315">right but you can move it</u>
<u who="sf5306">but it doesn't say we can't move the islands as long as say you have two so</u>
<gap reason="new phase of event" extent="uncertain"/>
<u who="su5324">it goes there's only one mini-barrel can be transferred at a time </u>
<u who="su5322">it does yeah it does oh damn so best quick are we allowed are they telling us when we've when we've cause it should've been five minutes</u>
<u who="sm5319">oh right okay right should we construct this thing then i don't know yeah should we make this then</u>
<u who="su">should we just check so we don't get told off</u>
<u who="su5322">Dave has it been five minutes cause it</u>
<u who="nm5303">haven't you been keeping time</u>
<u who="su5322">i have but i'm just wondering if you were meant to be telling us when five minutes is up five minutes is up go go go</u>
<gap reason="new phase of event" extent="uncertain"/>
<u who="sm5314">can someone just one person</u>
<u who="sf5306">always make sure that you can reach </u>
<u who="sf5305">the one in front of you so you throw it</u>
<u who="sm5314">what's that should someone just take all of them and make a make a path across for now</u>
<u who="sm5313">yeah</u>
<u who="sf5306">okay then who wants to do that then</u>
<u who="sm5313">and then we can just sort of like keep a spare island in case we need to change it a bit </u>
<u who="sm5319">who wants to go first</u>
<u who="su">if we stand like this we could book a <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> session</u>
<u who="sf5306">who's good at jumping</u>
<u who="sm5314"># go on then</u>
<u who="sf5306">you alright</u>
<u who="su">should we</u>
<u who="sf5305">don't put <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/></u>
<u who="sm5314">so i'll put my first one there</u>
<u who="sf5306">well can't yeah</u>
<gap reason="new phase of event" extent="uncertain"/>
<u who="su5322">so we need three we need three that are just for people</u>
<u who="su5323">have someone in the middle</u>
<u who="su">yeah</u>
<u who="su5322">and then we need some for us to walk on</u>
<u who="sm5319">mm</u>
<u who="su">yeah</u>
<u who="su5322">do you know what i mean</u>
<u who="su5324">well if there's three for people to stand on that'd be five for you to walk on</u>
<u who="su5322">so Vince if you take two tiles one for you to stand on </u>
<u who="sm5319">yes</u>
<u who="su"> how are we going to chuck them right over there water along there</u>
<u who="sm5319">no chuck them and they'll</u>
<u who="su5322">no you need to take more you need to take if you take a lot and as you go</u>
<u who="sm5319">oh crap # should i do that now</u>
<u who="su">they're not all </u>
<u who="su">do you not need one </u>
<u who="sm5319">well #</u>
<u who="su5322">you need to make a route for you to walk across and that we can use when we walk and then also drop some for the people who are going to stand on them to use</u>
<u who="su5323">but only one person can stand on an island at a time so if he's standing at the other end and he's trying to get across</u>
<u who="sm5319">so how <trunc>ma</trunc> </u>
<u who="su5322">okay we need two separate so we need one for people one for us to walk across there and back and then one for the people who are just going to stand there and hold pipes</u>
<u who="sm5319">yeah cause as there are going to be zigzags you've got to make it in the right place</u>
<u who="su5322">yeah</u>
<u who="sm5319">so i don't know how to judge how cause i haven't even seen it really</u>
<u who="su5322">do you think we should set it up as a practice </u>
<u who="su">yeah let </u>
<u who="su">i think we should #</u>
<u who="su5322">so we can see how big it is and see how far away it is</u>
<u who="su5323">do we have a time limit this time</u>
<u who="su">twenty-five minutes</u>
<u who="sm5319">twenty-five minutes yeah</u>
<u who="su">it's probably about twenty minutes left</u>
<u who="nm5303">it's twenty-five minutes total</u>
<u who="sf5311">should we use the long one's</u>
<u who="su5322">oh twenty twenty-five minutes in total so we've actually only got about blimey okay quick oh i can't do it</u>
<u who="su">are we doing it in a zigzag shape or </u>
<u who="su5323">that's on it'll stay</u>
<u who="su">there you go </u>
<u who="su5322">yeah</u>
<u who="su">maybe this one's mm</u>
<u who="su5323">are we going to connect that up to here</u>
<u who="sf5311">what am i doing</u>
<u who="su">hold on no</u>
<u who="sm5319">you need the other end yeah</u>
<u who="su">the other end</u>
<u who="su5322">are they all the same length</u>
<u who="sm5319">no </u>
<u who="sf5309">no</u>
<u who="su">that one's shorter</u>
<u who="su">strange</u>
<u who="su5322">oo it's really tall</u>
<u who="sf5309">that should about hold it shouldn't it</u>
<u who="su">yeah that'll be alright</u>
<gap reason="new phase of event" extent="uncertain"/>
<u who="su">careful to not get drifted along</u>
<u who="su">does that mean we lose you if you like you're out of <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/></u>
<u who="sf5305">it's quite far away isn't it</u>
<u who="sm5315">it is isn't it</u>
<u who="sm5321">should we carry on with the building</u>
<u who="sm5315">oh yeah yeah yeah why are we just watching him doing it </u>
<u who="su">no i think that bit that's probably half of it </u>
<u who="sf5306">when you're over there do you want to make sure that the barrels are in the bucket</u>
<u who="sm5315">there's three small one's and two big one's so i think that's probably half of it already</u>
<u who="sm5321">so we might as well just</u>
<u who="sf5305">sorry sorry sorry</u>
<u who="sm5314">yeah they're all there</u>
<u who="sf5306">yeah cool how many </u>
<u who="sm5314">lots</u>
<u who="sf5306">oh good cause i thought we might be racing against them but </u>
<u who="sm5314">they're golf balls though</u>
<u who="sf5306">alright okay </u>
<u who="sm5315">should i start taking this lot over </u>
<u who="sf5306">right if they're got to if you've got to get them through surely it'll be a slight slant on it for them to roll down</u>
<u who="sf5305">yeah so somebody tall has to stay here no no tall over there</u>
<u who="sm5315">someone tall has to go over there</u>
<u who="sf5305">over there</u>
<u who="sf5306">so the tall person's got to go over there</u>
<u who="sm5315">so you have to go over that's okay</u>
<u who="sm5321">right i'll take the two</u>
<gap reason="new phase of event" extent="uncertain"/>
<u who="su5326">we're using initiative here and copying</u>
<u who="su5325">if you use like bigger steps you can probably</u>
<u who="sf5306">we could just leave them down</u>
<u who="su"> yeah we don't have to collect them up</u>
<u who="sf5306">cause if the if the gaps are big enough for it to stretch all the way</u>
<gap reason="new phase of event" extent="uncertain"/>
<u who="sm5315">she stays here she's smallest</u>
<u who="sf5306">do you want to try and join it then we might have to move the islands</u>
<u who="sf5305">well while we're joining them together in the middle if i go and stand there so that i can support it while the person in the middle joins them together do you know what i mean</u>
<u who="sm5315">yeah yeah </u>
<u who="sf5305">yeah</u>
<u who="sm5315">okay so you shall i go in the middle</u>
<u who="sf5306">do do we have another connector</u>
<gap reason="new phase of event" extent="uncertain"/>
<u who="su5323">oh no</u>
<u who="sm5319">that'll do </u>
<u who="su5323">mind the North Sea i'll provide entertainment at the other end</u>
<u who="sf5309">here we go</u>
<u who="su">do you need another one of those thingys</u>
<u who="su5322">do we need this many oh i suppose it's quite a long way and then maybe have a little one to like drop it oh no cause we won't have hang on see if you can hold this with three people who's going to hold this</u>
<u who="sm5319">am i holding it as well yeah</u>
<u who="su">yeah you too</u>
<u who="su5322">well we'd be washed away by now</u>
<u who="sf5309">yes we would </u>
<u who="su5322">they're not very # i don't think really these are top market connectors</u>
<gap reason="new phase of event" extent="uncertain"/>
<u who="sf5305">maybe we should just get them to hold it at the connecting point</u>
<u who="sm5313">yeah</u>
<u who="sf5305">woah</u>
<u who="sm5313">woah</u>
<u who="sf5306">we can do it so you just pass one bit at a time</u>
<u who="sf5305">one bit a time should we send half of it through</u>
<u who="sm5313">okay should i just sort of like</u>
<u who="sf5306">don't drop it</u>
<u who="sm5313">okay what am i</u>
<u who="sf5306">right</u>
<u who="su">you can connect it in bits don't worry about that</u>
<u who="su">yeah you connect it in bits</u>
<u who="sf5306">someone else has got to hold up</u>
<gap reason="new phase of event" extent="uncertain"/>
<u who="su5322">so</u>
<u who="sm5319">am i making the little islands then</u>
<u who="su5322"><trunc>we</trunc>  okay one person needs to stay at the end just in case it's not long enough so they can feed it on and connect</u>
<u who="sm5319">so i might as well at the end if i'm doing those island things no yes i don't know</u>
<u who="su5322">so so are we going to do we can use five of them to like make a route for us to walk on</u>
<u who="sm5319">yeah</u>
<u who="su5322">and then you just need three so they've got to be this far apart so maybe maybe sort of like a route thing and do one for yourself to stand on and then we'll have to like feed the pipe and us two can go over with the pipe sounds really easy doesn't it</u>
<gap reason="new phase of event" extent="uncertain"/>
<u who="sf5306">do you need to go up another one</u>
<u who="sm5315">#</u>
<u who="sm5313">i think one of them's going to have to come onto the island</u>
<u who="sm5315">yeah yeah so if you move <trunc>o</trunc>  move over move up you both move up one basically whilst you are carrying it that's what you've got to do </u>
<u who="sf5306">okay</u>
<u who="sm5315">but do you understand no</u>
<u who="sf5306">yeah connect this take that one from her</u>
<u who="sm5315">need a connector haven't got a connector guys</u>
<u who="sm5313">here</u>
<u who="sm5315">got to go back</u>
<u who="sm5313">hold on a <trunc>sec</trunc> </u>
<u who="sm5315">go back</u>
<u who="sf5306">no no just take one off that end</u>
<gap reason="new phase of event" extent="uncertain"/>
<u who="sm5319"># how how much further shall i  oh is it three at a time no it's not</u>
<u who="su">try and make it sort of zig-zagish shape</u>
<u who="sm5319">just copy them then zigzagish </u>
<u who="sm5319">probably not</u>
<gap reason="new phase of event" extent="uncertain"/>
<u who="sm5312">wait a <trunc>sec</trunc>  have you got it</u>
<u who="sm5315">yeah you've moved it away now can you</u>
<u who="sm5321">let's push this forward</u>
<u who="sm5315">i still need to move round a little bit more</u>
<u who="sm5321">which way do you want us to go</u>
<u who="sm5315">that way</u>
<gap reason="new phase of event" extent="uncertain"/>
<u who="sm5315">come on</u>
<u who="sm5321">just do it roughly and just as long as the balls don't fall out should i do the blindfold bit</u>
<u who="sm5315">alright okay this is the best as it's going to be </u>
<u who="sf5306">right</u>
<u who="sm5315">okay give it a go</u>
<u who="sm5321">right</u>
<u who="sf5306">you've got to hold right</u>
<u who="sm5321">i'm directing now</u>
<u who="sf5306">we need to hold that part up a bit more</u>
<u who="sf5305">can i pull it a bit this way</u>
<u who="sf5306">i think we're going to have to like twist it</u>
<u who="sm5315">yeah yeah that would be a lot easier if you pulled it that way pulled it that way</u>
<u who="sf5305">can you yeah but i don't want to </u>
<u who="sm5315">a bit more</u>
<u who="sf5306">it doesn't say you can't put it under the tape put it under the tape</u>
<u who="sm5313">can i do that</u>
<u who="sf5306">you can now</u>
<u who="su">guys you need to direct him</u>
<u who="sm5315">alright okay #</u>
<u who="sf5306">right you'll have to direct him </u>
<u who="sm5315">can you hold it here</u>
<u who="sf5306">you're all going to have to move up one and you're going have to can you rest it in the bucket</u>
<u who="sf5305">no it's not long enough i need to it</u>
<u who="sm5313">can you twist it </u>
<u who="sf5305">oh</u>
<u who="sm5313">yeah okay that's fine </u>
<gap reason="new phase of event" extent="uncertain"/>
<u who="sm5319">do you want a zigzag yeah</u>
<u who="su5322">well no not isn't this just for us to walk on and then we're going to put three down for us to #</u>
<u who="sm5319">oh yeah yeah good point</u>
<u who="sf5311">just do a walking path </u>
<u who="su5322">so imagine it's like just for us to walk</u>
<u who="sm5319">so do you want five</u>
<u who="sf5309">just five yeah five</u>
<u who="sf5311">we're not going to get it</u>
<u who="sf5309">i think you need to </u>
<u who="sm5319">yeah i think it's going to need to be spread out more</u>
<u who="sf5309">yeah</u>
<u who="sf5311">yeah definitely</u>
<u who="su5322">you're going to have to do this with a blindfold on jumping from these woo</u>
<u who="su">don't think i <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/></u>
<u who="sm5319">okay do you reckon you could handle that gap</u>
<u who="su5322">oh no bigger than that otherwise we're never going to get that's four of them already</u>
<u who="su">bigger gaps</u>
<u who="sm5319">let's be perfectly honest you're not going to be able to make it if it's like properly wide out alright you want it about there so you # hang on so you want to try and get from here to there</u>
<u who="su5322">no not that far a little bit closer</u>
<u who="sm5319">oh there</u>
<u who="su">that's quite good</u>
<gap reason="new phase of event" extent="uncertain"/>
<u who="sm5314">i've got to put the blindfold on</u>
<u who="sf5305">can you give me a little bit more</u>
<u who="sm5315">it's coming out a little bit here</u>
<gap reason="new phase of event" extent="uncertain"/>
<u who="sm5317">okay</u>
<u who="sf5308">i think right we should have</u>
<u who="sm5317">one of you is holding and you is blindfold you're going to be in the sea you're going to be in the sea so i'll be this side so you need to be further towards there</u>
<u who="su">okay have you got two can you walk on two</u>
<u who="su">yeah i can walk on two</u>
<u who="su">i've got some more over here</u>
<u who="sm5317">so she's going to be roughly a bit closer than where she is now and then we can pass the pipe across and start with <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/></u>
<u who="su">do you want some more tiles</u>
<u who="su"># hang on</u>
<gap reason="new phase of event" extent="uncertain"/>
<u who="sf5310">so</u>
<u who="su5325">we might not need that short bit</u>
<u who="sf5310">no i don't think we do do we</u>
<u who="su5325">no</u>
<u who="sm5318">so</u>
<u who="su5325">right now we're standing here</u>
<u who="sf5310">so where's the barrels</u>
<u who="su5325">right the barrels are in that bucket</u>
<u who="sf5310">are they can we use that</u>
<u who="su5325">that bucket over there</u>
<u who="sf5310">so someone needs to get some</u>
<u who="su5325">how many yeah <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> four</u>
<u who="sf5310"># deliver your oil</u>
<u who="su"> how many barrels do we have to get across</u>
<u who="su5325">four </u>
<gap reason="new phase of event" extent="uncertain"/>
<u who="su">Charles can you support that end if he goes with him</u>
<u who="su">we could pass an island along</u>
<u who="su5325">hang on Laura</u>
<u who="sf5306">yeah</u>
<u who="su5325">can you pass that one along</u>
<u who="sf5306">sure</u>
<u who="su5325">that's probably quite an <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/></u>
<u who="sf5306">no it won't</u>
<u who="su5325">oh no we can't </u>
<u who="sf5306">it won't reach</u>
<gap reason="new phase of event" extent="uncertain"/>
<u who="sm5319">are you are you alright</u>
<u who="su5322">we nearly got washed away</u>
<u who="nm5303">that's your last chance next time a person's going to be swept away</u>
<u who="su">can you reach this</u>
<u who="su">hang on</u>
<u who="sm5319">or you can just put them down and step on them and pick them up again</u>
<u who="su5322">like this </u>
<u who="su5323">yeah and it's easier</u>
<u who="sf5309">who's going over to hold it now</u>
<u who="su">okay you need to you know tell <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> that </u>
<u who="sm5319">oh dear this is</u>
<u who="su5323">pick one up and pass it along</u>
<u who="su5322">yeah</u>
<gap reason="new phase of event" extent="uncertain"/>
<u who="sf5306">yeah one at a time so don't put any more in until we say</u>

<u who="su">yeah this is the third</u>
<u who="sf5311">i'll shimmy back and then</u>
<u who="sm5319">or you could stand on that and then just chuck it over</u>
<u who="sf5311">could do yeah</u>
<u who="sm5319"> well we dropped it on the floor</u>
<u who="su">oh no</u>
<u who="su">did you</u>
<u who="su5324">we've got four in here </u>
<u who="sf5309">we've got four</u>
<u who="su5324">yeah</u>
<u who="sm5319">basically should we just throw the pipes back</u>
<u who="sf5311">should we yeah undo the pipes and just throw them chuck them back</u>
<u who="sf5309">okay</u>
<u who="su5324">oh are we undoing them</u>
<u who="sf5309">put the bucket down</u>
<u who="su">just like feed it along so</u>
<u who="sf5309">hang on</u>
<u who="su5322">do either of you go if you go down are you splitting it up</u>
<u who="su5324">yeah</u>
<u who="sm5319">sort of javelin throw it</u>
<u who="sf5311">have you got it </u>
<u who="su5324">you got it</u>
<u who="sf5309">yeah this big one might come undone</u>
<u who="su5324">i've got it i've got it don't worry no i don't</u>
<u who="su5322">one of those kind of you know that Persil advert where they're all like they were really pleased with the result then he had been told</u>
<u who="sf5309">we didn't really need it though did we</u>
<u who="su5323">if i reach out and out it there grab out and move it</u>
<u who="su5322">la la la oh i can't touch it i haven't got my blindfold on can i have another one please la la la that's quite a good island</u>
<u who="sm5319">what's the time quarter to twelve </u>
<u who="sm5319">yeah i know i know yeah i know what you mean actually they're blatantly they're just laughing at us but</u>
<u who="su5322">look at that team over # #</u>
<u who="sm5319">admittedly we did look a bit stupid when the pipe broke and our ball fell off</u>
<u who="su5324">and their pipes looked perfect did you see their pipe it looked perfect like all properly positioned and everything</u>
<u who="su5323">really</u>
<u who="nm5303">how long's the time who's the timekeeper</u>
<u who="sm5319">yeah how long was it</u>
<u who="su5322">oh we took far too long well no actually no bang on </u>
<u who="nm5303">bang on</u>
<u who="su5322">exactly half an hour to do the whole lot</u>
<u who="sm5319">we were allowed twenty-five minutes </u>
<u who="nm5303">seeing as i told you you've got twenty-five minutes bang on </u>
<u who="su5322">oh no shame</u>
<u who="sm5319">no don't you mean half an hour including the five minutes of planning it yeah that's right</u>
<gap reason="new phase of event" extent="uncertain"/>
<u who="sm5313">okay already there</u>
<u who="nf5302">ok it was just to get your first thoughts down before you started to share them so in terms of this activity # what's your overall feeling about how well you did how do how do you rate yourself after this first activity </u>
<u who="su">we completed the task</u>
<u who="sf5305">we completed the task </u>
<u who="sf5306">yeah but i think it was quite close </u>
<u who="sm5315">it was close</u>
<u who="sf5305">yeah it was close</u>
<u who="sf5306">so we could have done better</u>
<u who="su">time management</u>
<u who="sm5315">i think we took a bit of time to actually do action while we talked a little bit too much maybe instead of actually doing it </u>
<u who="sf5306">yeah that's what i put down yeah</u>
<u who="nf5302">so in terms of your own feelings about it you know # <trunc>h</trunc>  did you enjoy it # what was what were your own personal feelings about doing it </u>
<gap reason="new phase of event" extent="uncertain"/>
<u who="su"> pleased yeah </u>
<u who="su5322">we did it but i i felt a bit rubbish in front of the other group oh yeah and we were like</u>
<u who="sm5319">yeah you felt felt a bit outdone by them</u>
<u who="su5322">yeah i i felt like like if we'd been out on our own i would have been really pleased with us but</u>
<u who="su">yeah</u>
<u who="sm5319">should i write jealous of other team</u>
<u who="nm5303">so you so you think in all <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> it's a bit of a competition</u>
<u who="sm5319">well yeah it was kind of</u>
<u who="su5322">the other guy was going are you finding this constructive we were like oh yeah he was taking it seriously</u>
<u who="sm5319">and you were going oh no can't fall into the sea you're going to get swept away #</u>
<u who="nm5303">so we've got a bit of a mixture there positive and negative feelings</u>
<u who="su">i think pleased is a good word</u>
<u who="su">yeah</u>
<u who="sm5319">yeah not amazingly happy but alright</u>
<gap reason="new phase of event" extent="uncertain"/>
<u who="su">challenging</u>
<u who="nf5302">when you first saw what you had to do # what did you feel</u>
<u who="sf5305">oh my god</u>
<u who="sf5306"><trunc>aft</trunc>  after after talking about it with each other it was became clearer and that so</u>
<u who="nf5302">yeah yeah what what was the first thing that happened <trunc>aft</trunc>  after you'd read it through then what what happened next</u>
<u who="sm5314">just decided on # started thinking about how to make the pipeline didn't we</u>
<u who="sf5306">yeah some people like picked up on different parts of what like the whole thing</u>
<u who="su">the group like all together</u>
<u who="sm5313">i think we each just <trunc>pr</trunc>  you know pretty much took our own roles and then we decided who was going to be where and</u>
<u who="nf5302">how did that happen</u>
<u who="sf5305">i think it just sort of happened nobody</u>
<u who="sm5313">i think people just started with what they would be better at</u>
<u who="sm5315">just decided what they wanted to do</u>
<u who="sf5306">some people did allocate some other people like</u>
<u who="su">yeah</u>
<u who="sm5315">i think Laura you took a little bit of charge not in a bad way i'm just saying that you you were probably like if there was a leader you'd probably like </u>
<gap reason="new phase of event" extent="uncertain"/>
<u who="su5324">we planned it</u>
<u who="su">and we # were more conscious of the time so</u>
<u who="su5324">yeah and we took more like concern over the rules we kept looking back at the rules this time to make sure we followed them</u>
<u who="su">yeah</u>
<u who="su5322"># i think everyone was a lot more involved like different people were taking more active roles this time like you and Davina were like doing more active stuff which was really good like just a bit different</u>
<gap reason="new phase of event" extent="uncertain"/>
<u who="nf5302"># when i was i didn't come close up to your discussions but when i saw you from a distance i did see that the four the six of you were facing inwards and you appeared to be kind of listening to each other so i was impressed by that i thought for your first shot you you kind of started to act as a team you didn't fragment immediately so <trunc>th</trunc>  that was that was quite impressive # in terms of the next activity # is there anything you've learnt from this one that you think you might like to roll into the next one</u>
<u who="sm5314">time management should be a bit better</u>
<u who="sf5306">yeah definitely</u>
<u who="nf5302">tell me a bit more about this time management</u>
<u who="sm5314">well we didn't realise we didn't know there was an exact time limit well </u>
<u who="sf5306">until the end</u>
<u who="sm5314">we knew there was an exact time limit but we didn't know what it was then we didn't then we found out at the end what it was so then we were just thought ah we take about a few minutes yeah</u>
<u who="sf5305">to just read this</u>
<u who="sf5306">we weren't aware the time limit mattered</u>
<u who="nf5302">so if that that was at the bottom of the list wasn't it so what does that kind of suggest to you</u>
<u who="sm5314">it means next time as soon as we get the paper we're going to start timing</u>
<u who="sm5315">check the time limit</u>
<u who="nf5302">so i <trunc>act</trunc>  actually had timed you as well so i stopped you but i mean it's getting right to the bottom isn't it and making sure that you all know it before you </u>
<u who="su">yeah</u>
<u who="nf5302">before you dash off we did notice that nobody was in fact timing you although you had twenty-five minutes so you kind of relying on the outside though it might # so what you'd like to improve is your time management just just run me through how apart from knowing what the time is how would you do time management</u>
<u who="sf5306">maybe like call it out</u>
<u who="su">give warnings</u>
<u who="sm5315">i could say oh we've got ten minutes to go so you've got to like back the group up</u>
<u who="sf5306">five minutes or depending however much time we're given</u>
<u who="nf5302">going onto the second question which is really about <trunc>your</trunc>  yourself as a team as if forgetting about the task which i think you did very well actually what kind of how do you think you gel as a team</u>
<u who="sm5313">we only just met about like <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/></u>
<u who="su">that's what makes it better actually</u>
<u who="su">yeah</u>
<u who="sf5305">it was good that everybody listened to each other and like # nobody like started dominating like you should go over there and you should go <trunc>o</trunc> </u>
<u who="sf5306">everybody made suggestions</u>
<u who="sf5305">yeah</u>
<u who="nf5302">that's good so in terms of general ideas that you might get about how teams work ignoring you six but just thinking in general what <trunc>lear</trunc>  have you learnt about teams from this activity if anything</u>
<u who="sm5315">i think communication's probably the most important bit</u>
<u who="sf5305">yeah you need to talk to each other</u>
<u who="sf5306">yeah it's a lot easier to solve a problem when you can like bounce ideas off each other than just stand there and try and think it out</u>
<u who="sm5315">cause if we actually did it like should we chuck the islands in and just like try to make the pipe straight away we probably would've just completely messed it up</u>
<u who="sf5306">yeah or broken one of the rules or something</u>
<u who="nf5302">so it's quite important that members of the team kind of take a pause and think about what everybody has to say before they start actually doing it i noticed actually that some of you were rather keen to get touching the pipes you know</u>
<u who="sm5315">i was i was straight in there</u>
<u who="nf5302">that's cool that works well too #</u>
<u who="sm5313">we were looking for the gold first</u>
<u who="sm5315">yeah we were like that was that was the main thing that was just like that was #</u>
<u who="nf5302">in terms of the whole # morning cause you've got another couple of exercises # because you already work well as a group i did i thought that you were quite impressive as a group it might be worth trying different roles within the group so just have a think about what your role was in this group the the last <trunc>ex</trunc>  activity what # it's something that we it's not on this list but just think about your own role you know how you contributed to it all all happening and maybe make a couple of notes to yourself about what you personally contributed you know give yourself a gold star for this or a kind of trying hard or <trunc>somethi</trunc>  some aspect of teamwork that you'd like to improve and maybe just make a a quick note of it on somewhere on here okay i won't ask you to tell me what it is but just think about the things that you contributed personally</u>
<gap reason="new phase of event" extent="uncertain"/>
<u who="sm5319">ok so what could we have done better</u>
<u who="sf5309">i thought we could have had better equipment that actually stayed together and didn't fall apart <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/></u>
<u who="su">yeah</u>
<u who="sm5319">and that</u>
<u who="nm5303">could have been provided with better equipment</u>
<u who="sf5309">yeah</u>
<u who="su5322">but the other team did it with it</u>
<u who="su">i don't care</u>
<u who="sm5319">i think i don't think we actually connected it like fully in cause they were quite stiff so</u>
<u who="su5322">yeah we needed to be like twisted in yeah</u>
<u who="sm5319">so should i write connect equipment better</u>
<u who="su5322">yeah and i said that we could have like maybe drawn a diagram like cause we were all there and then we were like oh should we just put it together and see like we didn't actually like i don't know</u>
<u who="su">we were sort of stuck</u>
<u who="su5322">yeah we we were just like you know yeah and like when Davina was like trying to get and we kind of lost it it was like # it just seemed a bit if we'd had a plan a visual thing we probably could have in that first five minutes could have done it a bit better</u>
<u who="sm5319">so draw a diagram anything else no</u>
<u who="nm5303">are you happy with that you started off saying you should have had better equipment but Vince has written down should have put the equipment together better so which is it</u>
<u who="sf5309">i don't know</u>
<u who="nm5303">so you are happy with <trunc>th</trunc>  the fact <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> or not</u>
<u who="su5324">i actually think their equipment was a bit different from our's the other team's cause their pipes fitted together perfectly and they weren't like too big like our pipes we were like trying to hold them one side there one side here where as their's was kind of perfectly fitted like together and they had better equipment i think</u>
<u who="su">through no fault of our own</u>
<u who="su">i think we should have ignored the other team</u>
<u who="sm5319">blame blame the tools</u>
<u who="su5322">ignore <trunc>th</trunc>  the other people</u>
<u who="su5323">so if there was gold across the sea you'd have thought it would be something slightly more hi-tech you know computers involved</u>
<u who="nm5303">have you ever heard that saying a bad workman blames his tools and you're sitting here going we had the wrong tools no i thought i mean if you think about how you planned it you were told you needed five minutes to plan and you and you spent longer than five minutes you almost didn't you were desperate wasn't you right five minutes is up let's do it and everybody carried on planning which was quite quite good so the reaction is easiest is pleased you've got no negative things though people were saying negative things</u>
<u who="sm5319">we dropped the ball in the river</u>
<u who="nm5303">pardon</u>
<u who="sm5319">we dropped a ball in the sea</u>
<u who="nm5303">dropped a ball in the sea</u>
<u who="sm5319">and that was quite disappointing</u>
<gap reason="new phase of event" extent="uncertain"/>
<u who="nf5302"># i think this is trickier questions</u>
<u who="sm5314">you blindfolded me so</u>
<u who="sf5306">yeah what was going on round then</u>
<u who="sm5315">and we had to pick the yellow balls out of the white ones they were all mucked up and i didn't know my left from my right until the end</u>
<u who="sm5314">yeah is that going left is that going left and he was like</u>
<u who="sm5315">that that's not left and he was like yes it is and he was right </u>
<u who="sm5312">you had a fifty-fifty chance though didn't you so </u>
