<u who="sf5331">maybe number whoever's number eight</u>
<u who="sf5329">but how do you know who's <trunc>gon</trunc>  going to be number eight</u>
<u who="su">yeah</u>
<u who="sf5331"> whoever's going to be a number eight</u>
<u who="sm5341">do we all get blindfolded at the same time</u>
<u who="sm5338">we could kind of clap your number or something instead of like</u>
<u who="su">yeah</u>
<u who="sf5337">yeah that's a good idea</u>
<u who="sm5338">clap your number</u>
<u who="sf5329">go round in a circle</u>
<u who="sf5336">yeah</u>
<u who="sm5339">but how are you going to sort out who is going to go first</u>
<u who="sm5341">oh we'll just sort of clap and then</u>
<u who="sf5337">pick someone now</u>
<u who="sf5336"><trunc>s</trunc> someone just starts randomly clapping</u>
<u who="sf5329">well whoever's number one should clap first  </u>
<u who="sm5338">yeah yeah and then like</u>
<u who="sf5329">and then they should stand away from the group </u>
<u who="sm5341">what if no-one's number one</u>
<u who="sf5329">and then link hold out hands or something and be like i don't know</u>
<u who="sm5338">and then like number two walk over to them or whatever</u>
<u who="sf5337">yeah yeah what if no-one's no-one's one though</u>
<u who="sf5329">yeah yeah number two will have to walk over to then cos you will hear them clap and # can walk over to them</u>
<u who="sm5341">but i think someone should just clap <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/></u>
<u who="sf5337">i think someone should start because if we're not if we don't start at once</u>
<u who="sm5339">if we sort if we sort out an order of clapping now</u>
<gap reason="new phase of event" extent="uncertain"/>
<u who="sf5336">right you have ten minutes before your task begins during the task all members of the team will be blindfolded and nobody will be allowed to talk at the start of the task each team member will be given a number which will be known only to them your task is to form your team into a straight line in ascending order of numbers you will have ten minutes to complete  the task</u>
<u who="su">sorry continue</u>
<u who="sm5339">unfortunately we're going to have to put someone in charge of sorting out </u>
<u who="sf5329">the numbers</u>
<u who="sm5339">the clapping</u>
<u who="sf5337">sorting out the clapping i think the hand on the shoulder and go in a line idea is a good plan like the person at the front like just like touches someone on the shoulder and then they do their number and then they can position it i don't  know</u>
<u who="sf5329">yeah yeah </u>
<gap reason="inaudible" extent="uncertain"/>
<u who="sf5336">but it's going to be a lot of work for just one person</u>
<u who="sm5341">that's alright though</u>
<u who="sf5336">but then if you have you cant have more than one because you can't talk so it's going to have to be one </u>
<u who="sm5339">if you have two then it's going to mess up</u>
<u who="sf5336">yeah exactly</u>
<u who="sf5337">so who's volunteering <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/></u>
<u who="sm5341">i can just see this not working actually and everybody just walking off over there</u>
<u who="sf5337">we need to i think we need to sort of sort of join shoulders or something at the start so we don't lose everyone sort of thing</u>
<u who="sf5329">well we'll just have to make sure that no-one moves really set a ground rule that you don't move until the organiser moves you</u>
<u who="sf5336">pulls you and pushes you </u>
<u who="sm5339">if we start in a line at the beginning  </u>
<u who="sf5337">yeah yeah</u>
<u who="sm5339">then we can swap people round</u>
<u who="sf5336">yeah that's a good idea</u>
<u who="sm5341">yeah if we can we'll do that but if we can't</u>
<u who="sf5331">but if we're in a line you and and there's one person sorting sorting you out how are they going to reach</u>
<u who="sm5339">'cause if they're staying behind a line</u>
<u who="sm5341">i know i've got</u>
<u who="sf5329">but as long as you are in a line it will be easy to find the front or the back because you'll just you'll know where  people are</u>
<u who="sm5341">i've got an idea for the numbers sorry right if if we take it in turns to clap and we all clap the number we've got and then the person with the lowest number steps back and then the person with the second highest number</u>
<u who="su">alright</u>
<u who="sm5341">if you can see all you've got to remember is like whether your's was highest or second highest</u>
<u who="sf5337">but we still won't be able to get ourselves in order doing that cause we won't be able to see anything</u>
<u who="sm5341">you can hear you can hear the clapping</u>
<u who="sf5329">we'll have to set someone now to start clapping and it'll have to go anti-clockwise or clockwise</u>
<u who="sm5339">if we no if we go in a line now it'll be easier to keep in a line as opposed to in a circle when we have to spread out</u>
<u who="sf5337">i think yeah i think</u>
<u who="sf5329">so is one person going to be in charge of organising</u>
<u who="sf5337">Charles i think</u>
<u who="sm5339">me alright</u>
<u who="sf5337">let's get in a line now</u>
<u who="sf5329">if if Charles taps you on the shoulder once you're blindfolded then clap your number again</u>
<u who="sf5331">are you organising</u>
<u who="sf5329">yeah</u>
<u who="sf5331">right</u>
<u who="sf5337">does that sound all right</u>
<gap reason="new phase of event" extent="uncertain"/>
<u who="sf5333">well maybe maybe if say if we choose like Natalie claps first and Natalie claps and i think okay my number's lower than Natalie so i'm going to go to her left hand side and if your number's higher than Natalie's you go on her right and then she gives a signal to say like or maybe we have a signal that we've all finished so we could like all do something to say  yeah we've all finished and then we like maybe then Claire does hers Claire claps hers but then i don't know</u>
<u who="sf5330">what's the second what can the second one be when you're finished besides clapping</u>
<u who="su">no that just sounds exactly the same</u>
<u who="sf5330">i can't whistle</u>
<u who="sf5333">are we allowed to use vocals at all or just not talking</u>
<u who="nm5327">you'll have to read the rules</u>
<u who="sf5333">it just say nobody's allowed to talk but it doesn't say no noises</u>
<u who="sf5334">we could make animal noises moo</u>
<u who="sm5340">no</u>
<u who="nm5327">except we've got two koalas</u>
<u who="su">yeah they don't make any noise though</u>
<u who="sf5330">what sound does a flamingo make <vocal desc="imitates bird" iterated="y" dur="2"/></u>
<u who="sf5333">what does a giraffe do i don't know</u>
<gap reason="new phase of event" extent="uncertain"/>
<u who="sf5337">okay so should we recap so eveyone knows what we are doing # are we standing in a line cause <trunc>C</trunc>  Charles okay if he he's going to be leader if he stands at the end</u>
<u who="sm5339">if i if i stand if i stand at this end and start the clapping and then we go along on a line</u>
<u who="sf5337">and yeah and if he and he's going to try and put you in order and if he taps you on the side then clap </u>
<u who="sm5341">and then he can just work out where</u>
<u who="sf5337">and then he can work it out right so should we get in a line</u>
<u who="sm5339">so if someone has someone gets number one-hundred and three <gap reason="inaudible" extent="uncertain"/>
<gap reason="new phase of event" extent="uncertain"/>
<u who="sf5333"># okay so it can't be clapping we've got that</u>
<u who="sf5330">i don't know actually animal noises are quite a good idea</u>
<u who="sf5333"><kinesic desc="makes clicking sound" iterated="y" dur="2"/> we could do that or i can't even do that</u>
<u who="sf5334">yeah a noise like that yeah and then we know</u>
<u who="sf5333">ok so maybe when we're all so when you've kind of stopped you can just go <vocal desc="makes noise" iterated="y" dur="2"/> and then like we'll just wait until everyone's done it so you have to wait until you've heard it six times or something i don't know</u>
<u who="sm5340">what so we're saying highest number to the right and lowest number to the left yeah</u>
<u who="sf5333">shall we have like a practice run just pretend we've got numbers okay</u>
<u who="su">yeah that's a good plan</u>
<u who="su">how many of us are there's six</u>
<u who="sm5340">okay</u>
<u who="sf5333">can we get in a line already so should we go in this order so if we remember or do you reckon should we go in likealphabetical order so we remember who's next</u>
<u who="su">yeah</u>
<u who="sf5333">cause i won't remember who's standing next to me</u>
<u who="sm5340">okay so i'm at the back</u>
<u who="sf5333">where am i C you're at the end you're first Claire so you stand this end i'll stand next to you</u>
<u who="sf5334">are we doing surname or first name</u>
<u who="sf5333">first name i can't remember surnames</u>
<u who="sm5340">wait wait names</u>
<u who="sf5333">okay so do you want to go first close your eyes so we can feel like we're into it</u>
<u who="sf5330">okay what am i doing</u>
<u who="sf5333">you're just choosing a number in your head pretending we're having a practice run</u>
<u who="sf5330">okay i'll need to clap</u>
<u who="sf5333">so just clap and then when you clap we're all going to move round you</u>
<u who="sf5330">all of you okay</u>
<u who="sf5333">yeah #</u>
<u who="sf5334">actually no i think she should move into her position she should move down the line and go one two three</u>
<u who="sf5333">but how does she how does she</u>
<u who="sf5330">but i don't know what everyone else has got</u>
<u who="su">how does she know</u>
<u who="sm5340">yeah what if someone's picked the same number</u>
<u who="sf5333">we have got ten minutes to move so we could listen to everyone's and we'll remember like what order we're in cause we're in alphabetical order then when we've heard everyone's like we could say okay now after we've heard Vince Claire  moves</u>
<u who="sf5330">yeah</u>
<u who="sf5334">yeah might be a better idea</u>
<u who="sf5330">yeah then we stop and then start</u>
<u who="sf5333">so she has to think okay am i going to go like and she can stand in well she can feel she can say right okay i'm the i'm like number two so she's if her number's fourth in the line she'll make sure she's standing in front of </u>
<u who="sf5330">that's a good idea actually</u>
<u who="sf5333">Natalie so if she just moves in front of Natalie and then or maybe #</u>
<u who="sf5330">yeah that's good if we all do it like do our numbers first and then we'll move from there once everyone else has done  it yeah</u>
<u who="ss">yeah</u>
<u who="sf5333">okay so should we just have a practice and see if it works go on then</u>
<gap reason="new phase of event" extent="uncertain"/>
<u who="sm5339">start the start the line now <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/></u>
<u who="sf5337">Charles does it yeah</u>
<u who="sf5329">are we standing</u>
<u who="sm5339">i'll stand this way</u>
<u who="su">right we're standing like that </u>
<u who="su">like this </u>
<u who="sf5337">we can't even in a line</u>
<gap reason="inaudible" extent="uncertain"/>
<u who="sf5331">are we standing side to side or</u>
<u who="sf5329">yeah stand like that</u>
<u who="sf5331">okay</u>
<u who="sf5329">facing this way and then he can walk along our back's and do it</u>
<u who="sf5331">okay</u>
<u who="sf5337">yeah it'll be easier once its in a line yeah</u>
<u who="sf5336">right </u>
<u who="sf5337">we've still got five minutes</u>
<u who="sf5336">we've still got five minutes yeah</u>
<u who="sf5337">right so is everyone clear</u>
<u who="sf5331">so how are you going to confirm at the end just go along and touch everyone on the shoulder</u>
<u who="sm5339">yeah touch everyone's shoulder and we have to count</u>
<u who="sm5338">well touch it twice</u>
<u who="sf5337">what</u>
<u who="sf5329">well as long as he touches your shoulder you know to clap so</u>
<u who="sm5341">yeah but then everybody's just going to be clapping</u>
<u who="sf5337">well when he's done it <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/></u>
<gap reason="new phase of event" extent="uncertain"/>
<u who="sf5330">what if we all get the same number</u>
<u who="sf5333">so you're going to do a clap</u>
<u who="sf5330">yeah okay</u>
<u who="sf5333">oh well that's just we'll deal with that if it happens</u>
<u who="sf5330"># <kinesic desc="claps" iterated="y" dur="2"/></u>
<u who="su">i didn't even hear that</u>
<u who="su">honestly</u>
<u who="sf5333">no we have to clap pretty loud see we have to i'm thinking now are we going to are we going to do a count to kind of five so i'm going to go <kinesic desc="mimes counting" iterated="y" dur="5"/> and then do mine</u>
<u who="su">yeah i think so</u>
<u who="sf5330">yeah</u>
<u who="sf5333">just so there's enough gap okay so we've all we've all heard that okay <kinesic desc="claps" iterated="y" dur="2"/></u>
<gap reason="new phase of event" extent="uncertain"/>
<u who="sf5336">what if the numbers are really high numbers</u>
<u who="sm5339">i know</u>
<u who="sm5338">i don't think they will be</u>
<u who="sf5331">they can't be that would be cruel surely it's got to be one to eight</u>
<u who="sf5337">how long have we got to actually complete the whole thing we've got time to clap a hundred haven't we</u>
<u who="su">problem is going round</u>
<u who="sm5341">right if they are really high numbers we'll just like clap each digit so if it's like three-hundred and ten you just  clap three times</u>
<u who="sm5338">how are you going to know that</u>
<u who="sf5331">yeah how are you it's not one two three space</u>
<u who="sm5341">for the nought for the nought no just go one two three one and then do ten for the nought because you can't do nought</u>
<u who="su">and how do you not know it's three-thousand one-hundred and ten</u>
<u who="sm5341">because nought is ten claps it's not going to happen so it doesn't matter</u>
<u who="su">i bet it will</u>
<u who="sm5339">if it's a high number right say if you are number ten</u>
<u who="sm5341">number ten just clap ten times cause <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/></u>
<u who="sf5337">if it's a high number can't we do the like one O five or something like that with our hands</u>
<u who="sf5329">he won't be able to see that's the only trouble</u>
<u who="sm5339">we have to do we have to do the clapping we have to sort it out if we have a if it's a number higher than ten i go  with his idea if you do it in sets so if it's three hundred you do three then wait a bit then two for twenty</u>
<u who="sf5331">what if it's a nought</u>
<u who="sm5339">if it's a nought you do ten</u>
<u who="sf5337">so if its three-hundred you do three then ten and then another ten</u>
<u who="sm5339">you do three then ten then ten</u>
<u who="sf5336">or can't cant you just stamp your feet or something for a nought</u>
<u who="sf5337">oh yeah okay yeah</u>
<u who="sf5336">go one two three <kinesic desc="claps" iterated="y" dur="3"/> and then stamp <kinesic desc="stamps foot" iterated="y" dur="2"/> and then stamp again</u>
<u who="sf5337">so that would be three-hundred so three hundred and two would be <kinesic desc="claps" iterated="y" dur="3"/><kinesic desc="claps" iterated="y" dur="3"/><kinesic desc="stamps foot" iterated="n" dur="2"/></u>
<u who="sf5336">yeah </u>
<u who="su">right</u>
<u who="sf5331">how will you ever remember all those numbers </u>
<u who="sm5339">i'm not it's <trunc>gon</trunc>  it's going to take about twenty minutes for me to sort everyone out</u>
<u who="sf5337">but if it's below ten</u>
<u who="sf5336">how long have we got</u>
<u who="sf5331">it must be just one it must be i hope so</u>
<u who="sf5329">okay so what</u>
<u who="sf5336">we've got ten minutes to do it</u>
<u who="sf5329">which end is going to be the low end and which end is going to be the high end</u>
<u who="sf5336">right so ascending order</u>
<u who="sm5339">okay this is going to be do we have to be in a straight line</u>
<u who="sf5329">yeah we've got to be in ascending order</u>
<u who="sm5338">yeah people need to move a bit further along sort of thing</u>
<u who="sm5339">yeah but if we if we have this end as the low end and then everyone turns to the left once we're finished then we'll  be in a straight line ascending order now which way round<gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/></u>
<u who="sm5341">i'm sure when when we've heard everyone clap like right near the end if someone's in the wrong place we'll know</u>
<u who="su">even if we start this way we'll be okay</u>
<u who="sm5341">we just go down the whole line</u>
<u who="sm5338">we could like pass people along and like if they're a number lower than you you pass them that way sort of thing and so  go along the line and clap then if like </u>
<u who="sm5341">yeah yeah that's what i was saying earlier on</u>
<u who="sm5338">yeah why don't we do that then</u>
<u who="sf5337">you're just going to have to sort of drag us</u>
<u who="sf5331">and to # make sure they who it you've got to be touching as well just in case you just sort of fall over or something</u>
<u who="sf5329">or somebody ends up down there or something</u>
<gap reason="new phase of event" extent="uncertain"/>
<u who="sm5340">this is so not what are we doing</u>
<u who="sf5333">Claire are you going to move first</u>
<u who="sf5330">i can't remember what everyone's was</u>
<u who="su">it's going to be so funny on the video</u>
<u who="sf5333">oh no okay yeah i'm trying i'm trying to do it in my head so i'm going okay three like five one two four six and </u>
<u who="su">you did five i did four and six</u>
<u who="sf5333">so i was just kind of trying to think that in my head</u>
<u who="sf5334">cos maybe if number one moves along the line first the person who's number one</u>
<u who="sm5340">no what if the person from yeah</u>
<u who="sf5332">yeah moves to the end and <trunc>nu</trunc>  number two moves</u>
<u who="sf5333">so how do how do we <trunc>kn</trunc>  know we're going to get number one and number two and number three and number four and  number five we could get like twenty-five or a hundred</u>
<u who="su">well the lowest number then</u>
<u who="sm5340">well if we move the back person moves first and then the next person and then after you've finished moving you just  like clap or something or does that sound <trunc>st</trunc> </u>
<u who="sf5333">that's so the person who knows they've got the lowest number is going to</u>
<u who="sm5340">yeah</u>
<u who="sf5330">come to the end or go to</u>
<u who="sf5334">yeah the person with the lowest number if they just go okay everyone's finished clapping and then <trunc>th</trunc>  they just  go like this and make sure they're at the front and just feel their way to the front</u>
<u who="sm5340">oh yeah yeah yeah</u>
<u who="su">yeah</u>
<u who="sf5333">and Claire's pretty tall so you can just go okay i'm</u>
<u who="sf5334">yeah and then just like each person </u>
<u who="sm5340">yeah that'll work that'll work</u>
<u who="sf5334">then the second highest number then move until they are second to the front</u>
<u who="sf5333">yeah</u>
<u who="sf5334">what do you reckon</u>
<u who="sf5333">and if we if we know this order then we know like what order we clapped in so we should know who's got the number  next to us so we can say okay this is i've got she's next to me and she's next to me</u>
<u who="sf5334">if yeah but if they give us really high numbers and we're going one two three four five six seven eight nine ten  then we're not going to remember what we each clapped</u>
<u who="sf5333">okay we could we could</u>
<u who="sf5332">what could be like a signal to like if we don't hear it we need something to like get someone to repeat do you know  what i mean</u>
<u who="sf5333">we could actually do it two times</u>
<u who="sf5334">yeah so we <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/></u>
<u who="sf5333">cause we've got enough time to do it two times i reckon</u>
<u who="su">cause it's not timed when we actually do is it</u>
<u who="sf5333">it's ten minutes just got ten minutes to get into it</u>
<u who="su">ten minutes before your task <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/></u>
<u who="sf5333">you know what we could do if it's double figures we could do like</u>
<u who="su">oh yeah ten minutes</u>
<u who="sm5340">no we need <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/></u>
<u who="sf5334">does anybody know how long we've had</u>
<u who="sm5340">#</u>
<u who="sf5334">no</u>
<u who="sf5333">oh shit we didn't do that</u>
<u who="sf5334">nevermind we're quite sorted anyway</u>
<u who="sf5333">okay i reckon if it's double figures or triple figures we have to do it so like maybe if it's twenty-seven you  could do like <kinesic desc="claps" iterated="y" dur="2"/></u>
<u who="su">yeah do that inbetween</u>
<u who="sm5340">what <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> hold tight</u>
<u who="sf5333">so you know that like</u>
<u who="su">twenty-seven twenty-seven yeah </u>
<u who="sf5333">and then kind of because otherwise we're going to be going oh my god quick i've got to do thisand to count and  it's just going to be crazy</u>
<u who="su">okay so that's the <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/></u>
<u who="sf5333">right we'll have to look <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/></u>
<u who="sm5340">i thought this was i thought we'd be i thought we were just being given numbers from one to six</u>
<u who="sf5330">it just says numbers doesn't it</u>
<u who="sf5333">it just says numbers so we have to like just be prepared</u>
<u who="sm5340">do you want to drop a hint</u>
<u who="sf5335">if it's something like one-hundred then you're going to be like <kinesic desc="claps" iterated="y" dur="2"/></u>
<u who="su">zero</u>
<u who="sf5330">oh yeah what </u>
<u who="su">if it's zero you're going to have to do something else</u>
<u who="sf5334">what are you just going to go <kinesic desc="claps" iterated="y" dur="2"/><kinesic desc="clicks" iterated="y" dur="3"/> so  you know you've had a number inbetween but it's a nothing  number</u>
<u who="sf5333">yeah but have that for zero oh yeah but what are we going to do if it's to separate oh this <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/></u>
<u who="sm5340">this is so not going to work at all #</u>
<u who="su">that doesn't sound much different does it</u>
<u who="sf5333">it does sound quite different </u>
<u who="su">you can tell i think</u>
<u who="sf5333">so that could be maybe be </u>
<u who="sf5334">we could do a dance</u>
<u who="sf5333">that could maybe be zero</u>
<gap reason="new phase of event" extent="uncertain"/>
<u who="sm5339">ah yeah okay <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/></u>
<u who="sm5338">what he's going to tap us on the shoulder and then </u>

<u who="nm5326">okay could i have everybody's attention please right could you please all put your  blindfold's on and you must stop talking at this point</u>
<u who="su">what about our number</u>
<u who="sm5340">have we actually decided what we're doing</u>
<u who="nm5326">stop talking</u>
<u who="sf5336">oh my glasses</u>
<u who="nm5326">stop talking please and put your blindfolds on alright okay okay there's going to  be # a couple minutes now whilst we go through # giving you all the numbers so <trunc>jus</trunc>  just wait someone will come and # come  and one of one of <trunc>my</trunc>  myself or my colleagues will come and # tap you on the shoulder and just # just do what we what we say  and listen listen to us okay remember you can't talk and you can't take your blindfold off and just be patient cause it's  going to take a couple of minutes and then after after the couple of minutes # i'll i'll say you can start the task alright  so just be patient and wait for me to say start and remember there's no talking</u>

<u who="sf5329">they're in order i think he ordered up them but we were kind of stuck</u>
<u who="nm5326"> so right okay so a few of you were in the right order okay Charles Karen do you want to rejoin them</u>
<u who="sf5337">he was probably looking for #</u>
<u who="sm5341">Charles did you have your blindfold on you had a blindfold on</u>
<u who="su">you know when you were when you were following somebody you were following somebody with their feet in the grass it  was him filming you</u>

<u who="sm5339">how did we do did we get anyone anywhere near</u>
<u who="nm5326"> i think you got about four people in the right order</u>

<u who="sf5336"><gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> clapping three times a group of three and then two yeah so i was just like</u>
<u who="sf5331">yeah i just stood and waited and thought they know what they're doing they'll come and get me in a minute</u>
<gap reason="new phase of event" extent="uncertain"/>
<u who="sm5340">cause i thought you'd put us in like different parts of the field and i was like hang on where is everyone</u>
<u who="sf5333">yeah i was just like and then i could hear you lot laughing and was like that's Vince that's Vince</u>
<u who="sm5340">i was just pissing myself laughing i just oh yeah i knew it was you i knew it was you pissing yourself it was like  yeah go on then</u>
<u who="sf5333">i couldn't stop laughing i'm like i'm just standing here</u>
<u who="su">the signal should have been <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/></u>
<u who="sf5333">and then i was like to you everyone was clapping so i was like i can <trunc>f</trunc>  and i was just like # no i came to you  first <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> i'm just going to write my number down cause i don't i didn't know how to mine had got a point</u>
<u who="sf5334">i didn't really mind so much cause i was like i'm zero i'm the lowest i must be the lowest and you kept moving  and i was like</u>
<u who="su">when he said three point two i went #  oh</u>
<u who="sf5333">how annoying</u>
<u who="nm5327">what did you think when i showed you there was someone else next to you</u>
<u who="sm5340">you didn't</u>
<u who="nm5327">to your to your right cause we had an extra team person so you'd all sort of arranged yourselves but we had  this extra spurious person on the end</u>
<u who="sf5330">it didn't feel quite right cause i was sure everyone else was like</u>
<u who="sf5333">cause i was we were all standing here then i was like hang on there's only like five of us</u>
<u who="sm5340">yeah</u>
<u who="su">so i just thought #</u>
<u who="nm5327">who was the last person to join</u>
<u who="su">yeah i didn't think</u>
<u who="sf5335">i know i didn't know where i was</u>
<u who="nm5327">they sort of they sort of didn't realise</u>
<u who="sm5340">i was completely lost and didn't know what was going on until i i got dragged down i was like oh what like just like</u>
<u who="sf5332">i think i was just standing there by myself for about like ten minutes then</u>
<gap reason="new phase of event" extent="uncertain"/>
<u who="sf5331">oh right</u>
<u who="sf5337">see i was like</u>
<u who="sf5331">i don't know i just stayed there and waited</u>
<u who="sf5329">i followed the whistling</u>
<u who="sf5337">oh god</u>
<u who="sm5339">was anyone a minus number</u>
<u who="su">#</u>
<u who="su">no</u>
<u who="sm5339">i was </u>
<u who="sm5338">really</u>
<u who="sm5339">i got minus one</u>
<u who="sf5337">it's a good job you were like sorting then otherwise</u>
<u who="sf5329">and i got zero </u>
<u who="sf5336">and i was a half </u>
<u who="sf5329">you were a half</u>
<u who="sf5336">i was thinking to myself how am i going to get a half so i was thinking like to do nought point five to go nought <kinesic desc="stamps foot" iterated="y" dur="2"/> one two three four five <kinesic desc="claps" iterated="y" dur="5"/>  but i didn't know if that'd work</u>
<u who="sm5341">that would've worked because no numbers start with nought do they</u>
<u who="su">yeah</u>
<u who="sf5329">yeah nought five</u>
<u who="nm5326"> right do you want do you guys want to do the review bit stay outside or go back into the place</u>
<u who="su">what do you reckon</u>
<u who="nm5326"> go back in right okay</u>
<gap reason="new phase of event" extent="uncertain"/>
<u who="nm5326"> so we'll start the review off in the same way if you don't mind just i'll just give you two minutes to # it's  the same set of headings i think aren't there on the second page there # just # open right yeah okay # so if you just do the  same as last time</u>
<u who="nm5326">so i've just given you a bit of opportunity there to sort of have another experience and # just to start  reflecting individually so alright with your notes if you just draw out some of that reflection into group discussion <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/>  reflections so # anyone want to throw anything in on feelings this time</u>
<u who="su">horrible</u>
<u who="nm5326"> it was horrible</u>
<u who="su">yeah</u>
<u who="sm5341">i thought it was quite funny actually</u>
<u who="sm5338">yeah i thought it was</u>
<u who="nm5326"> it was very funny watching it i tell you</u>
<u who="sf5336">yes i did think about that i was like oh no people are watching me doing this just walking around randomly  clapping</u>
<u who="nm5326">it was bit scary </u>
<u who="sf5329">yeah i wasn't expecting us to all get split up like that</u>
<u who="sm5341">i kind of was</u>
<u who="sm5339">that was the thing that went wrong</u>
<u who="sm5341">yeah i was kind of expecting him to give like decimal numbers and stuff but i thought no he won't be do that because </u>
<u who="sf5337"><gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> be that cruel</u>
<u who="nm5326">now what you didn't realise was of course i was just listening to everything you were suggesting and made sure i  gave you something that didn't you hadn't thought of # ok some of you thought it was funny some of you thought it was scary  any other feelings</u>
<u who="sm5339">i felt like an idiot i was the only person moving around and wandered off in completely the wrong direction</u>
<u who="nm5326"> it was really quite <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> at the very very end of the game it was everyone was stationary the whole field and you  were just wandering around chasing this chap</u>
<gap reason="new phase of event" extent="uncertain"/>
<u who="sf5334">right what reactions did anyone have</u>
<u who="sm5340">very hard</u>
<u who="su">very hard</u>
<u who="su">difficult</u>
<u who="sf5333">i thought it was going be actually when when we first read it i was thinking ah this'll be easy but i didn't  realise when you could hear everyone else clapping i was like oh no</u>
<u who="sm5340">i didn't know we were getting taken away</u>
<u who="sf5332">yeah nor did i </u>
<u who="sm5340">cause i thought we would have stayed in those lines but obviously not</u>
<u who="sf5332">but that was the part of our plan i decided that planning was rubbish</u>
<u who="su">yeah</u>
<u who="sf5334"># so what else very hard</u>
<u who="sf5333">i didn't think we'd actually do it i just thought #</u>
<u who="su">no </u>
<u who="sf5332">it didn't work really</u>
<u who="nm5327">but your reaction at the end being you said being you said you didn't think you were going to do it but</u>
<u who="sf5330">i thought it was quite a good result it worked out alright in the end</u>
<u who="su">we got together in a line</u>
<u who="sf5333">yeah i was quite pleased we all found each other</u>
<u who="sm5340">how on earth we managed to like almost do it was like</u>
<u who="sf5334">i felt stupid</u>
<u who="sf5333">yeah yeah like you were the only person doing it like # cause you couldn't like call out and like reassure  yourself that there was also other people also like feeling as stupid as you <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/></u>
<u who="sf5334">yeah and you felt like everyone else had taken their blindfold and you were still standing there going</u>
<u who="sf5333">i know at the end cause cause you couldn't tell the time like i was standing there and i was thinking what if  everyone's taken them off and i'm just like stood here on my own #</u>
<u who="sm5340">i felt well uncomfortable with that blindfold on though i just couldn't stand it i just oh</u>
<u who="nm5327">so uncomfortable yeah</u>
<gap reason="new phase of event" extent="uncertain"/>
<u who="nm5326"> how about feelings about how the team worked <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> this specific exercise or the more general</u>
<u who="sf5329">i think we managed to set up a good plan yeah and we had a good code for the numbers cause we managed to deal with  like the big numbers</u>
<u who="su">yeah</u>
<u who="sm5341">i think we all managed to find each other pretty well</u>
<u who="sm5338">yeah that was # that was <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/></u>
<u who="sm5341">well we managed to find some of us</u>
<u who="sf5329">we did get Charles put four people in a a line so at least you know it was</u>
<u who="nm5326"> yes yes you achieved at least a good quarter of your objectives</u>
<u who="sm5339">four out of eight</u>
<u who="nm5326">yeah yeah well that that's alright but that's really important because but it's it's often very difficult to  achieve all the objectives but you can feel good about having got some of the way there</u>
<gap reason="new phase of event" extent="uncertain"/>
<u who="sf5334"># what did we do well</u>
<u who="sf5335">i think we did plan it though we planned it but it just didn't go according to it and i think we did try</u>
<u who="sf5333">i think we did good improvisation cause we managed to put we must have something that could have worked cause  everybody else was doing it so we were just like</u>
<u who="nm5327">you you you did do a plan now on the way in you were saying well that was a load of rubbish making a plan but  did any part of your plan help you achieve what you achieved</u>
<u who="su">i don't</u>
<u who="sf5334">the clicking did cause i had zero and that was our signal for zero and i was like ah excellent</u>
<u who="nm5327">that's right that was quite good and i thought in your plan you realised that there could be a zero that's  something that not many people realise you realised there could be high numbers okay</u>
<u who="su">and it wouldn't have to be one to six</u>
<u who="nm5327">so i think it was you you said that didn't you it doesn't have to be one to six and everybody started <trunc>y</trunc>   challenging you <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> so it seemed to me given that the # problem with your plan was that there was # # # unpredictable thing  happened</u>
<u who="sf5333">we should have asked more we should have asked more questions or like the like thought of finding out more  information like we should like we thought we could stand in a line which obviously we couldn't do and like so that was  pointless and yeah</u>
<u who="sf5330">yeah i suppose we didn't think that they were have to negative numbers or</u>
<u who="su">no we didn't plan for like every occasion</u>
<u who="su">or points decimal points</u>
<u who="su">yeah</u>
<u who="nm5327">well we've gone from in the first task you said we didn't want a plan it's useless and now you made a plan  and then you're saying well you're what we didn't do was plan for every eventuality but should we do that</u>
<u who="sf5333">it's a different sort of thing it's you know it's different</u>
<u who="sf5334">yeah more like logic thing that was more practical so it's better to get in there whereas this was kind of i don't  know using all your senses a different type of and if you can't see like you really need a plan really because you know and  if you can't talk either they're two of the main things that you'd use </u>
<u who="sf5333">yeah cause the other problem was we were constantly communicating but we actually like couldn't almost at all  communicate</u>
<u who="sf5334">yeah</u>
<u who="nm5327">in <trunc>an</trunc>  any situation in any task you do in your life it's # there's always something crops up that you don't  expect but does that mean you should or shouldn't have a plan anyway</u>
<u who="su">no you should have one anyway</u>
<u who="nm5327">i thought your plan was fantastic completely different you <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> for the first task you came back and made a  plan you you planned for all sorts which a lot of the teams probably would've done but then the worst and this whole task is  designed to give you unexpected things that couldn't possibly have formed part of your plan to say look cope with that</u>
<u who="sf5333">yeah like two of the same same number and stuff i thought three of us did but</u>
<gap reason="new phase of event" extent="uncertain"/>
<u who="nm5326"># okay what about what you did what was what was best John</u>
<u who="sm5338"># i thought like the system was quite good apart from not being prepared for negative numbers and decimals and stuff  like that but that was <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> but i thought that #</u>
<u who="nm5326"> so so how about generalising about how the how would how would you say say that i agree with you in as the way  the team worked in a more general way how did you see that how did you come to the system</u>
<u who="sm5338">we all discussed it </u>
<u who="nm5326"> did you all discuss it anyone</u>
<u who="sm5338"><gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/></u>
<u who="sm5341">well we sort of</u>
<u who="sf5329">we discussed it more than last time</u>
<u who="sm5341">i think we sort of split into two little groups talking about stuff and then we just joined together</u>
<u who="nm5326">so you've got quite a big group so that's interesting isn't it that you split up</u>
<u who="sm5341"><event desc="mobile phone rings" iterated="y" dur="4"/>   sorry <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/></u>
<u who="nm5326"> # how did that happen how did you get back together was it spontaneous or did someone</u>
<u who="sf5329">it just seemed to happen</u>
<u who="sm5339">i just heard them talking and he had a go at it so but he doctored it</u>
<u who="su">yeah</u>
<u who="sm5341">did you see us talking</u>
<u who="sm5339"># clapping stamping your feet</u>
<u who="sf5336">yeah they came up with <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/><event desc="mobile phone rings" iterated="y" dur="2"/></u>
<u who="nm5326">so that's just so mmm turn your phone off mate # right so so Charles you sort of <trunc>f</trunc>  felt that something good  was going on in the other sort of subgroup so you kind of dragged dragged everyone back <trunc>s</trunc>  so that that's interesting you  didn't just carry with your own group so you thought well let's listen to someone else's findings <trunc>th</trunc>  that's really good  that's the thing with good things if they happen the team tend to make them make things work okay what was bad sorry what  could we have done better</u>
<u who="sm5339">if we'd had a way of finding each other at the beginning</u>
<u who="sf5336">yeah but then that was that was a bit unexpected so</u>
<u who="sm5339">yes</u>
<u who="nm5326">okay so how did you cope with it</u>
<u who="sf5329">who who started whistling then</u>
<u who="sm5341">that was me</u>
<u who="sf5329">yeah that that helped us all group together i did think if that hadn't of happened i'd have</u>
<u who="nm5326">okay did you</u>
<u who="sf5336">except i didn't know i didn't know if it was another group</u>
<u who="sm5341">yeah but i thought</u>
<u who="sf5329">i just felt it was in the general direction</u>
<u who="nm5326">so with the whistle improvisation and some of you responded so cause it could have been a disaster because if  what was really funny is three out of the four groups were clapping so and # # yeah so so there was was some good  improvisation there try and do something different</u>
<u who="sm5341">i think who is it who got the nought point five yeah i think you thought of the right idea i think if you'd done that  did you do it</u>
<u who="sf5336">well no not really because the way i stood behind the line and then i thought somebody was going to tap me on the  shoulder and nobody came and <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> is anybody there i thought she was already in the line</u>
<u who="sf5329">i thought i was in the line but i wasn't</u>
<u who="nm5326">what else okay so you you got something unexpected and you dealt with it the best you could really that's that's  </u>
# which is which is great # anything else you felt could have been done better</u>
<gap reason="new phase of event" extent="uncertain"/>
<u who="sf5333">i think that # we should have come up with a more original plan cause we i mean that i didn't realised we were all  going to be mixed up but i think we should have thought like well everyone's going to clap and like that</u>
<u who="sf5335">to come up with new ideas</u>
<u who="sf5333">yeah cause when we were all obviously talking and clapping and it didn't really take into consideration that  actually there was a lot of noise going on around us cause when you're <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> you can hear like you get confusing so</u>
<u who="su">yeah more <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/></u>
<u who="sf5333">yeah we could have had something a bit more different we didn't time keep again when we had our plan someone said  like how long have we got and we couldn't time keep when we had our blindfolds on cause i was like oh it's alright i'll look  at my watch and i was like oh no i won't be able to</u>
<u who="su">but we we wanted to but <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/></u>
<u who="sf5333">so that was #</u>
<u who="nm5327">well i don't know did you time keep in the first ten minutes</u>
<u who="su">no that's the bit we forgot</u>
<u who="sf5335">but we intended to sorry</u>
<u who="su">we get so excited by it</u>
<u who="sf5333">yeah it was just all exciting again</u>
<u who="nm5327">is that how you all feel Vince are you feeling right excited about the tasks</u>
<u who="su">he loves it</u>
<u who="sm5340">no</u>
<u who="sf5333">thrilled in fact</u>
<u who="sm5340"># no well # kind of well i'm not like really dark about it actually i'll go along with it</u>
<u who="nm5327">so did you i mean did you did you think you did well in that task</u>
<u who="sm5340">but we did surprisingly better than i thought we did when i was like stranded on my own</u>
<u who="su">i think we did at the other one</u>
<u who="sf5333">and we were just laughing i thought no</u>
<u who="sm5340">yeah that's the thing oh i thought just forget it just wait here until the ten minutes go by but somehow i managed to  well figure out what #</u>
<u who="nm5327">so were you <trunc>o</trunc>  you you'd made your plan you was quite confident you were going to get it done and then all  of a sudden</u>
<u who="sm5340">it just went pear-shaped</u>
<u who="nm5327">it went pear-shaped and you thought there's no way we're going to achieve it but then at the end of it</u>
<u who="sm5340">i got dragged about a bit and put in like almost the right position yeah</u>
<u who="nm5327">anybody else thoughts on this how their thought process went throughout the task</u>
<u who="sf5330">i think it definitely felt quite hopeless in the beginning</u>
<u who="sf5335">yeah i thought that i was going to have to like stand there for ten minutes as well i thought</u>
<u who="sf5330">you feel like yeah</u>
<u who="sf5333">just wait for someone to find you at some point and then i was thinking well no-one's going to find me cause  you're probably all thinking the same thing <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> going off and then i just and then i just started laughing and then i was  like i can hear someone laughing oh it's just it was just weird</u>
<u who="nm5327">did anybody cheat</u>
<u who="su">yeah i could see <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/></u>
<u who="nm5327">did anybody feel like cheating</u>
<u who="sf5333">yeah you could see just in front of you so like when i saw like Vince's trainers were right there i was like oh it  is him kind of thing</u>
<u who="su">yeah</u>
<u who="sm5340">i was kind of going like that and just trying to see i don't know just see the tops or something it was just # yeah</u>
<gap reason="new phase of event" extent="uncertain"/>
<u who="nm5326">what about the initial planning stage could it have been better # taking into account</u>
<u who="sf5329">take into take into account a bigger range of numbers</u>
<u who="nm5326">okay how could you seen how could you have ensured that happened or not ensured how could you have tried to make  that happen it's difficult that</u>
<u who="sf5329">it is yeah</u>
<u who="nm5326">but # was there <trunc>any</trunc>  anyone got any comments anyone feel that they weren't being listened to or that they think  anyone think any any thoughts on how could could of how you could of got maybe thought of more numbers how many people said  oh no they'll never do that</u>
<u who="sm5341">i did</u>
<u who="sf5337">i thought they might be high numbers but i didn't think of negatives or decimals at all i just didn't i didn't  even think about</u>
<u who="sf5329">it didn't even occur to me</u>
<u who="nm5326">so maybe the they'll never do that maybe <trunc>y</trunc>  you should say # maybe </u>
<u who="su">they might</u>
<u who="nm5326">maybe what what # what didn't happen was no-one said oh they probably will or what else could they do but # so i  just wondered there were a few people saying they'll never they'll never do that which is what i would have said as well i 
<gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> it's not a criticism i'm just making observations # any so   <trunc>con</trunc> conclusions here on what you might try and do  better next time</u>
<u who="sf5329">be more open-minded about the possible problems you could have thrown at you</u>
<u who="su">yeah think about</u>
<u who="nm5326">okay so that's where if we look back at our ground rules it's it's around here again isn't it it's the # if you  think you've got a whacky idea be prepared to speak up and # other people should keep an open-mind and # and # and # listen  listen to others but # overall you felt good about it which is great any # any other comments have you got any comments about  it</u>
<u who="sf5336">no</u>
<u who="nm5326">no you agree with the general sort of conclusion of the team anyone else</u>
<u who="sf5331">i think we did listen to each other a bit better this time and the initial plan would have been good in practice had  we been more open-minded</u>
<u who="nm5326">yeah you were well on the way to a good plan and you <trunc>ach</trunc>  you were well on the way to achieving your objectives  yeah so you feel <trunc>y</trunc>  you feel that you do you is that true that you feel that you worked better then in this exercise than in  the first one which is interesting cause you didn't actually achieve your objectives before #</u>
<u who="su">yeah but i think we worked</u>
<u who="su">i think we worked</u>
<u who="nm5326">it was harder it was harder any any more comments</u>
<u who="nm5326">i wondered whether at the expense of that time # thinking about #  because unfortunately the morning's <trunc>s</trunc>  soon  going to be over <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> but towards the end of the morning i think it it would be nice if you could start pulling out some  conclusions which you may well take forward with you into the rest of your lives # being ambitious here # but what i'd like  you to do is # just maybe think for a few minutes about coming up with some kind of model some kind of plan for  problem-solving in a team # now there's two ways you can do this now i'll i'll i'll ask you to decide given that we've got  the two groups merged you could actually split and we could do this would that be a good idea cause then we could discuss  both</u>
<u who="su">both would be <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/></u>
<u who="nm5326">would that be a good idea or would you rather stay in your you've got used to being in a big group you want to  stay in a big group</u>
<u who="sf5336">i think that it'd be easier to split up into two</u>
<u who="nm5326">yeah i think that might be quite nice cause # so so you're group ten right you four over there and you were  group one over this side why don't we just spend five minutes then in separate groups of four and think about # just coming  up with a bit of model a plan # strategy for the future which you can apply in the next exercise  we're going to do but that  you can also apply # in the in the more real world situation the future so i'll give you five minutes in your do you want to  have a little table and just sit round it # <trunc>f</trunc>  five minutes just to have a think # and then and then we can just # report on  it again maybe if you just want to pull back up a bit so i'll give you five to ten minutes to think come up with a plan a  strategy a vague or a very precise if you want strategy of how you how you might do better you know what i'm what i'm asking  are you clear with what i'm asking you to do</u>
<u who="sf5331">i think so yeah</u>
<gap reason="new phase of event" extent="uncertain"/>
<u who="sf5336">#</u>
<u who="sf5329">so we've got to think what's the first thing you do</u>
<u who="sf5331">well what's the task</u>
<u who="sf5329">yeah make <trunc>su</trunc>  make sure everyone understands the task yeah</u>
<u who="sf5331">and then # maybe even # if it's a if it's a kind of complicated thing we could just write down the tasks number them</u>
<u who="sf5336"># or underline the key points like cause the first one was a really big like long bit we could underline that i suppose <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/></u>
<u who="sf5331">and # and tasks need to be delegated efficiently everybody needs to be clear first of all of the task what they should be doing and what role they should be playing i think it's always what i i feel you should always have a a leader and follow what he somebody who</u>
<u who="sf5329">yeah yeah somebody who can make sure everybody has okay</u>
<u who="sf5336">right # and </u>
<u who="sf5329">i suppose it's more open discussion isn't it</u>
<u who="sf5336">yeah like putting ideas forward</u>
<u who="sf5331">brainstorming</u>
<u who="sf5329">yeah brainstorming yeah</u>
<u who="sf5329">and then then you have to cut it down and try and think what's the best ideas that have come out of that brainstorming</u>
<u who="sf5336">yeah and make sure everyone's involved</u>
<u who="sf5329">and make sure everyone agrees as well well to the best # as possible</u>
<u who="sf5336"># and make sure you try and think about every like eventuality</u>
<u who="sf5329">yeah</u>
<u who="sf5331">okay i suppose that's reiterating  being more open-minded all round and just preparing for every eventuality but then we would never have known that for that task would well well i would never have thought we'd be given minus numbers</u>
<u who="sf5329">i didn't think we'd get split up no # okay and then i suppose make a definite plan and run through it a few times</u>
<u who="sf5336">yeah make make sure everybody knows what they're doing</u>
<u who="sf5329">make everyone <trunc>su</trunc>  yeah what their role is make sure everyone's got like their own role</u>
<u who="sf5331">yeah do the task  </u>
<u who="sf5329">do the task</u>
<u who="sf5336">very important part</u>
<u who="sf5329">should we start writing this down</u>
<u who="sf5336">yeah how are we going to fit it into this space</u>
<u who="sf5329"># i don't know some sort of flow diagram i suppose would be alright</u>
<u who="sf5336"># so what was the first bit</u>
<u who="sf5331">identify a task and #</u>
<u who="sf5336">yeah</u>
<u who="sf5329">yeah</u>
<u who="sf5331"># </u>
<u who="sf5336">delegate roles</u>
<u who="sf5331">yeah</u>
<u who="sf5329">do the task but # we've got to pick out the key issues</u>
<u who="sf5331">okay</u>
<u who="sf5329">brainstorming</u>
<u who="sf5336">and make sure everyone in the team is involved</u>
<u who="sf5331">and is aware of what their responsibility is</u>
<u who="sf5336">yeah</u>
<u who="sf5331">prepare for any eventuality depending # nevertheless you know you know <trunc>howev</trunc>  however obscure it might be</u>
<u who="sf5336">yeah obscure</u>
<u who="sf5329">i suppose then you form your definite plan that should be <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/></u>
<u who="sf5331">definite plan </u>
<u who="sf5329">make sure people understand it</u>
<u who="sf5331">yeah</u>
<u who="sf5329">and then</u>
<u who="sf5331">again do the</u>
<u who="sf5329">do the task</u>
<gap reason="new phase of event" extent="uncertain"/>
<u who="nm5327">so in your in your plan which i think as i said i think that was a tremendous improvement over the first task did you end up doing what you said you'd do or how did the plan change</u>
<u who="sf5334">we said we'd time keep i mean and we didn't so</u>
<u who="nm5327">what about this i saw you sort of people were writing on people's hands was that part of your plan</u>
<u who="sf5333">no</u>
<u who="sm5340">no that was improvised</u>
<u who="su">that was improvisation</u>
<u who="sf5332">that was probably a better idea</u>
<u who="su">we came up with that #</u>
<u who="sf5333">i just started tapping Claire and then i was like #  oh i was like trying to do it on your arm and then i was like it's not working so i was like okay i'll just spell it out and then everyone started doing it i don't</u>
<u who="nm5327">now has # has anybody started to think about # a model for problem solving a model for problem solving out of what we've done so far should there be a model that we follow in every task</u>
<u who="su">plan</u>
<u who="nm5327">okay plan</u>
<u who="sf5333">i think it's different cause it depends on the task cause problems that we had in the first task we solved in a different way to like how we solved them in this task cause we just laughed</u>
<u who="sm5340">yeah</u>
<u who="nm5327">what what <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/></u>
<u who="sf5330">i think you need to get all your ideas together and sort of</u>
<u who="sf5332">knowing what you're doing and things</u>
<u who="nm5327">so you need to that's part of the plan isn't it don't you think so what do i what've i been giving you to put forward to start with</u>
<u who="sf5333">everyone needs to know what's going on cause if one of us tries to #</u>
<u who="sf5332">depends what the object at the end of the task is</u>
<u who="nm5327">that's good the object and then we provide you with information can't we so i'm giving you a sheet with all the information and then you're planning</u>
<gap reason="new phase of event" extent="uncertain"/>
<u who="sm5341">there but these problems are not but they mean different things then you # decide on all the obstacles and how important they are and then no we put discuss didn't so was that was that after yeah</u>
<u who="sm5338">discuss what has to be done</u>
<u who="sm5341">and then i'm getting confused now # </u>
<u who="nm5326"># its coming great so far</u>
<u who="sm5341"># no put forward ideas of how to do what has to be done then and that sort of comes back down if there's any problems in that the idea is you have to go all the way back round</u>
<u who="nm5326">okay</u>
<u who="sm5341">and it goes back up to the top cause we might just not be able to think of anything and then hopefully we can get a solution at the bottom</u>
<u who="nm5326">okay great yes makes sense to me # that # with that # do we have a volunteer from group one <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/></u>
<u who="sf5336">i'll do it </u>
<u who="nm5326">thanks Lucas</u>
<u who="sf5336">you'll have to tell me if i do anything wrong or leave something right the first thing is to identify the task and the key points from it and the second one we put delegate roles and possibly a leader</u>
<u who="nm5326">which is something that we we haven't discussed really yet hasn't really happened much</u>
<u who="sf5336">but Karen thought it was good to have a leader in this sorry and then we put # brainstorm ideas and # make sure everybody <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> # and then for the next one we put # that ensure every member is aware of the task and the role that they're going to play in it and # and oh prepare for the unexpected</u>
<u who="nm5326">right difficult but</u>
<u who="sf5336">just try and #</u>
<u who="nm5326">you tell me what happens of course if you?ve done these two things # well if you've brainstormed and you've made sure that everyone's been involved usually that's as much as you can do to prepare for unexpected to try and listen to everyone's possible</u>
<u who="sf5336"># and then <trunc>prep</trunc>  form a definite plan once you've done all of that just go through it again and then the last thing we put do the task and then review it at the end</u>
<u who="nm5326">yeah do and review great thanks very much</u>
<u who="sf5336">was there anything i missed out</u>
<u who="su">no</u>
<gap reason="new phase of event" extent="uncertain"/>
<u who="nm5327">again i think the one thing you did much better this time was actually assimilate the information okay so you  had things you had realised that the numbers were not necessarily going to be one to six and then Vince you said ah they're just going to be one to six aren't they</u>
<u who="sm5340">that's what i assumed so yeah</u>
<u who="nm5327">yeah so again that's interesting that's what we talked about in the first task about assuming things then but you you were accurate and that had come from assimilating the information</u>
<u who="sf5333">yeah i think # after we like tried it out i think we like realised there's problems like you know if like we all said if it's <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> what do we do so like i suppose yeah</u>
<u who="nm5327">so and after the plan what did we do after you'd made your plan what's the next </u>
<u who="nm5327"><gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> you put your plan into action </u>
<u who="sf5333">do a trial run</u>
<u who="nm5327">do a trial run and then what did you do during the trial run have you just come out of that with a late night at the Union there so you you actually did a trial which i thought was good and then you discussed what had happened didn't you you you reviewed didn't you i think and that's a sort of an # iterative process isn't it so <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> reviewed what you did and then put something else into action and then you review that and you should keep going round that circle until you # are confident that what you're going to do is achieve your object look i means there's no i mean we've there's there's no # one way of putting down words to go through the process there's many many different processes of doing tasks so we are we happy with that or not or there anything else we should add do we need to cross anything out and after the first task you wanted to get rid of that do you still want to get rid of it or should we leave it in Claire</u>
<u who="sf5330"># i think we should probably leave it in</u>
<u who="nm5327">you think we should leave it in</u>
<u who="sf5330">yeah</u>
<u who="su">yeah</u>
<u who="su">yeah</u>
<u who="nm5327">you don't have to</u>
<u who="sm5340">oh we won't then</u>
<u who="nm5327">okay so i i think a plan in any type of task is probably a good idea even if it only takes thirty seconds you've got something in your head right and # the information as well i think # well i think it goes without saying you know if you if you if you go and play any game and the game can be an essay or an exam or something you need to know the rules there'll be a certain percentage of the players in an exam or a task that don't bother looking at the rules and you're going to beat them if you know the rules because there will be people that hand their essay's in late there will be people who write too few words okay and those people as long as you fulfil the rules that just puts you up up the league table or it puts you closer to achieving that task i think # then in fact the object is good in fact  think that's another thing you're doing very well actually making it real especially you two in the first task that you said oh it's just a bit of water didn't you then you said no no it's real like that's good cause it gets you quite focussed on on what's going on okay we're almost finished what we're supposed to do now we're ahead of time now unless anybody's got anything else they want to say about the two tasks we've done so far feeling like part of a team yeah</u>
<u who="su">yeah</u>
<u who="sf5332">yeah </u>
<u who="nm5327">one person there who's who's # who thinks they're an activist how many activists have we got Vince where do you fit let's just whiz through</u>
<u who="sm5340">i'm not an activist</u>
<u who="nm5327">reflector i can't remember the other one actually that'll do so where would you put yourself</u>
<u who="su">what's the last one theorist</u>
<u who="nm5327">theorist sorry</u>
<u who="sm5340">oh right # i'll be reflector </u>
<u who="nm5327">you're a reflector is Vince a reflector</u>
<u who="sm5340">well in fact i'm just someone who stands on the side and does nothing but</u>
<u who="nm5327">does he is being fair on himself</u>
<u who="su">no</u>
<u who="su">no he does a bit of everything</u>
<u who="sm5340">no i can't do anything let's be honest like # yeah not</u>
<u who="nm5327">no i don't think that's true does anybody think that's true</u>
<u who="su">no</u>
<u who="sm5340">come on don't be nice i don't know wherever</u>
<u who="nm5327">i don't know i'd say what does anybody think he is is he an activist</u>
<u who="sm5340">okay well i haven't done and reflector i haven't reflected on anything and i haven't come up with any theories so so nothing</u>
<u who="sf5333">you have reflected cause you're reflecting by saying you didn't do anything</u>
<u who="sm5340">in that case i suppose i'll be a reflector then</u>
<u who="nm5327">well if that's what you think you are you happy with that are you going to try and change that in the third task if you feel like you're not contributing other people think you're contributing but you obviously</u>
<u who="sm5340">well in that case i'll do exactly the same as i've been doing then</u>
<u who="nm5327">okay Natalie what do you think you're contributing then</u>
<u who="sf5332">don't know</u>
<u who="sf5333">you always come up with good ideas</u>
<u who="sf5332">yeah yeah yeah</u>
<u who="sf5333">contributing ideas</u>
<u who="nm5327">okay coming up with ideas is that who you are in real life</u>
<u who="sf5332"># yeah i suppose so yeah i like to keep having an input and try and like you know come up with something even if it's not much just helping the team out</u>
<u who="sf5333">i don't think about anything i just do it so go go go</u>
<u who="nm5327"><gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> in there and see what goes on <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/></u>
<u who="sf5335">i don't know</u>
<u who="nm5327">i mean you can be more than one <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/></u>
<u who="sf5335">i really don't know</u>
<u who="sf5333">i think a reflector and a theorist cause you're coming up with things but she's also looking at other people's things and sort of saying like don't know yeah no she kind of takes her time to think about it before she actually says anything not like well i was just saying whatever comes into my head but like to me she seems to think about it a bit more</u>
<u who="nm5327"><gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> that's good Claire what about yourself </u>
<u who="sf5330"># i think i'm probably a reflector <vocal desc="laugh" iterated="n" dur="1"/> because</u>
<u who="nm5327">you like to work out what's going on</u>
<u who="sf5330">yeah i think so i don't know i mean i've got ideas as well but not as many as some people so</u>
<u who="nm5327">and Lou what about yourself</u>
<u who="sf5334"># probably a reflector #</u>
<u who="nm5327">so we've got just one activist in this group that just tackled that first task like let's get the equipment out and and see what it does no it's no it's # the thing that i think in any team if if we had six people that just wanted to get stuck in then your team <trunc>wou</trunc>  can fall apart so you you <trunc>oft</trunc>  often need different types of people in the team to make it succeed does anybody feel like they're not being allowed to contribute to the team how they want to no</u>
<u who="sm5340">we could do with another bloke not to be rude but yeah</u>
<u who="sf5333">a bit of female dominance going on</u>
<u who="sm5340">yeah that's the thing yeah you're just all doing your like girly chat and shit</u>
<u who="nm5327">we have one team member feeling left out here so anybody else and that's an important part of the team as well to kind of even if it's small things that people are feeling a bit excluded about that that to recognise that and try and bring them in cause i think you did that in the first task</u>
<u who="sm5340">i don't feel excluded</u>
<u who="nm5327">the first task so it's not you're not going to be blindfolded in another one alright so what you want to try and do now is try and put the learning points that you've done that we've hopefully done back to planning and time-keeping and things and i think if you do that it'll put stand you in good stead  and then we can come out of the last task in an elated fashion rather than a deflated one okay</u>
