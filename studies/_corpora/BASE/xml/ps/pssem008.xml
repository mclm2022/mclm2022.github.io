<u who="nm5386"># okay now we've got that # barrier out of the way now as # Tim was saying # at the end of the lecture this is # an # exercise # and an exercise which is # designed to # address some of the problems that students have typically had with # writing their particular reviews # exercises are very useful of course they are not the real thing we haven't got time to do the real thing and you're all meant to be doing the real thing when you're doing your dissertations but i hope # you'll enjoy doing this and that you'll take something away from it # its # <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> actually hand out some pieces of paper # which # i will do now there we go what you're going to end up with # in about half an hours time is each group is going to have a paragraph # which will incorporate some of the information # contained on that sheet you are basically going to read it and analyse it and then synthesise it into a paragraph as though it were a paragraph in you literature review and then comes the fun bit because you are going to inscribe that paragraph on # something for the overhead projector and # one of you a spokesman for each group is going to talk through how you arrived at your paragraph now obviously there will be similarities between the two paragraphs but they will of course be different because you're going to be working independently and then # when we've got the two paragraphs we # then decide which aspects of them we think work and which aspects of them we think don't work so that's the very simple brief # one of things looking at this material that Tim dreamt up it has all the appearance of being genuine academic material but actually he's just made it all up # so that no-one is distracted by their own knowledge as it were of whatever # engineering speciality a few of you may have the widget for the purposes of this exercise is a thing # an unspecified thing # its not the widget we're interested in its the descriptions of it # in fact i believe that the widget is a thing in <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> forget that perhaps i'm just bringing my own personal expertise in on that point # but as far as we're concerned today a widget is just a name of a thing what's important is what these three academic books say about it # the first thing that i would suggest that you do after you've all read them is identify the aspect of the widget that each concentrates on # because knowing what the # literature that already exists concentrates o means that you can then identify something that it doesn't concentrate on because as <gap reason="name" extent="2 word"/> was saying the lecture that i'm sure you've had drummed into you many times by your tutors the point of doing any core postgraduate work is to do something new # it won't be massively new and world-shatteringly original at masters level but we are looking for somthig which hasn't actually been done before so the first thing to do is to identify what has been done before and then see what remains where you could squeeze in in this place your particular take on the widget so the first thing to do individually i think is to read those # read the sheet and make tiny notes one word notes # on on the basic theme of each of the books that's the first thing to do and then i'll come round in about five minutes or so and see hwo you'e getting on with that and then then the next thing will be to work in a group to work out how you're going to synthesise this into one well-written clear paragraph for your <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> okay</u>

<u who="su"><gap reason="inaudible" extent="uncertain"/></u>

<u who="nm5386"> right i think its time to start talking to each other make sure you all agree <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> as we were saying the point of this sort of review is to show what the field consists of <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> i think you should also be thinking about <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> or where you would be coming in where is the gap what what <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> thesis could you start finding space for right so get together and first of all check that you are all agreed on what the four the three different books are and then look at <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/></u>

<u who="su"><gap reason="inaudible" extent="uncertain"/></u>

<u who="sm5387">one gap i see here is <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> that's the test we carried out that's this may be right</u>

<u who="su"><gap reason="inaudible" extent="uncertain"/></u>

<u who="nm5386">what sort of perspective on the subject does it have</u>

<u who="su"><gap reason="inaudible" extent="uncertain"/></u>

<u who="nm5386">yes but what does development imply <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> something starts there so it develops so you could say if you were just using one word to just give a title to that that this has a historical relevance</u>

<u who="su"><gap reason="inaudible" extent="uncertain"/></u>

<u who="sf5388"><gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> it is because of the design and the style of the <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> so he has paid attention to the <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/></u>

<u who="nm5386">so you could say that the second one although <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> really interested in the design okay and then what about <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/></u>

<u who="su"><gap reason="inaudible" extent="uncertain"/></u>

<u who="sf5388">demand</u>

<u who="nm5386">demand these are all words we associate with economics okay now obviously there's a bit of economics in all of these <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> design but this one it seems to me <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> on economic # aspect so that's one way of just distinguishing <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> because the problem with <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> that you concentrated is that you end up with the text and you really wanted a banner headline <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> primary concern <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> in contrast <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> and then you've got a sort of way of differentiating between them well teh next thing that you're going to have to do have you got some paper there have you got # a pen # paper</u>

<u who="sf5388">oh yeah</u>

<u who="nm5386">now between you you've got to summarise all of that as though you were writing in your literature review # so you better get started on that</u>

<u who="sm5387">okay</u>

<u who="nm5386">okay</u>

<u who="su"><gap reason="inaudible" extent="uncertain"/></u>

<u who="sf5388"><gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> he <trunc>mention</trunc> he mentioned that the first one was about <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/></u>

<u who="sm5387"><gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> characterised by a different use so maybe we can write something about a different use right i mean the first people he mentioned <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> i think so yes and then the last one the latest one is the economic and the second one mentioned that <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> but because of the <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> of the U-K they ignoring this image and so <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/></u>

<u who="sf5388">can we begin with the #</u>

<u who="su"><gap reason="inaudible" extent="uncertain"/></u>

<u who="sm5387">the thing is that the first one the first one it doesn't mention the <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> U-K and U-S market</u>

<u who="sf5388">it can be said that <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/></u>

<u who="su"><gap reason="inaudible" extent="uncertain"/></u>

<u who="sf5388">since i don't know when its written so # # <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/></u>

<u who="sm5387">because we don't know how to start together so we do it separately <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/></u>

<u who="nm5386">well i think if you do just do that quite quickly because #</u>

<u who="sm5387">sure okay</u>

<u who="su"><gap reason="inaudible" extent="uncertain"/></u>

<u who="sf5388">according to the research by Smith <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> it showed that # the <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/></u>

<u who="nm5386">yes now i think <trunc>that</trunc> that's a good point but what you want to do is to make that point but note also that # that the other two authors don't agree with her at all</u>

<u who="sf5388">yeah just one</u>

<u who="nm5386">yeah and what you're trying to do here is to sort of compare and contrast all of them</u>

<u who="sf5388">yeah</u>

<u who="nm5386">so not just say what each says</u>

<u who="sf5388">yeah</u>

<u who="nm5386">say point out their difference from something else so you can say something like while <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> Smith # # <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> # stresses the old traditional methods <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> is concerned with the future new age of manufacturing etcetera etcetera so that shows what htis is about it also shows <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/></u>

<u who="su"><gap reason="inaudible" extent="uncertain"/></u>

<u who="sf5388">the <trunc>increase</trunc> the demand reason is to meet the capacity and the <trunc>o</trunc> another resaon is to make it cheap <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> increasing demand of the <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/></u>

<u who="sf5389">okay we can make it if you want to <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> we can apply the computerised system <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> the thing is that <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/></u>

<u who="su"><gap reason="inaudible" extent="uncertain"/></u>

<u who="nm5386">how are you doing are you doing well</u>

<u who="sm5387">its becoming longer and longer</u>

<u who="nm5386">well see that's good you've got the final draft on paper before the #</u>

<u who="su"><gap reason="inaudible" extent="uncertain"/></u>

<u who="sf5388">design is not for aesthetics only design is sometimes for functionalities so we want to be specific we want to emphasise that its for aesthetics to make it look attractive</u>

<u who="su"><gap reason="inaudible" extent="uncertain"/></u>

<u who="nm5386">now can everybody see # the camera everybody see that</u>

<u who="sm5387"><gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> the topic of group is focus on nineteen-ninety-five traditional labour # intensive way of making widgets # <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> # two-thousand-one mentioned that to meet the market and the economical scope</u>

<u who="nm5386">skills</u>

<u who="sm5387">skills industries should apply computerized systems in widgets <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> in addition to make the widgets more attractive to the market the <trunc>aest</trunc> aesthetics of the widgets should be emphasised</u>

<u who="nm5386">emphasised</u>

<u who="sm5387">emphasised</u>

<u who="nm5386">okay thank you very much now # can you <trunc>do</trunc> <trunc>you</trunc> can we just have a quick comment on that one before we do yours because that will be different from yours i would <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> a word that i would have mentioned i mean you're drawing the essence of this book so mention is something that i might mention to you <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> drink in a minute but that's not you know this is what the book is about so its mentioned is just the wrong word # generally i like the way that flows as a sentence # i like the way that you haven't been # constrained by the order in which these appear <trunc>i</trunc> <trunc>i</trunc> <trunc>d</trunc> doesn't look as though you just lifted things from it # now having said that i think it would be better if you added a quotation or two now as we were just discussing you haven't put in a sort of final bit about where there might be a gap for further research but # anyway well done that's a pretty good piece of work and as we're running out of time we'll move swiftly on to the second presentation</u>

<u who="sm5387">according to Smith <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> widgets have a place in history he suggests that <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> methods of manufacture cannot be <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> by new technology methods his views are not shared by <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> manufacturing system he <trunc>ad</trunc> advocates that his new system will reduce the cost of manufacture by half implying <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> costs with steady demand <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> demand has been declining the he attributes to neglect of design of the widget by manufacturers <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> okay i think we missed something we made a mistake there <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> practical application to widget style and colour to to prevent that's supposed to be to prevent widget <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/></u>

<u who="nm5386">okay thank you very much and now ah you're getting applause from this side of the room # do you four want to make some some comments on on that <gap reason="inaudible" extent="uncertain"/> # well i think its good too i think # it could still be slimmed down a little bit you've got repetition of # <gap reason="inaudible" extent="uncertain"/> yeah it just you know if you find you're repeating the same phrase in the in a piece of work which is compressing so much then you know <trunc>y</trunc> you need to avoid that # but # and i think as i said with <trunc>th</trunc> <trunc>th</trunc> the first group that would be strengthened by bringing one or two of the quotations out <trunc>a</trunc> and putting them in # but # no i mean <trunc>tha</trunc> that represents # a very good attempt at sort of compressing and differentiating between <trunc>th</trunc> <trunc>th</trunc> the books and again i think it would be helpful if you gave sort of as it were headline # identifications of the books so that the first one <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> Smith who takes a historical perspective or a historical overview that just sort of signals to the reader what sort of a book it is # and then you could look at the # Kilroy and say # that this is actually looking primarily at the # aesthetic element of marketing # as i was saying to you when i came round <trunc>y</trunc> you may make a wonderful car but if it looks like a dustbin no-one's going to buy it # and so although you've compressed most of the information on the sheet you haven't brought that sort of new way of showing that you've sort of # taken on board <trunc>wh</trunc> what each of the books was about # but that was a a hard exercise you've all worked very hard i hope we're going to <trunc>t</trunc> take things away from this which you'll find useful # the last thing i'm going to say # is if you remember in the lecture Tim said if you wanted his lecture notes you could sign up with your emails and he'll do a mass emailing so i'm going to put this here</u>
