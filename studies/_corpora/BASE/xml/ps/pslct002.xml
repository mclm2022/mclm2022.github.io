<u who="nm0658"> this is the <pause dur="0.2"/> last of five sessions <pause dur="0.5"/> which are <pause dur="0.3"/> specially for your group <pause dur="0.4"/> to look at the design analysis of experiments <pause dur="1.0"/> # from next week <pause dur="0.6"/> we <pause dur="0.2"/> are going back to the general group <pause dur="0.5"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> we're going to look at advanced methods <pause dur="0.4"/> which i think are equally applicable <pause dur="0.5"/> for everybody <pause dur="0.3"/> so we're then going to look at advanced modelling ideas <pause dur="0.5"/> which i think are the same sort of models you need to consider <pause dur="0.3"/> whether you're doing a survey or an experiment <pause dur="0.9"/> the two main problems we will tackle there <pause dur="0.3"/> will be <pause dur="0.2"/> what happens if your design is unbalanced <pause dur="1.1"/> and some experiments are unbalanced and most surveys <pause dur="0.5"/> have unbalanced data <pause dur="1.3"/> and the second thing we will tackle <pause dur="0.2"/> is what happens <pause dur="0.3"/> when your data may not come from a normal distribution <pause dur="0.7"/> the traditional statistics <pause dur="0.3"/> says that <pause dur="0.3"/> if your data come from a normal distribution then everything is fine <pause dur="0.4"/> and if they don't come from a normal distribution <pause dur="0.4"/> then <pause dur="0.2"/> you first panic <pause dur="0.4"/> and then you transform your data and then you hope your panic is over <pause dur="0.7"/> and there are 
modern methods now <pause dur="0.4"/> where you can analyse data from a non-normal distribution <pause dur="0.5"/> much more flexibly <pause dur="0.3"/> than was possible before <pause dur="0.6"/> so that's what we're going to do together <pause dur="0.4"/> with <pause dur="0.2"/> the # <pause dur="0.2"/> students from wildlife management <pause dur="0.4"/> # and also from vegetation <pause dur="0.3"/> surveys <pause dur="1.3"/> so what i want to do today <pause dur="0.3"/> is to <pause dur="0.2"/> review <pause dur="0.2"/> the ideas <pause dur="0.3"/> # of experimental design <pause dur="0.3"/> and analysis <pause dur="0.2"/> and then go through one more advanced topic <pause dur="0.4"/> which is a very common topic and which is the subject of repeated measures <pause dur="0.4"/> so that's where <pause dur="0.3"/> you measure repeatedly on the same unit <pause dur="0.4"/> be it the same animal <pause dur="0.2"/> the same tree <pause dur="0.3"/> or the same plot <pause dur="0.3"/> you go back to it perhaps repeatedly through the season <pause dur="1.0"/> and what i want you to do <pause dur="0.3"/> with this <pause dur="0.3"/> single example of a more advanced method <pause dur="0.4"/> is to see whether the weapons you have learned through the last <pause dur="0.3"/> four weeks <pause dur="0.4"/> how much can they help <pause dur="1.0"/> because what i would like you to get to by the end of this course <pause dur="0.9"/> is <pause dur="1.1"/> # so that the subject of statistics is not always expanding <pause dur="0.6"/> you've got to give yourself a framework <pause dur="0.6"/> so that when 
you have a new problem <pause dur="0.4"/> you say well what parts of the problem are new <pause dur="0.2"/> and what parts can fit into the the subject that i already know <pause dur="0.4"/> and i want to show you <pause dur="0.2"/> that although repeated measures appears to be a new subject <pause dur="0.5"/> once you understand some of the basic ideas we've tried to cover <pause dur="0.5"/> then <pause dur="0.2"/> there are only a few <pause dur="0.2"/> extra <pause dur="0.3"/> changes <pause dur="0.3"/> to be able to follow the ways you could analyse a repeated measures example <pause dur="1.6"/> so <pause dur="1.0"/> what i'm going to do this morning <pause dur="0.8"/> is <pause dur="0.5"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> to review some of the ideas of designing experiments <pause dur="1.0"/> bringing in <pause dur="0.2"/> what Genstat can do to help you <pause dur="0.8"/> look very quickly at data management <pause dur="0.7"/> # and then go into <pause dur="0.3"/> as part of the analysis <pause dur="0.2"/> how to analyse a repeated measures experiment <pause dur="3.5"/><vocal desc="cough" iterated="n"/><pause dur="1.6"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> you should have just two handouts <pause dur="0.3"/> although it says here you have three <pause dur="0.2"/> i couldn't think of anything extra to write for the worksheet so this is the one week where there isn't a worksheet <pause dur="0.3"/> so you have a lecture note <pause dur="0.2"/> and you have the practical exercise for <pause dur="0.4"/> the practical <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> which is as usual in the Met department at 
eleven o'clock <pause dur="6.6"/><vocal desc="cough" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.2"/> now we're going to look at <pause dur="0.4"/> the ideas of designing experiment <pause dur="0.7"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> and <pause dur="0.4"/> i've kept repeating <pause dur="0.3"/> that you start with your objectives <pause dur="0.2"/> they lead to the treatments <pause dur="1.0"/> the way you're doing your experiment leads to the layout <pause dur="0.2"/> you must decide on your measurements and we've now moved for the last four weeks to do the analysis <pause dur="0.4"/> and we're going to consider these components in turn yet again <pause dur="0.6"/> and see at the same time how Genstat can assist <pause dur="0.3"/> with the randomization of an experiment <pause dur="5.0"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> so <pause dur="0.3"/> the menu that you're going to use <pause dur="0.3"/> here we see Genstat it's not very clear but it's probably clearer on your slide <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> that <pause dur="0.2"/> you're on the usual stats menu <pause dur="0.8"/> but instead of going <pause dur="0.2"/> to analysis of variance you go up one <pause dur="0.8"/> to an option called design <pause dur="1.0"/> and there are a variety of things you can do <pause dur="0.2"/> and all we're going to do <pause dur="0.4"/> is look at one or two standard <pause dur="0.3"/> designs <pause dur="1.3"/> and we're going to use them first to show you how to randomize an experiment <pause dur="0.6"/> but also to review some of the ideas of different experiments <pause dur="5.6"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> here's the 
sort of menu you get <pause dur="1.6"/> and almost all the experiments that we've been discussing <pause dur="0.4"/> you can randomize <pause dur="0.3"/> using this menu <pause dur="1.0"/> for the very simplest experiment you might consider <pause dur="0.2"/> is a one-way design where you've just got treatments <pause dur="0.6"/> and the <pause dur="0.5"/> experiment is laid out in randomized blocks <pause dur="1.2"/> so then in this menu <pause dur="0.2"/> you have to say <pause dur="0.2"/> what do i call the blocks <pause dur="0.2"/> we've just left it with an A block <pause dur="0.3"/> and how many blocks are there <pause dur="1.3"/> what are we going to call <pause dur="0.5"/> the units well we'll call them plots <pause dur="0.7"/> and what are we going to call the treatment factor which might be variety here i've just called it treat <pause dur="0.5"/> and how many levels </u><pause dur="1.1"/><u who="sm0659" trans="pause"> one question please <pause dur="0.3"/> what is the criteria for one-way or two-way <pause dur="0.2"/> two-ways design </u><pause dur="1.7"/> <u who="nm0658" trans="pause"> you mean this </u><u who="sm0659" trans="overlap"> <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 word"/> yeah what will be the criteria for this to choose one-way or <pause dur="0.2"/> <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> </u><u who="nm0658" trans="overlap"> two-way designs </u><u who="sm0659" trans="overlap"> yeah i believe there must be a two-way </u><u who="nm0658" trans="latching"> this is where <pause dur="0.3"/> on the second component <pause dur="1.0"/> i've said that <pause dur="0.2"/> you first think of the treatments <pause dur="0.8"/> if you're <pause dur="0.4"/> if you have one treatment factor <pause dur="0.7"/> like variety <pause dur="0.9"/> that is a one-way design <pause dur="1.3"/> if you have two treatment factors <pause dur="0.7"/> let us say <pause dur="0.2"/> three varieties <pause dur="0.4"/> and <pause dur="0.3"/> two levels of fertility <pause dur="1.0"/> that would be two treatment factors <pause dur="1.3"/> and then you would have <pause dur="0.3"/> a two-way

this previous slide <pause dur="0.5"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> just to remind you what i did <pause dur="2.4"/> this particular example <pause dur="0.7"/> i have <pause dur="0.5"/> four blocks <pause dur="0.6"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> three levels of the treatment <pause dur="0.6"/> so it's a simple design i have twelve plots so there's a twelve down at the bottom <pause dur="0.5"/> which Genstat works out automatically <pause dur="0.2"/> just multiplying the four by the three <pause dur="0.2"/> that this was an experiment with twelve plots <pause dur="1.9"/> so when i click on okay <pause dur="1.0"/> it will produce the randomization <pause dur="0.3"/> and automatically <pause dur="0.3"/> you will now get <pause dur="3.7"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> i've called it data but it's really just the design <pause dur="0.5"/> you will now get <pause dur="0.9"/> this structure <pause dur="0.2"/> in a Genstat spreadsheet <pause dur="3.1"/> now i want you to notice and we will emphasize this later on <pause dur="0.6"/> that <pause dur="0.5"/> this way of laying out the data <pause dur="1.0"/> is part of the simple data management <pause dur="0.7"/> and i've seen one or two examples this term <pause dur="0.3"/> because <pause dur="0.2"/> you are all addicts of Excel <pause dur="0.8"/> you will find that Excel gives you too much freedom in laying out your data <pause dur="0.3"/> and that can cause lots of problems later on <pause dur="0.7"/> so i emphasize what we discussed in <pause dur="0.3"/> session three <pause dur="0.6"/> that <pause dur="0.2"/> when you have twelve plots in an experiment <pause dur="0.4"/> the 
layout of the data for a statistics package <pause dur="0.3"/> is to have <pause dur="0.2"/> twelve rows of data <pause dur="0.2"/> one for each plot <pause dur="0.6"/> you will have the label for the plot <pause dur="0.6"/> and you will then <pause dur="0.3"/> have another column which says which block <pause dur="0.9"/> am i using <pause dur="0.4"/> which <pause dur="0.4"/> plot do i have and which treatment <pause dur="0.3"/> and these treatments have been randomized <pause dur="0.9"/> so there's your randomization <pause dur="0.9"/> so this is your data laid out <pause dur="0.2"/> in the sort of field order <pause dur="0.3"/> ready <pause dur="0.7"/> to <pause dur="0.2"/> add further columns if you like with your measurements once you take them <pause dur="0.9"/> and so <pause dur="0.2"/> this is all ready <pause dur="0.2"/> to be a data collection form <pause dur="1.7"/> and this is in Genstat <pause dur="1.3"/> so the next part of your strategy you see <pause dur="0.3"/> is to say well <pause dur="0.3"/> after <pause dur="0.3"/> i haven't got any measurements yet because i'm just designing my experiment <pause dur="0.3"/> but when i've got my measurements <pause dur="0.2"/> they will make more columns here <pause dur="0.9"/> do i want to enter these measurement data <pause dur="0.5"/> into <pause dur="0.3"/> Genstat or into Excel <pause dur="1.0"/> i can choose <pause dur="0.7"/> so if you choose to save <pause dur="0.2"/> this as an Excel file which i did <pause dur="0.5"/> then <pause dur="0.2"/> here is the same information <pause dur="0.2"/> saved in Excel <pause dur="1.3"/> so now as you see you've got <pause dur="0.3"/> A B C and D in Excel <pause dur="0.3"/> and 
once you measure a few things <pause dur="0.2"/> the height of the plants or the mean height of the plants <pause dur="0.3"/> # the yield and various things <pause dur="0.2"/> those just become more columns <pause dur="0.3"/> which you can enter <pause dur="0.4"/> into <pause dur="0.4"/> back into Genstat for the analysis <pause dur="2.5"/> and you will remember from the # <pause dur="0.2"/> session on management <pause dur="0.2"/> we have said <pause dur="0.7"/> please enter your data straight from the field in the randomized order <pause dur="0.5"/> and now you see that's a very easy routine <pause dur="0.7"/> you can start in your stats package <pause dur="0.2"/> to randomize your experiment <pause dur="0.7"/> if you choose to do your data entry in Excel then that's fine <pause dur="0.6"/> you export <pause dur="0.2"/> all the details <pause dur="0.3"/> before the season <pause dur="0.4"/> here <pause dur="0.6"/> you now collect data and as you collect the data <pause dur="0.4"/> you just type in your extra columns of data <pause dur="0.3"/> and your data are ready entered <pause dur="1.1"/> 
and in many of the courses that i give <pause dur="0.4"/> i try and encourage scientists <pause dur="0.3"/> not to enter data at the end of the season when they've got everything collected <pause dur="0.5"/> but if <pause dur="0.5"/> after <pause dur="0.5"/> a few weeks <pause dur="0.2"/> you've measured <pause dur="0.3"/> the data fifty per cent flowering <pause dur="0.3"/> then the day you measure it <pause dur="0.2"/> you just type it in <pause dur="0.3"/> it's very quick <pause dur="1.1"/> and so it's there in your field book <pause dur="0.3"/> and in it goes same day <pause dur="0.5"/> and then if there's a problem <pause dur="0.4"/> you can <pause dur="0.3"/> probably have a look very quickly and you've seen how easy it is <pause dur="0.3"/> to having <pause dur="0.5"/> even if you enter in Excel <pause dur="0.3"/> to then get your data into Genstat for the analysis <pause dur="0.4"/> so the very day you collect your data <pause dur="0.3"/> there is no problem doing your first analysis <pause dur="0.6"/> and the procedure works <pause dur="0.4"/> very nicely <pause dur="3.3"/> any <pause dur="0.2"/> questions so far <pause dur="1.3"/><vocal desc="cough" iterated="n"/><pause dur="2.6"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> the second example <pause dur="2.8"/> this now can follow up your initial question <pause dur="0.2"/> this is now <pause dur="0.4"/> an experiment <pause dur="0.5"/> where i have got <pause dur="0.2"/> three factors <pause dur="2.1"/> so i've got three treatment factors i'm assuming irrigation with four

very small plots <pause dur="0.8"/> so i'm assuming <pause dur="0.2"/> that <pause dur="0.2"/> either because of your expertise or in discussion with a statistician <pause dur="0.3"/> you decide that <pause dur="0.2"/> you can get away with small plots for variety <pause dur="0.3"/> but you need larger plots for here and that's why you chose a split plot design <pause dur="1.1"/> if that had not been the case <pause dur="0.4"/> then as we've said before <pause dur="0.7"/> i would recommend that you don't have a split plot design you've have a randomized plot design <pause dur="0.2"/> and then you <pause dur="0.4"/> you'd just have a different menu <pause dur="0.4"/> and you just say these are the three factors <pause dur="2.3"/> and what i want to show you in a minute is that we'll come and check <pause dur="0.4"/> well was it a good idea <pause dur="0.2"/> our design </u><pause dur="1.5"/> <u who="sf0660" trans="pause"> can i just ask what's the randomization seed is that the way of generating random numbers </u><pause dur="1.2"/> <u who="nm0658" trans="pause"> that's correct # yes i haven't explained these things down at the bottom <pause dur="0.4"/> the randomization seed <pause dur="0.6"/> means that that's the point at which it starts its random number generation <pause dur="1.0"/> so <pause dur="0.6"/> if you were <pause dur="0.3"/> to make a note of this <pause dur="1.6"/> then you could always regenerate the same randomization <pause dur="0.2"/> yet again you don't have to keep everything <pause dur="0.4"/> by <pause dur="0.6"/> typing this number in yourself so usually you allow the 
computer <pause dur="0.2"/> to choose this and it's different every time <pause dur="1.2"/> but if you chose <pause dur="0.2"/> to make it the same you'd get the same randomization <pause dur="1.1"/> and that's quite a good way of keeping a record of the randomization you had <pause dur="0.3"/> without noting everything down <pause dur="0.4"/> if somebody would say please could you print me another copy of that <pause dur="0.4"/> well you can always <pause dur="0.3"/> print the resulting <pause dur="0.3"/> spreadsheet <pause dur="0.5"/> but if you said well <pause dur="0.8"/> sending the information all you have to do is fill this in this way and give that random number seed and you'll get the same <pause dur="0.2"/> randomization <pause dur="7.1"/> and this is the randomization that follows <pause dur="1.7"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> so this is the output when you press okay <pause dur="3.0"/> it goes on of course <pause dur="0.4"/> down to ninety-six plots we only have fourteen plots here <pause dur="0.4"/> but you see it gives you a column which says which block <pause dur="0.2"/> which main plot <pause dur="0.2"/> which subplot <pause dur="0.3"/> which level of irrigation which level of fertility and which variety <pause dur="0.8"/> these of course are not randomized <pause dur="1.5"/> but <pause dur="0.8"/> the this <pause dur="0.5"/> which is the level of irrigation fertility and variety <pause dur="0.4"/> that is associated <pause dur="0.2"/> is randomized <pause dur="0.6"/> to a 
certain extent <pause dur="0.6"/> what you should notice <pause dur="0.4"/> is that the variety <pause dur="0.9"/> is randomized on the little plots <pause dur="0.9"/> so here's the first main plot which goes one one one <pause dur="0.8"/> while the subplots go one two three <pause dur="1.5"/> you will notice <pause dur="0.2"/> that irrigate <pause dur="0.5"/> is at the same level one <pause dur="0.2"/> for all those three <pause dur="0.4"/> because that's at the main plot level <pause dur="1.0"/> and so is fertility <pause dur="0.7"/> but the varieties <pause dur="0.3"/> go <pause dur="0.3"/> one two three <pause dur="1.2"/> because they are randomized on the subplot level <pause dur="0.8"/> and when we go to the next main plot <pause dur="0.6"/> here <pause dur="0.8"/> we have main plot two <pause dur="0.5"/> subplots one two three these two again remain the same because it's a split plot design <pause dur="0.3"/> and these three this is a complete repeat of all the values here <pause dur="0.5"/> so each main plot <pause dur="0.8"/> is a total repeat <pause dur="0.6"/> for all the levels of variety <pause dur="0.6"/> but it just is one plot from here </u><pause dur="7.8"/> <u who="sm0667" trans="pause"> <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> <pause dur="1.0"/> # <pause dur="2.2"/> if they're completely randomized will it be numbers one to ninety-six or </u><pause dur="0.8"/> <u who="nm0658" trans="pause"> # sorry </u><pause dur="0.3"/> <u who="sm0667" trans="pause"> if they're completely randomized </u><pause dur="0.8"/> <u who="nm0658" trans="pause"> if it were completely randomized </u><pause dur="0.2"/> <u who="sm0667" trans="pause"> mm </u><u who="nm0658" trans="overlap"> without even any replicates <pause dur="0.6"/> then it would randomize everything <pause dur="0.3"/> for the numbers one to ninety-six <pause dur="0.3"/> so you can choose <pause dur="0.3"/> do i have replicates <pause dur="0.6"/> which is a sort of blocking idea <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> do i have 
treatments <pause dur="0.2"/> and how do i randomize <pause dur="0.5"/> you probably wouldn't use this menu if you just wanted a set of random numbers there's an easier way of doing that <pause dur="0.4"/> but that would be the extreme <pause dur="0.3"/> for the randomization that's right <pause dur="1.1"/> now <pause dur="1.1"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> you asked just now about this randomization seed <pause dur="0.4"/> but there are other options down at the bottom <pause dur="0.7"/> that you could also ask for <pause dur="0.9"/> and i've used one or two of these <pause dur="1.2"/> # i've asked could i have a dummy ANOVA table <pause dur="1.2"/> which might answer a bit more of your question <pause dur="0.2"/> why did i choose to put varieties at the subplot level <pause dur="0.8"/> what i would like to see occasionally is <pause dur="0.2"/> is the resulting design a sensible one for me to continue with <pause dur="1.6"/> and so i could learn a little bit about that with a dummy ANOVA table <pause dur="0.3"/> and i will show you in a minute what that is <pause dur="1.3"/> i could ask <pause dur="0.3"/> for trial ANOVA with random data <pause dur="2.7"/> what it does there <pause dur="0.3"/> please don't make too much of that the random data <pause dur="0.2"/> is only there to show you what will the results look like <pause dur="0.8"/> from this sort of experiment <pause dur="0.2"/> when you have 
some data <pause dur="0.3"/> how will the results be laid out <pause dur="0.7"/> so it can show you <pause dur="0.3"/> the way in which the results will be laid out and i think that's quite useful ahead of the experiment <pause dur="0.4"/> to say is that a sensible thing so <pause dur="0.2"/> this is the sort of tool that i would like also for discussion <pause dur="0.3"/> with people such as yourself <pause dur="0.3"/> when you're saying i'm thinking of doing this sort of experiment <pause dur="0.4"/> and i can say well <pause dur="0.2"/> this is the sort of result you will get <pause dur="0.8"/> are you happy A with the design <pause dur="0.5"/> and B <pause dur="0.2"/> that you can then understand the results <pause dur="2.1"/> so let's show you what this <pause dur="0.2"/> works out <pause dur="1.3"/> because i ticked the dummy ANOVA table <pause dur="3.2"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> here i have <pause dur="0.2"/> the dummy ANOVA <pause dur="0.4"/> from Genstat <pause dur="6.1"/> i asked you how many main plots <pause dur="0.3"/> and you see <pause dur="0.2"/> this is straight print out from Genstat <pause dur="0.3"/> and here you see here is the main plot <pause dur="0.2"/> section <pause dur="2.7"/> so this is all revision <pause dur="0.3"/> but you can see <pause dur="0.2"/> that from the point of view of these two factors <pause dur="0.6"/> this is a simple experiment <pause dur="0.2"/> not with ninety-six <pause dur="0.2"/> plots <pause dur="0.5"/> but with ninety-six divided by three plots <pause dur="0.8"/> so there are <pause dur="0.3"/> thirty-two plots <pause dur="0.8"/> thirty-two main plots <pause dur="0.3"/> 
which is my <pause dur="0.2"/> twenty-one plus three plus one plus three <pause dur="0.2"/> plus the three <pause dur="0.2"/> plus the extra one <pause dur="0.3"/> so here we are at the main plot section <pause dur="1.7"/> so when you want to evaluate if this was a good experiment <pause dur="0.5"/> from the point of view <pause dur="0.3"/> of the main plots <pause dur="0.6"/> you can start having a look just up here was it a good experiment to study irrigation and fertility and the interaction <pause dur="1.7"/> 
and then when you come along to the subplot section <pause dur="1.2"/> you come along here <pause dur="0.4"/> and you have all the degrees of freedom <pause dur="0.5"/> down here <pause dur="0.2"/> ninety-five is the total because that's ninety-six minus one there's your <pause dur="0.3"/> n-minus-one <pause dur="2.1"/><vocal desc="cough" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.6"/> i haven't given this but you'll try this in the practical <pause dur="0.3"/> Genstat also provides a sample ANOVA with random data to show you how the results will look <pause dur="0.4"/> and i find that quite useful in teaching and we're asking you to get this in the in the practical to have a look at that <pause dur="3.1"/> and the sort of question you can now answer is <pause dur="0.4"/> how would the degrees of freedom change if you moved fertilizer to the subplots <pause dur="0.9"/> if instead of having <pause dur="0.2"/> two main plot factors and one subplot factor <pause dur="0.3"/> you said well fertilizer could go on the little plots i wonder <trunc>w</trunc> how that would look <pause dur="1.1"/> and you have now two ways of doing that <pause dur="0.3"/> you can do that from first principles yourself <pause dur="1.2"/> or <pause dur="0.2"/> you could run the randomization again <pause dur="0.3"/> and move one of the factors from the main plot 
level to the subplot level <pause dur="4.2"/> i hope you can see from here if we move <pause dur="0.2"/> fertilizer from here <pause dur="0.4"/> down to here <pause dur="1.3"/> then this would come down here <pause dur="1.0"/> and also this would come down here <pause dur="1.1"/> so we would now be doing an experiment <pause dur="0.5"/> with <pause dur="0.7"/> three <pause dur="0.2"/> degrees of freedom there <pause dur="0.6"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> just three values here <pause dur="0.5"/> because this stays <pause dur="0.8"/> and so this now <pause dur="0.9"/> the <trunc>intera</trunc> the residual <pause dur="0.2"/> would have nine <pause dur="0.2"/> degrees of freedom <pause dur="0.3"/> we've got ourselves rather a small experiment at the main plot level <pause dur="0.3"/> that's not such a good idea <pause dur="1.4"/> so it's those sorts of things you can now do <pause dur="0.2"/> either by studying this <pause dur="0.3"/> or <pause dur="0.2"/> by running through the design again <pause dur="0.9"/> and that's what we've asked you to do in the practical <pause dur="5.2"/> any more comments or <pause dur="0.4"/> questions <pause dur="1.4"/> on this design part i'm now moving <pause dur="0.3"/> to data management </u><pause dur="1.0"/> <u who="sf0660" trans="pause"> # i'd like to ask something on the number of plots <pause dur="0.3"/> that you have for your <pause dur="0.8"/> # main <pause dur="0.4"/> blocking practice the main treatment practice </u><pause dur="0.3"/> <u who="nm0658" trans="pause"> yep </u><u who="sf0660" trans="latching"> # <pause dur="1.6"/> from <pause dur="2.0"/> <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> <pause dur="0.6"/> where he's given us the three factors </u><pause dur="0.4"/> <u who="nm0658" trans="pause"> yes </u><u who="sf0660" trans="overlap"> # <pause dur="1.6"/> i don't know <pause dur="0.3"/> if you've got irrigation as four levels fertility two levels <pause dur="0.3"/> how do you then <pause dur="0.4"/> get <pause dur="0.7"/> can you not say that you had nine <pause dur="1.0"/> plots for your <pause dur="1.2"/> two </u><pause dur="2.0"/> <u who="nm0658" trans="pause"> with the design as randomized <pause dur="0.8"/> that's what you've got </u><pause dur="4.8"/> <u who="sf0660" trans="pause"> so for your main plot from that did you say you've got how many plots </u><pause dur="0.6"/> <u who="nm0658" trans="pause"> for my main plot i said i've got <pause dur="0.3"/> thirty-two <pause dur="0.6"/> main plots <pause dur="0.8"/> which is the ninety-six that i had <pause dur="0.7"/> divided by three </u><pause dur="2.7"/> <u who="sf0660" trans="pause"> but if you didn't go through that ANOVA table <pause dur="0.4"/> # is there any way of working that out just from what you get at the very beginning # <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 word"/> structure </u><pause dur="0.4"/> <u who="nm0658" trans="pause"> yes <pause dur="1.6"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> if i didn't have that at the beginning <pause dur="0.5"/> i would say <pause dur="0.4"/> that

lots of levels <pause dur="0.2"/> causes complication <pause dur="0.7"/> if you can have your experiment at a single level <pause dur="0.7"/> life is simpler <pause dur="0.7"/> all your tables are compared at the same level all your plots are the same size <pause dur="0.5"/> and the analysis the design is simpler <pause dur="0.2"/> and i think the analysis is simpler <pause dur="0.7"/> so the split plot analysis has lots of different levels <pause dur="0.3"/> and you will find when you look at the standard errors <pause dur="0.6"/> that that indicates that the analysis becomes very messy and complicated <pause dur="0.9"/> so i would prefer <pause dur="0.2"/> not to have <pause dur="0.2"/> split plot experiments <pause dur="2.6"/> the only reason i would have a split plot experiment is if <pause dur="0.2"/> some factors need <pause dur="0.2"/> large size plots <pause dur="0.2"/> like irrigation <pause dur="0.6"/> and other factors don't <pause dur="1.3"/> and then <pause dur="0.2"/> if the <trunc>l</trunc> if irrigation needs large size plots and we want to have irrigation and variety <pause dur="0.6"/> if we want to have no <pause dur="0.3"/> different levels <pause dur="0.2"/> then all plots have to be very very large <pause dur="0.9"/> whereas because variety only needs small plots <pause dur="0.2"/> we can choose to split the large plots that we need <pause dur="0.3"/> for irrigation <pause dur="0.2"/> into subdivision <pause dur="0.2"/> that seems a good reason <pause dur="1.0"/> i find 
there is no other good reason <pause dur="0.3"/> for having split plot <pause dur="0.4"/> designs <pause dur="1.6"/> we will see later today <pause dur="0.3"/> that <pause dur="0.2"/> the whole nightmare of repeated measures analysis <pause dur="1.4"/> is a similar argument that the repeated measures <pause dur="0.8"/> are <pause dur="0.2"/> repeated within the plot <pause dur="0.5"/> they're like a sort of split plot <pause dur="0.6"/> where time <pause dur="0.3"/> is each measurement <pause dur="0.5"/> and you will find <pause dur="0.2"/> as soon as you have lots of different levels in your data <pause dur="0.6"/> your analysis is getting messier <pause dur="1.0"/> so i'm not very comfortable <pause dur="0.2"/> with the idea <pause dur="0.2"/> that if you increase the number of factors <pause dur="0.5"/> you also increase <pause dur="0.6"/> the layout problems <pause dur="0.3"/> remember <pause dur="0.3"/> at the very beginning <pause dur="0.6"/> we've said that <pause dur="2.0"/> when you look at design <pause dur="7.0"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> please think of your treatment structure <pause dur="0.3"/> we said we want three factors <pause dur="0.2"/> because that ties in with our objectives <pause dur="0.9"/> and then please think of your layout <pause dur="1.2"/> now what the people who do split-split plot all the time are doing <pause dur="0.4"/> is they are thinking of these two together <pause dur="1.2"/>

definition further apart on average <pause dur="1.0"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> so when you compare a randomized block <pause dur="0.3"/> with a split plot <pause dur="0.6"/> in the split plot <pause dur="0.7"/> according to the textbooks <pause dur="0.6"/> you get more information on the subplot factors <pause dur="0.7"/> and less information on the main plot factors <pause dur="1.8"/> the problem i have is that <pause dur="0.7"/> you get much less <pause dur="0.3"/> on the main plot compared with a very little gain <pause dur="0.4"/> on the subplot <pause dur="0.5"/> and also <pause dur="0.2"/> that does not account for the fact you also <pause dur="0.3"/> add in <pause dur="0.3"/> unnecessary complication in interpreting the results <pause dur="0.8"/> which means that <pause dur="0.3"/> i don't like that as a reason <pause dur="0.6"/> for doing a split plot experiment <pause dur="0.2"/> the only reason i like <pause dur="0.4"/> is the fact that you have to for practical purposes <pause dur="0.4"/> and there are many of those <pause dur="5.7"/> okay <pause dur="0.3"/> the next subject <pause dur="2.8"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> then we'll have a break <pause dur="0.3"/> and we'll discuss repeated measures after the break <pause dur="2.9"/> now <pause dur="1.4"/> what i hope to show you <pause dur="0.5"/> is <pause dur="0.8"/> that <pause dur="0.2"/> the ideas of data management <pause dur="0.6"/> which we <pause dur="0.3"/> distributed in session three which was <pause dur="0.6"/> very early last term <pause dur="0.7"/> that was data management <pause dur="0.2"/> for any sort of data <pause dur="1.3"/> when we translate those ideas into experimental data <pause dur="0.4"/> 
experimental data are quite simple <pause dur="0.3"/> usually <pause dur="0.3"/> and so you shouldn't have any problem <pause dur="0.5"/> if <pause dur="0.2"/> you manage the data sensibly and if you keep the principles <pause dur="0.6"/> so we're going to review the standard ways of entering experimental data <pause dur="0.3"/> which i think follow automatically if you've understood the ideas of design <pause dur="2.1"/> and <pause dur="0.3"/> what we're also going to show you <pause dur="0.3"/> is what happens <pause dur="0.4"/> if your data have been entered differently <pause dur="0.5"/> and this is where we're hitting a new problem now <pause dur="0.2"/> because of all these people as i've said before <pause dur="0.3"/> who are maniacs for Excel <pause dur="0.5"/> and that means you can enter data in all sorts of crazy ways doesn't it <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="1.0"/> and and then you can have problems reorganizing your data <pause dur="0.3"/> so you can do the sensible analysis <pause dur="0.6"/> and i have to tell you that as statisticians now <pause dur="0.4"/> this is serious <pause dur="0.6"/> because <pause dur="0.5"/> in the olden days we found that we spent all our time helping people on the analysis <pause dur="1.0"/> now <pause dur="0.7"/> most of your time seems to be spent <pause dur="0.3"/> on rescuing your data from poor data management <pause dur="0.3"/> the analyses are very quick <pause dur="0.5"/> you just click on the 
ANOVA button <pause dur="0.2"/> in Genstat <pause dur="0.5"/> so the analysis step <pause dur="0.2"/> is very very quick <pause dur="0.3"/> and you've done it many times this term <pause dur="0.7"/> the step which isn't quick <pause dur="1.5"/> is reorganizing your data <pause dur="0.3"/> because they were entered in a funny way <pause dur="1.5"/> so there are two ways to avoid this <pause dur="0.3"/> and i want to <pause dur="0.2"/> indicate both of them <pause dur="0.3"/> the first is please enter your data sensibly <pause dur="0.2"/> and then you won't have this problem <pause dur="1.3"/> and the second <pause dur="0.2"/> is if you haven't entered your data sensibly <pause dur="1.0"/> please don't re-enter <pause dur="0.7"/> please use the computer <pause dur="0.2"/> to reorganize your data <pause dur="0.5"/> but accept <pause dur="0.3"/> that <pause dur="0.2"/> don't get annoyed at either Excel or at Genstat or Minitab <pause dur="0.2"/> because that's taking the time <pause dur="0.3"/> i'm afraid it is the data manipulation <pause dur="0.2"/> that does take the time <pause dur="0.4"/> so <pause dur="0.6"/> allow a little bit of time for that <pause dur="2.0"/> so we're going to show you both <pause dur="0.6"/> and <pause dur="0.7"/> you either need to reorganize the data because you've entered it in an odd way <pause dur="0.9"/> or <pause dur="0.2"/> because alternative analyses <pause dur="0.4"/> require different layouts <pause dur="0.2"/> so <pause dur="0.2"/> sometimes <pause dur="0.2"/> when the data aren't so simple <pause dur="0.4"/> you might have three different analyses <pause dur="0.2"/> and for one analysis it was good to 
enter the data across <pause dur="0.3"/> and for another analysis <pause dur="0.3"/> it was good to enter the data down <pause dur="2.5"/> so you need to become a little adept <pause dur="0.2"/> at data manipulation <pause dur="0.7"/> or you're going to waste a lot of time <pause dur="1.3"/> and a lot i do mean it <pause dur="4.3"/> perhaps i'll <pause dur="0.5"/> # tell you one <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> not horror story but close <pause dur="1.9"/> the subject of data management <pause dur="0.6"/> is not well reported in the textbooks <pause dur="0.9"/> when i arrived back a couple of years ago <pause dur="1.7"/> one of the first advisees i saw <pause dur="0.8"/> was somebody <pause dur="0.2"/> who was just finishing his PhD at Reading <pause dur="1.5"/> and he had been on this course <pause dur="0.9"/> but we hadn't been discussing much about data management in the olden days <pause dur="0.8"/> and he'd followed a little bit of the notes on how to organize the data <pause dur="1.3"/> and it was discussions with him <pause dur="0.4"/> that clarified to me that we must include <pause dur="0.6"/> data manipulation data management in this course <pause dur="0.3"/> which is why we've changed this course to include this <pause dur="1.1"/> he had an experiment which was done here <pause dur="0.8"/> and he'd done his experiment <pause dur="0.3"/> at <pause dur="0.3"/> two different places for each of the three years of his PhD <pause dur="2.6"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> each experiment 
he had measured ten different things <pause dur="1.8"/> so he'd had ten measurements <pause dur="0.8"/> it's all very simple <pause dur="0.3"/> these were very simple experiments <pause dur="1.3"/> he had forty-eight plots in each experiment <pause dur="1.5"/> he had now looked in a textbook <pause dur="0.9"/> and he looked at his notes <pause dur="0.3"/> to see how to enter the data <pause dur="1.6"/> and he had entered the data quite nicely organized <pause dur="0.5"/> with three columns <pause dur="1.3"/> the first column <pause dur="0.3"/> was the yield <pause dur="0.2"/> or the measurement <pause dur="0.9"/> the second column <pause dur="0.3"/> was the block <pause dur="0.5"/> and the third column was the treatment <pause dur="0.4"/> there were twelve treatments <pause dur="0.3"/> and there were four <pause dur="0.5"/> blocks <pause dur="0.6"/> so he had <pause dur="0.2"/> measurement <pause dur="0.2"/> block <pause dur="0.4"/> treatment <pause dur="1.8"/> because he'd looked in a textbook <pause dur="0.6"/> and textbooks <pause dur="0.4"/> only seem to deal with experiments when you have a single measurement <pause dur="1.6"/> which is unlike the real world <pause dur="0.4"/> where you always have lots of measurements <pause dur="1.4"/> he decided to enter his ten measurements <pause dur="0.4"/> in ten different files <pause dur="2.0"/> so he now had <pause dur="0.2"/> ten little files <pause dur="0.2"/> each one with three columns <pause dur="1.0"/> the block and the treatment columns were the same <pause dur="0.3"/> and the measurement was different <pause dur="2.2"/> and then he had six experiments <pause dur="1.9"/> 
so he now had sixty files <pause dur="1.9"/> each one <pause dur="0.2"/> with three columns in <pause dur="1.1"/> and each one followed precisely the method of analysis he'd been taught in his course <pause dur="0.7"/> and he'd finished his analysis <pause dur="0.6"/> and he was three weeks away from submitting his PhD <pause dur="2.3"/> and his supervisor <pause dur="0.6"/> looked at his information and said <pause dur="0.8"/> there are two interesting things i would like you to do in addition <pause dur="1.6"/> the first is <pause dur="0.2"/> that i've noticed that you have measured <pause dur="0.7"/> the yield <pause dur="0.5"/> in two different ways <pause dur="0.2"/> i'd like you to do what's called an analysis of covariance where you adjust one measurement for the values of another measurement <pause dur="1.7"/> could you please do a <trunc>bi</trunc> a simple analysis of covariance <pause dur="0.6"/> for each of your six experiments <pause dur="0.5"/> and he gave him a very simple thing <pause dur="0.2"/> and showed him it was in the textbook <pause dur="2.4"/> the second question <pause dur="1.0"/> was even more perplexing to him he said could you do a simple combined analysis where you combine the information for the six experiments together <pause dur="0.2"/> to see how <pause dur="0.7"/> the <pause dur="0.2"/> results you have reinforce each other <pause dur="2.0"/> and so he came to 
statistics <pause dur="0.4"/> to do this <pause dur="0.7"/> he knew no <pause dur="0.4"/> computing he only knew how to turn <pause dur="0.4"/> the computing handle <pause dur="0.7"/> so he was now being asked <pause dur="0.8"/> a simple question of data management <pause dur="0.4"/> well it would have been simple <pause dur="0.3"/> if his data had been organized sensibly <pause dur="0.6"/> but can you see that <pause dur="0.2"/> this idea of covariance <pause dur="0.9"/> which <pause dur="0.2"/> would have been trivial with Genstat <pause dur="0.2"/> normally <pause dur="1.0"/> meant that he had two data files <pause dur="0.2"/> which he had to merge together because the two columns were in different files <pause dur="1.6"/> nobody'd taught him about merging files <pause dur="2.8"/> and <pause dur="0.6"/> the combining of the experiments the six experiment <pause dur="0.2"/> meant not just that you merged the files <pause dur="0.4"/> but you then had to put them end to end <pause dur="1.0"/> because he had forty-eight but now he wanted forty-eight times six <pause dur="0.5"/> with another column which said which experiment it was <pause dur="1.7"/> so when he came with three weeks to go <pause dur="1.4"/> we explained <pause dur="0.3"/> these ideas to him <pause dur="1.0"/> but because he had no concept of data management <pause dur="0.3"/> or of <pause dur="0.3"/> computer ideas such as merging files <pause dur="0.7"/> he never succeeded <pause dur="0.2"/> the only way it could possibly have happened <pause dur="0.7"/> is if somebody else had taken 
his data and done it all for him <pause dur="0.9"/> that's not his PhD <pause dur="0.8"/> or if he'd learned a little about data manipulation <pause dur="0.5"/> and these were very very simple tasks <pause dur="1.1"/> i have to say these are much easier tasks <pause dur="0.4"/> now you've got Windows <pause dur="0.3"/> than they were <pause dur="0.2"/> when you had to merge files using DOS commands <pause dur="1.4"/> 
but <pause dur="0.2"/> nevertheless <pause dur="0.7"/> this was not possible for him to do <pause dur="1.5"/> and <pause dur="0.3"/> that's data manipulation <pause dur="0.4"/> taken to its illogical extreme <pause dur="1.2"/> but i have to say <pause dur="0.3"/> that the way he was encouraged to enter the data first <pause dur="1.2"/> was exactly what was recommended <pause dur="0.5"/> in a very popular textbook <pause dur="1.0"/> which we use on our courses <pause dur="0.5"/> says <pause dur="0.2"/> when you're entering your data into the computer this is the sort of layout <pause dur="1.2"/> and it encouraged the layout <pause dur="0.3"/> which caused his disaster <pause dur="0.3"/> because it didn't say of course in practical experiments <pause dur="0.2"/> you will have more than one measurement <pause dur="0.3"/> and just put them end to end <pause dur="0.4"/> don't make them in a different file <pause dur="6.5"/> so let me just remind you <pause dur="1.9"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> this was the yield data <pause dur="0.8"/> that we discussed in session three <pause dur="1.8"/> you have nothing new you need to learn if you understood session three <pause dur="0.3"/> notice <pause dur="0.2"/> that the way that we have laid this out <pause dur="0.2"/> with the block numbers <pause dur="1.3"/> is exactly the same <pause dur="0.4"/> as the way Genstat has just randomized your experiment at the beginning <pause dur="0.7"/> so here <pause dur="0.5"/> are the blocks <pause dur="0.2"/> the repetitions <pause dur="0.2"/> and the treatments <pause dur="0.7"/> and here are the 
measurements <pause dur="0.3"/> that you just type in when you get them <pause dur="1.3"/> so as long as you don't mess things up <pause dur="0.8"/> from where you started <pause dur="0.8"/> the rules are very simple <pause dur="0.5"/> how many plots do you have <pause dur="1.2"/> each plot <pause dur="0.6"/> becomes a row <pause dur="1.2"/> each column <pause dur="0.3"/> is a measurement <pause dur="1.7"/> i can't think of anything <pause dur="0.4"/> that's more simple <pause dur="2.8"/> and that's what you have to do <pause dur="4.0"/> you will find <pause dur="0.3"/> that there's one complication which we do discuss in session three <pause dur="0.6"/> which is <pause dur="0.2"/> what happens if some of the measurements <pause dur="0.4"/> are made at the plant level or the plot level <pause dur="0.4"/> here sorry the plot level <pause dur="0.2"/> and other measurements are made at the plant level <pause dur="1.9"/> so for example <pause dur="0.2"/> it's very popular to measure the yield by harvesting at the plot level <pause dur="0.4"/> but you might measure the height of twenty plants in each plot <pause dur="0.6"/> i wonder how you would enter that <pause dur="0.3"/> to which the answer is <pause dur="0.2"/> either in Excel or in Genstat <pause dur="0.3"/> you have one sheet <pause dur="1.0"/> for your plot level <pause dur="0.3"/> and you have another sheet for your plant level <pause dur="0.4"/> and we've covered that <pause dur="0.5"/> both in <pause dur="0.4"/> the discussion in section three and in the practical that you did <pause dur="1.3"/> so as long 
as you're happy with those <pause dur="0.5"/> you don't have a data management problem <pause dur="0.9"/> you should enter your data in this way <pause dur="2.9"/> i can leap ahead a little bit <pause dur="0.4"/> to <pause dur="0.4"/> these repeated measures ideas <pause dur="0.3"/> supposing that <pause dur="0.3"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> here's an example <pause dur="0.2"/> i'm sorry it's a bit in French <pause dur="0.3"/> but this is the weight <pause dur="0.2"/> of small potatoes middling potatoes et cetera <pause dur="1.4"/> we're going later on to consider repeated measures <pause dur="0.6"/> which is <pause dur="0.2"/> measuring things <pause dur="0.3"/> after <pause dur="0.2"/> twenty days twenty-five days thirty days and things like that <pause dur="0.3"/> how should you enter those data <pause dur="0.2"/> answer <pause dur="0.2"/> they are just measurements <pause dur="0.2"/> so enter them across <pause dur="0.8"/> just as though <pause dur="0.6"/> you were entering different measurements <pause dur="0.2"/> so just because you made the measurements which differ in time <pause dur="0.3"/> don't get more complicated <pause dur="0.2"/> just treat them as a measurement <pause dur="0.6"/> and so <pause dur="0.2"/> if you have <pause dur="0.2"/> six repeated measurements <pause dur="0.6"/> just <pause dur="0.6"/> they're six measurements <pause dur="1.0"/> enter them across <pause dur="0.2"/> they haven't changed the number of plots in your experiment <pause dur="0.4"/> so <pause dur="0.2"/> they go across <pause dur="5.8"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> this <pause dur="1.6"/> is how not <pause dur="0.2"/> to enter experimental data <pause dur="1.9"/> this is the same data <pause dur="4.6"/> here we have <pause dur="0.9"/> the 
treatment information <pause dur="1.1"/> and here we've entered the data <pause dur="0.2"/> for replicate one replicate two replicate three for one measurement <pause dur="4.2"/> that is very popular <pause dur="2.3"/> isn't it <pause dur="0.8"/><vocal desc="laugh" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.3"/> i i'm sorry i'm i'm looking at you because <pause dur="0.4"/> <trunc>i</trunc> <trunc>i</trunc> you know it's not you that's made this as a <pause dur="0.3"/> this is encouraged in many departments <pause dur="0.8"/> and it seems very obvious <pause dur="0.9"/> and it works quite well for simple problems <pause dur="0.2"/> also <pause dur="0.5"/> notice that if you were doing the analysis by hand <pause dur="1.6"/> in the olden days <pause dur="0.7"/> this is exactly what you would do <pause dur="0.4"/> because you could work out the mean of these <pause dur="1.3"/> and you could get <pause dur="0.3"/> the mean for that treatment <pause dur="0.9"/> so you could get all the treatment means down here <pause dur="0.3"/> and all the block means across here <pause dur="2.3"/> so if you are in the habit <pause dur="0.9"/> of confusing entry with analysis <pause dur="0.5"/> this is wonderful <pause dur="0.4"/> you can use Excel <pause dur="0.5"/> to work out calculated columns <pause dur="0.2"/> and it all seems to work quite well <pause dur="0.2"/> until you try and do a full analysis and then it all falls apart <pause dur="1.2"/> do not confuse analysis <pause dur="0.4"/> with entry <pause dur="1.3"/> if later on you want to analyse your data <pause dur="0.8"/> either with Genstat or Excel <pause dur="0.5"/> you can 
enter the data in the proper way <pause dur="2.5"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> that's like this <pause dur="2.8"/> if you would now like <pause dur="0.7"/> to look at the data <pause dur="0.3"/> like this <pause dur="1.6"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> i've said <pause dur="0.3"/> this is how not to enter experimental data <pause dur="0.5"/> if you want to look at the data like this that's terrific <pause dur="0.2"/> it's called tabulation <pause dur="0.8"/> you enter the data <pause dur="0.2"/> in long columns <pause dur="0.2"/> and then you say <pause dur="0.2"/> please tabulate the columns <pause dur="0.2"/> and across the top i want one factor <pause dur="0.2"/> and down here i want the other factor <pause dur="0.5"/> and then i'll put some summaries i don't have a problem looking at the data like that <pause dur="0.2"/> i have a problem entering the data <pause dur="0.3"/> it's confusing entry <pause dur="0.2"/> with analysis <pause dur="1.1"/> in Genstat <pause dur="0.2"/> that's called tabulation <pause dur="0.9"/> in Excel it's called pivot tables <pause dur="0.2"/> i don't care <trunc>h</trunc> whether you do it in Excel <pause dur="0.3"/> or whether you do it in Genstat <pause dur="0.6"/> so enter your data in Excel <pause dur="0.3"/> the <pause dur="0.2"/> proper way <pause dur="0.3"/> enter your data in Genstat the proper way <pause dur="0.2"/> if you want to look at the data like this <pause dur="1.3"/> tabulate the data present the data very nice you can see what's going on <pause dur="0.8"/> you can see what a nightmare this is for your data entry <pause dur="0.9"/> by looking <pause dur="0.4"/> and explaining to 
somebody <pause dur="0.2"/> how you would enter <pause dur="0.2"/> these data <pause dur="0.3"/> in that format <pause dur="0.7"/> because that only works if you've got one measurement <pause dur="0.4"/> but in the real world we have <pause dur="0.2"/> here we have one two three four five six measurements <pause dur="0.3"/> are you going to enter them on six different sheets <pause dur="0.3"/> it's all getting messy <pause dur="2.1"/> this <pause dur="0.4"/> is very simple <pause dur="1.6"/> and if ever you want to transform your data <pause dur="0.2"/> and get <pause dur="0.3"/> the total <pause dur="0.3"/> it just becomes another column <pause dur="0.5"/> down here </u><pause dur="3.6"/> <u who="sf0668" trans="pause"> why doesn't he have repeated measurements of so many different factors <pause dur="0.3"/> <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> </u><pause dur="0.4"/> <u who="nm0658" trans="pause"> if you've got <trunc>repea</trunc> lots of repeated measurements they still keep going across </u><pause dur="1.3"/> <u who="sf0668" trans="pause"> <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> </u><pause dur="0.9"/> <u who="nm0658" trans="pause"> and you might have sets of repeated measurements you might measure <pause dur="0.2"/> lots of things after twenty days another set of things after thirty another set of things after forty <pause dur="0.2"/> they can go across <pause dur="1.1"/> so <pause dur="0.3"/> you can go way across <pause dur="0.3"/> here <pause dur="0.6"/> # </u><pause dur="0.8"/> <u who="sm0669" trans="pause"> what if <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> experiment where you take in data <pause dur="0.3"/> from <trunc>de</trunc> for instance you do maize and <pause dur="0.2"/> pea or whatever it is <pause dur="0.6"/> and then you have all similar columns like this will it make safe <pause dur="0.2"/> to try to box them together or have separate <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> because <pause dur="0.3"/> <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> on them really <pause dur="0.3"/> i mean they're independent <gap reason="inaudible" extent="2 secs"/> </u><pause dur="0.2"/> <u who="nm0658" trans="pause"> okay </u><u who="sm0669" trans="overlap"> <gap reason="inaudible" extent="2 secs"/> <pause dur="0.7"/> sort of shoot up into <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> <pause dur="0.4"/> for say <pause dur="0.3"/> maize height <pause dur="0.4"/> <gap reason="inaudible" extent="3 secs"/> </u><u who="nm0658" trans="overlap"> okay </u><u who="sm0669" trans="overlap"> <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> </u><u who="nm0658" trans="latching"> right <trunc>th</trunc> we'll that can be the last <pause dur="0.2"/> question before we have a quick break <pause dur="0.5"/> 'cause you have such a nice new coffee place downstairs <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> <trunc>th</trunc> <pause dur="0.3"/> # the question i hope it's understood to everybody <pause dur="0.2"/> there are some experiments <pause dur="0.2"/> which are called mixed cropping experiments

another file <pause dur="1.0"/> or maybe i'll enter <pause dur="0.3"/> the maize sole data in one file and the bean sole data in another and the mixed data in a third <pause dur="1.0"/> and then they get very confused <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> so to avoid all that confusion <pause dur="1.2"/> keep my simple message <pause dur="0.7"/> don't confuse <pause dur="0.4"/> the entry with the analysis <pause dur="0.3"/> the reason people choose the different files <pause dur="0.2"/> is to simplify the analysis <pause dur="0.6"/> simplify the analysis afterwards <pause dur="0.6"/> but for the entry <pause dur="0.2"/> the entry is simple <pause dur="0.3"/> if you say <pause dur="0.2"/> how many plots did i have <pause dur="0.8"/> and i will enter observations <pause dur="0.2"/> and if there are some observations i don't have <pause dur="0.2"/> they're like missing values <pause dur="0.8"/> the reason is different <pause dur="0.4"/> but you just leave it blank <pause dur="0.5"/> or you put a missing value code in <pause dur="1.7"/> let's have a nice simple life <pause dur="0.2"/> and then you will find <pause dur="0.2"/> that the analysis is also simple <pause dur="0.8"/> after the break <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> we'll look at <pause dur="0.2"/> how to manipulate the data <pause dur="0.2"/> and then <pause dur="0.2"/> quickly on to repeated measures <pause dur="0.3"/> okay we'll have a break </u><gap reason="break in recording" extent="uncertain"/> <u who="nm0658" trans="pause"> 
i'm realizing as usual that luckily <pause dur="0.4"/> you have the slides for everything <pause dur="0.3"/> because i don't think i'm going to finish yet again and i do want to discuss repeated measures <pause dur="0.5"/> so i may have to leave out a little bit of <pause dur="0.2"/> one of the topics on data management <pause dur="2.8"/> i just want quickly to review the ideas <pause dur="0.6"/> to compare these two formats you've seen <pause dur="1.2"/> our recommended way of data entry this is all revision now <pause dur="0.2"/> has one row for each plot <pause dur="0.2"/> or unit <pause dur="1.0"/> and that's the lowest possible level <pause dur="0.3"/> if it's a subplot it's one row for each subplot <pause dur="0.5"/> so <pause dur="0.2"/> in the example <pause dur="0.2"/> in lecture three there are twenty-seven rows <pause dur="0.3"/> because there were three reps by nine treatments there were twenty-seven plots <pause dur="0.6"/> in the randomized one just now there were ninety-six rows because there were ninety-six plots <pause dur="1.0"/> therefore there's one column for each measurement <pause dur="1.8"/> the other way <pause dur="0.2"/> looks like a textbook example for a hand analysis <pause dur="2.0"/> also unfortunately <pause dur="1.0"/> and they've been written too

Genstat is the most appropriate <pause dur="0.3"/> but the important thing is that you use <pause dur="0.2"/> one that is appropriate <pause dur="0.5"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> you've fallen off the end <pause dur="0.3"/> of a very general purpose tool <pause dur="0.2"/> which is a spreadsheet <pause dur="1.8"/><vocal desc="cough" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.7"/> so <pause dur="3.6"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> as i've said before this lecture <pause dur="1.0"/> try to use the standard format for your entry it will save time on the analysis later <pause dur="0.9"/> but if somebody has entered the data differently <pause dur="0.3"/> it's usually quicker to reorganize the data <pause dur="0.2"/> than to have to retype <pause dur="1.3"/> so <pause dur="0.2"/> don't say oh gosh you've made a big mistake <pause dur="0.2"/> you'd better start again <pause dur="1.2"/> use the computer to help reorganize the data <pause dur="0.6"/> use either a statistics package or a spreadsheet <pause dur="2.1"/> i find <pause dur="0.5"/> that Genstat <pause dur="0.6"/> the competition between Genstat and Excel <pause dur="0.3"/> for reorganizing the data <pause dur="0.4"/> for you <pause dur="0.3"/> would be quite a good one <pause dur="0.8"/> because <pause dur="0.2"/> i think for reorganizing <pause dur="0.3"/> if you knew neither package it would be quicker <pause dur="0.2"/> to learn and use Genstat <pause dur="0.8"/> because it's built to do that sort of reorganizing <pause dur="0.8"/> than to use Excel <pause dur="1.0"/> but <pause dur="0.2"/> life is not equal <pause dur="0.2"/> most of you know Excel very well and you hardly know Genstat <pause dur="0.4"/> so some of you will 
prefer <pause dur="0.3"/> to reorganize your data in Excel <pause dur="0.4"/> and other people would prefer <pause dur="0.4"/> to learn a bit more of Genstat to do the reorganizing <pause dur="0.3"/> you should choose the method that's most appropriate for you <pause dur="0.4"/> and that will depend <pause dur="0.2"/> on your work in the future <pause dur="0.4"/> but if you're thinking of using Genstat seriously <pause dur="0.3"/> in the future <pause dur="0.3"/> then <pause dur="0.4"/> try and learn a bit about its methods <pause dur="0.2"/> for data manipulation and i'll show you <pause dur="0.3"/> a little bit about what that means <pause dur="2.7"/> first you have to understand what you're trying to do <pause dur="2.2"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> here is an example <pause dur="0.4"/> where i've taken the one from before <pause dur="0.3"/> where i assume we've entered the data in the wrong way <pause dur="2.0"/> and we want to go <pause dur="0.2"/> from this way <pause dur="0.2"/> to <pause dur="0.2"/> this way <pause dur="0.7"/> that's the way we would have had if we'd entered it correctly <pause dur="1.0"/> with <pause dur="0.2"/> the replicates and the treatments and the dry matter <pause dur="1.0"/> so you ought to see <pause dur="0.2"/> what it is <pause dur="0.2"/> we are trying to do <pause dur="0.3"/> we want to go <pause dur="0.2"/> i've said from this wide format <pause dur="1.3"/> to the long <pause dur="0.2"/> format <pause dur="2.6"/> we are trying <pause dur="1.0"/> to take these and i think you can see i hope you can see <pause dur="0.3"/> we're trying to stack these <pause dur="0.2"/> one below another <pause dur="1.3"/> 
so what goes across <pause dur="0.3"/> becomes stacked <pause dur="2.3"/> it's not # only that <pause dur="1.5"/> you could picture that's very easy in Excel <pause dur="0.8"/> but we want to do a little more than that <pause dur="0.5"/> because we want to take this <pause dur="0.2"/> which are already in the right form <pause dur="0.9"/> and we want to repeat that <pause dur="1.5"/> so <pause dur="0.2"/> this one on the left hand side <pause dur="0.4"/> gets repeated <pause dur="0.2"/> three times <pause dur="1.4"/> once <pause dur="0.2"/> for each column <pause dur="1.8"/> so it stays opposite <pause dur="1.5"/> not just this measurement but this measurement <pause dur="1.1"/> and <pause dur="0.3"/> these reps one two and three <pause dur="1.0"/><kinesic desc="indicates point on board" iterated="n"/> we want to have a new column called rep <pause dur="0.3"/> which goes one <pause dur="0.2"/> two <pause dur="0.2"/> three <pause dur="3.1"/> so <pause dur="0.5"/> it's not just stacking <pause dur="2.2"/> it's a bit more <pause dur="0.7"/> what do we mean in practice usually <pause dur="0.3"/> you want to stack <pause dur="0.2"/> the measurements <pause dur="1.3"/> and you want to carry <pause dur="0.2"/> the factors <pause dur="1.8"/> let's have a look at how that works in Genstat <pause dur="2.5"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> Genstat <pause dur="0.8"/> has a dialogue <pause dur="0.3"/> called stack <pause dur="3.8"/> you just have to go <pause dur="0.4"/> you should be getting to the stage with Genstat that you become curious and you think well there must be there somewhere <pause dur="0.4"/> and you go to spread <pause dur="0.5"/> manipulate <pause dur="0.4"/> and you will find stack <pause dur="1.3"/> within stack <pause dur="1.6"/> it will say how many columns <pause dur="0.3"/> do you want to 
stack together <pause dur="1.3"/> well it should be quite easy for you to say i want three columns because i have rep one rep two rep three i want those <pause dur="0.3"/> stacked <pause dur="0.5"/> one below the other <pause dur="1.4"/> i want to record the column source i want to record where they came from <pause dur="0.3"/> in a column called rep <pause dur="0.3"/> that's a new column <pause dur="1.9"/> and then you put <pause dur="0.2"/> your observations <pause dur="0.5"/> which were called rep one rep two rep three which were actually the yields <pause dur="0.6"/> and you put them there <pause dur="0.2"/> you notice it puts a one <pause dur="0.3"/> beside <pause dur="1.1"/> to say they're all going to be one column <pause dur="1.3"/> you might have had <pause dur="0.2"/> more things as well <pause dur="0.9"/> and then it would have twos beside <pause dur="0.5"/> because that would now be a second column <pause dur="2.3"/> and you have a repeat column <pause dur="0.2"/> which is treat <pause dur="1.6"/> you want treat <pause dur="0.2"/> to be repeated <pause dur="0.2"/> each time that's what we said was needed <pause dur="0.9"/> and when you click on okay <pause dur="3.4"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> then you will find <pause dur="0.7"/> that it will produce <pause dur="1.1"/> exactly <pause dur="0.4"/> that <pause dur="0.2"/> spreadsheet <pause dur="2.6"/> so it will take that <pause dur="0.7"/> and produce that <pause dur="4.5"/> i don't think that's too difficult <pause dur="2.2"/> so that is stacking in <pause dur="0.4"/> Genstat <pause dur="8.4"/> once you've got that far and you realize that's quite easy <pause dur="0.5"/> i <pause dur="2.0"/> just 
occasionally <pause dur="0.3"/> you want to go the other way round <pause dur="4.9"/> not often <pause dur="0.7"/> but sometimes <pause dur="0.2"/> you have it long <pause dur="0.4"/> and you want to go wide <pause dur="1.6"/> and if you ever need that <pause dur="0.7"/> there is you should now not be surprised if there's a stack dialogue <pause dur="0.3"/> there is also an unstack <pause dur="1.1"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> this is like stacking things on a shelf <pause dur="0.6"/> you you can either stack them up <pause dur="0.3"/> or you can take them from there <pause dur="0.2"/> and you move them <pause dur="0.6"/> sideways so that they're now unstacked <pause dur="0.7"/> so that also exists <pause dur="6.4"/> that is one sort of data manipulation <pause dur="2.0"/> the second one <pause dur="0.4"/> i'm going to <pause dur="0.2"/> mention that it exists and then leave it <pause dur="0.5"/> because <pause dur="0.6"/> i think there is no not time for the repeated measures <pause dur="0.4"/> so let me just mention <pause dur="0.3"/> that <pause dur="0.2"/> the next it's in your notes <pause dur="0.9"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> that the next is that you sometimes have data <pause dur="0.3"/> at two levels <pause dur="0.7"/> and you must summarize one level <pause dur="0.3"/> to move it to another level <pause dur="2.0"/> the example that <pause dur="0.2"/> you have in the notes <pause dur="0.3"/> is data that were measured <pause dur="0.7"/> yields were measured on the plot level <pause dur="0.7"/> but tuber number was measured on the plant level <pause dur="0.4"/> and you want to summarize the tuber number 
onto the plot level <pause dur="0.3"/> to analyse with your other data <pause dur="0.7"/> and you'll be doing that in the practical <pause dur="0.3"/> one of the examples does that <pause dur="0.3"/> and that is called <pause dur="0.2"/> data summary <pause dur="0.3"/> before the analysis <pause dur="1.1"/> and that's very common <pause dur="0.3"/> and is usually where measurements are made at a lower level <pause dur="0.4"/> than the one where the treatments were applied <pause dur="1.2"/> so here the varieties were applied at the plot level <pause dur="0.4"/> but you measured something <pause dur="0.2"/> on plants within the same plot <pause dur="2.5"/> and so i just give you the three examples that you've had already <pause dur="0.9"/> in session three <pause dur="0.2"/> there were tuber measurements on twenty plants in each plot <pause dur="2.2"/> in session in the last session <pause dur="0.3"/> you had tree measurements <pause dur="0.8"/> this was what <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> <pause dur="0.4"/> described <pause dur="0.3"/> on four trees in each plot <pause dur="0.4"/> so you have <pause dur="0.2"/> a plot was four trees and you measured <pause dur="0.4"/> the girth <pause dur="0.8"/> and other measurements <pause dur="0.3"/> on each tree <pause dur="0.2"/> within the plot <pause dur="0.6"/> but you want to analyse at the plot level <pause dur="0.5"/> because that's where you applied your treatments <pause dur="1.1"/> and in the Genstat guide <pause dur="1.2"/> the very simple example that you will have seen in the 
first part of the guide <pause dur="0.2"/> had four replicates and three treatments <pause dur="0.9"/> and there were twelve pens <pause dur="0.7"/> but there were two sections to each pen <pause dur="0.5"/> and that's the example in the Genstat guide <pause dur="1.8"/> so <pause dur="0.2"/> there we have <pause dur="0.2"/> twelve <pause dur="0.2"/> plots <pause dur="0.4"/> and two sections in a pen so we have twenty-four sections <pause dur="0.4"/> and we want to summarize from the twenty-four <pause dur="0.2"/> up to the twelve <pause dur="1.9"/> now <pause dur="0.2"/> i've put at the bottom <pause dur="0.2"/> check you recognize these <pause dur="0.3"/> these three as the same problem <pause dur="0.9"/> because in the Genstat guide <pause dur="0.4"/> we show you in detail how to solve this problem <pause dur="1.0"/> you will meet it very often and if you recognize that this is the same problem as this and this and many others <pause dur="0.6"/> then you can use Genstat <pause dur="0.4"/> to do <pause dur="0.2"/> that initial summary <pause dur="2.0"/> and <pause dur="0.3"/> let me just show you the <pause dur="1.1"/> the dialogue <pause dur="0.2"/> that you get with Genstat <pause dur="2.3"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> without giving you <pause dur="2.4"/> there's your data at your low level <pause dur="0.4"/> you want to get the total or the mean <pause dur="0.2"/> at the higher level <pause dur="0.2"/> and you want to carry other things along <pause dur="0.2"/> so your analysis can proceed at the higher level <pause dur="0.4"/> and so again <pause dur="0.4"/> you should find <pause dur="0.3"/> there is a summarize the 
spreadsheet <pause dur="0.3"/> which is another dialogue <pause dur="1.0"/> which will help you <pause dur="0.3"/> when you've got very detailed data at one level <pause dur="0.2"/> and you want to move up <pause dur="0.2"/> to another level <pause dur="4.6"/> so that's in your notes <pause dur="0.4"/> and it'll be in the practical <pause dur="2.6"/> does anybody have any <pause dur="0.3"/> i haven't covered it because <pause dur="0.6"/> i'm a little behind and i would like to tackle the repeated measures <pause dur="1.1"/> does anybody have any comments or questions on that <pause dur="2.2"/> yes </u><pause dur="0.3"/> <u who="sm0675" trans="pause"> case we have # four trees # in each plot <pause dur="0.6"/> <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> we know for example the <unclear>directional reach</unclear> of the trees </u><u who="nm0658" trans="latching"> yes </u><pause dur="0.2"/> <u who="sm0675" trans="pause"> so we wanted to know the production for the block <pause dur="0.2"/> <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> separately then <pause dur="0.5"/> we add all the production of the four <pause dur="0.7"/> trees and then # we'd like to know <pause dur="0.5"/> # for the whole plot <pause dur="0.5"/> <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/></u> <u who="nm0658" trans="overlap"> that's correct that <pause dur="0.2"/> that that's very common <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> you you don't have to and in the notes <pause dur="0.2"/> we describe you can do the analysis at the tree level <pause dur="0.7"/> but you must accept that you applied <pause dur="0.2"/> your treatment at the plot level <pause dur="0.5"/> so the usual thing is to say <pause dur="0.2"/> what was the production for the whole plot <pause dur="0.5"/> and then you must say well do i want the mean production per tree <pause dur="0.3"/> or the total production <pause dur="0.2"/> and that depends on the problem <pause dur="1.9"/> 
on # some experiments i analysed <pause dur="0.4"/> # on disease <pause dur="0.7"/> there were <pause dur="0.7"/> measurements <pause dur="0.3"/> a an <pause dur="0.6"/> an insecticide <pause dur="0.2"/> was applied <pause dur="0.4"/> at the whole plot <pause dur="0.9"/> and then ten plants were measured <pause dur="0.7"/> to see how diseased they were <pause dur="1.4"/> and <pause dur="0.4"/> the idea was now <pause dur="0.2"/> for each plot you wanted a measure of disease <pause dur="1.8"/> in the olden days people always used <pause dur="0.7"/> the mean <pause dur="0.2"/> disease score <pause dur="0.5"/> as a measure of the disease per plot <pause dur="0.8"/> we decided <pause dur="0.5"/> that because we wanted to see the most effective <pause dur="0.4"/> insecticide <pause dur="0.2"/> we should also calculate <pause dur="0.3"/> the maximum disease score <pause dur="0.2"/> namely the disease score of the worst <pause dur="0.3"/> plant in the plot <pause dur="0.3"/> as a summary number <pause dur="0.4"/> to say <pause dur="0.2"/> that characterizes <pause dur="0.6"/> the worst <pause dur="0.2"/> that could <trunc>possib</trunc> if that worst is pretty good it's a good insecticide <pause dur="0.6"/> so <pause dur="0.2"/> it's not always <pause dur="0.2"/> usually you have the total or the mean in the plot <pause dur="0.3"/> but it can be the maximum or the minimum <pause dur="0.4"/> that is also useful <pause dur="0.3"/> so you calculate a summary statistic for the plot <pause dur="0.6"/> which you then analyse at the plot level <pause dur="6.3"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> last subject <pause dur="1.9"/> repeated measures <pause dur="3.3"/> these are very common in designed 
experiments <pause dur="1.1"/> where measurements are repeated on the same unit <pause dur="2.6"/> they can be in time <pause dur="0.4"/> or in space <pause dur="1.9"/> and the problem <pause dur="0.3"/> from a statistical point of view is the same <pause dur="1.2"/> so <pause dur="0.5"/> animals weighed each week <pause dur="0.8"/> would be <pause dur="0.3"/> i'm assuming the animal receives a particular treatment <pause dur="0.7"/> at the beginning of the experiment or has having a diet as you go through the experiment <pause dur="0.3"/> and is weighed each week <pause dur="1.0"/> so rather than just an ordinary yield experiment where you measure just once at the end <pause dur="0.3"/> you record successively in time <pause dur="1.3"/> that is a repeated measure in time <pause dur="1.8"/> most <pause dur="0.2"/> repeated measures are measures in time <pause dur="2.1"/> occasionally here's another example tree diameter is recorded every six months <pause dur="0.4"/> to see about the growth <pause dur="1.9"/> in human experiments <pause dur="0.4"/> you often do lots of measurements in time <pause dur="0.3"/> you measure the weight of babies <pause dur="0.3"/> every month <pause dur="0.3"/> for a year <pause dur="1.7"/> you measure <pause dur="0.3"/> the effectiveness of a treatment for cancer <pause dur="0.4"/> by recording <pause dur="0.2"/> every three months <pause dur="1.3"/> the effect on patients and so on <pause dur="0.4"/> so this is very common <pause dur="0.2"/> in many fields of application <pause dur="0.9"/> just 
occasionally <pause dur="0.2"/> these repeated measures are in space <pause dur="0.6"/> an example <pause dur="0.3"/> would be if you have a hedge <pause dur="1.0"/> and you want to see <pause dur="0.2"/> the effect of the hedge on the plants <pause dur="0.3"/> that are <pause dur="0.3"/> close to the hedge you might have <pause dur="0.3"/> a hedge <pause dur="0.2"/> # with a certain tree species <pause dur="0.5"/> and then <pause dur="0.2"/> you have some rows of maize <pause dur="0.3"/> which grow <pause dur="0.4"/> and you have six rows <pause dur="0.5"/> going away from the hedge <pause dur="0.6"/> and now you want to measure each row <pause dur="1.3"/> so you applied your plot <pause dur="0.2"/> consists of your hedge <pause dur="0.4"/> with six rows each side <pause dur="0.6"/> and now <pause dur="0.2"/> you want to repeat the measurement namely the yield <pause dur="0.4"/> but not for the whole plot <pause dur="0.3"/> but for each row <pause dur="0.4"/> to see the effect in space <pause dur="0.3"/> as you go further away <pause dur="0.2"/> from the hedge <pause dur="1.1"/> and that is a problem of repeated measures <pause dur="0.3"/> in space <pause dur="3.7"/> those repeated measures introduce problems of data management and analysis which we're going to look at <pause dur="1.1"/> and it reviews many of the ideas <pause dur="0.5"/> from this part of the course <pause dur="3.0"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> we'll have a very simple example <pause dur="0.5"/> and so you have more information it's in the Genstat guide <pause dur="1.9"/> there are five <pause dur="0.5"/> replicates <pause dur="0.2"/> this is an example for you because 
it's example where there are no blocks <pause dur="0.2"/> one or two <pause dur="0.3"/> # so there are just <pause dur="0.2"/> fifteen petri dishes little dishes <pause dur="1.6"/> and <pause dur="0.5"/> there are three isolates of a fungus <pause dur="0.7"/> and they're repeated <pause dur="0.2"/> five times <pause dur="0.4"/> but there's no <pause dur="0.2"/> group of five here group of five here there are just fifteen of them <pause dur="2.1"/> and there were six measurements made <pause dur="0.6"/> on days three four five six seven and eight <pause dur="2.3"/><vocal desc="cough" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.3"/> how many plots <pause dur="0.3"/> how many measurements <pause dur="1.0"/> is it clear about the normal data and how many plots <pause dur="4.8"/> how many plots <pause dur="0.3"/> easy question <pause dur="6.3"/> fifteeen </u><u who="sm0676" trans="latching"> fifteen </u><u who="nm0658" trans="latching"> it is <pause dur="0.4"/> i'm sorry you you probably were confused 'cause it's too easy <pause dur="0.5"/> # it depends whether you think of your your confuse your measurements with your plots you see if you don't <pause dur="0.3"/> it should be obvious you have a question </u><pause dur="0.3"/> <u who="sf0677" trans="pause"> <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> <pause dur="0.2"/> destructive <pause dur="0.7"/> measurements on the same plot as the <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> </u><u who="nm0658" trans="latching"> the <trunc>des</trunc> <pause dur="0.5"/> <trunc>tha</trunc> that's a very good question <pause dur="1.1"/> when you are measuring on the same plot <pause dur="1.4"/> you have the choice of measuring let's say height <pause dur="1.0"/> which is <pause dur="0.4"/> something you can go back to exactly the same plant <pause dur="0.2"/> and measure <pause dur="0.6"/> or <pause dur="0.8"/> harvesting a few plants in the plot <pause dur="1.1"/> from a stats point of 
view <pause dur="0.4"/> it's roughly the same thing <pause dur="0.4"/> because <pause dur="0.5"/> they are <pause dur="0.3"/> they're still within the same plot <pause dur="0.7"/> but from a precision point of view <pause dur="0.4"/> it's much better <pause dur="0.4"/> if you can <pause dur="0.6"/> <trunc>i</trunc> <trunc>i</trunc> it isn't quite the same because <pause dur="0.2"/> if you go back to the same plant <pause dur="0.7"/> then your repeated measure <pause dur="0.6"/> is at the level plant <pause dur="0.4"/> if you're measuring the height <pause dur="1.1"/> whereas if it's destructive <pause dur="0.6"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> you're measuring let's say the height of four plants and then you throw them away <pause dur="1.0"/> then <pause dur="0.4"/> and you measure the height of four more plants <pause dur="0.2"/> then you're still repeating the measure <pause dur="0.3"/> but the level is the plot level not the plant level because you can't go back to the same plant <pause dur="0.2"/> because it's harvested <pause dur="0.7"/> so where it differs <pause dur="0.2"/> is the level <pause dur="0.2"/> at which you're able to do the repeat <pause dur="0.9"/> usually we find <pause dur="0.3"/> that the lower the level you can do the repeat the better it is <pause dur="0.9"/> so <pause dur="0.2"/> we often find <pause dur="0.3"/> that non-destructive measurements <pause dur="0.4"/> are tremendously useful <pause dur="0.5"/> and last week <pause dur="0.2"/> i <pause dur="0.3"/> was examining somebody whose thesis <pause dur="0.4"/> is on taking aerial photographs <pause dur="0.4"/> of plots <pause dur="0.5"/> where <pause dur="0.2"/> you can measure <pause dur="0.4"/> the <pause dur="0.7"/> the area 
roughly of each plant <pause dur="0.5"/> repeatedly <pause dur="0.8"/> very very easily by taking a photograph <pause dur="1.1"/> and that is <pause dur="0.5"/> non-destructive <pause dur="1.0"/> and <pause dur="0.3"/> was shown to be a very good way <pause dur="0.6"/> compared to these small harvests that people often take <pause dur="0.4"/> where you get exactly what you want namely the harvest but it destroys it so you can't measure the same plants later on <pause dur="5.0"/> here's the data <pause dur="0.6"/> well sorry <pause dur="0.4"/> # i haven't <pause dur="0.5"/> i'd asked you how many plots there are <pause dur="0.3"/> but it hasn't <pause dur="0.4"/> answered <pause dur="0.9"/> you should be saying <pause dur="0.4"/> there are six measurements so that's six columns <pause dur="1.1"/> the fact they're on days three four five six seven eight doesn't affect <pause dur="0.2"/> and there are fifteen <pause dur="1.2"/> plots <pause dur="0.4"/> therefore i'm going to have <pause dur="0.2"/> fifteen rows of data <pause dur="1.2"/> and so <pause dur="0.2"/> the data <pause dur="1.1"/> are going to look <pause dur="0.3"/> well here's an example of the way the data could look <pause dur="1.5"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> where <pause dur="0.2"/> there's the unit <pause dur="0.2"/> there's the isolate there's the rep <pause dur="0.3"/> and there's my measurements on day <pause dur="0.2"/> three four five six seven eight <pause dur="9.5"/><vocal desc="cough" iterated="n"/><pause dur="3.4"/> now <pause dur="0.6"/> you now have to think of your strategy <pause dur="0.4"/> for the analysis <pause dur="4.3"/> and here we begin <pause dur="0.2"/> with a slight <pause dur="0.3"/> problem <pause dur="2.1"/> that is <pause dur="0.2"/> i would like you to 
look constructively at the data <pause dur="1.4"/> exploratory analysis <pause dur="0.2"/> we said <pause dur="0.2"/> is very important <pause dur="0.3"/> i wonder how you would like to explore <pause dur="0.5"/> these data <pause dur="2.7"/> well a very common way that people would like to explore the data <pause dur="0.8"/> is <pause dur="0.2"/> to see <pause dur="0.8"/> what's the change in observation <pause dur="0.4"/> over time <pause dur="2.3"/> sort of <pause dur="0.3"/> notice this goes <pause dur="0.4"/> on the first petri dish i go three-point-seven five six-point-one <pause dur="0.2"/> seven-point-five eight-point-three <trunc>nine-point-ei</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> seem to going up with time <pause dur="1.5"/> to understand my data <pause dur="0.5"/> maybe it would be nice <pause dur="0.8"/> to look at that sort of graph <pause dur="0.5"/> as a function of time <pause dur="0.9"/> that would be a nice exploratory method <pause dur="0.3"/> but unfortunately for a stats package <pause dur="0.3"/> exploration works best on columns <pause dur="1.3"/> so you may wish to do that exploration in Excel <pause dur="1.9"/> or <pause dur="1.2"/> you will find Genstat helps <pause dur="1.3"/> so a strategy for the analysis <pause dur="4.4"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> nothing changes you've changed the problem but you haven't changed the strategy which is <pause dur="0.2"/> please start by looking critically at your data <pause dur="1.3"/> so start with data exploration and that's usually graphs <pause dur="0.5"/> so you look at all the data <pause dur="0.2"/> are there any odd 
observations <pause dur="0.7"/> you could do those Excel or in Genstat <pause dur="0.6"/> and you could get one graph for each plot <pause dur="0.5"/> so there'd be fifteen graphs <pause dur="0.4"/> be one way of exploring the data <pause dur="1.2"/> let's have a look at that first <pause dur="5.4"/> i'll come back to that for the second part <pause dur="0.3"/> so there's a way <pause dur="2.4"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> in Genstat <pause dur="1.3"/> of exploring the data <pause dur="4.1"/> and you will find that Genstat has a little menu <pause dur="2.5"/> which <pause dur="1.6"/> puts this out automatically <pause dur="1.0"/> so here's the graphs <pause dur="0.3"/> for <pause dur="0.2"/> # one treatment <pause dur="0.3"/> the second treatment <pause dur="0.2"/> and the third treatment <pause dur="2.8"/> and here is the graph <pause dur="0.3"/> for <pause dur="0.4"/> the means <pause dur="0.4"/> for the three treatments <pause dur="0.3"/> so there's a bit of analysis <pause dur="0.3"/> but here we have all our data <pause dur="0.8"/> this is the ninety observations <pause dur="0.7"/> there are fifteen lines <pause dur="0.2"/> because we have fifteen plots <pause dur="0.8"/> and each line has six points <pause dur="0.2"/> because we have six time points <pause dur="0.4"/> so we actually have all our data <pause dur="0.4"/> here <pause dur="0.8"/> and we could see if there was some odd observations <pause dur="0.7"/> i don't see anything particularly odd </u><pause dur="0.4"/> <u who="sm0678" trans="pause"> when you say odd <pause dur="0.7"/> what exactly do you mean </u><pause dur="8.7"/> <u who="nm0658" trans="pause"> the full set of numbers <pause dur="2.0"/> consists <pause dur="0.2"/> here's all our data <pause dur="0.9"/> these are all the numbers <pause dur="1.4"/> and what we have <pause dur="0.3"/> is we have 
fifteen plots so we're actually using all the numbers <pause dur="0.3"/> in those graphs you can see every number <pause dur="0.4"/> somewhere there so we're using <pause dur="0.2"/> all our data <pause dur="0.8"/> in producing those plots </u><u who="sm0678" trans="latching"> my question is by looking at the graphs <pause dur="0.2"/> what <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 word"/> <pause dur="0.9"/> are we looking for <pause dur="0.7"/> <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> </u><u who="nm0658" trans="overlap"> # okay <pause dur="10.0"/> does anybody have anything they've found without knowing seriously what they're looking for </u> <pause dur="3.3"/> <u who="sm0679" trans="pause"> there is a </u><u who="nm0658" trans="overlap"> any impressions </u><u who="sm0679" trans="latching"> increase # <pause dur="0.9"/> <unclear>to an</unclear> X<pause dur="0.2"/>-axis <pause dur="0.5"/> and </u><u who="nm0658" trans="overlap"> there seems to be an increase <pause dur="1.4"/> any # <trunc>re</trunc> remember your chick experiment <pause dur="0.4"/> and the increases sort of straight lines or curves </u><pause dur="1.4"/> <u who="sm0680" trans="pause"> curves </u><u who="sm0681" trans="latching"> curves </u><pause dur="0.5"/> <u who="nm0658" trans="pause"> curves <pause dur="1.7"/> we we <pause dur="0.4"/> sort of like that </u><u who="sm0682" trans="overlap"> yes </u><u who="nm0658" trans="overlap"> or <pause dur="0.2"/> wiggeldy </u><pause dur="1.2"/> <u who="sf0683" trans="pause"> some of them </u><pause dur="0.5"/> <u who="sm0682" trans="pause"> mm some of them were </u><u who="sf0683" trans="latching"> and some were straight mm </u><pause dur="2.1"/> <u who="nm0658" trans="pause"> i don't notice any that go sort of right like that <pause dur="1.0"/> sort of <pause dur="0.2"/> starting going up to the top and coming down <pause dur="0.4"/> remember <pause dur="0.4"/> we're worrying about statistics there's variation so <pause dur="0.2"/> <trunc>th</trunc> everything you can't have things that are exactly straight 'cause we're just connecting the points <pause dur="1.5"/> do you do you think <pause dur="0.3"/> that <pause dur="0.3"/> for some of these <pause dur="0.6"/> it would be sensible to have a straight line model <pause dur="0.3"/> would that be a rough reasonable summary </u><pause dur="0.6"/> 
<u who="sm0684" trans="pause"> <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 word"/></u><pause dur="0.4"/> <u who="nm0658" trans="pause"> for all the plots <pause dur="1.7"/> are there any plots where you think a straight line model isn't going to be sensible <pause dur="2.1"/> i don't actually see many <pause dur="0.4"/> which is surprising usually you find <pause dur="0.4"/> maybe one treatment is curved and the other treatments are straight <pause dur="1.2"/> as you found with the barley and the wheat one was more curved than another you might <pause dur="0.3"/> want to <pause dur="0.2"/> recognize that <pause dur="1.4"/> does anybody see any very surprising observations <pause dur="2.4"/> i don't <pause dur="0.8"/> i don't i don't sort of see a sudden spike like this <pause dur="0.4"/> which might be a recording error <pause dur="1.3"/> so this is exploration <pause dur="0.6"/> and <pause dur="0.4"/> exploration can be positive or negative <pause dur="0.7"/> usually i find <pause dur="0.2"/> you notice one or two very odd observations <pause dur="0.2"/> here i don't see anything very odd <pause dur="0.4"/> and things seem to be increasing <pause dur="0.7"/> so that here <pause dur="0.7"/> where this <pause dur="0.2"/> is the mean <pause dur="0.3"/> of that one <pause dur="2.2"/> i feel <pause dur="0.2"/> reasonable confidence that drawing a straight line <pause dur="0.4"/> which is the average for those points <pause dur="0.5"/> is probably a reasonable summary <pause dur="1.1"/> and i notice now <pause dur="0.2"/> that this straight line so this is analysis and this 
is just presentation of the raw data <pause dur="1.9"/> and i now notice in this summary <pause dur="0.5"/> that <pause dur="0.7"/> these <pause dur="0.6"/> all three seem to be going up <pause dur="0.3"/> but this maybe is going up more gradually A it's lower <pause dur="0.2"/> and it's going up more gradually <pause dur="1.1"/> so from these <pause dur="0.6"/> i feel that this is probably a fair summary of the data i don't see any reason <pause dur="0.2"/> to say oh gosh it's not fair because of <pause dur="0.2"/> this <pause dur="0.9"/> and in here i'm starting my analysis <pause dur="1.1"/> and i've done that in a very simple way and visually <pause dur="2.3"/> does that help to answer your question <pause dur="9.6"/><vocal desc="cough" iterated="n"/><pause dur="3.4"/> okay so we have our data <pause dur="1.9"/> and <pause dur="0.4"/> i was looking for the strategy <pause dur="0.5"/> okay <pause dur="2.6"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> so <pause dur="1.7"/> i suggest for all analyses you start with a simple summary <pause dur="0.2"/> and then you go on to simple analyses <pause dur="2.1"/> what could the simple analyses be <pause dur="4.0"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> well here we have the data <pause dur="4.0"/> one simple analysis <pause dur="0.2"/> could be to analyse the data on day three <pause dur="2.4"/> just take one time point <pause dur="0.9"/> another one <pause dur="0.6"/> day eight <pause dur="0.8"/> so there's a very simple analysis <pause dur="0.3"/> you could analyse <pause dur="0.2"/> each of your observations <pause dur="0.2"/> separately <pause dur="1.8"/> the next simple analysis <pause dur="0.4"/> could be <pause dur="0.6"/> to take a useful summary <pause dur="2.5"/> one summary might be the difference between 
day eight and day three <pause dur="0.2"/> has the change <pause dur="0.2"/> been the same for each treatment and each replicate <pause dur="1.7"/> so that's what we suggest <pause dur="4.7"/><event desc="looks through slides" iterated="y" dur="22"/> i keep losing <pause dur="0.5"/> the # <pause dur="17.0"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> so i've suggested the first simple analysis could be the data at each time point <pause dur="1.4"/> then we could have simple function <pause dur="0.9"/> like the final minus the initial <pause dur="0.4"/> or <pause dur="0.6"/> we could have the slope <pause dur="0.2"/> of each line <pause dur="1.0"/> now you don't want the slope <pause dur="0.2"/> if too many lines could be very curved <pause dur="0.4"/> but here i think getting the slope of each line <pause dur="0.2"/> might be a sensible summary <pause dur="8.8"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> as a strategy what sort of strategy is this <pause dur="1.6"/> well i would claim that the repeated measures <pause dur="0.5"/> are like observations at a lower level <pause dur="0.5"/> they're not exactly the same <pause dur="0.7"/> but they're a little like a split plot analysis they're like taking <pause dur="0.2"/> day <pause dur="0.4"/> as <pause dur="0.2"/> a level within a petri dish <pause dur="2.1"/> and then <pause dur="0.5"/> in this example we have six observations within each petri dish <pause dur="0.2"/> for the six days <pause dur="1.4"/> or we have ten weights within each animal <pause dur="1.1"/> so it's a little like a split plot <pause dur="0.2"/> experiment <pause dur="0.3"/> where the factor time <pause dur="0.7"/> is within <pause dur="0.4"/> the treatment <pause dur="1.1"/> just as <pause dur="0.3"/> an 
ordinary split plot <pause dur="0.8"/> but it's not quite a split plot <pause dur="0.2"/> because we don't randomize the times <pause dur="1.0"/> we can't <pause dur="2.4"/> like <pause dur="0.7"/> anything like that <pause dur="0.2"/> the analysis will be simpler if we first get a summary value at the plot level <pause dur="1.2"/> so our analysis is going to be simple if we summarize up <pause dur="0.6"/> to the petri dish <pause dur="1.5"/> whatever we do <pause dur="0.2"/> we've got fifteen petri dishes <pause dur="0.2"/> whatever summary we'd like to get <pause dur="0.5"/> that would be a simple <pause dur="0.2"/> analysis <pause dur="0.2"/> if we can go <pause dur="0.2"/> you were asking about split plots and i was saying <pause dur="1.0"/> simple experiments are at one level <pause dur="0.9"/> well repeated measures <pause dur="0.2"/> bring in a second level <pause dur="0.9"/> there are many methods for analysing repeated measures <pause dur="0.2"/> bringing in the two levels <pause dur="0.7"/> but the simplest is not to have two levels <pause dur="0.3"/> but is to summarize the data <pause dur="0.3"/> from the repeated measures up to the one level <pause dur="2.1"/> because that's where we apply the treatment <pause dur="1.6"/> which summary is appropriate <pause dur="0.5"/> depends on the data and the objectives <pause dur="0.9"/> and the booklet on analysis that i gave out in week eleven <pause dur="0.3"/> gives you some more details <pause dur="3.9"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> so <pause dur="0.7"/> <reading>the graphical display <pause dur="0.3"/> indicates <pause dur="0.3"/> that 
a useful summary might be the slope of the regression line for each petri dish</reading> <pause dur="3.1"/> so we then have a problem how do we get the fifteen slopes <pause dur="2.0"/> in Excel we could use the data as they stand <pause dur="1.0"/> in Genstat <pause dur="0.2"/> be better to stack the data <pause dur="1.2"/> so now to do those slopes <pause dur="0.5"/> because Genstat works with columns <pause dur="0.2"/> be better to stack <pause dur="0.2"/> the data <pause dur="1.9"/> and that was shown <pause dur="0.3"/> earlier <pause dur="3.5"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> and once you analyse <pause dur="0.2"/> with the stack data <pause dur="0.9"/> you will find <pause dur="1.1"/> and the way we'd go through that <pause dur="0.3"/> and get the regression <pause dur="0.2"/> you will find <pause dur="0.3"/> that here are the fifteen <pause dur="0.8"/> observations <pause dur="0.3"/> and here are the fifteen slopes <pause dur="1.4"/> and here is the analysis <pause dur="0.3"/> where we're actually analysing the slopes <pause dur="1.0"/> we're getting the individual slopes <pause dur="0.4"/> and there's fourteen degrees of freedom here <pause dur="0.4"/> because there's fifteen petri dishes <pause dur="1.2"/> and <pause dur="0.3"/> we find <pause dur="0.4"/> that # the effect of slope is statistically significant <pause dur="0.2"/> and these are <pause dur="0.2"/> the three slopes <pause dur="1.6"/> which are the <trunc>lin</trunc> the slopes of those three lines <pause dur="0.3"/> and we find <pause dur="0.2"/> that these first two <pause dur="0.4"/> treatments are about the same <pause dur="0.2"/> but this slope <pause dur="0.3"/> is rather <pause dur="1.2"/> flatter <pause dur="9.1"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> there 
are many other methods of analysis of repeated measures <pause dur="0.5"/> and Genstat <pause dur="0.4"/> has a whole set of dialogues specially for that <pause dur="1.3"/> they all try and get more levels more information <pause dur="0.3"/> by leaving the data at the two levels <pause dur="0.3"/> rather than summarizing up <pause dur="0.5"/> to one level <pause dur="1.6"/> they're often attractive in principle <pause dur="2.9"/> they're needed that should be an if <pause dur="0.3"/> they're needed if there is not enough data <pause dur="4.8"/> but <pause dur="0.9"/> to me they have a major problem <pause dur="0.4"/> that they are much more complicated <pause dur="0.4"/> and often <pause dur="0.3"/> their real problem is you can't tailor the analysis to the precise objectives of your research <pause dur="0.7"/> so they're like many complicated analyses <pause dur="0.4"/> that they're wonderful <pause dur="0.3"/> in principle <pause dur="0.3"/> but in practice they don't help <pause dur="1.1"/> that they are playing with data <pause dur="0.2"/> often <pause dur="1.1"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> my conclusion is <pause dur="0.2"/> use the simple methods wherever possible <pause dur="1.4"/> and if you do use the more complex methods which you can because Genstat provides them from menus <pause dur="0.9"/> then don't just use them <pause dur="0.2"/> make sure they add constructively <pause dur="0.4"/> to what you were able to do quite simply <pause dur="0.3"/> with the simple methods <pause dur="6.1"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> okay <pause dur="0.5"/> practical work <pause dur="1.7"/> 
the practical follows the topics covered in this session so it's useful for you to review those <pause dur="0.3"/> so we're doing some on designing some on managing data and some on repeated measures <pause dur="1.5"/> in each case <pause dur="0.4"/> i've deliberately used examples from the Genstat guides <pause dur="0.5"/> so <pause dur="0.5"/> you don't have to finish <pause dur="0.3"/> just concentrate on those parts you find most interesting <pause dur="0.3"/> and that will help you <pause dur="0.4"/> get more experience <pause dur="0.2"/> in using Genstat <pause dur="5.2"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> and <pause dur="1.4"/> two final slides <pause dur="3.4"/> this is now the end of the five sessions <pause dur="0.3"/> which are specifically for the analysis of experimental data <pause dur="1.5"/> you now should have two things <pause dur="0.8"/> the first is <pause dur="0.2"/> the broad picture of the role of statistics in research projects <pause dur="1.0"/> which has come from <pause dur="0.3"/> sessions one to five <pause dur="1.4"/> that was last term <pause dur="0.8"/> so you should have an idea of how you use statistics in design in data management <pause dur="0.8"/> you should have 
reviewed <pause dur="0.3"/> basic statistical techniques <pause dur="1.0"/> statistical inference ANOVA simple regression <pause dur="0.2"/> that was the second part last term <pause dur="1.1"/> now you should be familiar with some of the special methods for analysing experimental data <pause dur="2.2"/> and hopefully <pause dur="0.9"/> you are therefore ready <pause dur="0.3"/> for a brief introduction <pause dur="0.4"/> to <pause dur="0.5"/> the role of modern statistical methods <pause dur="0.9"/> to help you <pause dur="0.4"/> in processing your research data <pause dur="7.8"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> the lecture room next week <pause dur="1.0"/> is <pause dur="0.2"/> the plant sciences <pause dur="0.3"/> lecture room so we're not here next week <pause dur="0.4"/> we're together with the other group <pause dur="0.3"/> in plant sciences </u><pause dur="0.2"/> <u who="ss" trans="pause"> <gap reason="inaudible, multiple speakers" extent="2 secs"/></u><u who="nm0658" trans="overlap"> in </u><u who="ss" trans="overlap"> <gap reason="inaudible, multiple speakers" extent="1 sec"/></u><pause dur="0.3"/> <u who="nm0658" trans="pause"> sorry </u><u who="ss" trans="overlap"> <gap reason="inaudible, multiple speakers" extent="1 sec"/></u><u who="nm0658" trans="latching"> the ground floor i <trunc>pres</trunc> the ground floor lecture room in plant sciences </u><pause dur="0.5"/> <u who="sm0685" trans="pause"> you mean the small lecture theatre </u><pause dur="0.9"/> <u who="sm0686" trans="pause"> there's one <pause dur="0.3"/> <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 word"/> </u><u who="nm0658" trans="overlap"> i hope not it's <trunc>w</trunc> </u><u who="sf0687" trans="overlap"> there's one lecture theatre anyway isn't it </u><u who="nm0658" trans="overlap"> sorry </u><u who="sf0687" trans="overlap"> just one there isn't it </u><u who="nm0658" trans="overlap"> there's just one one lecture
