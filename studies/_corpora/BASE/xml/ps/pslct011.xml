funny really it just gets there eventually and that's it <pause dur="1.4"/> we then had a look <pause dur="0.4"/> <trunc>thi</trunc> this is hopefully how i <pause dur="0.2"/> how i left you last time we were on <pause dur="0.4"/> # was looking at the critically damped case <pause dur="0.6"/> and how far did we go fine <pause dur="0.2"/> so this this you've had a look at this bit so far so if i go over this you won't <pause dur="0.2"/> or shouldn't be saying what the hell is that <pause dur="0.3"/> it should be yeah i remember that way back <pause dur="0.2"/> beyond the <pause dur="0.4"/> days gone by <pause dur="0.4"/> the <pause dur="0.2"/> in the <pause dur="0.3"/> critically damped case just to remind you the critically damped case <pause dur="0.4"/> is really this sort of <pause dur="0.3"/> mathematical ideal on the cusp <pause dur="0.4"/> probably never really happens in practice type <pause dur="0.2"/> it it's a it's an ideal type of thing to get to <pause dur="0.5"/> it's sort of # <pause dur="0.3"/> in a political sense it's the pure communist state you know it's an <trunc>ol</trunc> <trunc>i</trunc> ideal but it's never # going to actually occur in practice <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> here we got a system <pause dur="0.2"/> output <pause dur="0.3"/> the the system is G input is U which is a step input <pause dur="0.4"/> and where we'd got to <pause dur="0.4"/> was <pause dur="0.2"/> simply at the point of looking at what the output response is <pause dur="0.8"/> to a step input <pause dur="1.0"/> and # <pause dur="0.5"/> # again 
what we'd done before well what what i'd done and some of you had listened in <pause dur="0.5"/> was to look at the sort of extreme cases <pause dur="0.4"/> when <trunc>thi</trunc> this is what it looks like the output looks like in terms of time physically what the output looks like <pause dur="0.5"/> and there are three <pause dur="0.2"/> values to it or three parts to it <pause dur="0.6"/> one is the just the gain K is just a number <pause dur="0.4"/> alpha <pause dur="0.2"/> apart from being a Greek symbol just to make it look more difficult <pause dur="0.3"/> is also just a number <pause dur="0.5"/> and and this would just be as it is squared so this is just going to be a positive value here that's all a gain value <pause dur="0.5"/> we've then got one <pause dur="0.3"/> now this this effectively will be the steady state value when things have settled down <pause dur="0.3"/> and all we've got are two exponential terms <pause dur="0.7"/> which we can look at at the extreme cases <pause dur="0.2"/> and the extreme cases being <pause dur="0.2"/> when we switched the thing on <pause dur="0.4"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> it's like # time is zero <pause dur="0.2"/> it's the big bang time <pause dur="0.3"/> well in a physical sense <pause dur="0.2"/> that is not in a <pause dur="0.3"/> # well any other sense <pause dur="0.4"/> and i've got to watch what i say here haven't i 'cause <pause dur="0.2"/> i mean <trunc>th</trunc> this is 
this is with language studies you get sort of <pause dur="0.2"/> # mystical foreign students # <pause dur="0.5"/> listening in on this or <pause dur="0.3"/> yeah </u><pause dur="0.6"/> <u who="om0725" trans="pause"> possibly </u><pause dur="0.2"/> <u who="nm0724" trans="pause"> okay <pause dur="0.3"/> for the so for the <pause dur="0.3"/> the Latin American students that might listen to this transcript <pause dur="0.3"/> the big bang i'm talking purely in a <pause dur="0.2"/> sort of Stephen Hawking sense not in # <pause dur="0.4"/> # other <pause dur="0.5"/> other connotations <pause dur="0.5"/> and # <pause dur="0.4"/> anyway so actually when when <trunc>t</trunc> <vocal desc="laugh" iterated="n"/> oh God let's go for it <pause dur="0.2"/> when T is zero <pause dur="0.4"/> then exponential of zero is </u><pause dur="0.9"/><u who="sm0727" trans="pause"> one </u><pause dur="0.3"/><u who="nm0724" trans="pause"> one great <pause dur="0.4"/> and when <pause dur="0.5"/> this lot is zero because we've got a T in there <pause dur="0.2"/> that going to zero the whole lot <pause dur="0.5"/> of that goes to zero <pause dur="0.3"/> so all we've got when we switch the thing on <pause dur="0.3"/> this is when we apply the step input at that time we go <shift feature="pitch" new="high"/> zing <shift feature="pitch" new="normal"/> <pause dur="0.3"/> then the output <pause dur="0.4"/> will be this value <pause dur="0.2"/> one-minus-one <pause dur="0.4"/> and one-minus-one is </u><pause dur="0.9"/> <u who="sm0728" trans="pause"> zero </u><pause dur="0.8"/> <u who="nm0724" trans="pause"> one student knows anyway that # <trunc>th</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> yeah one-minus-one is zero <pause dur="0.2"/> which means that the output <pause dur="0.2"/> is zero <pause dur="0.4"/> which is pretty obvious we switch the thing on and the output's # well i was going to say <pause dur="0.2"/> i was going to swear but i won't <pause dur="0.4"/> # the output is zero <pause dur="0.5"/> # but why not <pause dur="0.4"/> but # now let's let's take the other case <pause dur="0.2"/> 
when time goes off to a big number <pause dur="0.3"/> such as infinity or the end of the lecture whichever is first <pause dur="0.5"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> in this case the exponential minus infinity <pause dur="0.4"/> is </u><pause dur="2.0"/> <u who="sm0729" trans="pause"> must be zero </u><pause dur="0.3"/> <u who="nm0724" trans="pause"> must be zero <pause dur="0.2"/> it sounds good doesn't it it sounds good <pause dur="0.3"/> so that must be zero <pause dur="0.4"/> and here we've got <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> time is off to infinity or a big number <pause dur="0.9"/> and this bit is down to to zero <pause dur="0.3"/> so what's <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> anything multiplied by infinity is </u><pause dur="0.5"/> <u who="sm0730" trans="pause"> infinity </u><u who="nm0724" trans="latching"> infinity <pause dur="0.3"/> except for one specific case because anything multiplied by zero is </u><pause dur="0.3"/><u who="sm0731" trans="pause"> zero </u><pause dur="0.2"/> <u who="nm0724" trans="pause"> zero <pause dur="0.4"/> and # we're on one of these sort of <pause dur="0.5"/> <trunc>parad</trunc> what is it a <trunc>p</trunc> a paradigm or something i don't know what <pause dur="0.2"/> or is that some exotic drink </u><pause dur="0.7"/> <u who="sm0732" trans="pause"> <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> </u><pause dur="0.3"/> <u who="nm0724" trans="pause"> no all right anyway <pause dur="0.2"/> it's zero multiplied by any old thing and T is a big number <pause dur="0.3"/> so the whole lot's going to go to zero there <pause dur="0.3"/> so it's because <pause dur="0.2"/> that's <pause dur="0.6"/> zip all <pause dur="0.4"/> so we've got one-minus-zero <pause dur="0.2"/> which is </u><pause dur="0.8"/> <u who="sm0733" trans="pause"> one </u><pause dur="0.3"/> <u who="nm0724" trans="pause"> one thanks very much <pause dur="0.5"/> well we <trunc>ge</trunc> we're getting there even if it's the odd sort of person there <pause dur="0.3"/> so in a steady state <pause dur="0.2"/> this would be <pause dur="0.3"/> K-over-alpha-squared whatever the number is <pause dur="0.2"/> multiplied by one <pause dur="0.3"/> which turns out to be <pause dur="0.2"/> 
K-over-alpha-squared <pause dur="0.8"/> so that's the critically damped case <pause dur="0.4"/> <kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="3"/><vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.3"/> that's the steady state value <pause dur="1.5"/> and the two extremes <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> are the ones we've just looked at <pause dur="0.3"/> the steady state when time goes off to infinity <pause dur="0.6"/> or a or a big number <pause dur="0.3"/> whichever you want <pause dur="0.8"/> # is this number K-over-alpha-squared which is the <pause dur="0.3"/> the inherent <pause dur="0.3"/> gain <pause dur="0.2"/> of the system <pause dur="2.4"/> again they're just numbers <pause dur="0.3"/> K and alpha <pause dur="0.3"/> are just numbers <pause dur="1.0"/> i mean Kay is also a girl's name i know that <pause dur="0.2"/> but for the purposes of this thing <pause dur="0.6"/> just treat her as a number <pause dur="0.3"/> if anybody knows <pause dur="0.7"/> anybody called Kay <pause dur="2.3"/> tonight <pause dur="0.4"/> say to her Kay you're just a number <pause dur="4.2"/> if if she gets upset about that <pause dur="0.7"/> you know especially if you say you're number fifty-eight or something like that <pause dur="0.2"/> she gets upset then say no the prof says you're just a number <pause dur="1.3"/> say how does he know <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="1.5"/> and then in the initial <pause dur="1.2"/> does anybody know anybody called Kay just to get you into trouble here <pause dur="0.6"/> just as well <pause dur="0.2"/> just as well </u><pause dur="0.5"/> <u who="sm0734" trans="pause"> bloke </u><u who="nm0724" trans="overlap"> don't <pause dur="0.4"/> pardon </u>

the dotted this this dotted thing here <pause dur="0.3"/> is the steady state value <pause dur="0.3"/> # this is the output <pause dur="0.5"/> here's time along here <pause dur="0.3"/> we switch the switch <pause dur="0.3"/> and up it goes <pause dur="0.3"/> but it doesn't actually <pause dur="1.3"/> overshoot <pause dur="0.4"/> in theory <pause dur="0.2"/> it doesn't overshoot the final <pause dur="0.2"/> value that it settles down to <pause dur="2.3"/> 
in fact it is the most rapid <pause dur="0.5"/> response the critically damped thing what it means is it's the most rapid response that you can possibly get on the face of this earth <pause dur="0.6"/> without <pause dur="0.6"/> any overshoot <pause dur="3.8"/> for the overdamped case you remember <pause dur="0.3"/> it <pause dur="0.2"/> it <pause dur="0.2"/> didn't overshoot it # <pause dur="0.2"/> came in from <unclear>once i</unclear> eventually got there <pause dur="2.6"/> and i've said here it's desirable this particular <pause dur="0.3"/> goal this particular type critically damped response <pause dur="0.4"/> if you're looking at machine tools <pause dur="0.5"/> # or robots <pause dur="0.2"/> in fact or # a lot of production machinery <pause dur="0.2"/> welding machines is a a prime example <pause dur="0.7"/> i know tonight you'll all go home and play with a welding machine <pause dur="0.5"/> as you do <pause dur="0.3"/> and with that welding machine the aim the target <pause dur="0.4"/> is to make the thing critically damped <pause dur="0.5"/> so <pause dur="0.6"/> if if you can imagine for a moment <pause dur="0.2"/> that i am a welding machine <pause dur="0.4"/> and <pause dur="0.3"/> this the top of the projector is the thing <pause dur="0.2"/> like what i am supposed 
to be welding <pause dur="0.4"/> then <pause dur="0.2"/> here's my little torch <pause dur="0.2"/> or stick or whatever the welding thing is <pause dur="0.4"/> and i the design of it <pause dur="0.2"/> i want this arm to come in as quickly as possible <pause dur="0.7"/> do do you need a <trunc>v</trunc> a vocal commentary <pause dur="0.4"/><event desc="moves microphone closer to mouth" iterated="y" dur="2"/> he moved his arm <vocal desc="laughter" n="ss" iterated="y" dur="2"/> in the direction of <vocal desc="laughter" n="sl" iterated="y" dur="1"/> so i want the arm to come in as quick as possible <pause dur="0.2"/> to to that point <shift feature="pitch" new="high"/> zing <shift feature="pitch" new="normal"/> like that do the <vocal desc="buzzing noise" iterated="y" dur="1"/> do the welding and move away again <pause dur="0.3"/> now if it's overdamped the case we saw before <pause dur="0.2"/> it will not come in zing it will come in <shift feature="tempo" new="ll"/> zing <shift feature="tempo" new="normal"/> and eventually get there <pause dur="0.6"/> if it's as the case we're going to move on to <pause dur="0.2"/> it goes past it overshoots <pause dur="0.3"/> then of course it would go <pause dur="0.3"/> zing and we messed the <pause dur="0.2"/> and you can imagine whatever it is we've gone too far <pause dur="0.5"/> and know what going too far gets you <pause dur="1.0"/> # so this critically damped case is the <pause dur="0.3"/> the <pause dur="0.2"/> the perfect the ideal case if we had <pause dur="0.3"/> a perfect welder <pause dur="0.4"/> see knows all about perfect welders he can afford to miss the first ten minutes <pause dur="0.4"/> if we had the perfect welder <pause dur="0.3"/> it would be critically damped <pause dur="0.3"/> however <pause dur="0.5"/> i this this thing here <pause dur="0.5"/> is important <pause dur="0.6"/> that 
that's really in theory <pause dur="0.2"/><kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> this is the theoretical <pause dur="0.2"/> for Christ's sake if you get a job <pause dur="0.3"/> at the end of this course <pause dur="0.3"/> as a <pause dur="0.2"/> welding machine setter upper <pause dur="0.3"/> or whatever it happens to be <pause dur="0.2"/> or someone who's in charge of people who set welding machines up or <pause dur="0.2"/> or whatever <pause dur="0.4"/> # then <pause dur="0.8"/> don't <pause dur="0.3"/> do it <pause dur="0.2"/> quite this way <pause dur="0.3"/> aim for this as a perfect thing but remember <pause dur="0.4"/> probably you're going to get a bit of noise floating around probably you're going to get a bit of variability <pause dur="0.4"/> one <pause dur="0.2"/> robot's welding stick <pause dur="0.2"/> might be a little bit longer than another robot's welding stick <pause dur="0.3"/> you know in this world <pause dur="0.2"/> robots have welding sticks of different lengths we have to be # <pause dur="0.4"/> aware of that <pause dur="0.4"/> and that might mean if you've set the thing up <pause dur="0.5"/> to come in just from one side the the critically damped case <pause dur="0.5"/> it <pause dur="0.2"/> it might <pause dur="0.3"/> bang the <pause dur="0.3"/> so you might break it it might <pause dur="0.2"/> you you could go too far <pause dur="0.4"/> # the other thing with noise <pause dur="0.2"/> really you may not want this to overshoot and # with a bit of noise on the top <pause dur="0.3"/> the <trunc>si</trunc> the signal wouldn't look like that it would come in <pause dur="0.3"/> 
and it it might go like which means you would in fact be <pause dur="0.3"/> overshooting a little bit <pause dur="1.0"/> so in practice what happens is <pause dur="0.9"/> # you would slug it down <pause dur="0.3"/> a bit <pause dur="0.3"/> so in <pause dur="0.6"/> a a lot of manufacturing cases in fact it's really slugged down a hell of a lot <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> typical production line down at <pause dur="0.3"/> say Ford <pause dur="0.2"/> who are <pause dur="0.3"/> about to <pause dur="0.7"/> close the production line down i don't know whether that's any coincidence <pause dur="0.5"/> but so at Dagenham the robots there they have some big KUKA robots that do welding and parts manipulation and so on <pause dur="0.4"/> and they're slowed down to about a third <pause dur="0.3"/> sort of three times if you like <pause dur="0.2"/> slower than they could actually <pause dur="0.4"/> operate at <pause dur="0.3"/> for safety reasons for that <pause dur="0.2"/> reason that if they operated faster than that <pause dur="0.5"/> then <pause dur="0.3"/> they could the the to achieve <pause dur="0.3"/> more production because if the things are operating faster they get more things going through more welds three welds a <trunc>m</trunc> a minute instead of one weld or whatever it happens to be <pause dur="0.5"/> but as you get towards that optimum this critically damped case which is what we're looking at <pause dur="0.5"/> you've got 
all sorts of potential problems because of the variability in what you're dealing with <pause dur="0.5"/> so this is a an ideal a theoretical case to aim for <pause dur="0.3"/> here's the theory <pause dur="0.3"/> now let's detune slow things down let's come back to the overdamped case a bit in a practical way <pause dur="0.4"/> in order that things don't blow up and we don't break things and so on <pause dur="0.2"/> so forth <pause dur="0.3"/> so that's what we're about <pause dur="1.4"/><kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="14"/> so there # critically damped is a sort of <pause dur="0.3"/> theoretical ideal <pause dur="0.8"/> # it's a bit like my wage packet it's completely theoretical but the <pause dur="0.9"/><vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="y" dur="1"/> it's not ideal either <pause dur="1.3"/><vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/> it seems seem that the language <pause dur="0.2"/> they get paid loads of dosh over there so <pause dur="0.8"/> they get <trunc>p</trunc> <pause dur="0.3"/> get paid it all in foreign money and # <pause dur="0.2"/><vocal desc="laughter" n="sl" iterated="y" dur="3"/> <pause dur="0.6"/> right <pause dur="0.6"/> # we've done <pause dur="0.6"/> the overdamped case <pause dur="0.5"/> we've done the critical damped <pause dur="0.2"/> case <pause dur="1.1"/> and # <pause dur="0.4"/> we're going to have a look at the <pause dur="0.3"/> this is this is in fact this is a really sad moment <pause dur="0.4"/> because this underdamped response <pause dur="0.5"/> this is it this is the final thing we're going to be covering on the course <pause dur="0.4"/> so <pause dur="0.6"/> i know i know it's a time for holding back the tears for <pause dur="0.7"/> # you know <pause dur="0.8"/> 
stifling <pause dur="0.4"/> not a yawn <pause dur="0.2"/> but <pause dur="0.8"/> stifling something or other <pause dur="0.9"/> # so the <trunc>o</trunc> the the overdamped <pause dur="0.2"/> it didn't didn't overshoot critically damped's right on the cusp <pause dur="0.4"/> underdamped is the the final thing we're going to look at <pause dur="0.2"/> and it's called underdamped because it's underdamped <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> the the damping <pause dur="0.3"/> is not enough <pause dur="0.4"/> to stop <pause dur="0.3"/> overshoots <pause dur="0.3"/> essentially <pause dur="1.0"/> and this this type of response the output <pause dur="0.4"/> overshoots its steady state value <pause dur="0.4"/><kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="5"/> so i'll just <pause dur="0.2"/> flick back <pause dur="0.4"/> to this <pause dur="0.2"/> previous overhead <pause dur="1.1"/> he put the previous overhead on the projector <pause dur="0.5"/> flick back to that <pause dur="0.3"/> then in this case we was the the sort of ideal in the <trunc>n</trunc> furthest we could go <pause dur="0.2"/> quickest we could go without actually overshooting here <pause dur="0.2"/> we're actually going to go past this final value <pause dur="0.3"/> or <pause dur="0.3"/> # for language students from <pause dur="0.3"/> # the southern English <pause dur="0.3"/> past the final value <pause dur="1.1"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> the transfer function roots in this case you remember we had <pause dur="0.5"/> the first case the overdamped case the roots of the denominator <pause dur="0.5"/> were <pause dur="0.3"/> were like two <pause dur="0.2"/> different <pause dur="0.2"/> roots as it were but real <pause dur="0.2"/> roots <pause dur="0.7"/> and in the <pause dur="0.6"/> 
critically damped case <pause dur="0.3"/> the roots were in fact exactly the same <pause dur="2.6"/> and in this case <pause dur="0.3"/> for the underdamped case <pause dur="0.3"/> we've got <pause dur="0.3"/> complex conjugates <pause dur="0.2"/> we've got # <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> a real part and an imaginary part <pause dur="5.3"/> and and in this case for the underdamped response <pause dur="0.4"/> the output <pause dur="0.2"/> oscillates <pause dur="1.0"/> following a step input <pause dur="2.5"/> oscillates meaning it it goes backwards and forwards <pause dur="3.6"/> and just <pause dur="0.3"/> just to see what i'm getting at here what we're talking about here <pause dur="0.5"/> an an experiment for tonight is <pause dur="0.3"/> trying to get the <pause dur="0.2"/> key into the door of your room or house wherever you're living <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> for a <pause dur="0.3"/> an overdamped case just just go normally <pause dur="0.3"/> just go and you should be all right to go in fact that's probably critically damped isn't it just go straight to the keyhole turn the door and so on <pause dur="0.8"/> just for the purposes of experimentation <pause dur="0.2"/> have a few drinks <pause dur="0.4"/> and then try <pause dur="0.2"/> and get the key in the door <pause dur="0.2"/> and you'll find <pause dur="0.2"/> more than like well i find anyway i <trunc>don</trunc> <pause dur="0.3"/> is is that the key you'll have to sort of <trunc>j</trunc> <trunc>j</trunc> jiggle it around a bit like that <pause dur="0.3"/> and eventually you get 
the key in the door <pause dur="0.3"/> the more drinks the have <pause dur="0.2"/> you have the more jiggling around that you have to do <pause dur="0.3"/> until if you have <pause dur="0.3"/> too many i'm not suggesting you have too many but if you have too many <pause dur="0.3"/> probably goes completely unstable and you'll fall over sideways while you're trying to <vocal desc="laughter" n="ss" iterated="y" dur="1"/> get <pause dur="0.2"/> the key in the door <pause dur="0.6"/> but this one the oscillations are they're trying to to get <trunc>r</trunc> right on to the <unclear>then you over</unclear> you go past and you come you know the <pause dur="0.2"/> you know the feeling you go <pause dur="0.2"/> it's a <pause dur="0.2"/> it's a bit like my wife's driving so <pause dur="0.9"/><vocal desc="laughter" n="ss" iterated="y" dur="1"/> <vocal desc="cough" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.7"/> don't laugh it's true <trunc>unfort</trunc> <vocal desc="laugh" iterated="n"/><pause dur="1.0"/> that's another another rear reflector i shall be mending tomorrow <pause dur="1.7"/> # the amount of damping <pause dur="0.8"/> dictates <pause dur="0.3"/> how quickly these oscillations die down <pause dur="1.1"/> a lot of damping <pause dur="0.2"/> the oscillations don't hang around for very long <pause dur="3.3"/> not much damping and they stick around for quite a while <pause dur="5.7"/> and in the limits <pause dur="0.4"/> if there was no damping <pause dur="2.2"/> then <pause dur="0.3"/> it's <pause dur="0.2"/> purely <pause dur="0.2"/> it's just oscillating <pause dur="0.5"/> off it goes <pause dur="1.7"/> just oscillates <pause dur="3.6"/> and for the foreign language students <pause dur="0.3"/> very much like a Citroen Diane suspension <pause dur="1.0"/>

Skoda jokes and things like that <pause dur="0.5"/> right <pause dur="0.2"/> just to remind you we're still we're still looking at the what case are we looking at the underdamped case that's the one thanks for that <pause dur="0.4"/> and in this <pause dur="0.5"/> instance <pause dur="0.2"/> we have got <pause dur="0.3"/> complex conjugate roots <pause dur="0.2"/><vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="y" dur="1"/><pause dur="0.3"/> so the <pause dur="0.3"/> the transfer function G <pause dur="0.3"/> that relates input to output <pause dur="0.9"/> has this gain K <pause dur="0.2"/> there she is again on the top line <pause dur="0.2"/> or he again <pause dur="0.2"/> <shift feature="pitch" new="low"/> or he <shift feature="pitch" new="normal"/> again <pause dur="0.4"/> and on the <pause dur="0.3"/><shift feature="pitch" new="low"/> and on the bottom line <pause dur="0.3"/><shift feature="pitch" new="normal"/> we have <pause dur="0.6"/> S-plus-alpha-minus-J-beta <pause dur="0.9"/> bring in another Greek symbol <pause dur="0.2"/> make it more complicated <pause dur="0.6"/> for the Greek listeners this is probably all right though <pause dur="0.5"/> and and multiply by S-plus-alpha-<pause dur="0.2"/>plus-<pause dur="0.2"/>J-beta <pause dur="2.5"/> and you can see <pause dur="0.2"/> here why they use the term J <pause dur="0.3"/> and not <pause dur="0.3"/> some word like egg <pause dur="0.4"/> because if they called J egg <pause dur="0.3"/> then we'd have egg beta <pause dur="0.2"/> and that would be a bit silly <vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" n="sl" dur="4"/> <pause dur="0.4"/> see there's there's logic in these symbols you thought why they use J now you know <pause dur="0.2"/> now you know <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> so we've got complex conjugate routes <pause dur="0.2"/> i'll just <pause dur="0.2"/> just to make it look again for the language people listening in <pause dur="0.2"/> 
make it multiply things out and so on <pause dur="0.4"/> and we can also get <pause dur="0.3"/> if we multiply this stuff out to get rid of the J <pause dur="1.5"/> or egg if you like whichever the alternative <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> just i thought i'd <trunc>scramb</trunc> scramble <shift feature="voice" new="laugh"/> it up oh God <vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" dur="1"/><shift feature="voice" new="normal"/> no no no that's enough <pause dur="0.3"/> that was almost a joke there <pause dur="0.8"/> so scramble it up <pause dur="0.2"/> and this is just looking at the denominator <pause dur="0.5"/> forget K's forgotten for the moment <pause dur="1.3"/> poor girl <pause dur="1.0"/> # and if we can also if we multiply it out <pause dur="0.3"/> because this this little bit this little <pause dur="0.5"/> Frankie here <pause dur="0.2"/> is going to crop up again he's going to we're going to go through a few <unclear> and #</unclear> <pause dur="0.2"/> and whoo in it comes <pause dur="0.2"/> just to surprise us in a little bit <pause dur="0.3"/> so it's important to know where we're going <pause dur="0.2"/> S-<pause dur="0.2"/>squared plus two-alpha-S <pause dur="0.3"/> and then alpha-squared plus beta-squared so <pause dur="0.2"/> multiplying the bit alpha-plus-J-beta alpha-minus-J-beta <pause dur="0.3"/> we're just getting rid of that # complex conjugate thing <pause dur="0.3"/> or lo and behold we can even look at it in one yet one other way <pause dur="0.8"/> which is <pause dur="0.2"/> this is in fact also S-plus-alpha-<pause dur="0.3"/>all-squared <pause dur="0.7"/> plus beta-<pause dur="0.4"/>all-squared <pause dur="0.7"/><vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/><pause dur="4.0"/> A-K-A <pause dur="0.2"/> this form <pause dur="2.4"/> and 
now those astute members of you that are wide awake unlike myself <pause dur="0.2"/> will note that this S-plus-alpha-<pause dur="0.2"/>all-squared <pause dur="0.3"/> is exactly what we had <pause dur="0.2"/> for <pause dur="0.4"/> the previous case <pause dur="0.2"/> the underdamped case we had <pause dur="0.2"/> didn't we <pause dur="0.2"/> didn't we have something like that <pause dur="0.2"/> the critically damped <pause dur="0.2"/> critically damped case <pause dur="0.3"/> for the critically damped case <pause dur="0.2"/> we had two roots <pause dur="0.3"/> exactly equal <pause dur="0.4"/> we did somebody's somebody's nodding yeah we had something like that <pause dur="0.4"/> well it might not have been alpha it might have been A or something but <pause dur="0.3"/> but we did did we have alpha <pause dur="0.6"/> we did <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/><pause dur="0.3"/> the lectures actually tie together loosely <pause dur="0.5"/> so <pause dur="0.2"/> S-plus-alpha-all-squared was what we had before <pause dur="0.2"/> and now we've got this extra term the beta <pause dur="0.2"/> that's the only difference really <pause dur="0.2"/> is this extra bit which <pause dur="0.3"/> when we're factorizing it above <pause dur="0.4"/> # we can only do it in terms of the complex conjugates <pause dur="0.2"/> so that's where we are <pause dur="0.6"/> apply a unit step input <pause dur="0.3"/> this <trunc>u</trunc> here's U <pause dur="0.3"/> unit i've <pause dur="0.2"/> just to remind you it's just unit single value <pause dur="0.2"/> if it was <pause dur="0.3"/> five units then we'd just multiply the whole thing by five <pause dur="0.5"/> 
just to see what happens <pause dur="2.5"/> and the output then <pause dur="0.3"/> is just the multiple of G <pause dur="0.3"/> and U <pause dur="0.4"/> or G operating on U <pause dur="2.9"/> so we've got Y here's <pause dur="0.2"/> here's G <pause dur="0.2"/> K over <pause dur="0.4"/> S-plus-alpha-all-squared plus beta-squared <pause dur="0.8"/> and then multiplied by one-over-S the step <pause dur="0.6"/> input thing <pause dur="2.0"/> business <pause dur="2.8"/><vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/><pause dur="4.1"/> and now <pause dur="0.8"/> this is the bit <vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/> <pause dur="0.2"/> when you close your eyes and just write and hope for the best <pause dur="0.5"/> and then we'll get back to the <pause dur="0.3"/> the easier stuff <pause dur="0.6"/> you know what we did before <pause dur="0.4"/> with partial fractions and expanded out <pause dur="0.3"/> and so on and so forth <pause dur="0.9"/> you ready for this <pause dur="0.8"/> say yes <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> we're ready for it </u><pause dur="1.0"/> <u who="sm0746" trans="pause"> yes <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> we're ready for it </u> <u who="nm0724" trans="latching"> thank you very much <pause dur="0.4"/> here we go <pause dur="0.3"/> there we go <pause dur="0.4"/> i've <pause dur="0.4"/> i spent <pause dur="0.3"/> all morning working this one out <pause dur="0.2"/> before i came in </u><pause dur="0.5"/> <u who="sm0747" trans="pause"> <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/></u><u who="nm0724" trans="latching"> so that's right this is this is the one earlier <pause dur="0.5"/> and # you just need a <pause dur="0.2"/> squeezy bottle and three matchsticks <pause dur="0.5"/> and it all works out <pause dur="0.7"/> so the output <pause dur="0.3"/> is <pause dur="0.7"/> he said describing the difficult equation <pause dur="0.4"/> the output is K <pause dur="0.3"/> over alpha-squared-plus-beta-squared <pause dur="0.2"/> now all of these K alpha beta <pause dur="0.3"/> are just numbers <pause dur="0.8"/> a <pause dur="0.3"/> typical number <pause dur="0.4"/> is three <pause dur="1.3"/> so <pause dur="0.3"/> they might all be three <pause dur="0.3"/> in fact <pause dur="1.8"/>

cosines the frequency type of the the changing element <pause dur="0.3"/> and there's no alphas <pause dur="0.2"/> knocking around with the betas <pause dur="0.4"/> so the alphas and the betas are sort of # separated <pause dur="0.4"/> # and they they turned up in <pause dur="0.2"/> a different form in the <pause dur="0.4"/> the denominator <pause dur="0.3"/> and here they're having different effects in the output <pause dur="0.3"/> but <pause dur="0.4"/> can we can we see that in another way <pause dur="0.2"/> well we can this this will <pause dur="0.5"/> hopefully make it a little bit clearer <pause dur="0.4"/> the only thing <pause dur="0.4"/> i mean it may be first instance look a little bit more complicated but in fact it simplifies <pause dur="0.6"/> when we're looking at what happened <pause dur="0.4"/> this can be written by <pause dur="0.4"/> playing around with <trunc>so</trunc> sine and cosine <pause dur="0.8"/> what do they call trig identities or something like that is it <pause dur="1.2"/><vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/><pause dur="1.3"/> sounds like something out of Only Fools and Horses whatever <pause dur="2.5"/> and we've got the gain that's still there it's sort of lingering in there it is <pause dur="0.4"/> K over alpha-squared-plus-beta-squared no change there <pause dur="0.4"/> and then inside the one is still the one and all they've done is play around with these two 
terms messing around with the exponentials and the sine <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> i've cheated a little bit because <pause dur="0.4"/> there should be some sort of phase <pause dur="0.3"/> shift <pause dur="0.3"/> that appears <pause dur="0.5"/> in the <trunc>ins</trunc> it's not really just beta <pause dur="0.3"/> there should be a phase shift <pause dur="0.4"/> but i so when you look at in in years to come when you're ruminating on it with your cocoa one night <pause dur="0.4"/> and you're you're looking at this think blimey this should be a phase shift he's got it all wrong <pause dur="0.2"/> well <pause dur="0.4"/> i i'm just excluded it <pause dur="0.3"/> or <trunc>execu</trunc> got rid of it just for the purposes of going through this <pause dur="0.3"/> there is a bit of a phase shift in there <pause dur="0.3"/> but it's not really important in terms of <pause dur="0.3"/> what how we're looking at this <pause dur="0.6"/> # later on <pause dur="0.4"/><vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/> it may become important but not at this stage <pause dur="1.5"/> so we've got the gain <pause dur="0.4"/> # that that one is still there which multiplies by the gain and then we've got this time dependent thing <pause dur="0.4"/> that in here is <pause dur="0.2"/> the square root <pause dur="0.4"/> of <pause dur="0.2"/> alpha-squared-plus-beta-squared <pause dur="0.3"/> on the top <pause dur="0.4"/> divided by beta <pause dur="0.6"/> that's that which again is just a gain component just a number <pause dur="0.3"/> 
and then we've got the two terms <pause dur="0.3"/> exponential-minus-alpha-T <pause dur="0.3"/> multiplied by sine-beta-T <pause dur="0.9"/> and again the exponential has the alpha <pause dur="0.4"/> and the sine has the beta <pause dur="0.3"/> and the two things are separate <pause dur="0.4"/> so <pause dur="0.4"/> what does this all look like <pause dur="0.3"/> # well couldn't be bothered to work it out myself <pause dur="0.3"/> so i thought <pause dur="0.2"/> let you do a bit of work i thought make this an interactive lecture <pause dur="2.4"/> the steady state value <pause dur="0.5"/> # this is as time goes off to infinity <pause dur="0.7"/> again <pause dur="0.2"/> when time is B <pause dur="3.6"/> well what is it <pause dur="0.3"/> can we work it out <pause dur="0.2"/> can we see </u><pause dur="4.6"/> <u who="sm0749" trans="pause"> <gap reason="inaudible" extent="2 secs"/></u> <pause dur="0.3"/> <u who="nm0724" trans="pause"> oh you've given it away <pause dur="3.1"/> yeah <pause dur="0.3"/> if <pause dur="0.2"/> if you set <pause dur="0.7"/> T to be zero <pause dur="0.4"/> in that lot <pause dur="0.7"/> then <pause dur="0.3"/> the <trunc>overa</trunc> it doesn't really matter what the sine is doing that's going up and down as sines do <pause dur="0.5"/> but this this thing exponential of <pause dur="0.4"/> minus-infinity will be zero <pause dur="0.4"/> and that wipes the floor with anything else <pause dur="0.4"/> so # as time goes off to infinity we've got this gain <pause dur="0.3"/> multiplied by one-minus-zero <pause dur="0.4"/> and one-minus-zero is </u><pause dur="1.2"/> <u who="sm0750" trans="pause"> one </u><pause dur="0.5"/> <u who="nm0724" trans="pause"> one who said zero <pause dur="0.7"/> one <pause dur="0.2"/> yeah <pause dur="1.0"/><kinesic desc="writes on transparency" iterated="y" dur="6"/> so it's just K <pause dur="0.5"/> over alpha-squared-plus-beta-squared is the steady state value <pause dur="2.2"/> in fact <pause dur="3.3"/><kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="6"/> in fact if we 
went <pause dur="0.6"/> back <pause dur="0.8"/> just out of interest <pause dur="0.2"/> if we went back here <pause dur="0.5"/> and had a look <pause dur="0.4"/> at at this thing <pause dur="0.3"/> if # we remember with the step input <pause dur="0.2"/><vocal desc="sneeze" n="su0751" iterated="n"/> if we just bless you <pause dur="0.2"/> if we just set S to zero <pause dur="0.2"/> and multiply this thing out <pause dur="0.4"/> then which is <pause dur="0.2"/> alpha-squared-plus-beta-squared K over alpha-squared-plus-beta-squared <pause dur="0.4"/> so we we can just look at the thing in the first place <pause dur="0.3"/> and if you remember the steady state value for a step input <pause dur="0.3"/> we just set S to zero <pause dur="0.3"/> and we've got our answer and that's the same doing the same thing there <pause dur="0.5"/><kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="18"/> 
and that's what we've got <pause dur="0.3"/> K over alpha-squared-plus-beta-squared <pause dur="1.4"/> but let us this this denominator <pause dur="0.2"/> i threw in <pause dur="0.2"/> # a few minutes ago <pause dur="0.3"/> just to <pause dur="0.4"/> to add a bit of <pause dur="0.2"/> spice and <pause dur="0.2"/> <trunc>ele</trunc> <trunc>some</trunc> something there 'cause it's it's something <pause dur="0.3"/> we can sort of ask exam questions on sometimes <pause dur="0.5"/> and i want to look at it a little bit more closely <pause dur="1.7"/> so let us <pause dur="0.8"/> let us return to the denominator <pause dur="3.5"/> the denominator is the bit on the bottom <pause dur="2.6"/> you should know <pause dur="5.8"/> the numerator's the bit on the top <pause dur="1.6"/> and in the middle <shift feature="voice" new="laugh"/> well <shift feature="voice" new="normal"/><pause dur="0.2"/> keep your eyes closed <pause dur="1.4"/> you've got to draw the line somewhere there <pause dur="1.3"/> ha ha ha ha <vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" dur="1"/> <pause dur="0.7"/> so the numerator <pause dur="2.4"/> is commonly <trunc>thi</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> this is the bit on the right hand side <pause dur="0.4"/> see i <trunc>writ</trunc> i wrote the right hand side first just <pause dur="0.4"/> so you what the hell's he doing <pause dur="0.5"/> and on the right hand side this is what we had before <pause dur="0.3"/> S-squared plus two-alpha-S <pause dur="0.3"/> plus <pause dur="0.2"/> alpha-squared-plus-beta-squared that's what we had before <pause dur="0.2"/> for the denominator <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> 
well about <pause dur="0.4"/> ten lines ago <pause dur="0.3"/> was it not <pause dur="0.3"/> was it not <pause dur="2.4"/> and <pause dur="0.5"/> this is just to say that <pause dur="0.8"/> this this left hand side is how it is <pause dur="0.3"/> often written <pause dur="1.3"/> and we'll see why in a second <pause dur="0.5"/> so the S-squared <pause dur="0.4"/> has not changed it's S-squared <pause dur="0.5"/> and then we've got plus two-<pause dur="0.7"/>zeta-<pause dur="0.8"/>omega-<pause dur="0.3"/>baby-N or subscript-N-<pause dur="0.4"/>S <pause dur="0.6"/> plus omega-N-squared <pause dur="2.5"/> and again <pause dur="0.2"/> zeta <pause dur="0.2"/> we're trying to bring in <pause dur="0.2"/> people <pause dur="0.3"/> half the names that are nearly married to American film stars things like that <pause dur="0.5"/> so it sort of adds a bit of artistic licence to what we're doing <pause dur="0.6"/> so two-zeta-omega-N-S <pause dur="0.6"/> plus <pause dur="0.3"/> omega-N-squared <pause dur="0.6"/> and we can see that i mean straight even i <pause dur="0.3"/> could do this <pause dur="0.2"/> this morning <pause dur="0.3"/> with before my coffee <pause dur="0.6"/> zeta is <pause dur="0.6"/> if we just look at this we equate <pause dur="0.5"/> S-squared equals S-squared <pause dur="1.2"/> there's a profound statement <pause dur="0.5"/> and then if we equate the S terms <pause dur="0.4"/> two-zeta-omega-N <pause dur="0.5"/> is two-alpha <pause dur="1.2"/> and the twos <pause dur="0.4"/> cancel <pause dur="2.0"/> which leaves us zeta is <pause dur="1.0"/> alpha-over-omega-N <pause dur="0.2"/> if we want <pause dur="0.4"/> and also the omega-N-squared is alpha-squared-plus-beta-squared <pause dur="1.3"/> that's just so <pause dur="0.2"/> so what have we got this is where we came from 
the right hand side <pause dur="0.3"/> and all i'm saying here is well <pause dur="0.4"/> you know if you go out in the big world the wide boys down Oxford Street <pause dur="0.2"/> they wouldn't talk in terms of alphas and betas <pause dur="0.3"/> they would talk in terms of zetas and omega-Ns <pause dur="1.0"/> well they maybe wouldn't <pause dur="0.2"/> even talk like that <pause dur="0.2"/> but that that's the the common terminology is that one <pause dur="0.5"/> and as we can see <pause dur="0.2"/> let us let us look <pause dur="0.3"/> at extremes let us look at extreme cases <pause dur="0.4"/> what for instance <pause dur="0.3"/> happens <pause dur="0.2"/> when beta <pause dur="0.6"/> tends to zero <pause dur="1.3"/> what goes down what happens <pause dur="2.6"/> and it's # <pause dur="0.3"/> it's intriguing really isn't it when beta goes to zero <pause dur="0.3"/> 'cause as beta goes to zero <pause dur="0.7"/> if you're looking at at this side here <pause dur="0.7"/> we're we're back to the critically damped <pause dur="0.3"/> case <pause dur="0.4"/> when beta heads off as beta gets to zero we're back to the critically damped case <pause dur="0.5"/> # the roots are just <pause dur="0.5"/> S-plus-alpha-<pause dur="0.6"/>squared <pause dur="0.5"/> all-squared <pause dur="2.4"/> just like what <pause dur="0.3"/> they were <pause dur="0.2"/> sort of thing before <pause dur="13.0"/> and and now for the <pause dur="0.2"/> the foreign listeners sorry <pause dur="0.2"/> <distinct lang="fr">maintenant</distinct> <pause dur="0.4"/> # <distinct lang="fr"> nous</distinct> <pause dur="0.3"/> will set zeta <pause dur="0.6"/> to <distinct lang="fr">un</distinct> <pause dur="0.5"/><vocal desc="laughter" n="sl" iterated="y" dur="4"/> <pause dur="2.8"/> and there it is <pause dur="1.1"/> <shift feature="voice" new="mimicking French accent"/><distinct lang="fr">le </distinct> damping ratio <shift feature="voice" new="normal"/><pause dur="1.0"/> <vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" dur="1"/> <pause dur="0.3"/> so zeta 
zeta is actually known <pause dur="0.8"/> A-K-A <pause dur="0.3"/> the damping ratio <pause dur="0.9"/> and is as we set it to one <pause dur="1.1"/> it's it's all the same thing here <pause dur="0.2"/> if you look here <pause dur="1.4"/> it's all magic <pause dur="0.3"/> beta goes to zero <pause dur="0.2"/> so omega <pause dur="0.3"/> tends to alpha <pause dur="0.6"/> and as omega tends to alpha so zeta <pause dur="0.2"/> alpha-over-alpha <pause dur="0.6"/> is one <pause dur="1.2"/> here so <pause dur="0.2"/> just just from these equations <pause dur="0.2"/> beta to zero <pause dur="0.6"/> omega <pause dur="0.2"/> becomes alpha <pause dur="0.2"/> effectively <pause dur="0.6"/> alpha-over-alpha <pause dur="0.4"/> is just is one <pause dur="0.3"/> so zeta tends to one <pause dur="0.3"/> so this thing <pause dur="0.2"/> the damped zeta is known as a damping ratio <pause dur="0.3"/> and as beta goes to zero <pause dur="0.4"/> zeta the damping ratio goes to <pause dur="0.3"/> to a value of one <pause dur="1.4"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> the other and and really what beta <pause dur="0.5"/> was linked <pause dur="0.2"/> to the sine term <pause dur="0.3"/> the sine term going # really the oscillations <pause dur="0.4"/> so what this is saying effectively <pause dur="0.3"/> is as the oscillations die down <pause dur="0.2"/> as beta goes to zero the frequency of oscillations dies down and so on <pause dur="0.4"/> the damping ratio tends to one <pause dur="0.3"/> and we tend to the critically damped case where we don't have oscillation <pause dur="0.5"/> so it all sort of ties together really <pause dur="1.1"/> the # another extreme as alpha <pause dur="0.4"/> tends to zero <pause dur="9.5"/> then <pause dur="1.3"/> we can see see from here as 
alpha's zero then omega-N <pause dur="0.5"/> becomes beta <pause dur="0.3"/> or omega-N-squared is beta-squared <pause dur="2.0"/> and this omega-N <pause dur="0.3"/> which is why we've got this subscript-N <pause dur="0.8"/> is also known as the natural frequency <pause dur="8.2"/> and for this <pause dur="0.2"/> for this reason effectively <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="2.3"/> as beta goes to zero <pause dur="0.4"/> # as alpha goes to zero omega-N <pause dur="0.2"/> tends to <pause dur="0.2"/> to beta <pause dur="0.3"/> becomes <pause dur="0.2"/> beta <pause dur="0.5"/> and <pause dur="0.3"/> # with alpha being zero it means zeta <pause dur="0.5"/> is zero <pause dur="0.9"/> so and zeta being zero we've got no damping <pause dur="0.3"/> we've we've gone in the direction of the <pause dur="0.3"/> pure <pause dur="0.3"/> oscillations <pause dur="1.3"/> we we switch the thing on <pause dur="0.3"/> and it just oscillates it's a pure oscillator <pause dur="2.2"/> it just goes up and down up and down up and down <pause dur="0.2"/> never gets exhausted never gets tired <pause dur="2.0"/> never dies down <pause dur="0.2"/> just keeps going <pause dur="3.3"/> it's a bit like Bolton Wanderers <pause dur="0.2"/> really <pause dur="0.2"/> just keep going up and down <pause dur="0.4"/> never <pause dur="1.0"/> never settle down <pause dur="1.1"/> and # </u><u who="sm0752" trans="overlap"> <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/></u><pause dur="0.6"/> <u who="nm0724" trans="pause"> pardon <pause dur="1.8"/> oh <pause dur="0.2"/> <vocal desc="laugh" iterated="n"/> <pause dur="0.3"/> you're not a Bolton fan are you <pause dur="1.3"/> sorry about that i didn't <pause dur="1.0"/><vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/> as opposed to <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> which is just going down and down so <pause dur="3.0"/> and so for the underdamped case this is the whole <sic corr="caboodle">skaboodle</sic> <pause dur="0.7"/> this term zeta <pause dur="0.8"/> will <pause dur="0.4"/> go from zero <pause dur="1.0"/> in the case 
when there's no damping we've just got pure oscillations <pause dur="0.4"/> to one <pause dur="0.3"/> in the case where we were at before <pause dur="0.2"/> the critically damped case <pause dur="0.7"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> realistically as the term zeta <pause dur="0.4"/> tends towards zero so the oscillations get bigger there's more of them <pause dur="0.4"/> as zeta gets <trunc>w</trunc> towards one <pause dur="0.5"/> then the oscillations get smaller <pause dur="0.3"/> so so <pause dur="0.2"/> zeta is just a <pause dur="0.3"/> a knob that you can twiddle <pause dur="0.2"/> effectively <pause dur="0.3"/> and between zero and one <pause dur="0.3"/> and as you twiddle it <pause dur="0.4"/> so oscillations get bigger or smaller <pause dur="1.3"/> just just to conclude this and then we'll have a <pause dur="0.5"/> # a breather <pause dur="2.3"/> it's really bringing things together the extremes <pause dur="0.2"/> when zeta is one <pause dur="0.2"/> we've got the case of critical damping <pause dur="0.2"/> that's <pause dur="0.5"/> i know you all know that but i thought i'd write it down just for the sake of completeness <pause dur="0.7"/> and in fact <pause dur="0.3"/> when zeta <pause dur="0.3"/> is greater than one <pause dur="0.6"/> it's not really 
what we're looking at but when it's greater than one <pause dur="0.3"/> we're off back to the overdamped case <pause dur="14.1"/> and <pause dur="0.7"/> again the extremes the other point was when <pause dur="0.4"/> zeta is zero <pause dur="1.1"/> that's these <pause dur="0.2"/> there's natural frequency <pause dur="0.4"/> oscillations omega-N <pause dur="0.3"/> and they just go on forever and ever and ever and <pause dur="0.7"/> don't die down <pause dur="12.4"/> and i think at this juncture <pause dur="0.9"/> how's about we have <pause dur="0.2"/> 'cause # this is a double header this morning for me isn't it <pause dur="0.5"/> i think </u><pause dur="0.4"/> <u who="sm0753" trans="pause"> yeah </u><pause dur="0.3"/> <u who="nm0724" trans="pause"> hopefully yeah <pause dur="0.4"/> i'm glad you're giving me support in that yeah <pause dur="0.6"/> so # <pause dur="0.3"/> maybe # as i fancy making myself a cup of coffee <pause dur="0.3"/> if we said five past <pause dur="0.7"/> is that all right five past and we'll get going <pause dur="0.4"/> and we'll get this wrapped up <pause dur="0.3"/> so i'll see you all then have a wonderful time <pause dur="0.3"/> in the fifteen minute break <pause dur="0.5"/> or fourteen minutes </u></body> </text></TEI.2>
