<u who="nm0692"> right well yesterday i was # <pause dur="0.5"/> talking about the <pause dur="2.2"/><kinesic desc="puts on transparency" iterated="n"/> idea of a track <pause dur="0.3"/> in <pause dur="0.2"/> radiation chemistry <pause dur="0.4"/> where <pause dur="0.3"/> as the particle moves along <pause dur="0.6"/> it's losing energy we know it loses energy at a great rate we know the energy of the particle <pause dur="0.4"/> we know the range of the particle <pause dur="0.8"/> what happens to this energy how does it get transmitted to the medium <pause dur="0.5"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> this <pause dur="0.2"/> gave an indication <pause dur="0.3"/> that the principal <pause dur="0.2"/> acts of energy deposition <pause dur="0.4"/> are in the form of ionization <pause dur="0.4"/> and also <pause dur="0.2"/> <trunc>o</trunc> of excitation as well <pause dur="0.2"/> that that's <pause dur="0.2"/> an overall picture <pause dur="0.6"/><kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="16"/> now <pause dur="0.4"/> that being the case you might say well <pause dur="0.2"/> all right you've got ions in excited states <pause dur="0.3"/> or so you say <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> what happens immediately after <pause dur="0.4"/> this <pause dur="0.4"/> event has occurred <pause dur="0.6"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> i suppose <pause dur="0.4"/> the first thing that happens <pause dur="0.5"/> is that the electrons <pause dur="0.7"/> which are formed <pause dur="0.6"/> in the ionization act <pause dur="0.4"/> these are very small <pause dur="0.4"/> and they're very mobile <pause dur="1.4"/> and they're certainly very small compared with the <pause dur="0.2"/> cations that are formed 'cause those are going to be molecular size <pause dur="0.4"/> so the electrons tend to diffuse away very rapidly <pause dur="0.5"/> simply because they 
are so small <pause dur="0.6"/> and # <pause dur="1.4"/> they have a a very high mobility <pause dur="0.9"/><kinesic desc="reveals covered part of transparency" iterated="n"/> what about the # <pause dur="1.0"/> the cations that are formed <pause dur="0.4"/> well if you just consider a general i put R-H-plus but it could be anything <pause dur="0.4"/> but suppose it was i don't know hexane or something <pause dur="0.4"/> then <pause dur="0.2"/> the <pause dur="0.7"/> cation radical <pause dur="0.4"/> which is the thing you get by taking the electron out of the molecule <pause dur="1.0"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> will <pause dur="1.4"/> react with electrons that are <pause dur="0.2"/> are nearby the ones that haven't got away so to speak <pause dur="0.4"/> and you get a certain amount of ion recombination <pause dur="0.7"/> and when this electron returns to that cation <pause dur="0.5"/> it's very likely <pause dur="0.4"/> to form it in an excited state <pause dur="0.2"/> so you can get additional excited states <pause dur="0.2"/> from <pause dur="0.3"/> from ion recombination <pause dur="1.4"/><kinesic desc="reveals covered part of transparency" iterated="n"/> but also what can happen <pause dur="0.9"/> is that the R-H-plus the cation radical <pause dur="0.7"/> # is a very powerful proton donor <pause dur="0.7"/> and it will give a proton to almost anything in sight <pause dur="0.7"/> # and so <pause dur="0.3"/> this will tend to happen <pause dur="0.4"/> and perhaps the best known example of this is if you imagine <pause dur="0.3"/> R-H-plus is <pause dur="0.5"/> H-two-O-plus <pause dur="0.6"/> the water cation <pause dur="0.4"/> then <pause dur="0.2"/> that will give away a proton to a nearby water molecule <pause dur="0.4"/> 
to give H-three-O-plus <pause dur="1.0"/> and you're left with O-H behind <pause dur="2.2"/> so you do get these # <pause dur="1.6"/> proton transfers occurring <pause dur="1.3"/> how many ions do we get <pause dur="1.6"/> how do you measure the efficiency of a radiation chemistry <pause dur="1.0"/> process <pause dur="0.6"/> well in photochemistry it was very easy because you had the idea of a photon <pause dur="1.0"/> and the photon <pause dur="0.7"/> entered a molecule <pause dur="1.0"/> and so much no <trunc>s</trunc> a certain percentage of the molecule was converted <pause dur="0.7"/> to a product <pause dur="0.4"/> and you had the idea of a quantum yield <pause dur="0.4"/> the idea that you could destroy <pause dur="0.5"/> such a percentage of molecules <pause dur="0.7"/> you would form such a percentage of product molecules <pause dur="0.4"/> and you had a quantum yield for this and this was always less than one <pause dur="0.5"/> unless you had a chain reaction <pause dur="0.4"/> so it's a very very clear idea <pause dur="0.6"/> but with a gamma ray quantum i the point i was trying to make yesterday it's completely different <pause dur="0.4"/> because the gamma ray quantum <pause dur="0.4"/> has got enormous amounts of energy <pause dur="0.7"/> and <pause dur="0.8"/> or the alpha particle has <pause dur="0.4"/> and you don't have the notion <pause dur="0.3"/> of just one molecule <trunc>be</trunc> <trunc>be</trunc> being converted by one 
quantum <pause dur="0.6"/> you've got the <trunc>n</trunc> the idea of along the track <pause dur="0.2"/> hundreds of thousands of molecules being converted <pause dur="0.6"/> so how do we cope with this idea <pause dur="0.5"/> well we cope with it <kinesic desc="reveals covered part of transparency" iterated="n"/> by saying <pause dur="1.3"/> how many molecules <pause dur="0.2"/> how or how many ions do we get <pause dur="0.7"/> for a certain amount of energy deposited <pause dur="0.7"/> and there is a definition of a thing called a G value <pause dur="0.8"/> and the G value <pause dur="0.6"/><kinesic desc="reveals covered part of transparency" iterated="n"/> which is a measure of the product yield or indeed the <trunc>react</trunc> the <pause dur="0.2"/> destruction of the reactant 'cause # that would be then the negative G value but <pause dur="0.5"/> they normally normally you look at products to measure positive G values <pause dur="1.0"/><kinesic desc="reveals covered part of transparency" iterated="n"/> they are the number of molecules <pause dur="0.2"/> formed <pause dur="0.3"/> or destroyed <pause dur="0.5"/> for every hundred electron volts <pause dur="2.7"/> and so you if you think about it a hundred electron volts <pause dur="1.5"/> ionization of a typical organic is about ten eleven or twelve let's so say ten for the sake of argument <pause dur="0.6"/> then <pause dur="0.5"/> you would say well if we got ten <pause dur="0.6"/> <trunc>prod</trunc> if we got ten ions <pause dur="0.5"/> that would be <pause dur="0.2"/> a hundred per cent efficient <pause dur="1.2"/> but in fact you don't get ten ions <pause dur="0.3"/> you get typically <pause dur="0.4"/> two or three ions <pause dur="0.6"/> maybe 
slightly more than three sometimes but not much more than three <pause dur="0.7"/> and so the ionization efficiency <pause dur="0.8"/> is not enormously high <pause dur="1.4"/> but of course <pause dur="1.4"/> you also get the excited states as well <pause dur="0.7"/> and so if you're at the excited state yield which is also often about two or three <pause dur="0.5"/> but well for some systems <pause dur="0.9"/> you're using about fifty per cent of the of the <trunc>ou</trunc> energy <pause dur="1.0"/> chemically productively <pause dur="0.4"/> what happens to the rest <pause dur="0.5"/> well the rest <pause dur="0.3"/> you get ion recombination the ions don't escape at all they they <trunc>si</trunc> they're formed and they recombine instantly <pause dur="0.2"/> don't measure them <pause dur="0.3"/> 'cause they're not around to be measured any more <pause dur="1.8"/> under those conditions <pause dur="1.7"/> you simply end up by getting excited states <pause dur="0.4"/> and some of these simply end up by heating up the medium <pause dur="0.3"/> so you you you actually simply do a lot of vibration excitation of the medium <pause dur="0.3"/> so the medium will become warm <pause dur="0.3"/> as you put radiation through it <pause dur="1.1"/> so <pause dur="0.3"/> the energy is partitioned between ionization events <pause dur="0.4"/> excitation events <pause dur="0.3"/> and merely thermal warming <pause dur="0.8"/><kinesic desc="reveals covered part of transparency" iterated="n"/> and this <pause dur="0.2"/> G value <pause dur="0.6"/> as i've <pause dur="0.2"/> put down 
there is the analogue of the quantum yield <pause dur="0.2"/> it's not as precise in a way <pause dur="0.4"/> you can't picture it as as nicely <pause dur="0.7"/> but you've got to start from somewhere <pause dur="0.4"/> and you say well if i've got a million electron volts <pause dur="0.3"/> how <trunc>m</trunc> what do i get for each hundred electron volts that i deposit in the medium <pause dur="0.5"/> and so that is your <pause dur="0.2"/> fundamental parameter the G value <pause dur="0.3"/> and whenever you're discussing radiation chemistry of anything <pause dur="0.4"/> you begin <pause dur="0.3"/><event desc="takes off transparency" iterated="n"/> by saying well what is what is its G value <pause dur="0.3"/> is it # <pause dur="1.0"/> one or <pause dur="1.0"/> three or five or <pause dur="0.4"/> and if it's a lot more <pause dur="0.3"/> than <pause dur="0.6"/> than ten or if it becomes hundreds again it's a you got a chain reaction <pause dur="0.4"/> running away <pause dur="1.3"/> now <pause dur="1.6"/> let's think about some of the # <pause dur="1.9"/><gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> experiments <pause dur="0.2"/> to get some idea of what these G values are <pause dur="0.4"/> the very simplest experiment you can do <pause dur="0.3"/> is using an ionization chamber and i'll draw one of these <kinesic desc="writes on transparency" iterated="y" dur="16"/> it's a very simple idea <pause dur="0.7"/> if you imagine you've got a glass vessel <pause dur="0.8"/> with two electrodes in <pause dur="1.1"/> you got a you apply a voltage <pause dur="0.4"/> that's voltage there <pause dur="1.1"/> and you have an ammeter for measuring current <pause dur="0.4"/> there <pause dur="2.5"/> now <pause dur="0.6"/> normally of 
course <pause dur="1.6"/> if you have that <pause dur="0.2"/> globe filled with <pause dur="0.5"/> argon <pause dur="0.3"/> or helium <pause dur="0.7"/> or <pause dur="0.5"/> hexane vapour or something propane <pause dur="1.0"/> if you apply a voltage <pause dur="1.0"/> that's not enormous <pause dur="1.2"/> then there's no current <pause dur="0.8"/> because the gases are insulating <pause dur="0.6"/> i know if you take it to a very very high voltage you should get diametric breakdown <pause dur="0.3"/> we're not thinking about that at all <pause dur="0.4"/> we're thinking of quite low voltages <pause dur="0.3"/> get no current <pause dur="0.5"/> but if you bring up <pause dur="0.9"/> a <pause dur="0.4"/> other a radioisotope <pause dur="0.4"/> to the outside <pause dur="0.4"/><kinesic desc="writes on transparency" iterated="y" dur="1"/><kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> there <pause dur="0.3"/> close to the glass <pause dur="0.4"/> vessel so if we have isotope <pause dur="3.0"/><kinesic desc="writes on transparency" iterated="y" dur="7"/> this is giving out <pause dur="0.7"/> radiation <pause dur="1.0"/> like so <pause dur="0.8"/> or you could fire a very very fast electron beam <pause dur="0.7"/> into the globe <pause dur="1.6"/> if you're still applying the voltage <pause dur="1.5"/> you don't get a current <pause dur="0.6"/> I <pause dur="0.4"/> becomes greater than nought <pause dur="0.6"/><kinesic desc="writes on transparency" iterated="y" dur="13"/> with radiation <pause dur="4.1"/> I <pause dur="0.5"/> becomes greater than zero <pause dur="1.1"/> without radiation <pause dur="2.2"/> I <pause dur="0.3"/> equals zero <pause dur="0.7"/> so clearly the radiation is producing ions in the gas <pause dur="1.1"/> and you know they're there <pause dur="0.8"/> because the whole thing is carrying a current <pause dur="0.5"/> once you apply a voltage <pause dur="1.1"/> positive ions are moving to one electrode <pause dur="0.6"/> negative ions are moving 
to another <pause dur="0.7"/> so immediately we know <pause dur="0.6"/> that <pause dur="0.3"/> the application <pause dur="0.8"/> of ionizing radiation to a gas <pause dur="0.6"/> produces ions <pause dur="0.7"/> and you might say well <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="1.5"/> what sort of <pause dur="0.4"/> yields do we get <pause dur="0.7"/> from gases <pause dur="0.7"/> and maybe from liquids <pause dur="0.4"/> well from gases <pause dur="0.6"/><kinesic desc="writes on transparency" iterated="y" dur="6"/> the <pause dur="0.2"/> ion yield is <pause dur="0.2"/> sort of <pause dur="0.5"/> reasonable it's <pause dur="0.2"/> say <pause dur="0.2"/> one <pause dur="0.6"/> to three <pause dur="0.3"/> depends on the gas <pause dur="0.5"/><kinesic desc="writes on transparency" iterated="y" dur="3"/> for liquids <pause dur="1.6"/> interestingly if you if you fill that globe with <pause dur="0.2"/> liquid hexane or liquid benzene <pause dur="0.8"/><kinesic desc="writes on transparency" iterated="y" dur="1"/> G liquid it's nought-point-one <pause dur="1.6"/> now why should that be <pause dur="0.7"/> well the answer again if we go back to photochemistry <pause dur="3.7"/> a lot of <pause dur="1.0"/> photochemical acts <pause dur="0.6"/> give you <pause dur="0.7"/> two species formed very close to each other <pause dur="2.2"/> if they <pause dur="0.8"/> can get away from each other <pause dur="0.4"/> you get products <pause dur="1.0"/> but if they <pause dur="0.8"/> are forced <pause dur="0.2"/> by being surrounded by solvent <pause dur="1.0"/> back onto each other <pause dur="0.4"/> they recombine <pause dur="0.7"/> and so what's happening in the liquid <pause dur="0.3"/> is if you <kinesic desc="writes on transparency" iterated="y" dur="16"/> get <pause dur="0.9"/> a positive charge and a <trunc>neg</trunc> negative charge formed <pause dur="0.4"/> and these are surrounded <pause dur="2.7"/> by solvent molecules <pause dur="3.4"/> like so <pause dur="0.4"/> and this of course is a positive solvent molecule and that's a <pause dur="0.3"/> either a negative solvent molecule or an electron <pause dur="0.5"/> 
the thing is trapped <pause dur="0.6"/> and you've got <kinesic desc="writes on transparency" iterated="y" dur="8"/> basically what's called a cage effect the thing is trapped <pause dur="1.3"/> in a solvent so i'll say solvent cage effect <pause dur="0.7"/> that's very important in photochemistry <pause dur="1.7"/> it's very important in radiation chemistry as well <pause dur="0.7"/> so <pause dur="0.3"/> in liquids <pause dur="0.4"/> you've got the solvent cage effect operating <pause dur="0.4"/> in a gas phase you haven't once the ions are formed zoom <pause dur="0.5"/> they they go charging off towards the electrodes <pause dur="0.2"/> so there's quite a difference there <pause dur="0.7"/> so <pause dur="0.7"/> that was the <trunc>f</trunc> the first indication <pause dur="0.3"/> that you were getting ionization <pause dur="0.8"/> in the gases <pause dur="0.2"/> to quite high yields <pause dur="0.4"/> but in the liquids <pause dur="0.9"/> to very low yields <pause dur="0.2"/> and for a long time <pause dur="0.2"/><kinesic desc="writes on transparency" iterated="y" dur="1"/> that experiment <pause dur="0.9"/> convinced everybody <pause dur="0.7"/> that ionization <pause dur="0.7"/> was not important in liquids <pause dur="1.6"/> not at all <pause dur="0.7"/> because <pause dur="0.6"/> the conductivity experiments indicated the yields are very low <pause dur="1.0"/> and that that sort of held <pause dur="0.4"/> sway for a long time <pause dur="0.7"/> but then there were some <pause dur="0.3"/> very clever experiments <pause dur="0.4"/> that were done <pause dur="0.4"/> by a chap <pause dur="0.4"/> called Hamill <pause dur="0.7"/><kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="18"/> and i'll <pause dur="0.8"/> as i've got these on a <pause dur="0.5"/> a slide i'll put the slide on <pause dur="2.7"/> and it goes as follows <pause dur="6.4"/> Hamill worked <pause dur="1.5"/> 
with <pause dur="1.0"/> solutions <pause dur="0.6"/> they were quite dilute say a millimolar <pause dur="0.8"/> of things like naphthalene and biphenyl <pause dur="0.3"/> and he worked with lots of other ones as well but they're just examples <pause dur="0.6"/> in <pause dur="0.2"/> what are called glass glassy forming solvents or <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> glass forming solvents <pause dur="1.4"/> there were quite a few of these around i mentioned them in the photochemistry section of the course these are solvents that <kinesic desc="reveals covered part of transparency" iterated="n"/> when you freeze them down <pause dur="1.4"/> they give a perfect glass they don't crystallize <pause dur="1.3"/> they've got an irregular structure <pause dur="0.4"/> you've got the methyl group here <pause dur="0.4"/> tetrahydrofuran <pause dur="0.5"/> crystallizes when you freeze it <pause dur="0.2"/> in liquid nitrogen <pause dur="0.5"/> methyltetrahydrofuran is less symmetrical <pause dur="0.4"/> and it forms a glass <pause dur="1.6"/> pentane <pause dur="0.2"/> will crystallize if you freeze it <pause dur="0.3"/> you put a methyl group on get three-methylpentane <pause dur="1.4"/> it gives a perfect glass <pause dur="0.6"/> and if you've got a perfect glass <pause dur="0.7"/> it means you can freeze the thing in a cell a caught cell <pause dur="0.6"/> and then run an optical spectrum <pause dur="0.7"/> at liquid nitrogen temperature <pause dur="0.9"/> in an ordinary spectrophotometer <pause dur="1.8"/> and <pause dur="0.3"/> what did 
Hamill do <pause dur="0.4"/> well <pause dur="0.5"/> he rotated these solutions in these glassy forming solvents and then ran U-V spectra <pause dur="0.8"/><kinesic desc="reveals covered part of transparency" iterated="n"/> and for example <pause dur="2.2"/> if you # <pause dur="0.6"/> take <pause dur="1.2"/> naphthalene <pause dur="1.4"/> C-ten-H-eight <pause dur="0.8"/> this is <trunc>co</trunc> naphthalene's colourless <pause dur="0.8"/> dissolve it up in T-H-F or three-methyl-pentane <pause dur="0.4"/> if you gamma irradiate it <pause dur="1.2"/> the thing goes deep green <pause dur="0.3"/> it <trunc>s</trunc> it goes a deep green colour it's quite a spectacular experiment to do it's a nice demonstration but of course it's <pause dur="0.3"/> not easy to do 'cause you'd need <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.8"/> # a gamma source to do it <pause dur="0.2"/> and we we don't have one here <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="1.6"/> to get deep green colour <pause dur="0.6"/> this is this has got a it's quite a structured spectrum it's not just a broad band <pause dur="0.4"/> and it's exactly the same spectrum as <kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> this thing <pause dur="0.7"/> in other words if you take a sodium film <pause dur="0.3"/> a film of <trunc>so</trunc> if you purify sodium <pause dur="0.7"/> in fact you heat it up and evaporate it <pause dur="0.4"/> and then could allow the sodium vapour to get to get condense on glass <pause dur="0.3"/> you get <pause dur="0.6"/> a <pause dur="0.2"/> mirror <pause dur="0.3"/> formed <pause dur="0.2"/> a silver mirror <pause dur="0.4"/> of sodium <pause dur="0.8"/> if you take that silver mirror of sodium which is very very pure <pause dur="0.9"/> and you react it <pause dur="0.5"/> 
with <pause dur="1.1"/> a dilute solution of naphthalene <pause dur="0.2"/> in an ether <pause dur="0.7"/> you end up by getting a deep green solution <pause dur="0.6"/> and this is sodium-plus <pause dur="0.3"/> <trunc>C-ten-H-et</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> H-eight-<pause dur="0.3"/>minus <pause dur="0.2"/> with a free radical symbol <pause dur="0.3"/> # it's a free radical <pause dur="0.5"/> and it's it's strongly paramagnetic <pause dur="0.3"/> and it shows an E-S-R spectrum quite a complex one <pause dur="0.4"/> but it can be perfectly analysed in terms of # <pause dur="0.4"/> in terms of naphthalene <pause dur="0.5"/> so <pause dur="2.5"/> you've got this formed <pause dur="0.3"/> now we know <pause dur="0.3"/> the extinction coefficient <pause dur="0.3"/> of this <pause dur="0.7"/> thing <pause dur="0.2"/> because we can <pause dur="0.5"/> measure <pause dur="0.7"/> how much sodium has been consumed or <pause dur="0.5"/> we can indeed # <pause dur="1.8"/> # <pause dur="1.0"/> we can quantitate it reasonably well <pause dur="1.0"/> and so if we know the extinction of the <pause dur="0.4"/><kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> of this we can work out the yield <pause dur="0.5"/> of these <pause dur="1.1"/> <trunc>cat</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> anions <pause dur="0.3"/> which are formed in the glass <pause dur="0.8"/><kinesic desc="reveals covered part of transparency" iterated="n"/> and if you work it out <pause dur="0.6"/> it comes out to be about two <pause dur="0.5"/> for hydrocarbons <pause dur="0.3"/> and three <pause dur="0.3"/> for alcohols and ethers <pause dur="0.6"/> and this <unclear>retracts from all</unclear> people's thinking because <pause dur="0.3"/> what it meant was <pause dur="0.3"/> that if you <pause dur="0.2"/> operate at low temperature <pause dur="1.9"/> where everything was frozen down <pause dur="1.6"/> and you gamma irradiate it <pause dur="1.1"/> the electrons <pause dur="0.8"/> formed <pause dur="0.5"/> by attacking <pause dur="0.6"/> the 
solvent <pause dur="0.5"/> migrated through the medium <pause dur="0.4"/> and ended up <pause dur="0.8"/> on the naphthalene <pause dur="1.1"/> now this is quite this is a very important idea here <pause dur="0.2"/> which i which i i i want to stress so i'll i'll <trunc>th</trunc> i'll go on about it a bit <pause dur="1.1"/> when you do photochemical excitation <pause dur="0.6"/> you match <pause dur="0.3"/> the quantum <pause dur="0.9"/> of the light <pause dur="1.7"/> to the energy level <pause dur="0.2"/> of the solute <pause dur="1.2"/> okay <pause dur="0.4"/> you have a solvent and a solute <pause dur="0.6"/> the solvent normally doesn't absorb any light <pause dur="0.3"/> you're looking at the solute <pause dur="0.3"/> and that <pause dur="0.4"/> has <trunc>spectra</trunc> spectral levels <pause dur="0.5"/> that correspond to the irradiation wavelength in other words you're <pause dur="0.3"/> pumping a particular state within the solute molecule <pause dur="0.8"/> that's photochemistry <pause dur="0.6"/> in radiation chemistry it's completely different <pause dur="1.0"/> as the <pause dur="1.3"/> gamma ray traverses a medium or the alpha particle whatever it is <pause dur="1.0"/> it <pause dur="0.3"/> interacts with the solvent <pause dur="0.4"/> and it ionizes the solvent <pause dur="1.6"/> you might say what happens to the solute <pause dur="0.3"/> does it ionize that as well <pause dur="0.7"/> well <pause dur="0.3"/> it's purely statistical <pause dur="0.7"/> it will <pause dur="0.5"/> excite electrons in whatever it's passing by <pause dur="1.9"/> and of course statistically <pause dur="1.4"/> if you take something like 
methanol or pentane <pause dur="0.6"/> then take a litre of that and work out how many <trunc>m</trunc> how many moles there are in liquid pentane <pause dur="1.0"/> it's about ten molar <pause dur="0.4"/> liquid pentane <pause dur="0.2"/> is about ten moles per litre <pause dur="0.8"/> the naphthalene is ten-to-the-minus-three <pause dur="0.4"/> so it's a a ten-thousandfold excess of the solvent <pause dur="0.7"/> and so ninety-nine-<pause dur="0.7"/>point-nine-nine per cent <pause dur="0.3"/> of all the energy <pause dur="1.1"/> goes into the solvent <pause dur="0.3"/> and nought-point-nought-one per cent goes into solute <pause dur="0.4"/> so <pause dur="0.2"/> all of the <pause dur="0.5"/> reactions shown by the solute <pause dur="1.7"/> reflect what's happened to the solvent <pause dur="1.6"/> and with this solute <pause dur="0.2"/> it's picking up the electrons that have been formed in the solvent <pause dur="0.6"/> they've moved through this medium at low temperature <pause dur="0.5"/> and they've <trunc>al</trunc> alighted <pause dur="0.3"/> and been trapped <pause dur="0.7"/><vocal desc="cough" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.2"/> on the solute to give this green colour <pause dur="1.3"/> and <pause dur="0.8"/> this process of having a very small amount of something there <pause dur="0.8"/> that captures <pause dur="1.0"/> the negative charge in the system <pause dur="0.9"/> so you can then look at it optically <pause dur="1.0"/> that's called a scavenger <pause dur="0.4"/> okay <pause dur="0.4"/> so it's playing the role <pause dur="0.5"/><kinesic desc="writes on transparency" iterated="y" dur="15"/> of a scavenger <pause dur="1.4"/> i'll i've actually writing on the glass at 
the moment so i'll <pause dur="0.5"/> get back onto the <pause dur="2.8"/> so the naphthalene <pause dur="0.4"/> is <pause dur="0.2"/> C-ten-H-eight <pause dur="1.0"/> acts <pause dur="1.0"/> as <pause dur="0.5"/> a scavenger <pause dur="2.5"/> and the <pause dur="0.7"/> this was a <pause dur="0.8"/> the key <pause dur="0.2"/> to <pause dur="1.3"/> getting a much better understanding what was going on <pause dur="0.4"/> so we now know that in the solid organic matrices <pause dur="0.4"/> you know frozen down <pause dur="0.5"/> we had high ion yields <pause dur="1.5"/> and that result <pause dur="0.2"/> is complete opposite <pause dur="0.4"/> to the one we got <pause dur="0.5"/> using the conductivity cell <pause dur="0.7"/> and in the conductivity cell it's almost what's happening properly there <pause dur="0.6"/> is that # <pause dur="0.4"/> you're <trunc>simp</trunc> <trunc>is</trunc> you're simply <pause dur="0.7"/> not you haven't got a very efficient means of <trunc>g</trunc> of <pause dur="0.2"/> gathering the charge <pause dur="0.5"/><kinesic desc="reveals covered part of transparency" iterated="n"/> here <pause dur="0.5"/> you've got these solute molecules spread right through the system and they <trunc>c</trunc> they captured electrons before they can <pause dur="0.4"/> find positive ions to <pause dur="0.7"/> collide with <pause dur="0.5"/> or even destroy each other which # is <trunc>i</trunc> you know <pause dur="0.2"/> can also happen <pause dur="0.7"/> and there is such a reaction which i'll <pause dur="0.3"/> perhaps i'll talk about later <pause dur="1.0"/> well that was a position in <pause dur="0.6"/> frozen matrices <pause dur="0.4"/> and a question then arose <pause dur="0.3"/> well <pause dur="0.3"/> oh that's fine for frozen matrices <pause dur="0.8"/> what about liquids <pause dur="0.7"/> well <pause dur="1.1"/> the answer 
to that <kinesic desc="reveals covered part of transparency" iterated="n"/> came when people developed a technique called pulse radiolysis <pause dur="1.3"/> we talked about flash photolysis before that's where you take <pause dur="0.5"/> a flash lamp <pause dur="0.8"/> or a laser that's pulsed <pause dur="0.4"/> and you administer <pause dur="0.2"/> a flash of light or a pulse of light from the laser <pause dur="0.4"/> to the sample <pause dur="0.5"/> and you look <pause dur="1.9"/> spectroscopically on a very short time base nanoseconds or even shorter than nanoseconds as to what's going on <pause dur="0.9"/> in pulse radiolysis exactly the same idea <pause dur="0.4"/> what you've got this time <pause dur="0.5"/> instead of radiolysing with a continuous beam <pause dur="0.2"/> which is what you normally do with a cobalt source or a <pause dur="0.3"/> linear accelerator <pause dur="0.9"/> with a linear accelerator you can <pause dur="0.2"/> arrange the electronics <pause dur="0.6"/> to chop the beam <pause dur="1.1"/> and you can chop it <pause dur="0.4"/> right down <pause dur="1.2"/> into nanosecond pulses <pause dur="0.7"/> and so <pause dur="0.9"/> just as in flash photolysis <pause dur="0.2"/> you had a nanosecond flash of light <pause dur="0.6"/> in pulse radiolysis <pause dur="0.7"/> you've got <pause dur="0.6"/> a nanosecond <pause dur="0.2"/> burst of electrons <pause dur="0.5"/> you can pulse an electron beam <pause dur="0.6"/> fairly easily <pause dur="0.5"/> and get <pause dur="0.3"/> a pulse of electrons <pause dur="0.4"/> so it's exactly the same type of idea <pause dur="0.9"/> and with that of course you can 
then <pause dur="0.7"/> attack liquids with these electron pulses <pause dur="0.2"/> and look at <pause dur="0.8"/> ions that are formed <pause dur="0.4"/> and what you have to do <pause dur="0.4"/><kinesic desc="reveals covered part of transparency" iterated="n"/> is to put in <pause dur="0.6"/> again <pause dur="1.0"/> a scavenger <pause dur="1.0"/> most <pause dur="0.2"/> aromatics <pause dur="0.2"/> # sorry most aliphatics <pause dur="0.5"/> and ethers if you imagine that you were to ionize an ether <pause dur="0.9"/> you get an ether cation or ether radical and electron <pause dur="1.3"/> those those aliphatic radicals absorb right down in the U-V they're very hard to see <pause dur="0.3"/> so if you want to know what's going on what you again do <pause dur="0.3"/> is to put in <pause dur="0.6"/> another scavenger <pause dur="0.6"/> # maybe naphthalene again or biphenyl but this time <pause dur="0.4"/><kinesic desc="reveals covered part of transparency" iterated="n"/> you're putting it at room temperature <pause dur="0.5"/> instead of of a very low temperature <pause dur="0.9"/> so it's the same experiment in a way that Hamill did <pause dur="0.2"/> except that it's in the liquid phase <pause dur="1.0"/> to begin with <pause dur="0.3"/> so you're looking at the mobility of the of the ions which you don't get in the <pause dur="0.4"/> frozen matrix <pause dur="0.2"/> and also <pause dur="1.0"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> you're <pause dur="0.5"/> using fast <pause dur="0.2"/> spectroscopic recording you're recording optical spectra <pause dur="0.9"/> on the nanosecond timescale <pause dur="0.5"/> and if you do that <pause dur="0.6"/><kinesic desc="reveals covered part of transparency" iterated="n"/> then you find <pause dur="0.4"/> that <pause dur="0.3"/> you get # <pause dur="1.6"/> ion yields <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> in water 
about two-point-three <pause dur="0.2"/> this is using nanosecond <pause dur="0.6"/> N-S <pause dur="0.8"/> in methanol about one-point-three <pause dur="0.6"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> in hexane about point-five <pause dur="0.2"/> so the ion yields are much higher <pause dur="1.2"/> than the pure conductivity experiment indicated <pause dur="0.4"/> and this is using <pause dur="0.2"/> the scavengers <pause dur="0.5"/> but this time <pause dur="1.1"/> in <pause dur="0.3"/> a <trunc>l</trunc> in the liquid phase <pause dur="0.2"/> so again <pause dur="0.4"/> we've got direct physical evidence <pause dur="0.3"/> for <pause dur="0.4"/> quite <pause dur="0.2"/> large yields of ions <pause dur="0.3"/> even in hydrocarbons <pause dur="0.3"/> from <pause dur="1.1"/> the <trunc>r</trunc> the radiolysis experiment <pause dur="1.9"/> there's another thing that you can do <pause dur="0.7"/> and which was done <pause dur="2.1"/> all of these experiments were done on a <trunc>nat</trunc> a nanosecond timescale it's ten-to-the-minus-nine of a second okay ten-to-the-minus-nine <pause dur="0.7"/> and the question raised in people's minds <pause dur="0.5"/> okay this is what you see at ten-to-the-minus-nine <pause dur="0.4"/> but what if we could actually shorten the pulse further <pause dur="0.6"/> would we see earlier events after all in the track model <pause dur="0.2"/> you had the pictures of these spurs <pause dur="0.2"/> with positive and negative ions <pause dur="0.4"/> and the question was <pause dur="0.4"/> would it be conceivable <pause dur="0.5"/> to see <pause dur="0.4"/> these # scavengers <pause dur="0.6"/> capturing electrons or maybe capturing positive charges as 
well <pause dur="1.3"/> on a very very short timescale <pause dur="2.4"/> giving ion yields higher than what you see at one nanosecond because at one nanosecond <pause dur="0.6"/> some of your naphthalene minuses <pause dur="0.5"/> might have combined <pause dur="0.2"/> with solvent cations <pause dur="0.3"/> or naphthalene pluses <pause dur="0.4"/> also formed <pause dur="0.3"/><kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="7"/> and so people then began <pause dur="0.3"/> to to develop <pause dur="0.5"/> shorter timescales <pause dur="0.2"/> and they developed <pause dur="0.3"/> picosecond pulse radiolysis <pause dur="0.4"/> and that's ten-to-the-minus-twelve of a second <pause dur="0.9"/> so here we go <pause dur="0.5"/> picosecond pulse radiolysis ten-to-the-minus-twelve of a second <pause dur="0.4"/> basically it get gives higher ion yields <pause dur="0.5"/> and so if you actually <pause dur="0.3"/> measure the ion yield <pause dur="0.3"/> as a function of the <pause dur="0.3"/> pulse length that you're applying <pause dur="0.3"/> you find that ten-to-the-minus-twelve of a second <pause dur="0.4"/> everything <pause dur="0.4"/> gives ion yields of three <pause dur="0.4"/> at ten-to-the-minus-nine it's dropped down to about sort of two or one-point-five <pause dur="0.5"/> microsecond <trunc>i</trunc> it's fairly stable <pause dur="0.4"/> and then gradually of course <pause dur="0.3"/> with even longer pulses it gets very low <pause dur="0.4"/> and you get to the figure <pause dur="0.2"/> that you record <pause dur="0.3"/> in a conductivity experiment <pause dur="0.5"/> so <pause dur="0.6"/> you actually find the ion yield 
depends on time <pause dur="0.5"/> and it depends on that <pause dur="0.4"/> because <pause dur="0.3"/> you form these things inhomogenously <pause dur="0.6"/> <trunc>el</trunc> in the spurs <pause dur="0.8"/> they're formed <pause dur="0.6"/> they begin to migrate away <pause dur="1.0"/> on a very short timescale they they alight on the solute and give you say a solute minus that # <pause dur="0.2"/> you can see at the very short timescales <pause dur="0.6"/> but <pause dur="0.7"/> not long afterwards some of these have already recombined <pause dur="0.5"/> with positive ions in the medium <pause dur="0.3"/> to give lower yields <pause dur="1.3"/> well <pause dur="0.7"/> this <pause dur="0.5"/> was the picture with ions <pause dur="0.7"/> what about excited states <pause dur="1.0"/> well there are various ways of forming the excited states <pause dur="0.3"/> and various ways of trying to see them <pause dur="0.5"/> let's let's so let's look now <pause dur="0.4"/><kinesic desc="reveals covered part of transparency" iterated="n"/> at <pause dur="0.5"/> excited states <pause dur="0.6"/> measurement of <pause dur="1.0"/> excitation yields in radiolysis <pause dur="1.4"/> what we think happens <pause dur="0.3"/> and what i've done to start with <pause dur="0.3"/><kinesic desc="reveals covered part of transparency" iterated="n"/> is simply take a very simple system <pause dur="0.6"/> and i've taken cyclohexane <pause dur="0.8"/> now you might wonder <pause dur="0.3"/> why cyclohexane <pause dur="0.6"/> and the answer is <pause dur="0.4"/> that <pause dur="0.2"/> if you're looking at free radical chemistry <pause dur="0.6"/> cyclohexane's quite a good thing to work with because <pause dur="0.3"/><kinesic desc="writes on transparency" iterated="y" dur="7"/> if you look at cyclohexane <pause dur="1.7"/> you've got <trunc>hy</trunc> <trunc>the</trunc> two 
pairs of hydrogens all the way around <pause dur="1.6"/> it doesn't matter which of those bonds you break you always end up <pause dur="1.0"/><kinesic desc="writes on transparency" iterated="y" dur="4"/> with the same radical C-six-H-eleven <pause dur="1.4"/> if you add hexane <pause dur="0.7"/> you can take a hydrogen off <pause dur="0.5"/> the methyl group at the end <pause dur="0.2"/> or the next C-H-two in <pause dur="0.2"/> or the next C-H-two after that so immediately you got three different radicals <pause dur="0.4"/> and the chemistry becomes much more complicated <pause dur="0.4"/> so cyclohexane is very much a preferred solvent to work with <pause dur="0.4"/> because you can get it very very pure <pause dur="0.9"/> and it gives just one radical <pause dur="0.5"/> there's only one C-six-H-eleven <pause dur="0.8"/> so whichever that one <trunc>w</trunc> whichever those bonds you break you always have the same radical <pause dur="0.7"/> now if you <pause dur="0.4"/> take cyclohexane and irradiate it and i've just put <pause dur="0.2"/><kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> this is the symbol by the way that sort of # <pause dur="0.7"/> lightning looking symbol <pause dur="0.2"/> # with the little <trunc>gam</trunc> gamma above <pause dur="0.4"/> that's the # <pause dur="1.3"/> symbol for <pause dur="0.4"/> high energy radiation ionizing radiation <pause dur="0.4"/> # i put gamma <pause dur="0.2"/> i could have put alpha if it was alpha radiation <pause dur="0.5"/> and you get <pause dur="0.7"/> three things happening you get the cation <pause dur="1.1"/> and again  
that's a <pause dur="0.2"/> a radical cation <pause dur="0.2"/> initially so i'll <kinesic desc="writes on transparency" iterated="n"/> perhaps i'll put a dot there just to remind you <pause dur="0.6"/> the electron <pause dur="0.8"/> and the C-six-H-twelve-star <pause dur="0.7"/> now we can measure <kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> this by scavenging <pause dur="0.2"/> at low temperatures <pause dur="0.3"/> we can measure <kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> that as well by scavenging at low temperatures <pause dur="0.6"/><kinesic desc="reveals covered part of transparency" iterated="n"/> what if you put anthracene in the system <pause dur="0.8"/> what <pause dur="0.4"/> happens if anthracene is there <pause dur="1.2"/> right <pause dur="0.8"/> well i if i've got anthracene A <pause dur="0.7"/> what happens is this <pause dur="0.5"/> the electron goes onto the anthracene to give anthracene-minus <pause dur="2.0"/> 
the hole <pause dur="0.9"/> present in the C-six-H-twelve-plus-dot <pause dur="0.4"/> goes onto the anthracene <pause dur="0.3"/> to give anthracene-plus <pause dur="1.3"/> it's much <pause dur="0.2"/> easier to ionize anthracene than it is to <trunc>anthrace</trunc> to ionize cyclohexane <pause dur="0.3"/> so thermodynamically <pause dur="0.4"/> the positive charge will migrate <pause dur="0.3"/> from <kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> this molecule <pause dur="0.2"/> onto the anthracene <pause dur="0.3"/> to give anthracene-plus <pause dur="0.7"/> any excited states <pause dur="0.8"/> will be of very high energy 'cause they're going to be sigma sigma star states you remember there are no pi-electrons there <pause dur="0.4"/> but there are excited states formed <pause dur="0.7"/> and they give <pause dur="0.4"/> the excitation to the anthracene <pause dur="0.4"/> to give singlet anthracene-plus <pause dur="0.6"/> and triplet anthracene <pause dur="0.9"/> meanwhile <pause dur="0.6"/> # <kinesic desc="reveals covered part of transparency" iterated="n"/> what can also happen in the system <pause dur="0.2"/> is the anthracene-plus <pause dur="0.7"/> and the anthracene-minus <pause dur="0.3"/> if you don't track them <pause dur="0.5"/> at a low temperature but if you have them at room temperature <pause dur="0.8"/><kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> these will find each other <pause dur="1.1"/> and annihilate each other in other words the plus will destroy the minus to give excited states <pause dur="0.6"/> so you'll get yet more singlet anthracene <pause dur="0.2"/> and triplet 
anthracene <pause dur="0.8"/> the singlet anthracene <pause dur="0.3"/> will emit <pause dur="0.5"/> fluorescence <pause dur="0.2"/> so you can see fluorescence <pause dur="0.3"/> coming out of the system <pause dur="0.4"/> and you can measure it <pause dur="2.1"/> it is the case <pause dur="1.5"/> that if you take <pause dur="1.6"/> a solvent such as cyclohexane <pause dur="0.3"/> or benzene or toluene <pause dur="0.3"/> or <pause dur="0.2"/> some other solvents <pause dur="0.6"/> and put into the solvents <pause dur="0.8"/> a molecule that's a good fluorescing agent <pause dur="1.0"/> and you expose it to radiation <pause dur="0.8"/> it will emit <pause dur="0.4"/> light it emits fluorescence <pause dur="0.4"/> so you're not putting any light in <pause dur="0.6"/> you're only putting ionizing radiation into this system <pause dur="0.7"/> and you're getting fluorescence out <pause dur="0.6"/> and this is the basis of many detectors <pause dur="0.4"/> and this is a a a a a very slight digression <pause dur="0.4"/> but <pause dur="0.7"/> very many of the most important experiments that have been done in <pause dur="0.5"/> <trunc>cos</trunc> in radiochemistry <pause dur="0.3"/> but also astrophysics have relied on this <kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.6"/> because <pause dur="1.5"/> if you <pause dur="0.4"/> think about things like cosmic rays that are constantly pulsing through the earth <pause dur="0.6"/> they're pulsing through you as well <pause dur="1.5"/> are there ways of detecting them <pause dur="0.4"/> well if you take <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> either a plastic block <pause dur="0.3"/> loaded with anthracene <pause dur="0.5"/> or maybe a solution 
of toluene <pause dur="0.3"/> with some anthracene in it <pause dur="0.6"/> and you take it down to the bottom of a coal shaft <pause dur="1.2"/> you can actually see it fluorescing <pause dur="0.4"/> and it's fluorescing <pause dur="0.3"/> because of cosmic rays <pause dur="0.6"/> passing right through the earth <pause dur="0.2"/> and passing through that <pause dur="1.2"/> sample <pause dur="0.5"/> and <trunc>f</trunc> giving you light <pause dur="0.4"/> so we are all the time <pause dur="0.4"/> under constant irradiation <pause dur="0.4"/> from <pause dur="0.4"/> outside the solar system <pause dur="0.7"/> and you can detect that <pause dur="0.4"/> using these <pause dur="0.3"/> systems <pause dur="1.4"/> and these <trunc>th</trunc> these systems <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> they have a special name in in that technology <pause dur="0.5"/> they're called liquid scintillators <pause dur="0.5"/> so if i write if i put in brackets under here <kinesic desc="writes on transparency" iterated="y" dur="10"/> liquid scintillators <pause dur="9.1"/> they're a a very good way of measuring <pause dur="0.3"/> ionizing radiation <pause dur="1.2"/> you can use liquid ones and also you could there are <trunc>s</trunc> there are crystal ones as well <kinesic desc="reveals covered part of transparency" iterated="n"/> there are there's some some very nice crystalline scintillators that you can make solid state ones <pause dur="0.4"/> and they are used again for measuring radiation <pause dur="0.6"/> if there's been a leakage or something you go you can either go round with a gigacounter <pause dur="0.2"/> which is one possibility <pause dur="0.4"/> or you can 
go round with a solid state scintillator <pause dur="0.2"/> and you measure <pause dur="0.6"/> the # <pause dur="2.3"/> the scintillation spectrum <pause dur="0.6"/> okay <pause dur="0.3"/> well if you <trunc>de</trunc> # <pause dur="0.2"/> that's that was a bit of an aside but i thought i'd mention it in case # <pause dur="0.4"/> you sort of read about it sometime and wondered how it all linked up with this <pause dur="1.0"/> the <pause dur="0.3"/> G value that's a hundred electron volt yield of singlet anthracene is about two <pause dur="0.9"/> and the yield of triplet anthracene <pause dur="0.4"/> measured by pulse radiolysis this time <pause dur="0.8"/> is also about two <pause dur="0.3"/> so you get quite high excited state yields <pause dur="0.4"/> from <pause dur="0.2"/> radiolysis <pause dur="0.4"/> of something like <pause dur="0.7"/> cyclohexane <pause dur="0.5"/> hexane <pause dur="0.6"/> # dioxan <pause dur="0.2"/> benzene and toluene <pause dur="0.2"/> and all those sorts of solvents <pause dur="0.8"/> high yields from organic solvents <event desc="takes off transparency" iterated="n"/> particularly <pause dur="1.4"/> if there are no <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> organic radicals there sorry if there are <trunc>n</trunc> sorry if there are no hydroxy groups there they they that disturbs things but i i'll talk about that later as well <pause dur="2.8"/> that's using <pause dur="0.8"/> spectroscopic methods <pause dur="1.7"/> this detection of excited states <pause dur="0.6"/> we've <pause dur="0.9"/> looked at the fluorescence emission <pause dur="0.6"/> from the anthracene say or whatever else you were 
using <pause dur="0.8"/> you can look at the triplet states 'cause they won't emit at room temperature 'cause you know about that anyway from photochemistry <pause dur="0.3"/> but you can see them in <trunc>p</trunc> # by you doing triplet triplet <trunc>abdorp</trunc> triplet triplet absorption <pause dur="0.5"/> as in pulse radiolysis <pause dur="0.5"/> what about chemical effects <pause dur="0.4"/> well you can also <kinesic desc="puts on transparency" iterated="n"/> induce <pause dur="1.1"/> cis-trans isomerization <pause dur="0.8"/> i mentioned in <trunc>t</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> # <trunc>w</trunc> in the photochemistry lectures that # <pause dur="0.4"/> one of the things that # you can do <pause dur="0.2"/> is to make molecules <pause dur="0.6"/> isomerize by shining light on them <pause dur="0.7"/> but you can also do it with radiation <pause dur="0.5"/> and if you take <pause dur="0.2"/> liquid benzene <pause dur="0.9"/> and add <pause dur="0.4"/> a small amount of <pause dur="0.3"/> cis-butene <pause dur="0.4"/> which is what that is <pause dur="0.8"/> and gamma irradiate it <pause dur="1.2"/><kinesic desc="reveals covered part of transparency" iterated="n"/> it turns into a mixture of cis and trans-butene <pause dur="0.5"/> so you can bring about isomerization <pause dur="1.0"/> what how does this happen <pause dur="0.4"/> well <pause dur="0.5"/> <trunc>i</trunc> <pause dur="0.6"/> from the previous overhead you ought to have a good idea <pause dur="0.6"/> but i'll i'll write it all i'll put it down again <pause dur="0.3"/><kinesic desc="reveals covered part of transparency" iterated="n"/> to indicate <pause dur="1.1"/> got <pause dur="0.5"/> this is benzene <pause dur="0.9"/><kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> benzene <pause dur="0.4"/> undergoes radiolysis <pause dur="0.9"/> and this is a perfectly general equation you see you've got it for 
cyclohexane you've now got it for benzene <pause dur="0.6"/> it applies to every molecule there is <pause dur="0.4"/> so <pause dur="0.8"/> you know if you were given <pause dur="0.2"/> say a question <pause dur="0.4"/> in which you were given some molecule you hadn't come across before <pause dur="0.4"/> and asked what happens if you radiolyse this <pause dur="1.0"/> the first thing to write down is M-plus <pause dur="0.5"/> minus an M-star where the molecule is M <pause dur="0.5"/> then you've got everything that can happen <pause dur="1.1"/> in the spur <pause dur="0.2"/> <trunc>i</trunc> along the track <pause dur="1.5"/> well this is <kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> benzene-plus minus benzene excited state benzene <trunc>exci</trunc> excited state is singlet and triplet <pause dur="0.5"/> you get them both formed <pause dur="0.5"/> and what happens in particular <pause dur="0.7"/><kinesic desc="reveals covered part of transparency" iterated="n"/> is that triplet benzene <pause dur="0.8"/> will react <pause dur="0.3"/> with this <pause dur="0.5"/><kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> and it will transfer its energy <pause dur="0.3"/> so we've got energy transfer <pause dur="0.4"/> to give excited <pause dur="0.7"/> cis-butene <pause dur="0.5"/> plus ground state benzene so i could maybe <pause dur="0.3"/> just <kinesic desc="writes on transparency" iterated="y" dur="8"/> write in ground state benzene just to remind you that the <pause dur="0.7"/> you've got energy transfer so i if i put E-N <pause dur="0.9"/> energy transfer <pause dur="0.4"/> there <pause dur="0.9"/> and this excited state falls back to the <kinesic desc="reveals covered part of transparency" iterated="n"/> ground state <pause dur="0.5"/> and it falls back into a mixture of cis and trans <pause dur="0.8"/> and of course <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="0.9"/> 
<kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> this has another go then this can go round the circuit again and get converted into trans <pause dur="0.5"/> the isomerization yield <pause dur="1.0"/><kinesic desc="reveals covered part of transparency" iterated="n"/> is two-point-three <pause dur="0.5"/> you convert two-point-three molecules of cis-butene <pause dur="0.3"/> for every <pause dur="0.3"/> hundred electron volts <pause dur="0.5"/> of <pause dur="0.7"/> energy that falls on there <pause dur="0.5"/> and if that <pause dur="0.7"/> if it's a case there's a fifty-fifty chance of falling <kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> this way <kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> or that way <pause dur="0.5"/> it means <pause dur="0.4"/><kinesic desc="reveals covered part of transparency" iterated="n"/> the excited state yield <pause dur="0.6"/> the triplet state yield <pause dur="0.4"/> of the cis-butene is in fact twice that it's four-point-six <pause dur="0.5"/> 'cause half of them <pause dur="0.4"/> go <kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> this way <pause dur="0.4"/> and <kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> half of them go that way <pause dur="0.7"/> all right <pause dur="0.9"/> so <pause dur="0.3"/> that <pause dur="0.3"/> is <pause dur="0.6"/> an indication <pause dur="0.2"/> of how you can use a scavenger <pause dur="0.8"/> and this time it's the cis-butene <pause dur="0.3"/> to register <pause dur="0.4"/> what's going on in the benzene <pause dur="0.4"/> you rely on the scavenger <pause dur="0.4"/> picking up <pause dur="0.5"/> the intermediates <pause dur="1.5"/> of course if you <pause dur="0.6"/> were as a person were undergoing <pause dur="0.4"/> gamma radiolysis <pause dur="1.7"/> in the water in your body you would get <trunc>positi</trunc> you'd get <pause dur="0.4"/> <trunc>ion</trunc> ionization <pause dur="1.8"/> and you get the intermediates formed from that <pause dur="0.2"/> and then your D-N-A in your proteins acts as the scavengers <pause dur="0.3"/> so <pause dur="0.2"/><kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> this picture i've 
given you <pause dur="0.3"/> of scavengers <pause dur="0.2"/> small amounts of <trunc>s</trunc> materials <pause dur="0.4"/> in a <unclear>bulk</unclear> solvent system <pause dur="0.5"/> is relevant to radiobiology <pause dur="1.2"/> because in radiobiology <pause dur="0.4"/> eighty per cent of you is water eighty per cent <pause dur="0.3"/> and so if you <pause dur="0.4"/> get <pause dur="0.3"/> radiation effects in water <pause dur="0.3"/> these will <pause dur="0.2"/> transmit themselves <pause dur="0.5"/> to the building blocks <pause dur="0.3"/> of your cells <pause dur="0.2"/> okay but <pause dur="0.3"/> that's for a later lecture but i mention it now <pause dur="0.5"/> this picture <pause dur="0.2"/> carries all the way through this notion of scavenging <pause dur="1.1"/> now <pause dur="0.2"/> i've talked about the <pause dur="1.1"/> capturing the <trunc>n</trunc> the <pause dur="0.3"/> electrons <pause dur="0.8"/> i've talked about capturing the excited states <pause dur="0.7"/> the last thing i want to talk about is capturing the positive ions <pause dur="0.3"/> how do we know <pause dur="0.5"/> well well we there must be positive ions there 'cause we see the negative ions <pause dur="0.4"/> and you can't have negative ions without positive ions but it would be nice to see them as well <pause dur="0.5"/><kinesic desc="reveals covered part of transparency" iterated="n"/> and what you can do <pause dur="0.5"/> is this <pause dur="1.8"/> you can take <pause dur="1.5"/> a <pause dur="1.2"/> a molecule <pause dur="1.9"/> which we know from electrochemistry <pause dur="1.4"/> is very easily oxidized <pause dur="0.8"/> to give <pause dur="2.1"/> a highly coloured <pause dur="0.3"/> species <pause dur="0.8"/> and a nice example <pause dur="0.6"/> is <pause dur="1.2"/> triphenylamine <pause dur="0.3"/> nitrogen 
with three phenol groups on <pause dur="0.7"/> this is a pale <pause dur="0.4"/> pale yellow material <pause dur="0.5"/> crystalline <pause dur="0.5"/> if you dissolve it in <pause dur="0.5"/> cyclohexane <pause dur="0.4"/> and submit it to pulse radiolysis <pause dur="0.5"/> you get a brilliant colour <pause dur="0.8"/> just for a short time <pause dur="0.5"/> but you can measure that <pause dur="0.3"/> and it's known <pause dur="0.5"/> from electrochemical oxidation <pause dur="0.2"/> of triphenylamine <pause dur="0.7"/> so <pause dur="0.2"/> # <trunc>i</trunc> # it's a known species <pause dur="0.3"/> the extinction coefficient's known as well <pause dur="0.5"/><kinesic desc="reveals covered part of transparency" iterated="n"/> and what's happening <pause dur="0.4"/> is you're getting this this # <pause dur="0.5"/> you're getting C-six-H-twelve-plus <pause dur="0.4"/> with an odd little <pause dur="0.2"/> little radical dot <pause dur="0.8"/> formed <kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> that's your solvent cation radical <pause dur="0.8"/><kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> this is your <pause dur="0.3"/> amine <pause dur="0.9"/><kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> this gives up an electron far more readily than <kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> this does <pause dur="0.2"/> so the electron <pause dur="0.3"/> passes from <kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> here <pause dur="0.4"/> onto <kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> there to neutralize it and give you back the solvent <pause dur="0.6"/><kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> this becomes <pause dur="0.8"/> the cation <pause dur="0.8"/> and you can measure these cations <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> by pulse radiolysis that's what # P-R stands for <pause dur="0.5"/> at room temperature <pause dur="0.4"/> or you can do it at liquid nitrogen temperature as well <pause dur="0.3"/> and you get the same coloration there it's a blue-green colour <pause dur="0.9"/> so this is called a positive ion scavenger <pause dur="0.4"/> and 
it's been chosen <pause dur="0.3"/> because it's got a very low ionization energy <pause dur="0.3"/> and it's marvellous <pause dur="0.3"/> at # picking up positive ions in that sort of way <pause dur="1.2"/> okay <pause dur="0.4"/> so those are <pause dur="0.9"/> all <pause dur="1.4"/> experiments <pause dur="0.7"/> either at low temperature <pause dur="0.7"/> in some cases <pause dur="0.5"/> matrix isolation as i've called it before <pause dur="0.5"/> or room temperature <pause dur="0.8"/> to measure <pause dur="0.6"/> cations <pause dur="0.4"/> here <pause dur="0.5"/> excited states there <pause dur="0.2"/> and electrons on the previous overhead <pause dur="0.6"/><event desc="takes off transparency" iterated="n"/> so that is how <pause dur="0.3"/> we actually get at <pause dur="0.5"/> the <pause dur="0.2"/> the yields <trunc>o</trunc> of materials <pause dur="2.1"/> now <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="2.5"/> i'm going to skip <pause dur="0.2"/> the scavenger equation 'cause i'm going to come back to that later on <pause dur="1.3"/> what i'd like to do now <pause dur="0.2"/> is to say a little bit about water <pause dur="1.1"/> water is probably the most important system looked at <pause dur="0.5"/> mainly because as i said <pause dur="0.4"/> we are <pause dur="0.6"/> we consist largely of water <pause dur="0.8"/> so there's huge interest <pause dur="0.3"/> there must must be over a thousand papers on the radiation chemistry of water and probably half a dozen books as well <pause dur="1.0"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> what happens <pause dur="0.2"/> with water <pause dur="1.2"/> well <pause dur="0.2"/> in a way it's quite interesting <pause dur="0.5"/> if you take <pause dur="0.4"/> a vessel <pause dur="1.1"/> and you <trunc>fi</trunc> you fill it almost to the top <pause dur="1.4"/> put a stopper in <pause dur="2.6"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> 
take this vessel of pure water completely full <pause dur="2.5"/> and if you gamma irradiate it <pause dur="1.8"/> for days <pause dur="1.9"/> and then you do a a big analysis of it <pause dur="1.2"/> what happens <pause dur="0.4"/> and the answer is <pause dur="1.3"/> almost nothing <pause dur="1.1"/> water appears <pause dur="0.2"/> to survive <pause dur="1.3"/> radiolysis <pause dur="0.6"/> well that's a very strange sort of thing with hydrocarbons <pause dur="0.6"/> you get all sorts of products you get dimers you get hydrogen you get goodness knows what <pause dur="0.4"/> with methanol you get ethylene glycol <pause dur="0.6"/> plus hydrogen <pause dur="0.5"/> but water <pause dur="0.6"/> is extraordinary <pause dur="0.5"/> it's <trunc>a</trunc> it appears to be amazingly radiation resistant <pause dur="1.1"/> and so <pause dur="0.2"/> for quite a while <pause dur="0.8"/> certainly <pause dur="0.2"/> in in the earlier parts in the earlier <trunc>y</trunc> <trunc>y</trunc> years of this century <pause dur="0.5"/> people thought water was very boring <pause dur="0.5"/> because it didn't seem to do anything <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.9"/> but then <pause dur="0.7"/> people got used to got used to this this idea of using scavengers and they began to look at water <pause dur="0.6"/><kinesic desc="puts on transparency" iterated="n"/> with <pause dur="0.2"/> scavengers <pause dur="1.2"/> so they they took water <pause dur="0.7"/> and added scavengers <pause dur="0.5"/> so the first point to note is water on its own <pause dur="0.4"/> appears <pause dur="0.5"/> not to do anything <pause dur="0.9"/> but if you put in scavengers <pause dur="0.4"/> and the two i've chosen 
are iron-two and cerium-four <pause dur="0.6"/> iron-two is a reducing agent <pause dur="0.7"/> cerium-four is an oxidizing agent <pause dur="1.2"/> what do we think we get in <pause dur="1.8"/><kinesic desc="reveals covered part of transparency" iterated="n"/> well let us suppose <pause dur="0.4"/> and course i i know i know the answer to this but let us suppose <pause dur="0.2"/> that water does indeed undergo radiolysis <pause dur="0.5"/> to give an oxidizing species <pause dur="0.5"/> and a reducing species <pause dur="0.5"/> but let's also suppose <pause dur="0.3"/> that <kinesic desc="writes on transparency" iterated="y" dur="1"/> they are extremely good <pause dur="0.5"/> at going back again to water <pause dur="0.9"/> right <pause dur="1.6"/> let's <pause dur="0.4"/><kinesic desc="reveals covered part of transparency" iterated="n"/> look at it in more detail now what <pause dur="0.2"/> what <pause dur="0.5"/> from the experience with cyclohexane and benzene what <trunc>mi</trunc> might we expect to see <pause dur="1.0"/> well water <pause dur="0.4"/> we might have thought would ionize <pause dur="0.3"/> so we write H-two-O-plus and E-minus <pause dur="0.7"/> and H-two-O-star <pause dur="0.8"/> that would be a very good starting point <pause dur="0.4"/> what happens to those things <pause dur="0.8"/> well the first thing that happens <pause dur="0.9"/><kinesic desc="reveals covered part of transparency" iterated="n"/> # <pause dur="0.8"/> and i want to concentrate on <kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> this side of the picture <pause dur="0.4"/> so perhaps i'll <pause dur="0.5"/><event desc="covers part of transparency" iterated="n"/> cover that up for the moment <pause dur="1.1"/> H-two-O-plus is known in mass spectrometry you can you can ionize water in a mass spectrometer <pause dur="0.5"/> and what's known is a very very fast reaction <pause dur="0.3"/> between H-two-O-plus <pause dur="0.2"/> and 
water <pause dur="0.3"/> to give H-three-O-plus and O-H radical <pause dur="1.4"/> so <pause dur="0.2"/> we might have thought well <pause dur="0.2"/> perhaps we're getting some O-H radical <pause dur="2.5"/> what about the electrons <pause dur="0.6"/><kinesic desc="reveals covered part of transparency" iterated="n"/> well <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> an electron <pause dur="1.3"/> the kind of electron that goes along a wire in a torch or in a T-V set <pause dur="0.5"/> or to this overhead projector <pause dur="0.5"/> if you put an electron in water <pause dur="1.2"/> it becomes solvated <pause dur="2.7"/> i don't know what you know about <pause dur="0.2"/> solutions of sodium in ammonia or potassium in ammonia but if you take ammonia <pause dur="0.5"/> and you dissolve potassium or sodium <pause dur="0.4"/> have you done that have you done an experiment in the lab <pause dur="1.1"/> with <pause dur="0.2"/> sodium in ammonia have you ever had liquid ammonia as a reagent <pause dur="1.9"/> maybe not <pause dur="0.8"/> well if you take ammonia <pause dur="0.8"/> it's a liquid <pause dur="0.6"/> it # boils at minus-thirty-three but it's got quite a high <pause dur="1.0"/> latent heat of vaporization so it <trunc>s</trunc> hangs around for quite a while before it all evaporates <pause dur="0.3"/> it's around for really quite a long time <pause dur="0.6"/> if you put sodium in ammonia <pause dur="0.2"/> it dissolves and gives you a deep blue solution <pause dur="1.1"/> and these deep blue solutions are <trunc>p</trunc> are <trunc>p</trunc> highly magnetic <pause dur="0.7"/> and basically you've got N-A-plus <pause dur="1.0"/> 
and free electrons <pause dur="0.4"/> in the ammonia <pause dur="0.9"/> and those free electrons are solvated by the ammonia molecule which has got an electron <pause dur="0.2"/> with say six ammonias round it <pause dur="0.4"/> well here <pause dur="0.3"/><kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> you got an electron with six waters round it that's called the aquated electron or the hydrated electron <pause dur="0.6"/><kinesic desc="reveals covered part of transparency" iterated="n"/> okay <pause dur="0.5"/> and you can <trunc>s</trunc> you can see that that is there <pause dur="0.2"/> in pulse radiolysis <pause dur="0.6"/><kinesic desc="reveals covered part of transparency" iterated="n"/> if you just pulse radiolyse pure water <pause dur="0.5"/> you get <pause dur="0.2"/> a band at seven-hundred <pause dur="0.5"/> and this thing <pause dur="0.5"/> of course <pause dur="0.4"/> i mentioned before <pause dur="0.5"/> in the photochemistry section of the course <pause dur="0.2"/> if you flash photolyse <pause dur="0.8"/> iodide ion <pause dur="0.8"/> or ferrocyanide ion <pause dur="0.3"/> again you get <kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> this broad band <pause dur="0.4"/> peaking at seven-hundred <pause dur="0.2"/> that's right out in the red so it's a blue colour <pause dur="1.2"/> you see this <pause dur="0.3"/> and you do indeed get electrons <pause dur="0.5"/> the O-H radicals <pause dur="0.7"/> well <pause dur="0.7"/><event desc="covers part of transparency" iterated="n"/> i mentioned cerium-four and iron-three <pause dur="1.4"/> you take water <pause dur="0.4"/> and radiolyse it with iron-two there <pause dur="1.0"/> the iron-two becomes iron-three <pause dur="1.4"/> if you take water with cerium-four there <pause dur="0.8"/> the cerium-four becomes reduced to cerium-three <pause dur="1.5"/> if we put <kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> these two 
scavengers in <pause dur="1.6"/> we get oxidation <pause dur="0.5"/> of this <pause dur="0.2"/><kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> and <kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> reduction of that <pause dur="0.6"/> that was the first hint <pause dur="0.3"/> that there were oxidizing species in water <pause dur="0.7"/> these are very classical type experiments using those things <pause dur="0.8"/> <trunc>e</trunc> but <kinesic desc="reveals covered part of transparency" iterated="n"/> in the pulse radiolysis <pause dur="0.5"/> we can do this <pause dur="0.3"/> and we can see the O-H radicals <pause dur="0.5"/><kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> here <pause dur="0.3"/> which are formed in <kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> that step there <pause dur="0.5"/> they attack various things <pause dur="0.3"/> they attack <pause dur="0.5"/> benzene <pause dur="0.2"/> <trunc>s</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> add on to benzene to give <kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> this thing <pause dur="0.5"/> and that has got a known optical absorption spectrum this is you can <trunc>s</trunc> you can make this thing photochemically <pause dur="0.6"/> so we we know the <trunc>o</trunc> O-H is adding to benzene <pause dur="0.4"/> to give <kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> this <pause dur="0.5"/> but we also know that O-H if we have a different experiment <pause dur="0.6"/> it attacks <pause dur="0.2"/> various things <pause dur="0.4"/> and if we have <pause dur="0.2"/> sodium thiocyanate <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> N-A-<pause dur="0.2"/>S-C-N-<pause dur="0.5"/>minus it's a scavenger <pause dur="1.0"/> then <pause dur="0.4"/> we get electron transfer reaction electron transfer <pause dur="0.4"/> we get S-C-N-dot in other words the O-H pulls the electron off there <pause dur="0.3"/><kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> to give O-H-minus hydroxide <pause dur="0.4"/> which then reproteinates to water <pause dur="0.7"/> meanwhile <kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> this has formed S-C-N <pause dur="0.4"/> and this actually loves <pause dur="0.2"/> to add to an S-C-N-minus 
to give <kinesic desc="reveals covered part of transparency" iterated="n"/>this thing <pause dur="0.5"/> and that is very highly coloured <pause dur="0.3"/> and you can see it in pulse radiolysis <pause dur="0.9"/> so in the pulse radiolysis experiment <pause dur="0.2"/> without the scavenger <pause dur="0.2"/> you get this <pause dur="0.7"/><kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> with the scavenger <pause dur="0.3"/> you see this <pause dur="0.5"/><kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> or you see <kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> that <pause dur="0.8"/> and so <pause dur="0.5"/> although water <pause dur="0.4"/> appears <pause dur="0.6"/> not to give any <pause dur="0.2"/> reaction to radiation <pause dur="0.4"/> what's happening is you are getting <pause dur="0.4"/> yields of oxidizing species and reducing species <pause dur="0.5"/> the oxidizing species <pause dur="1.2"/> is in fact O-H <pause dur="0.6"/> and the reducing species <pause dur="0.4"/> is in fact E-minus <pause dur="0.5"/> and so <trunc>thi</trunc> this is basically <pause dur="0.3"/> the guts of water radiolysis <pause dur="0.4"/> i put H-two-O-star there and excited state of water <pause dur="0.6"/> are they very important <pause dur="0.7"/> well <pause dur="0.5"/> surprisingly <pause dur="0.2"/> perhaps <pause dur="0.5"/> they're not <pause dur="0.6"/> # you might have thought there might be a reasonable yield <pause dur="0.7"/> but in fact <pause dur="2.3"/> when you <pause dur="0.5"/> radiolyse water <pause dur="1.5"/> you <pause dur="0.7"/> form <kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> these two in the spur <pause dur="0.9"/> and there's a big difference between water and hexane <pause dur="0.5"/> in hexane <pause dur="0.2"/> if you've got two charges a few angstroms away <pause dur="1.6"/> they have an enormous coulombic attraction <pause dur="0.7"/> because the <trunc>cou</trunc> the attraction between two charges is given by Coulomb's law <pause dur="0.3"/> 
Q-one-Q-two <pause dur="0.3"/> over epsilon-R <pause dur="0.3"/> squared <pause dur="1.8"/> and <pause dur="1.3"/> <trunc>Q</trunc> <trunc>Q</trunc> Q-one and Q-two are both one <pause dur="1.0"/> it's the epsilon that counts the dielectric constant <pause dur="0.8"/> the dielectric constant or electric permittivity <pause dur="0.5"/> of hexane is about two <pause dur="1.0"/> has <trunc>any</trunc> does anyone have any idea what it is for water <pause dur="0.4"/> the dielectric constant of water or electric permittivity of water <pause dur="1.0"/> any <pause dur="0.3"/> any feel for that <pause dur="1.1"/> well it water's a highly dielectric medium <pause dur="0.3"/> and it the figure's about eighty <pause dur="0.8"/> so the <pause dur="0.2"/> force between the positive and <trunc>neg</trunc> negative charges <pause dur="1.0"/> in hexane <pause dur="0.3"/> is enormous <pause dur="0.3"/> because <pause dur="0.4"/> on the bottom line you've got epsilon being two <pause dur="0.3"/> but in water <pause dur="0.3"/> epsilon's eighty <pause dur="0.4"/> so the coulombic attraction is forty times weaker <pause dur="0.3"/> so there's a much better chance they'll get away <pause dur="0.5"/> and not recombine <pause dur="0.5"/> to give excited states <pause dur="0.6"/> and indeed <pause dur="0.5"/> the excited states of water <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> are purely dissociative if you excite water <pause dur="0.8"/> # with a very deep U-V quantum <pause dur="1.8"/> you get excited water <pause dur="0.3"/> but it breaks into <pause dur="0.3"/> hydrogen atoms and O-H radicals <pause dur="0.2"/> and so <pause dur="0.2"/> you do not have stable excited states of water <pause dur="0.3"/> if they are 
formed at all <pause dur="0.2"/> they dissociate <pause dur="0.2"/> to O-H <pause dur="0.2"/> and hydrogen <pause dur="0.3"/> and immediately the hydrogen atom <pause dur="0.5"/> will form an electron <pause dur="0.3"/> because if you think about it <pause dur="4.1"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="8"/> the solvated electron <pause dur="0.7"/> will with react with a proton <pause dur="0.5"/> to give you <pause dur="2.0"/> a hydrogen atom <pause dur="0.9"/> so you can convert electrons to hydrogen atoms <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="9"/> that's the H atom <pause dur="2.2"/> that's the proton <pause dur="1.1"/> and that's the solvated electron <pause dur="2.6"/> and so <pause dur="0.3"/> these are the three very very simple species <pause dur="0.3"/> but you always knew <pause dur="0.5"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="1"/><kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> that the hydrogen atom <pause dur="0.2"/> was a proton plus an electron <pause dur="0.3"/> so it's not surprising <pause dur="0.4"/> that <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="1"/> in water <pause dur="0.9"/> you actually get the hydrogen atom dissociating into <kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> those two bits <pause dur="0.6"/> or they can recombine to give that <pause dur="0.2"/><kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> and you've actually got <pause dur="0.3"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="2"/> there is a P-K-A <pause dur="0.4"/> the hydrogen atom <pause dur="0.2"/> it's a <trunc>lit</trunc> it's a little tiny acid all in its own right <pause dur="0.8"/> well on that amazing thought <pause dur="0.5"/> i'll <pause dur="0.2"/> <shift feature="voice" new="laugh"/>i'll <shift feature="voice" new="normal"/>bring things to an end today <pause dur="0.5"/> so we've talked about <pause dur="1.2"/> radiolysis <pause dur="0.3"/> using scavengers of organic systems <pause dur="0.3"/> and i've finished up by talking a bit about water <pause dur="0.5"/> the big difference is the organic systems <pause dur="0.2"/> have excited states that's a very important part of their radiolysis <pause dur="0.8"/> water <pause dur="0.5"/> is entirely <pause dur="0.4"/> ionization <pause dur="0.3"/> to give <pause dur="0.2"/> O-H-dot <pause dur="0.4"/> and E-minus those are the two principal species <pause dur="0.3"/> and they dominate radiation biology <pause dur="0.9"/> okay
