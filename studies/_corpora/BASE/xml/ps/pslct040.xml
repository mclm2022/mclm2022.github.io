the modelling techniques <pause dur="0.6"/> on the simulation it's called C-B Monty Put Call <pause dur="0.4"/> it's in the Q drive <pause dur="0.4"/> this reconciles with <pause dur="0.2"/> <gap reason="name" extent="2 words"/>'s file <pause dur="0.8"/> so if you want to use this in the project and <pause dur="0.3"/> have a put or a call or whatever you want <pause dur="0.2"/> you can <pause dur="0.3"/> reconcile it back to <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/>'s model <pause dur="0.4"/> and use that as well <pause dur="0.6"/> you should be able to <pause dur="0.6"/> follow it it's # <pause dur="0.4"/> instead of having one bullet option it's got a series of options <pause dur="0.5"/> and <trunc>tr</trunc> goes through ten years like the # <pause dur="0.6"/> ten periods <pause dur="0.8"/> like the binomial model <pause dur="0.7"/> so that's on <pause dur="0.7"/> the Q drive <pause dur="0.8"/> if you want to use it <pause dur="24.8"/> okay there's a handout <pause dur="0.7"/> on this <pause dur="1.7"/> just over here <pause dur="0.5"/> if you want to pick it up later <pause dur="8.4"/> i'm # <pause dur="0.5"/> i'm going to go through <pause dur="1.3"/> the theory <pause dur="0.4"/> of real options <pause dur="1.1"/> and then <pause dur="0.2"/> i'm going to show you <pause dur="1.5"/> how they can be <pause dur="1.2"/> used <pause dur="0.8"/> to <pause dur="0.6"/> raise some money <pause dur="1.0"/> particularly on property assets <pause dur="3.8"/> real options # <pause dur="0.7"/> are a term which <pause dur="0.6"/> was coined <pause dur="1.2"/> ten fifteen years ago <pause dur="0.5"/> when people began to realize that <pause dur="0.7"/> net present value isn't the only thing <pause dur="0.5"/> that you should look at <pause dur="0.4"/> in valuing assets <pause dur="0.7"/> that <pause dur="0.2"/> a number of <pause dur="0.8"/> assets <pause dur="0.5"/> in 
companies <pause dur="0.4"/> have a great deal of option value <pause dur="1.5"/> and so the <pause dur="0.7"/> option theory <pause dur="0.4"/> that you've been looking at <pause dur="0.8"/> can be also applied <pause dur="0.7"/> to <pause dur="0.3"/> real assets instead of just financial assets <pause dur="1.1"/> and that in raising money <pause dur="0.2"/> companies particularly have <pause dur="0.6"/> a lot more to offer <pause dur="0.5"/> from an option pricing perspective <pause dur="0.5"/> than they first thought <pause dur="1.1"/> the <pause dur="1.6"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> the idea on on real options is that management is just not <pause dur="0.6"/> a passive <pause dur="0.7"/> participant <pause dur="0.6"/> that management can take an active role <pause dur="0.8"/> in # <pause dur="0.8"/> in making and revising decisions <pause dur="1.1"/> that can lead <pause dur="0.4"/> # on from <pause dur="0.6"/> unexpected market developments such as for example the price of oil <pause dur="0.7"/> has gone up from # ten pounds a barrel to in excess of thirty pounds a barrel <pause dur="1.0"/> over the last year <pause dur="0.8"/> so if you were an oil <pause dur="1.4"/> producer this time last year <pause dur="0.9"/> you would be taking a very different view <pause dur="0.3"/> on the market for oil <pause dur="0.5"/> so the increase in <pause dur="0.3"/> oil prices has uncovered <pause dur="0.4"/> a stream of options <pause dur="0.3"/> which make <pause dur="0.8"/> the # the oil <pause dur="0.7"/> producers a lot more valuable <pause dur="0.5"/> and now you can bring oil fields back on stream that <pause dur="0.2"/> were not necessarily economic <pause dur="0.8"/> # so 
this is the the kind of idea <pause dur="0.4"/> that when we're looking at a project <pause dur="0.4"/> we're just not looking at a static cash flow we're actually looking at a cash flow that can be subject to a lot of optionality in it <pause dur="1.2"/> so <pause dur="0.4"/> real options <pause dur="0.8"/> assume that management is not an inert force <pause dur="0.2"/> that management actually understands what it's doing <pause dur="0.7"/> and then it that it can act <pause dur="0.2"/> and react <pause dur="0.3"/> very quickly <pause dur="0.5"/> to changes in the economic environment <pause dur="0.9"/> many of the high tech companies are valued on real options <pause dur="0.6"/> in that <pause dur="0.6"/> there's so much happening <pause dur="0.3"/> in <pause dur="1.2"/> tech at the moment <pause dur="0.7"/> that <pause dur="0.2"/> # even though they're not earning current cash flows that the possibility of being able <pause dur="0.2"/> to be on the ground <pause dur="0.2"/> and earn those sort of cash flows in the future <pause dur="0.6"/> represents enormous opportunities so many of them are valued using real options <pause dur="2.4"/> the <pause dur="0.6"/> the flexibility <pause dur="1.1"/> comes down <pause dur="0.7"/> to being able to <pause dur="0.2"/> improve upside potential <pause dur="1.6"/> firstly <pause dur="0.8"/> and then it's also assumed that management will <pause dur="0.9"/> have some damage limitation on the downside losses <pause dur="1.0"/> so that it can move extremely 
quickly <pause dur="0.5"/> and is not a passive entity <pause dur="0.8"/> so we've got <pause dur="0.9"/> another item here we've got <pause dur="0.3"/> a passive net present value <pause dur="0.7"/> of expected cash flows which is what you've done in the workshop <pause dur="1.1"/> over the last couple of days <pause dur="0.5"/> we've done a very passive <pause dur="0.5"/> look at it <pause dur="0.6"/> nothing has changed <pause dur="1.2"/> we've got to add to it <pause dur="1.0"/> the value of options <pause dur="0.4"/> from active management <pause dur="0.5"/> which i'm going to do in the first week of next term <pause dur="0.7"/> that we're going to make <pause dur="0.3"/> the price process stochastic <pause dur="0.5"/> and we're going to see <pause dur="0.3"/> on that <pause dur="0.4"/> fairly simple little project that you did <pause dur="0.8"/> what other <pause dur="0.6"/> areas of value <pause dur="0.4"/> that we can find out <pause dur="0.6"/> of that project <pause dur="0.5"/> and just to compare what its passive <pause dur="0.6"/> value is <pause dur="0.4"/> with what its active value is <pause dur="3.0"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> so these are the types of <pause dur="0.7"/> of real options <pause dur="1.0"/> which are available <pause dur="1.4"/> you have an option to defer a project <pause dur="1.2"/> you don't have to keep on <pause dur="0.8"/> going on with a loss making project <pause dur="1.1"/> it means you have to mothball it <pause dur="0.3"/> if you're going to defer it so there are some <pause dur="1.0"/> there are some cost to putting it in mothballs <pause dur="0.5"/> and just <pause dur="0.2"/> leaving it there <pause dur="1.5"/> there's an option 
for staged investments <pause dur="1.3"/> that it's possible <pause dur="1.4"/> when you go through a product life cycle <pause dur="0.5"/> that <pause dur="0.3"/> other <pause dur="0.9"/> options become available as you are going through <pause dur="0.6"/> this life cycle <pause dur="0.4"/> and so you can look at it in a kind of a staging process that as management learns <pause dur="1.1"/> what is going on it can then <pause dur="0.3"/> acquire that new <pause dur="0.3"/> technology and go into another technology <pause dur="0.7"/> my old favourite B-T <pause dur="0.3"/> is just <shift feature="voice" new="laugh"/>starting <shift feature="voice" new="normal"/>to do that now its share price has just recovered as it's starting to <pause dur="0.7"/> find out that there are other things in the mobile market and it's making a move into the mobile market and so it's <pause dur="0.3"/> using <pause dur="0.3"/> its own platform to stage investments and to # <pause dur="0.2"/> to move through and the share price has <pause dur="0.4"/> has recognized that <pause dur="0.6"/> so it's starting to move up <pause dur="2.1"/> you can change scale <pause dur="0.9"/> on a project <pause dur="1.7"/> with the <pause dur="0.8"/> increase in oil values <pause dur="0.2"/> oil prices rather from <pause dur="0.6"/> ten <pause dur="0.4"/> dollars a barrel to thirty dollars a barrel <pause dur="0.5"/> you can most certainly bring on <pause dur="0.2"/> an huge change in scale <pause dur="0.8"/> of the projects and i would imagine 
that <pause dur="0.6"/> when OPEC gets its act together it will most certainly be doing this <vocal desc="sigh" iterated="n"/> that when they finish squabbling <pause dur="0.7"/> that what we will find is they're a huge change of scale <pause dur="0.6"/> from OPEC and it will then once again as it normally does flood the market <pause dur="0.7"/> and the price will <pause dur="0.5"/> come down <pause dur="0.6"/> but <pause dur="0.4"/> this is now <pause dur="0.6"/> # with that <pause dur="0.8"/> threefold increase <pause dur="0.9"/> a huge ability to change the scale of production <pause dur="1.3"/> you can of course <pause dur="0.5"/> abandon <pause dur="1.4"/> but if you make <pause dur="0.5"/> the wrong decision <pause dur="0.9"/> there is nothing worse than throwing good money <pause dur="0.2"/> after bad <pause dur="0.8"/> and making the wrong decision <pause dur="0.5"/> so <pause dur="0.5"/> fundamentally <pause dur="0.4"/> quit <pause dur="1.1"/> so there's always an option to abandon <pause dur="1.3"/> # there are options to switch <pause dur="0.2"/> # the technology <pause dur="0.8"/> might be appropriate <pause dur="0.7"/> for <pause dur="0.2"/> another area <pause dur="1.0"/> that you could become involved in <pause dur="0.6"/> or alternatively you could switch <pause dur="0.6"/> # from gold <pause dur="0.3"/> if <pause dur="0.3"/> to silver or lead zinc <pause dur="0.6"/> if you're in a field that has gold and silver lead zinc the gold price goes down you can switch to a product <pause dur="0.6"/> which <pause dur="0.3"/> # potentially is going to give you more revenues <pause dur="1.5"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> options to grow well that's fairly <pause dur="0.3"/> self-explanatory 
and this is all the Internet <pause dur="0.6"/> all the Internet companies come in here <vocal desc="laugh" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.4"/> that # <pause dur="0.2"/> people are seeing enormous growth options <pause dur="0.7"/> potentially in the Internet companies <pause dur="1.0"/> # and importantly <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> these are not <pause dur="0.7"/> mutually exclusive <pause dur="1.4"/> the there are interacting options <pause dur="0.8"/> within all of this framework so you can potentially have options on options <pause dur="1.0"/> which tend to be <pause dur="0.3"/> extremely explosive <pause dur="0.3"/> in terms of valuing things <pause dur="1.0"/> but <pause dur="0.3"/> but what this <pause dur="0.2"/> all assumes is that management is good <pause dur="1.6"/> and <pause dur="0.5"/> i think you'll probably find that over <pause dur="1.0"/> the next few years that a lot of inept management will be flushed out <pause dur="0.7"/> of the system <pause dur="0.5"/> and that <pause dur="0.2"/> the # the high fliers <pause dur="0.2"/> will <pause dur="1.0"/> have gone too near the sun and will have their wings melted <pause dur="0.8"/> and will <pause dur="0.6"/> plummet to earth <pause dur="0.2"/> in a very big way <pause dur="0.6"/> so this assumes that there is the management to be able to recognize <pause dur="0.6"/> the optionality <pause dur="0.9"/> of these opportunities <pause dur="7.5"/> just to go through those in a little bit more detail <pause dur="1.6"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> options to defer <pause dur="0.9"/> so management could hold a lease <pause dur="0.6"/> or an 
option to buy valuable land <pause dur="0.3"/> or resources <pause dur="0.7"/> so it can wait for a number of years to see if output prices justify the construction <pause dur="0.7"/> of a building <pause dur="0.6"/> or a plant <pause dur="0.2"/> or a project development <pause dur="1.0"/> important in natural resources <pause dur="1.3"/> extraction <pause dur="0.7"/> real estate <pause dur="0.3"/> farming <pause dur="0.7"/> paper <pause dur="1.2"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/>

financial options no we can use that <pause dur="0.5"/> because we can form the hedge portfolio <pause dur="0.8"/> and by hedging the portfolio <pause dur="0.2"/> we can assume that the asset grows <pause dur="0.6"/> at the riskless interest rate <pause dur="0.3"/> it's very difficult to form a hedge portfolio <vocal desc="laugh" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.3"/> on a <pause dur="0.2"/> real option <pause dur="0.6"/> so we have to manage that <pause dur="1.1"/> and adjust <pause dur="1.1"/> the interest rate and i'll come to this in an example fairly shortly <pause dur="0.5"/> by what's known as the market price of risk <pause dur="1.4"/> to bring us back into a risk <trunc>u</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> risk neutral universe <pause dur="0.9"/> to do the pricing <pause dur="0.7"/> so <trunc>th</trunc> <pause dur="0.4"/> all of the terminology <pause dur="0.3"/> is analogous <pause dur="0.9"/> in terms of <pause dur="0.7"/> valuing real option opportunities <pause dur="1.4"/> and there are <pause dur="0.7"/> in raising money <pause dur="0.2"/> i think that # <pause dur="1.1"/> companies <pause dur="1.3"/> do not really realize the value of the real options <vocal desc="laugh" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.4"/> which might be available <pause dur="0.6"/> and that the stock market <pause dur="0.8"/> is <pause dur="0.6"/> only just becoming to realize <pause dur="0.6"/> that apart from the technology sector there are huge values in real options <pause dur="0.5"/> and as that goes through as the <pause dur="0.2"/> as the market realizes that then the share price will alter <vocal desc="laugh" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.2"/> and then the companies will be able to raise more capital because they've

and then <pause dur="0.2"/> doing <pause dur="0.3"/> a similar <pause dur="0.2"/> thing as it goes through the tree <pause dur="0.6"/> if you have a <pause dur="0.4"/> a tree that doesn't combine <pause dur="0.9"/> then you start to have <pause dur="0.5"/> two-to-the-N nodes <pause dur="0.8"/> and when you get to something like two-to-the-eighth or two-to-the-tenth it's # <pause dur="0.2"/> it's something like a thousand-and-twenty-four nodes at the end <pause dur="1.1"/> which means that the tree becomes completely unmanageable <pause dur="0.7"/> if you start changing <pause dur="0.4"/> parameters <pause dur="0.5"/> and volatility patterns and other things at each node <pause dur="0.6"/> so the only reason that trees work <pause dur="0.8"/> or work nicely unless you do <pause dur="0.2"/> some very clever pruning <vocal desc="laugh" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.3"/> of the trees is that they recombine <pause dur="1.0"/> and so <pause dur="0.3"/> a ten year tree just has <pause dur="0.6"/> ten nodes on it <pause dur="0.6"/> so the one we're going to be doing is simulation which is real easy <pause dur="0.9"/> to do because you can incorporate all sorts of path dependency <pause dur="1.2"/> into simulation models <pause dur="4.1"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> so i'm <pause dur="3.5"/> going to go through <pause dur="3.5"/> some stuff <pause dur="4.4"/> on options <pause dur="0.6"/> on real options <pause dur="1.4"/> that i've been <pause dur="0.4"/> working on <pause dur="0.3"/> with the Land Management department <pause dur="1.0"/> on <pause dur="0.9"/> trying to <pause dur="0.4"/> peel out some <pause dur="0.2"/> value <pause dur="0.9"/> in the company's real estate assets <pause dur="1.2"/> so that it can <pause dur="0.5"/> either <pause dur="1.1"/> spin those <pause dur="0.4"/> 
real estate options out <pause dur="0.9"/> or it can convince the market <pause dur="0.5"/> that it's got more value in it and by convincing the market it can then <pause dur="0.6"/> hopefully get a better share price <pause dur="1.0"/> and then <pause dur="2.0"/> be able to do some sort of <pause dur="0.3"/> rights issue <pause dur="0.3"/> or other placement <pause dur="0.6"/> in terms of <pause dur="0.2"/> giving itself some added value <pause dur="1.4"/> so this is <pause dur="3.0"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> this is a problem with <pause dur="0.7"/> property <pause dur="0.4"/> a company's <pause dur="0.7"/> always <pause dur="0.4"/> have to have somewhere to live <pause dur="1.0"/> they've always got <pause dur="0.5"/> a lot of property <pause dur="0.4"/> on their balance sheets <pause dur="1.6"/> property is one of the most <pause dur="0.2"/> underutilized assets <pause dur="0.8"/> that a company has <pause dur="0.6"/> historically <pause dur="0.5"/> companies have only used property <pause dur="0.7"/> as <pause dur="0.8"/> a mortgageable asset <pause dur="1.2"/> which we did <pause dur="0.2"/><vocal desc="laugh" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.4"/> in the workshop that we've just done <pause dur="0.7"/> that we mortgage seventy per cent at a fixed rate <pause dur="1.6"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> very few companies use their asset base <pause dur="0.4"/> sufficiently to raise capital <pause dur="1.0"/> # mortgages can be <pause dur="0.2"/> quite expensive <pause dur="0.7"/> because of the valuation fees that are involved <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> because of the stamp duty <pause dur="0.3"/> which is involved as well <pause dur="0.7"/> and so there are other <pause dur="0.3"/> better ways <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> for a company to use its property portfolio <pause dur="0.8"/> than just <pause dur="1.4"/> 
raising mortgage funds against it <pause dur="1.5"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> there are problems with <pause dur="0.3"/> companies property portfolios <pause dur="0.3"/> firstly is the large size of each individual transaction <pause dur="1.4"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> shares are nice <pause dur="0.6"/> you can <pause dur="0.2"/> take shares down into nice little bite size numbers <vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" dur="1"/>and <pause dur="0.4"/> do a thousand <pause dur="0.2"/> or a hundred or whatever it might be <pause dur="0.8"/> very difficult <pause dur="0.5"/> on property because it's lumpy <pause dur="1.5"/> and it's <pause dur="0.4"/> hard to manage if you have to find a buyer for just a big lump of property <pause dur="0.5"/> it means that there are very few buyers around <pause dur="0.8"/> that can swallow up the property <pause dur="1.3"/> always <pause dur="1.2"/> government <pause dur="1.3"/> being government <pause dur="1.1"/> sees property as a wonderful source of revenue <pause dur="1.2"/> and so to move property <pause dur="1.1"/> you have to pay a huge amount of stamp duty <pause dur="1.2"/> just about anywhere <pause dur="1.2"/> and so this is <pause dur="0.5"/><vocal desc="laugh" iterated="n"/> except in the United States which didn't like stamp duties anyway <pause dur="0.4"/> <vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" dur="1"/><shift feature="voice" new="laugh"/> but # this is one major source of revenue <pause dur="0.5"/> in a lot of <pause dur="0.2"/> countries <pause dur="0.3"/> is that if you do sell it you've 
got to pay huge amount of transaction costs to do it <pause dur="0.5"/> so the transaction costs <pause dur="0.6"/> which you've discovered <pause dur="0.5"/> in the portfolio management just between the offer and bid <pause dur="1.3"/> are <pause dur="0.4"/> are exacerbated <pause dur="0.5"/> because in to move property in this market <pause dur="0.7"/> is six per cent front end transaction cost <pause dur="0.7"/> by the time you fold in all of the stamp duties <pause dur="0.4"/> so not only have you got the difference between the offer and the bid but you got to pay another six per cent <pause dur="0.7"/> to the government <pause dur="1.2"/> to move property <pause dur="2.7"/> it's also got a lot of <pause dur="0.2"/> valuation fees attached to it <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> the the property market <pause dur="0.6"/> for companies trying to raise money <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> is very <pause dur="0.3"/> very hard to get a fix on just <pause dur="0.3"/> what your property's worth <pause dur="1.2"/> and valuers <pause dur="0.5"/> smooth the series <pause dur="1.3"/> so what you've got is <pause dur="0.7"/> that valuers instead of doing their job properly <pause dur="0.3"/> look backwards and say well what sort of property was this when it was valued last time <pause dur="0.6"/> and so the whole of the <pause dur="0.2"/> the valuation parameter tends to be autoregressive <pause dur="0.7"/> and you find that it's an extremely smooth valuation 
parameter and you actually don't ever get what the market is you can only get the market when you do a deal <pause dur="0.6"/> and there's no screen based property trading because it's not an homogenous asset <pause dur="0.4"/> so you're never quite sure what you've got <pause dur="2.1"/> 
which is brings to <pause dur="0.5"/> incomplete market information that nobody really knows <pause dur="0.4"/> what their property's worth until they put it on <pause dur="0.9"/> the market <pause dur="1.2"/> and every property asset is complex and unique <pause dur="0.9"/> so while you may have a row of houses <pause dur="0.6"/> that comes on to the market that <pause dur="0.2"/> all looked the same when they started <pause dur="0.4"/> the moment people start to occupy them they're all different <pause dur="0.8"/> it's not like a share <pause dur="0.5"/> and it's not like a bond <pause dur="0.5"/> so the moment people start to <pause dur="0.4"/> paint their walls a different colour <pause dur="0.7"/> or put a new garage on <pause dur="0.6"/> it's a completely different asset <pause dur="0.3"/> so it's not homogenous <pause dur="0.9"/> so with <pause dur="0.2"/> with all of that <pause dur="0.2"/> you've got <pause dur="0.7"/> companies looking to raise money <pause dur="0.4"/> with this huge asset base <pause dur="0.5"/> which is extremely difficult to manage <pause dur="0.8"/> and extremely difficult to know <pause dur="0.6"/> what sort of valuation to put on <pause dur="4.3"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> 
so what we've suggested <pause dur="0.9"/> in terms of doing this this is for large <pause dur="0.9"/> property companies <pause dur="0.9"/> is to create property derivatives <pause dur="2.5"/> and <pause dur="2.2"/> you can securitize <pause dur="1.5"/> an asset <pause dur="1.2"/> which means that you could <pause dur="0.5"/> theoretically take your property asset or any asset <pause dur="0.3"/> like <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> <trunc>ren</trunc> like # <pause dur="0.7"/> credit card <pause dur="0.6"/> # receivables <pause dur="0.2"/> or <pause dur="0.6"/> # mortgage pass throughs or a number of other things and securitize them <pause dur="0.5"/> and sell off little bits of it <pause dur="3.8"/> this isn't really appropriate for the property portfolio <pause dur="0.3"/> of a company because it then <pause dur="0.2"/> comes back into stamp duties and other <pause dur="1.1"/> # front end costs in terms of <pause dur="0.3"/> dividing up a property and making it into <pause dur="0.3"/> a trust for example with little bite size <pause dur="0.8"/> so what we thought is <pause dur="0.2"/> not to buy or sell the physical asset <pause dur="1.4"/> but buy sell <pause dur="0.3"/> and this is another thing or swap <pause dur="1.6"/> some of the rental cash flows which are derived from the physical asset <pause dur="1.1"/> so for example you've got <pause dur="0.4"/> a <pause dur="0.3"/> a company like <pause dur="0.5"/> # Marks and Spencer's <pause dur="0.3"/> here at the moment <pause dur="0.6"/> they're not having a very good time of it at all <pause dur="0.8"/> and they've just undergone a thing called a 
huge sale leaseback <pause dur="0.5"/> arrangement <pause dur="0.7"/> # that's another way of raising money <pause dur="0.6"/> for companies is that you <pause dur="0.4"/> sell <pause dur="0.6"/> your physical assets <pause dur="0.5"/> and then for say twenty years you then lease them back <pause dur="0.8"/> from the institution or institutions that you've sold them so you get a whole big heap of cash flow now <pause dur="1.7"/> but <pause dur="0.2"/> you're <pause dur="0.5"/> hooked for a twenty year lease <pause dur="0.8"/> that <pause dur="0.5"/> involves <pause dur="0.7"/> huge front end costs again <pause dur="0.3"/> and it also means <pause dur="0.5"/> that by selling <pause dur="0.2"/> what is potentially <pause dur="0.3"/> your best real estate <pause dur="0.5"/> you lose the real option <pause dur="0.7"/> on the real estate <pause dur="0.2"/> and it's gone forever and it's been acquired by an institution <pause dur="0.9"/> so we're suggesting <pause dur="0.3"/> that <pause dur="0.2"/> instead of <pause dur="0.6"/> selling the asset <pause dur="0.9"/> that companies sell the cash flows <pause dur="1.3"/> and the cash flows are the derivative of the asset <pause dur="0.5"/> so we can value them using <pause dur="0.6"/> derivate pricing theory <pause dur="1.2"/> and also bond pricing methods <pause dur="4.5"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> so this <pause dur="0.2"/> is this is what we'll do in an option <pause dur="0.5"/> and a workshop <pause dur="0.4"/> in the first part of next term <pause dur="0.8"/> this is how you value all real options <pause dur="1.4"/> you <reading>model the expected performance <pause dur="0.5"/> of the underlying 
property or asset <pause dur="0.8"/> in a form <pause dur="1.0"/> that allows you to assume risk neutrality</reading> <pause dur="1.0"/> it's very important <pause dur="0.3"/> that we get into this risk neutral universe <pause dur="1.0"/> 'cause if we do that then we could compare any property <pause dur="1.0"/> so if we're in a risk neutral universe <pause dur="0.2"/> every asset earns a risk free rate of interest <pause dur="0.4"/> and we can compare <pause dur="0.5"/> the value of any asset so we we have to move into a risk neutral universe <pause dur="4.3"/> we can take out the expected paths of <pause dur="0.2"/> any of the cash flows from the asset <pause dur="0.9"/> and account for any <pause dur="0.3"/> mean reversion <pause dur="1.0"/> in <pause dur="0.3"/> rental growth <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> series tend to <pause dur="1.1"/> cash flows tend to have <pause dur="0.4"/> a number of properties one of them is that they're mean reverting <pause dur="1.0"/> and you'll find this in an inflation series in a rental series that it tends to <pause dur="0.4"/> it tends to come and tends to revert to the mean <pause dur="0.5"/> so we can put a model in <pause dur="0.2"/> which actually <trunc>im</trunc> has a huge volatility pattern <pause dur="0.5"/> but a very nice mean reversion pattern <pause dur="1.0"/> and then we can discount <pause dur="0.2"/> the expected <pause dur="0.2"/> rent by the zero yield curve <pause dur="0.7"/> of the relevant market <pause dur="0.8"/> to <pause dur="0.5"/> also account <pause dur="0.3"/> for mean reversion 
which could be in that series as well because <pause dur="0.8"/> yield curves also tend to be <pause dur="0.5"/> mean reverting so there's a lot of <pause dur="1.1"/> organizing that we can do on the inputs <pause dur="2.3"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> so <pause dur="0.2"/> you've seen this one before <pause dur="2.3"/> but this is what we've used <pause dur="0.4"/> for <pause dur="1.0"/> the <pause dur="0.4"/> the simulation <pause dur="0.2"/> part <pause dur="0.4"/> in <pause dur="0.5"/> the option project you're doing <pause dur="0.9"/> in the more complex model <pause dur="0.4"/> that i've <pause dur="0.3"/> just put on <pause dur="0.7"/> on the server <pause dur="0.9"/> this is done <pause dur="0.6"/> instead of one bullet option <pause dur="0.6"/> that we've done <pause dur="0.4"/> for your project <pause dur="0.3"/> I-E a seven year option or a ten year option <pause dur="0.4"/> this is done on an annual basis <pause dur="0.8"/> so <pause dur="0.2"/> if you want to use that file <pause dur="0.3"/> you can see that <pause dur="0.2"/> P-T then becomes P-T-plus-one T-plus-two T-plus-three <pause dur="0.5"/> as <pause dur="0.5"/> it simulates the binomial model <pause dur="0.8"/> going through time <pause dur="1.3"/> the only thing that you <pause dur="0.9"/> and we <pause dur="0.2"/> haven't <pause dur="1.1"/> discovered is <pause dur="0.3"/> this lambda <pause dur="0.9"/> here <pause dur="2.2"/> so in <pause dur="0.7"/> in a real options model <pause dur="1.8"/> we have to <pause dur="0.2"/> do an adjustment <pause dur="0.8"/> for risk <pause dur="0.8"/> because we can't assume <pause dur="0.9"/> that we can hedge <pause dur="0.5"/> a real estate portfolio properly <pause dur="0.2"/> by <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> shorting the option and buying delta <shift feature="voice" new="laugh"/> shares <shift feature="voice" new="normal"/><pause dur="0.8"/> or <pause dur="0.6"/> selling the put and selling delta shares <pause dur="0.4"/> 'cause it just doesn't work 
out that way because we don't have a delta of a property <pause dur="0.8"/> 'cause we can't divide the property up into nice little <pause dur="0.5"/> bits of <shift feature="voice" new="laugh"/>property <shift feature="voice" new="normal"/><pause dur="0.4"/> in order to be able to hedge it properly <pause dur="1.0"/> but we can get round it <pause dur="1.8"/> by <pause dur="1.3"/> using <pause dur="0.6"/> a CAPM formula which i'll show you very shortly <pause dur="1.0"/> so in real options <pause dur="1.6"/> this mu <pause dur="2.0"/> is the expected growth rate <pause dur="0.8"/> of whatever it might be <pause dur="0.7"/> gold <pause dur="0.9"/> silver <pause dur="0.9"/> whatever <pause dur="0.4"/> you're looking at <pause dur="0.6"/> mu is the expected growth rate of the commodity of <pause dur="0.3"/> what's the underlying path of the real option <pause dur="0.9"/> it is not the risk free rate <pause dur="3.1"/> the <trunc>ad</trunc> the variance adjustment's exactly the same <pause dur="1.2"/> because <pause dur="0.5"/> while options can go up <pause dur="0.4"/> they most certainly can go down as well <pause dur="0.2"/> <vocal desc="laugh" iterated="n"/><pause dur="1.6"/> come to that in a minute <pause dur="1.4"/> and the rest of it <pause dur="0.5"/> is just the standardized <pause dur="0.7"/> log normal approach <pause dur="1.0"/> that we've been doing <pause dur="6.3"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> so you've seen this formula before many times <pause dur="0.2"/><vocal desc="cough" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.9"/> right <pause dur="0.3"/> so it's a slightly different guise <pause dur="0.5"/> on this one <pause dur="2.2"/> so we're <pause dur="0.5"/> <trunc>thi</trunc> this is a property based one <pause dur="1.8"/> 
where I is a suitable index <pause dur="1.4"/> and the suitable index would # <pause dur="0.5"/> be <pause dur="0.4"/> say the FTSE All Share <pause dur="1.5"/> right <pause dur="1.0"/> P is the property <pause dur="1.4"/> that you're looking at <pause dur="0.9"/> if we can <pause dur="0.7"/> tease out a beta <pause dur="0.4"/> between the index and the property <pause dur="1.4"/> over some <pause dur="0.2"/> period of time <pause dur="1.1"/> we could use <pause dur="0.4"/> P for property <pause dur="0.3"/> to resemble if it were that there are several subindices <pause dur="0.2"/> of property <pause dur="0.4"/> the same as there are several subindices of gold and silver and other bits and pieces <pause dur="1.1"/> and just simply use <pause dur="0.4"/> what we figure out <pause dur="0.3"/> the growth is <pause dur="0.8"/> less the risk free rate <pause dur="0.8"/> and if we take that <pause dur="1.1"/> off <pause dur="1.1"/> the top line <pause dur="0.9"/> of <pause dur="0.4"/> the formula above <pause dur="1.4"/> this one <pause dur="2.1"/> we come back into a risk free world <pause dur="1.7"/> and we can then <pause dur="1.3"/> discount <pause dur="0.8"/> the cash flows <pause dur="0.5"/> in that risk free world <pause dur="0.4"/> by the risk free rate <pause dur="0.7"/> so we're just doing <pause dur="0.6"/> what you've been doing all the time <pause dur="0.2"/> it's just a a CAPM adjustment <pause dur="0.6"/> to bring <pause dur="0.3"/> the whole thing back <pause dur="0.4"/> to risk neutrality <pause dur="2.1"/> which is extremely useful because it means you don't have to form the portfolio <pause dur="9.4"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> so if you've got this process <pause dur="1.1"/> for property or for gold or for silver or for whatever <pause dur="0.5"/> the real optionality 
of it might be <pause dur="1.5"/> the <pause dur="0.4"/> the cash flows <pause dur="0.8"/> inherit the stochastic property <pause dur="0.6"/> properties <pause dur="0.4"/> of the underlying asset <pause dur="0.7"/> so all of the cash flows <pause dur="0.4"/> will be stochastic as well <pause dur="0.7"/> as the property moves around <pause dur="0.4"/> any cash flows <pause dur="0.5"/> which come from it <pause dur="0.2"/> will also tend to be stochastic <pause dur="1.1"/> we discount at the risk free <pause dur="1.4"/> rate <pause dur="1.3"/> now <pause dur="0.6"/> there are important parts going back to the property portfolio <pause dur="0.4"/> and this will depend on the market that you're in which i i'll come to shortly <pause dur="0.5"/> we can separate <pause dur="0.9"/> this property <pause dur="0.3"/> cash flow into fixed and variable characteristics <pause dur="1.4"/> and we can then analyse <pause dur="1.5"/> any of the characteristics <pause dur="0.2"/> of <pause dur="0.3"/> the cash flows <pause dur="0.9"/> to account for <pause dur="0.3"/> jump diffusion what's jump diffusion <pause dur="4.2"/> where are <pause dur="0.3"/> the mathematicians <pause dur="1.2"/> what's jump diffusion <pause dur="4.2"/><vocal desc="whistle" n="su0967" iterated="y" dur="1"/> <vocal desc="laughter" n="ss" iterated="y" dur="2"/> blinding silence <pause dur="3.8"/> it's what happens when a market falls out of bed completely <pause dur="1.3"/> so what you've <shift feature="voice" new="laugh"/># you've had a little bit here <vocal desc="laugh" iterated="n"/> right <shift feature="voice" new="normal"/><pause dur="0.4"/> that <pause dur="0.2"/> one of the the problems <pause dur="0.5"/> and it crashes as well <pause dur="0.6"/> one of the problems with a standard Black Scholes 
methodology <pause dur="1.1"/> is that it assumes <pause dur="0.6"/> that <pause dur="0.7"/> markets <pause dur="0.3"/> go very nicely and very continuously <pause dur="0.9"/> they don't <pause dur="1.3"/> so what you've got is <pause dur="0.3"/> you can model <pause dur="0.5"/> into a process <pause dur="0.7"/> either a jump diffusion on volatility <pause dur="0.2"/> which means that volatility in a market suddenly changes <pause dur="0.6"/> and as you will have <pause dur="0.6"/> been with Dr Smith <pause dur="0.2"/> who has nice little volatility change regimes <pause dur="0.8"/> from time to time this has amazing impact <pause dur="0.3"/> on what happens with a market so you can model <pause dur="0.3"/> a process of <pause dur="0.5"/> volatility diffusion <pause dur="1.5"/> that it <pause dur="0.3"/> goes <pause dur="0.7"/> over <pause dur="0.3"/> a shortish period of time <pause dur="0.5"/> that <trunc>m</trunc> people's view on volatility <pause dur="0.4"/> say over a week suddenly changes <pause dur="0.3"/> and they assume that the market volatility is going <pause dur="0.4"/> up or down <pause dur="1.1"/> 
# <pause dur="0.7"/> that's not as bad as a crash <pause dur="1.8"/> but you can also put a crash model in <pause dur="0.9"/> you can assume that # in the next ten years <pause dur="0.5"/> for example <pause dur="1.0"/> that <pause dur="0.5"/> the stock market or the gold market <pause dur="0.5"/> will crash by twenty per cent on a given day <pause dur="1.3"/> now you don't know when the day's going to be <pause dur="1.1"/> but you can <pause dur="0.2"/> probabilistically <pause dur="0.2"/> weight it <pause dur="0.6"/> so that at some stage <pause dur="0.3"/> through the next ten years <pause dur="0.4"/> there is going to be the most <pause dur="0.2"/> almighty crash <pause dur="1.2"/> that could happen in any market <pause dur="1.4"/> # as i say we can <pause dur="0.8"/> model for mean reverter yields <pause dur="0.2"/> and we can model for mean reverting interest rates <pause dur="0.6"/> so <pause dur="0.4"/> anybody that's looking at raising money <pause dur="0.2"/> on this sort of thing must <pause dur="0.5"/> model in <pause dur="0.5"/> the fact <pause dur="0.2"/> that <pause dur="0.6"/> markets fall and they fall very quickly <pause dur="1.2"/> they tend to rise rather slower <vocal desc="laugh" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.5"/> so you can <pause dur="0.3"/> put all of this modelling in <pause dur="0.9"/> and # <pause dur="0.3"/> and get yourself <pause dur="0.4"/> quite an acceptable valuation <pause dur="0.6"/> in order to go out and get some 
money <pause dur="2.8"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> # <pause dur="1.3"/> this is where <pause dur="1.1"/> in <pause dur="0.3"/> financial engineering terms and raising money you can get quite clever <pause dur="1.6"/> there <pause dur="0.4"/> there is a structure <pause dur="0.3"/> in this market <pause dur="0.5"/> and in a number of other markets <pause dur="0.6"/> which is called an upward only lease <pause dur="0.5"/> a lot of companies <pause dur="0.6"/> do this a lot of companies <pause dur="0.3"/> lease <pause dur="1.0"/> for a long period of time <pause dur="1.6"/> and they don't lease on what's called market rental <pause dur="0.4"/> that means their rents don't change every year <pause dur="1.1"/> as a function of open market <pause dur="0.6"/> their rents may change only once every five years <pause dur="1.5"/> and if the landlord can get away with it <pause dur="0.6"/> they only change <pause dur="0.2"/> upwards <pause dur="0.7"/> they never go down <pause dur="1.9"/> this is a <pause dur="0.2"/> an incredibly iniquitous form of lease <pause dur="1.0"/> but in a tight property market <pause dur="0.8"/> it sometimes happens <pause dur="0.7"/> that you can have <pause dur="0.4"/> upward only <pause dur="1.0"/> leases so if you have upward only leases <pause dur="0.8"/> the first part of a five year lease <pause dur="1.8"/> if it's a good credit <pause dur="0.7"/> is actually an annuity <pause dur="1.4"/> so what you've got is this company is paying twenty-five years' annuities <pause dur="0.7"/> to somebody <pause dur="1.1"/> 'cause it's paying <pause dur="0.7"/> at least that amount of lease rental <pause dur="1.3"/> for the next twenty-five years <pause dur="0.6"/> so 
you can take these <pause dur="0.5"/> annuities <pause dur="0.9"/> package them up <pause dur="1.2"/> put a bank behind it <pause dur="0.4"/> and securitize them and sell them into the bond market <pause dur="1.9"/> if you're a good treasurer <pause dur="2.1"/> this <pause dur="0.2"/> what i've called second slice <trunc>th</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> these are five year <pause dur="1.0"/> this second slice is unknown <pause dur="1.8"/> so if it's unknown <pause dur="0.6"/> but it's high volatility <pause dur="0.6"/> it's an option <pause dur="1.9"/> so <pause dur="0.2"/> you can sell <pause dur="1.4"/> the next twenty years <pause dur="2.0"/> effectively convertible bond <vocal desc="laugh" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.4"/> effectively an option <pause dur="0.5"/> for twenty years <pause dur="0.3"/> you can do the same with a green lot which is the third slice <pause dur="0.6"/> for the last fifteen years <pause dur="0.7"/> so by the time you've finished <pause dur="1.1"/> working out where your property's at <pause dur="0.8"/> you can have the physical property or the physical asset <pause dur="1.1"/> still keep it <pause dur="1.2"/> because that's the most valuable option <pause dur="0.3"/> in real option that you've got <pause dur="0.7"/> but you can sell <pause dur="0.7"/> all of the cash flows <pause dur="0.6"/> which are derived from the physical asset <pause dur="0.7"/> so by the time you <pause dur="0.2"/> can mix and match <pause dur="0.3"/> you've <pause dur="0.9"/> sold an annuity <pause dur="0.6"/> sold several slices of options <pause dur="0.2"/> and kept the property <pause dur="1.5"/> so a property in central 
London or central New York or central wherever it might be <pause dur="0.5"/> even central Reading <pause dur="0.9"/> in twenty-five years time <pause dur="0.4"/> might be worth <pause dur="0.3"/> a whole heap of money <pause dur="0.8"/> so you're not giving it away which is what the Marks and Spencer's <pause dur="0.8"/> model was <pause dur="0.6"/> that you're actually giving away what's called the reversion <pause dur="0.4"/> in real estate speak <pause dur="0.8"/> you're giving away your most valuable option <pause dur="1.2"/> rather than <pause dur="1.2"/> being smart and using <pause dur="0.7"/> optionality <pause dur="0.5"/> to raise money <pause dur="1.0"/> to get your cash flows up <pause dur="5.9"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> so this sort of structure <pause dur="0.4"/> and any sort of structure <pause dur="0.4"/> based on <pause dur="1.2"/> real options <pause dur="1.6"/> tends to minimize <pause dur="0.5"/> legal fees <pause dur="1.3"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> and valuation fees because you're not <pause dur="0.5"/> doing the whole of the asset we're just doing the rentals <pause dur="1.1"/> you can <pause dur="0.3"/> in property speak <pause dur="0.6"/> # the covenant <pause dur="0.6"/> is the company that is <pause dur="0.2"/> renting the property <pause dur="1.2"/> you can credit enhance <pause dur="1.0"/> we haven't covered <pause dur="1.0"/> enhancement <pause dur="1.1"/> but you can credit enhance so if it's a weak <pause dur="0.5"/> company <pause dur="0.8"/> you can go and find a bank <pause dur="1.3"/> that may have a relationship with <pause dur="0.2"/> this company's parent <pause dur="0.8"/> and may <pause dur="0.3"/> put a bank guarantee <pause dur="0.9"/> behind <pause dur="0.5"/> the payment 
of the cash flows <pause dur="1.5"/> and <pause dur="0.4"/> enable it to be sold into a different market which is the <pause dur="0.9"/> securitization market <pause dur="1.2"/> so you can then <pause dur="0.3"/> parcel up all of these little cash flows on gold or silver or property or whatever it might be <pause dur="1.3"/> break them down into bite size chunks <pause dur="1.0"/> enhance them so it's # instead of it being # <gap reason="name" extent="2 words"/> Enterprises Credit it's Deutsche Bank and presumably Deutsche Bank is a bit <pause dur="0.2"/> better credit than i am <pause dur="1.0"/> and then <pause dur="0.6"/> sell that as a Deutsche Bank piece of paper into the market <pause dur="0.6"/> if you can do that <pause dur="1.7"/> what it means is <pause dur="0.3"/> that <pause dur="0.4"/> you never part with the asset <pause dur="0.6"/> and you're using <pause dur="0.2"/> other <pause dur="0.3"/> parts of the capital market <pause dur="0.7"/> to reveal <pause dur="1.1"/> the real optionality <pause dur="0.7"/> that is in <pause dur="0.9"/> your company's assets <pause dur="0.8"/> and the ones that we've looked at <pause dur="1.1"/> the sum of the parts <pause dur="0.3"/> greatly exceeds <pause dur="0.9"/> the total <pause dur="1.1"/> that when you <pause dur="1.1"/> use the real options <pause dur="0.4"/> and peel them out <pause dur="0.9"/> that <pause dur="0.4"/> what has been <pause dur="0.6"/> the passive <pause dur="1.1"/> net present value as we did in the workshops <pause dur="0.6"/> is far far less <pause dur="0.8"/> than the optionality <pause dur="0.2"/> of the cash flows <pause dur="0.3"/> properly engineered <pause dur="0.6"/> and properly put through <pause dur="0.5"/> 
into the capital market <pause dur="1.1"/> now <pause dur="0.8"/> one thing that <pause dur="1.0"/> you can do and this is just <pause dur="0.2"/> from <pause dur="0.6"/> the investment regime <pause dur="0.8"/> just as an investor <pause dur="0.9"/> that if i'm Long Reading Property <pause dur="1.2"/> and # <pause dur="2.3"/> <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> is Long Birmingham Property <pause dur="1.6"/> then <pause dur="1.2"/> maybe i'm a Little Too Long South of England Property <pause dur="1.2"/> and <pause dur="0.3"/> # i'm <pause dur="0.4"/> not really happy with the economic characteristics of <pause dur="0.5"/> the south of England i'm too long <pause dur="0.6"/> and he's Too Long Midlands <pause dur="0.6"/> Property <pause dur="0.9"/> so we could actually swap <pause dur="1.1"/> our property exposure <pause dur="0.7"/> for a while <pause dur="1.1"/> so <pause dur="0.6"/> <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> could sell me <pause dur="0.7"/> his <pause dur="1.5"/> next ten years Birmingham rents <pause dur="1.1"/> and i could <pause dur="0.2"/> <trunc>s</trunc> sell him my next ten years' Reading rents <pause dur="0.7"/> so instead of <trunc>s</trunc> instead of us both going into a transaction <pause dur="0.4"/> where we have to sell the property <pause dur="0.5"/> we could go into a transaction where we forward sell the cash flows <pause dur="0.8"/> from the property <pause dur="0.5"/> so then <pause dur="0.2"/> # my a hundred-million Reading cash flows will go to him <pause dur="0.7"/> and <trunc>i</trunc> # <pause dur="0.2"/> well in <pause dur="0.2"/> net terms # <pause dur="0.2"/> and his will come back to me <pause dur="0.4"/> and at the end of the process <pause dur="0.3"/> like in the swaps market <pause dur="0.5"/> we simply net out the difference of the cash flows <pause dur="1.1"/> 
so that # <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> may win <pause dur="1.0"/> because <pause dur="0.2"/><shift feature="voice" new="laugh"/> you know he's bought my Reading properties <pause dur="0.2"/> and he's made a good deal <shift feature="voice" new="normal"/><pause dur="0.7"/> but i might win on the other hand but we don't swap the gross <pause dur="1.3"/> cash <pause dur="0.3"/> we swap the net cash <pause dur="0.2"/> at the end <pause dur="0.9"/> on ongoing basis <pause dur="0.6"/> so it's a very <pause dur="0.3"/> useful area looking at it from the investor rather than the company that's trying to raise money <pause dur="0.8"/> that # i can diversify out of <pause dur="1.1"/> a market here <pause dur="0.5"/> into <pause dur="0.3"/> another market <pause dur="0.9"/> # which <pause dur="0.7"/> # might enhance <pause dur="0.5"/> yeah my overall <pause dur="0.3"/> diversification potential <pause dur="9.2"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> there's a couple of the markets which i've gone through <pause dur="0.7"/> which <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> which might <pause dur="1.3"/> want to use their assets <pause dur="0.6"/> certainly companies <pause dur="0.3"/> when they are raising money do not use <pause dur="0.7"/> their property assets <pause dur="0.4"/> properly <pause dur="0.5"/> Marks and Spencer's is the latest classic <pause dur="0.5"/> why sell its best properties <pause dur="0.6"/> into the market <pause dur="0.8"/> and then rent them back <pause dur="0.9"/> and give a buyer a Marks and Spencer's credit 
which is still extremely good <pause dur="0.6"/> is entirely beyond me <pause dur="0.9"/> as to all they should have done is to securitize the cash flows <pause dur="0.8"/> sell the cash flows into the <shift feature="voice" new="laugh"/>market <shift feature="voice" new="normal"/><pause dur="0.6"/> and keep the property <pause dur="0.7"/> so there's a lot <pause dur="0.9"/> the message from the day is <pause dur="0.8"/> there's a lot of hidden value <pause dur="1.1"/> in <pause dur="0.2"/> all of these asset classes <pause dur="0.9"/> particularly in <pause dur="0.6"/> the <trunc>propert</trunc> <pause dur="0.3"/> the property <pause dur="0.4"/> portfolio <pause dur="0.8"/> of <pause dur="0.3"/> the company <pause dur="0.9"/> okay <pause dur="0.6"/> so that's <pause dur="0.3"/> that's a first look <pause dur="0.6"/> at <pause dur="0.5"/> real assets <pause dur="0.4"/> sorry real options <pause dur="1.0"/> # <pause dur="0.9"/> one modelling <pause dur="0.2"/> session <pause dur="1.0"/> next term <pause dur="0.3"/> where i'll show you these <pause dur="0.5"/> and i <pause dur="0.3"/> show you the models <pause dur="0.4"/> for deferring abandonment <pause dur="0.3"/> they're actually reasonably simple <pause dur="0.6"/> in terms of <pause dur="0.5"/> getting out the <pause dur="0.3"/> the cash flows <pause dur="0.7"/> getting them through <pause dur="0.9"/> so <pause dur="0.7"/> that'll do us <pause dur="0.5"/> for today i'm going to be around until eleven <pause dur="1.2"/> i know people want <pause dur="0.5"/> to talk about projects <pause dur="0.4"/> so i've got a meeting at eleven until twelve <pause dur="0.8"/> and we'll <pause dur="0.3"/> pick up any other meetings <pause dur="0.4"/> next week <pause dur="1.1"/> okay
