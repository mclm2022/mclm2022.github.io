<u who="nm0757"> # two three weeks is to <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="3.8"/> is to try and build up a framework a a model that will allow us to understand how <pause dur="0.3"/> consumers make choices and <pause dur="0.8"/> we've almost got to the end of <pause dur="0.2"/> the <pause dur="0.2"/> # what people would like to buy <pause dur="0.3"/> element # of the framework <pause dur="0.3"/> and then what we're going to try and do today when we've finished that off is to actually put it together <pause dur="0.3"/> to try and <pause dur="0.2"/> # create a framework a model that will allow us to understand the choices that actually made so we going to put together that <pause dur="0.3"/> availability set the things that people can choose <pause dur="0.5"/> and the part that looks at what they actually want to choose <pause dur="0.3"/> to actually <pause dur="0.3"/> look at the choices that are actually made <pause dur="0.8"/> and what we want to try and do is to put that framework together in such a way that we can use it <pause dur="0.3"/> not just in an academic sense to <pause dur="0.2"/> have some nice diagrams but to actually <pause dur="0.2"/> predict what people will choose <pause dur="0.4"/> # and <pause dur="0.2"/> to look at what happens when things change so if we can build this framework up <pause dur="0.2"/> we can try and understand well if prices change <pause dur="0.5"/> 
what's going to happen to the demand for a good is it going to go up is it going to go down <pause dur="0.3"/> and by how much <trunc>likew</trunc> wise with income <pause dur="0.2"/> for example <pause dur="0.3"/> if income changes how will demand change <pause dur="0.3"/> # and by how much so <pause dur="0.6"/> that's where we want to <pause dur="0.3"/> to end up <pause dur="1.0"/> now if you remember <pause dur="0.4"/> where we got to # <pause dur="1.1"/> at the end of <pause dur="0.3"/> last week <pause dur="4.7"/> was we we started at the end of <pause dur="0.4"/> last week hang on <pause dur="0.2"/> try and remember  which of these light switches it is again <pause dur="3.2"/><event desc="changes lights" iterated="y" dur="3"/><gap reason="inaudible" extent="2 words"/><pause dur="3.3"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="3"/> where <pause dur="1.4"/> we have all of this this space these combinations of two goods X-one and X-two <pause dur="0.3"/> okay <pause dur="0.3"/> and if you remember we said well we can represent it in two dimensions but really <pause dur="0.3"/> we're looking at the choices between all the goods and services that <pause dur="0.2"/> consumers have available to them <pause dur="1.5"/> and we started saying well what the consumer can do <pause dur="0.2"/> we assume <pause dur="0.4"/> is <pause dur="1.1"/> compare <pause dur="0.2"/> any <pause dur="0.2"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="2"/> combination of these goods <pause dur="0.7"/> wherever it is <pause dur="0.7"/> and can say <pause dur="0.3"/> i prefer this point that combination of the two goods over this point <pause dur="0.3"/> and so on <pause dur="0.2"/> and that they can <pause dur="0.4"/> compare all the possible combinations of the things <pause dur="0.3"/> that are available 
to them <pause dur="0.6"/> okay <pause dur="0.6"/> and say i prefer this combination to that combination <pause dur="0.9"/> and they do that <pause dur="0.4"/> # they have these preferences they can say that they have strong preference i prefer A over B <pause dur="0.4"/> i'm indifferent i don't care which i have <pause dur="0.5"/> or weak preference i prefer A to B or i'm indifferent between the two <pause dur="1.7"/> and then what we we did was <pause dur="0.3"/> we said okay that's fine but what we want to try and do is to build up the model that will allow us to predict choices <pause dur="0.4"/> and to do that we have to make certain assumptions about the preferences that consumers have <pause dur="1.0"/> and we we had all these assumptions of completeness there are no black holes there are no <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> combinations of the goods that the consumer can't express a preference over <pause dur="1.0"/> transitivity <pause dur="0.4"/> that is that we have this rule that if you say <pause dur="0.3"/> i prefer A to B <pause dur="0.2"/> and i prefer B to C we can assume that they prefer <pause dur="0.4"/> A over C <pause dur="0.5"/> and we've we we said that <pause dur="0.3"/> often that doesn't hold but <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> at least logically it seems that a rational consumer might have transitive preferences <pause dur="0.6"/> 
we then had the idea of reflexivity that if a if a consumer couldn't compare a good <pause dur="0.3"/> or combination of goods to any other <pause dur="0.4"/> they could compare them to themselves <pause dur="1.8"/> and using that <pause dur="0.4"/> okay <pause dur="0.6"/> we said okay <pause dur="1.0"/> every single one of these points <pause dur="0.6"/> # we can express a preference over <pause dur="0.2"/> but there won't be any inconsistencies <pause dur="1.0"/> we then went on to say okay <pause dur="0.4"/> can we make any general rules about the direction of the consumer's preference and we had the idea of non-satiation <pause dur="0.6"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="1"/> which means that preferences go out in that direction I-E <pause dur="0.4"/> that <pause dur="0.7"/> within the realms of most of the choices that consumers make with lots and lots of goods and services available to them <pause dur="0.3"/> they will prefer more to less they prefer more of the goods to less of the goods <pause dur="0.4"/> and if that is the case <pause dur="0.4"/> their preferences will go out in that direction <pause dur="0.2"/> and hence we automatically can say for example <pause dur="0.2"/> that this point here <pause dur="0.5"/> is preferred to that point there <pause dur="0.7"/> simply because it has more of # both of <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> the goods <pause dur="0.4"/> # and therefore <pause dur="0.2"/> automatically the 
consumer will prefer more <pause dur="2.4"/> we then said okay if that's the case then we can start talking about indifference lines <pause dur="0.7"/> and because that is the case an indifference line or indifference curve must <pause dur="0.3"/> have a negative slope <pause dur="1.3"/> okay <pause dur="0.2"/> that is if we <trunc>combi</trunc> if we we <pause dur="0.3"/> draw a line that combines all of the combinations of these goods <pause dur="0.4"/> between which <pause dur="0.2"/> the consumer is indifferent <pause dur="0.9"/> it must be the case that if you get more of one good you have less of another <pause dur="0.8"/> and <trunc>w</trunc> the measure of that <pause dur="0.2"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="n"/> is the marginal rate of substitution <pause dur="0.4"/> okay the slope <pause dur="0.2"/> of <pause dur="0.6"/> the line <pause dur="1.9"/> so that's negative and it's a measure of the trade off between these two goods which reflects <pause dur="0.2"/> the relative preference that the consumer has <pause dur="0.3"/> for one good over another <pause dur="0.3"/> so if a consumer really likes X-one <pause dur="0.6"/> if they give up one unit of X-one they're going to require a lot of X-two to take its place <pause dur="0.6"/> okay <pause dur="0.4"/> for example <pause dur="1.5"/> then we said okay <pause dur="0.8"/> that's fine <pause dur="0.3"/> but <pause dur="0.4"/> looking at the way <trunc>c</trunc> they're looking at the sorts of preferences that consumers have <pause dur="0.6"/> what we tend to 
find is that this rate of trade off this marginal rate of substitution <pause dur="0.3"/> isn't constant <pause dur="0.9"/> okay <pause dur="0.6"/> and we said in fact <pause dur="1.4"/> that <pause dur="0.5"/> we would expect the indifference curve <pause dur="0.3"/> to be <pause dur="0.3"/> convex to the origin <pause dur="0.8"/> which means that <pause dur="0.5"/> the rate of trade off <pause dur="0.8"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="n"/> at this point here <pause dur="0.2"/> when you have a lot of X-two and not much X-one <pause dur="0.2"/> will be different <pause dur="0.4"/> to the rate of trade off here <pause dur="0.5"/> where you have a lot of X-one and not much X-two <pause dur="0.6"/> because we know that as <pause dur="0.3"/> you get more of a good its marginal utility declines <pause dur="0.7"/> and and vice versa <pause dur="1.3"/> so where we ended up <pause dur="0.2"/> last time <pause dur="0.4"/> was <pause dur="0.2"/> with <pause dur="1.2"/> basically the ability <pause dur="1.5"/> to <pause dur="3.8"/> represent <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> sort of <pause dur="0.2"/> colour <pause dur="4.5"/> to represent the consumer's preferences <pause dur="0.6"/> between these two goods <pause dur="1.5"/> okay <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="3"/><pause dur="0.6"/> as a series <pause dur="0.3"/> of indifference curves <pause dur="0.4"/> like this <pause dur="0.3"/> that are <pause dur="0.3"/> negatively sloped <pause dur="0.4"/> convex to the origin <pause dur="1.3"/> the direction of the consumer's preferences <pause dur="1.6"/> is out here <pause dur="0.5"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="8"/> so we automatically know <pause dur="0.2"/> that <pause dur="3.0"/> indifference curve <pause dur="0.3"/> two <pause dur="0.7"/> is preferred to indifference curve one <pause dur="0.3"/> every single combination of the two goods on <pause dur="0.2"/> this indifference curve <pause dur="0.9"/> 
<trunc>des</trunc> is preferred to every single combination <pause dur="0.4"/> on indifference curve one <pause dur="1.1"/> and likewise indifference curve three <pause dur="0.3"/> every combination on that indifference curve is preferred <pause dur="0.2"/> to indifference curve two <pause dur="0.8"/> okay and so on <pause dur="0.3"/> so the least preferred point is this point here zero consumption <pause dur="0.5"/> 'cause the consumer gets no utility because they only get utility from consumption from the goods <pause dur="0.7"/> and the maximum is some infinite point up here <pause dur="0.9"/> okay <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> <trunc>whoo</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> whoops where <pause dur="1.0"/> they consume however much <pause dur="0.6"/> because at the moment they have no constraints <pause dur="0.5"/> okay because we haven't brought the availability set in <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> so this is what they would like to do <pause dur="1.3"/> okay <pause dur="0.5"/> now <pause dur="0.6"/> you may say okay that's totally unrealistic because eventually the consumer will grow satiated <pause dur="0.6"/> okay <pause dur="0.3"/> now that may be true with <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> two goods <pause dur="0.4"/> but remember <pause dur="0.5"/> if we try and represent this with all the goods available <pause dur="0.2"/> then we can have very small substitutions between all the different goods that are available <pause dur="1.0"/> and we would assume that normally within the realms of <pause dur="0.3"/> of <pause dur="0.8"/> balanced consumption <pause dur="0.9"/> of <pause dur="0.4"/> consuming a large number of different goods <pause dur="0.4"/> that <pause dur="0.3"/> the consumer  
will operate within the context of not having great satiation <pause dur="0.2"/> in most circumstances <pause dur="0.7"/> okay <pause dur="1.5"/> so that's where <pause dur="0.2"/> where we got to <pause dur="1.5"/> and <pause dur="0.5"/> that's fine we can <pause dur="0.2"/> so far <trunc>wh</trunc> if i could draw it <pause dur="0.3"/> do it in three dimensions we could do three goods <pause dur="0.5"/> okay <pause dur="0.9"/> but <pause dur="0.9"/> that is just a diagram it is it's just a representation a a theoretical <pause dur="0.3"/> model <pause dur="0.2"/> of <pause dur="0.5"/> # the consumer's preferences <pause dur="0.5"/> we can't use it at the moment to do anything <pause dur="0.2"/> except <pause dur="0.3"/> # to to try and think about the way in which choices are made <pause dur="0.8"/> what we need to do is to be able to represent this <pause dur="0.2"/> numerically <pause dur="0.2"/> we need to be able to represent <pause dur="0.4"/> these indifference curves <pause dur="0.3"/> in a numerical form <pause dur="0.7"/> 'cause if we can do that <pause dur="0.8"/> if you remember the availability set can be represented # <pause dur="0.3"/> # mathematically because you have the budget line <pause dur="1.4"/> what we need to be able to do is to represent these <pause dur="0.5"/> algebraically mathematically <pause dur="0.4"/> # and then we can combine the two together and use that to actually predict the <trunc>ch</trunc> the <trunc>co</trunc> the choices the consumer would actually make <pause dur="1.5"/> if we can <trunc>al</trunc> also 
if we can represent it algebraically of course we're not constrained to three goods which is what we are in a three-dimensional diagram <pause dur="0.3"/> we can have however many goods <pause dur="0.2"/> that the consumer has available to them <pause dur="0.9"/> okay <pause dur="0.3"/> so we need to <pause dur="0.2"/> represent this in some other way <pause dur="0.5"/> and so the final assumption <pause dur="0.2"/> is that we can represent <pause dur="1.1"/> these indifference curves algebraically <pause dur="0.3"/> and that they are differentiable <pause dur="1.1"/> okay <pause dur="0.4"/> that is that if <pause dur="0.2"/> we we we can differentiate them so that we can derive an optimum <pause dur="0.8"/> okay we can derive a point <pause dur="0.4"/> # a choice that the consumer will make <pause dur="0.2"/> when we put all of all all of the information together <pause dur="0.2"/> the two sides <pause dur="0.6"/> so that's the final assumption <pause dur="0.5"/> that <pause dur="0.2"/> that we are we are going to make <pause dur="1.2"/> now we're not going to go into <pause dur="0.3"/> # a lot of the <trunc>m</trunc> of the mathematics <pause dur="0.4"/> okay <pause dur="0.3"/> it's it's <pause dur="0.3"/> the basic principle that really <pause dur="0.3"/> matters here <pause dur="1.0"/> okay <pause dur="0.8"/> now <pause dur="1.0"/> the complication we have <pause dur="1.5"/> is that we have said that utility is not <pause dur="0.3"/> measurable <pause dur="0.3"/> in a cardinal sense that is <pause dur="0.3"/> we cannot say <pause dur="0.3"/> for example that if a consumer <pause dur="0.3"/> # has a certain consumes a 
certain combination of goods their utility is level X <pause dur="0.6"/> and then if they consume another combination it's level Y <pause dur="1.0"/> okay <pause dur="0.2"/> we can't say there's a <trunc>l</trunc> level utility ten <pause dur="0.4"/> and another combination of goods gives you level of utility twenty <pause dur="0.4"/> we've said we can't do that we can't measure utility <pause dur="0.5"/> # and even if we could we couldn't combine it across individuals because it's totally individual <pause dur="0.4"/> # to that consumer <pause dur="2.3"/> that seems to fly in the face of saying well we want to represent those indifference curves <pause dur="0.4"/> mathematically algebraically <pause dur="0.2"/> and we want to be able to predict the choice they make <pause dur="1.1"/> that's because the reason for that conflict is that all of the mathematical functions that you will have seen to date <pause dur="0.5"/> are what called <trunc>a</trunc> are are are called cardinal functions that is functions where <pause dur="0.2"/> the numbers are measuring things so if we have a value of ten <pause dur="0.3"/> we can say that is half of a value of twenty <pause dur="1.1"/> okay <pause dur="0.8"/> now what we are going to do <pause dur="0.9"/> is to use a type of function that is called an ordinal 
function <pause dur="1.0"/> and an ordinal function <pause dur="0.4"/> is a function where the numbers <pause dur="0.5"/> only matter in terms of their relative position <pause dur="0.5"/> so if you have values of one and two <pause dur="0.9"/> the two is greater than one <pause dur="0.6"/> okay it doesn't matter how much <pause dur="0.2"/> but it's just greater <pause dur="0.6"/> okay so that all that matters in an ordinal function <pause dur="0.2"/> is order <pause dur="0.5"/> not relative position <pause dur="0.8"/> 
okay <pause dur="0.7"/> so <pause dur="0.2"/> what we want to do <pause dur="0.6"/> is <pause dur="1.2"/> we have our indifference curves <pause dur="4.0"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="6"/> like this <pause dur="2.5"/> and we want to be able to represent those indifference curves <pause dur="2.0"/> with a number <pause dur="0.5"/> okay algebraically <pause dur="1.6"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> presume that we can represent that <pause dur="1.8"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="2"/> utility function as # U-X-one-X-two <pause dur="0.6"/> that is <pause dur="0.3"/> utility <pause dur="1.2"/> the satisfaction they get <pause dur="0.5"/> is a function of the amounts of these goods which is what we've said and don't get they don't get satisfaction from anything else they just get it from consumption <pause dur="0.3"/> in <pause dur="0.6"/> in the context of the market <pause dur="1.9"/> and clearly the amount of the utility depends on the quantities of those two goods and that's exactly what this diagram says <pause dur="0.9"/> okay it says that <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="1.6"/><vocal desc="cough" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.4"/> if we have this combination <pause dur="0.9"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="2"/> and this 
combination <pause dur="0.2"/> these two points here <pause dur="0.7"/> the level of utility's exactly the same <pause dur="0.2"/> although the quantities of these two goods is actually different <pause dur="0.2"/> because <pause dur="0.3"/> the consumer is indifferent between those two combinations <pause dur="0.6"/> and we've said that if we have a combination here <pause dur="3.3"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="3"/> the the level of utility is greater <pause dur="0.8"/> again the quantities of the two goods are different <pause dur="0.5"/> but the level of utility that the consumer gets is is greater because it's on a higher indifference curve <pause dur="1.6"/> and so what we want to do is to represent these <pause dur="0.2"/> these indifference curves <pause dur="0.2"/><vocal desc="cough" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.3"/> as <pause dur="0.4"/> what is called a utility function <pause dur="0.4"/> a function that simply says the utility the consumer gets <pause dur="0.5"/> is a function mathematically of <pause dur="0.4"/> the <pause dur="0.2"/> quantity of X-one <pause dur="0.5"/> and the quantity of X-two <pause dur="0.9"/> okay the quantity the amount of the two goods <pause dur="2.1"/> one of these could be zero <pause dur="0.2"/><vocal desc="cough" iterated="n"/> so if the consumer got no utility at all from <pause dur="0.3"/> the consumption of that good <pause dur="0.3"/> then simply <pause dur="0.3"/> the <pause dur="0.4"/> the expression relating to say X-one this good here would just be zero <pause dur="1.0"/> okay so that's possible <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> and if the consumer <trunc>go</trunc> got 
no utility at all from these two <pause dur="0.3"/> then <pause dur="0.5"/> it <unclear>would</unclear> be zero for both <pause dur="1.2"/> okay so we can represent that no no problem at all <pause dur="1.7"/> but we don't we're not going to represent <pause dur="0.2"/> these indifference curves with a function <pause dur="1.6"/> which assumes that we're measuring utility <pause dur="0.2"/> so we're going to use <pause dur="0.5"/> # what is termed a a an ordinal function <pause dur="2.3"/><vocal desc="cough" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.2"/> okay <pause dur="2.8"/> so <pause dur="0.7"/> we're not going back to a world where <pause dur="1.5"/> yeah we can measure marginal utility et cetera <pause dur="0.4"/> we're still in a world of of indifference curves <pause dur="0.2"/> okay that's so that's <pause dur="0.2"/> that's fine <pause dur="1.6"/> okay <vocal desc="cough" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.9"/> the type of function we want is as is as follows <pause dur="0.5"/> if we assume that we have two <pause dur="0.5"/> consumption bundles <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="3"/> X-one <pause dur="1.2"/> # and X-two <pause dur="0.6"/> okay and these are the utility functions that represent those two consumption bundles <pause dur="0.3"/> so X-<pause dur="0.6"/>one here is a combination of these two goods <pause dur="0.5"/> and X-two here is a combination of these two goods <pause dur="0.5"/> a different combination <pause dur="1.8"/><vocal desc="cough" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.8"/> and <pause dur="1.0"/> what we want to do <pause dur="0.4"/> is to effectively so U-X-one <pause dur="0.8"/> okay could be associated with this indifference curve here and U-X-two could be associated with this indifference <pause dur="0.2"/> 
curve here <pause dur="0.8"/> okay for example <pause dur="2.0"/> what we want is to put numbers on these things <pause dur="0.3"/> so hence any combination of goods that lay on indifference curve <pause dur="0.3"/> two <pause dur="0.2"/> would have a greater number <pause dur="0.2"/> than any combination <pause dur="0.4"/> on indifference curve one <pause dur="0.9"/> okay <pause dur="3.2"/> now <pause dur="0.7"/> let's assume that we give we have a <trunc>lar</trunc> a larger <pause dur="0.2"/> value <pause dur="0.4"/> for U-X-one this combination <pause dur="0.3"/> than U-X-two <pause dur="0.3"/> what that would mean of course is that the consumer preferred <pause dur="0.3"/> this combination <pause dur="0.2"/> to that combination that is <pause dur="1.5"/> that <pause dur="0.4"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="5"/> X-one <pause dur="0.2"/> was preferred <pause dur="1.0"/> to X-two <pause dur="1.6"/> okay and that's what that would imply <pause dur="0.5"/> is that the consumer strictly preferred X-one over X-two <pause dur="2.9"/> the other possible scenario <pause dur="1.0"/> is that <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="4"/> U<pause dur="0.7"/>-X-one is equal to U<pause dur="0.3"/>-X-two like if two goods were on the same indifference curve <pause dur="0.8"/> and that would assume <pause dur="1.3"/> that the consumer was <pause dur="0.3"/> indifferent <pause dur="1.6"/> okay <pause dur="3.2"/> so <pause dur="0.2"/> we want <pause dur="0.3"/> to represent these indifference curves in such a way <pause dur="0.5"/> that either <pause dur="0.7"/> if the consumer is indifferent <pause dur="0.9"/> the value we give the number we give is exactly the same <pause dur="1.8"/> okay <pause dur="1.1"/> if the consumer prefers one bundle of goods over another we will give 
a bigger number <pause dur="0.4"/> to <pause dur="0.6"/> the # <pause dur="0.8"/> bundle the consumer prefers <pause dur="2.3"/> what <trunc>th</trunc> <trunc>th</trunc> the the very important thing to get clear in your mind is it doesn't matter what the number is <pause dur="1.1"/> okay <pause dur="1.0"/> all that matters is that we give the same number <pause dur="0.7"/> to bundles of goods between which the consumer is indifferent <pause dur="1.1"/> and we give a bigger number <pause dur="0.7"/> to combinations of goods <pause dur="0.2"/> that the consumer prefers <pause dur="0.9"/> it doesn't matter how much bigger <pause dur="1.6"/> okay <pause dur="0.5"/> and that is the crucial difference <pause dur="0.2"/> if it mattered how much <pause dur="0.2"/> bigger the number was <pause dur="0.2"/> we would be using it as a real measure of utility we'd be saying that <pause dur="0.3"/> if it was a value of ten <pause dur="0.6"/> that would be half a value of twenty <pause dur="1.5"/> all we're saying is that if we give a value of ten <pause dur="0.4"/> that is less <pause dur="0.2"/> than twenty <pause dur="0.4"/> doesn't matter how much because we're not measuring utility <pause dur="0.3"/> we're just measuring order <pause dur="0.4"/> hence it is called an ordinal function <pause dur="1.3"/> okay <pause dur="0.5"/> so <pause dur="0.3"/> any combinations on one indifference curve will have the same number <pause dur="1.2"/> any higher indifference curve any combinations that are on a higher <trunc>diss</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> indifference 
curve will have a bigger number it doesn't matter how much bigger the number is <pause dur="1.5"/> okay <pause dur="0.8"/> so <pause dur="0.7"/> let's <kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="3"/> assume for example that we have <pause dur="0.3"/> # three <pause dur="0.4"/> no sorry four <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="2.3"/> consumption bundles <pause dur="0.9"/> okay these are four different combinations of those goods <pause dur="0.9"/> and we have a utility function <pause dur="1.5"/> U-X <pause dur="6.8"/> okay <pause dur="2.0"/> now <pause dur="1.5"/> if we assume that X-one that that this combination X-one and this combination X-two the consumer is totally indifferent between them <pause dur="0.3"/> they will have exactly the same number <pause dur="0.2"/> say five and five <pause dur="3.5"/> okay <pause dur="1.9"/> and let's assume that they prefer X-three over those two <pause dur="0.8"/> and it may then have a number of <pause dur="0.2"/> ten <pause dur="1.9"/> and they like X-four even more <pause dur="1.5"/> and that could have a number which is say twenty <pause dur="1.6"/> okay <pause dur="0.9"/> so <pause dur="0.2"/> X-one and X-two are indifferent <pause dur="1.0"/> they <trunc>pref</trunc> <trunc>thi</trunc> this consumer prefers X-three over two and one <pause dur="0.6"/> and prefers four over three two and one <pause dur="7.4"/> let's assume that we have let's think say another function <pause dur="0.3"/> that we <trunc>rec</trunc> we could we and we give another numerical representation <pause dur="0.4"/> to <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> to this consumer's preferences <pause dur="1.1"/> and let's say 
we have a value of # a thousand <pause dur="0.7"/> here <pause dur="3.9"/> again the numbers are the same hence the consumer's indifferent <pause dur="4.9"/> let's assume the number given to X-three is ten-thousand <pause dur="2.4"/> that indicates the consumer prefers X-three over two and one <pause dur="1.7"/> it does not say <pause dur="0.2"/> that they prefer the <trunc>consu</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> X-two more <pause dur="0.6"/> than when <pause dur="0.2"/> we had a value of ten <pause dur="1.0"/> okay <pause dur="0.8"/> all that matters <pause dur="0.3"/> is that that number <pause dur="0.3"/> is bigger <pause dur="0.4"/> than the numbers given to X-one and X-two <pause dur="0.4"/> it doesn't matter how much because we're not measuring utility <pause dur="0.5"/> all that matters is relative <pause dur="0.7"/> # positioning <pause dur="0.6"/> and so we could have a value of say a million <pause dur="1.2"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="1"/> given to X-four <pause dur="0.6"/> and again that doesn't tell us anything more <pause dur="0.7"/> than the values here <pause dur="1.0"/> it's exactly the same <pause dur="1.2"/> because all that matters is relative ordering <pause dur="0.6"/> hence it's an ordinal function <pause dur="0.7"/> the higher the number <pause dur="0.8"/> the greater the consumer's preference <pause dur="1.0"/> okay that's true <pause dur="1.6"/> but it doesn't say <pause dur="0.2"/> how much higher it is <pause dur="0.2"/> it just says it is higher <pause dur="1.9"/> so whenever a number is bigger than another number it means the consumer has greater 
preference they will go for that combination of goods <pause dur="0.3"/> rather than one to which we've allocated <pause dur="0.2"/> a lower number <pause dur="3.5"/> how much the number differs <pause dur="0.3"/> is irrelevant <pause dur="0.9"/> it could differ by <pause dur="0.2"/> you know <pause dur="0.3"/> one decimal point <pause dur="0.4"/> or it could differ by <pause dur="0.8"/> a million <pause dur="1.3"/> the information is exactly the same because <pause dur="0.2"/> what we're well what we're not saying is that this how the consumer <pause dur="0.4"/> chooses <pause dur="0.3"/> you know they they think in their head what is my utility function <pause dur="0.7"/> how much utility do i get from these combinations <pause dur="0.3"/> what we're saying is that we want to represent <pause dur="2.1"/><kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="1"/> # these <pause dur="0.3"/> these ideas that we have about their preferences <pause dur="0.5"/> in a numerical way <pause dur="1.1"/> okay <pause dur="0.8"/> we don't want to measure utility because we assumed that we can't do that <pause dur="1.8"/> but what we do want to do is to say <pause dur="0.2"/> we want to give a bigger number <pause dur="0.4"/> to <pause dur="0.2"/> a higher indifference curve because of course what we want to do <pause dur="0.2"/> is to produce a model that says <pause dur="0.4"/> the consumer <pause dur="0.2"/> aims for the highest indifference curve <pause dur="1.1"/> okay they aim for the one <pause dur="0.2"/> which is <pause dur="0.6"/> furthest up <pause dur="1.1"/> okay <pause dur="1.7"/> we're not saying <pause dur="0.3"/> that <pause dur="0.7"/> we can 
measure their utility we're saying is that all they will do is to strive for the highest indifference curve <pause dur="1.0"/> okay and <pause dur="0.7"/> that is # that is all <pause dur="0.9"/> these are termed ordinal functions and they are <pause dur="1.4"/> very different <pause dur="0.3"/> to <pause dur="0.4"/> the sorts of functions that you see we can treat them in exactly the same way as any other <pause dur="0.2"/> mathematical function <pause dur="0.5"/> we can do everything to them that we can do to another <pause dur="0.2"/> mathematical function <pause dur="0.5"/> the only difference is the interpretation we give to these numbers <pause dur="0.6"/> all that matters <pause dur="0.2"/> is their relative position <pause dur="0.8"/> okay <pause dur="0.3"/> how much they are different <pause dur="0.4"/> does not matter <pause dur="0.2"/> simply because <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> we're not measuring their utility <pause dur="0.2"/> we're just measuring <pause dur="0.2"/> order <pause dur="0.9"/> okay <pause dur="1.6"/> 
do you do you understand <pause dur="0.2"/> that distinction <pause dur="0.2"/> between the two types of functions and and what <pause dur="0.5"/> those functions are representing <pause dur="0.2"/> yeah <pause dur="1.1"/> simply they're saying <pause dur="1.0"/> if we get more preference we have a bigger number <pause dur="0.3"/> doesn't matter how much <pause dur="0.2"/> that's irrelevant <pause dur="0.4"/> okay <pause dur="0.4"/> and it does take you know given you've been used to using other the other functions in in other ways <pause dur="0.2"/> it does take some sort of <pause dur="0.2"/> getting your head round but # <pause dur="1.3"/> okay that's <trunc>th</trunc> basically what what we want to do <pause dur="2.8"/> once we once we've said we can do that we can give a number to the preferences <pause dur="0.2"/> then we just have to decide what is the mathematical form <pause dur="1.7"/> okay what is the mathematical form <pause dur="1.4"/> and i'm just going to quickly give you some <pause dur="0.5"/> # examples <vocal desc="cough" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.4"/> okay <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="3.1"/> some some extreme <pause dur="0.3"/> examples <pause dur="0.2"/> okay <trunc>th</trunc> the normal case that we'd tend to find and then just some extreme examples so that you <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.8"/> you understand <pause dur="0.3"/><vocal desc="cough" iterated="n"/><pause dur="1.3"/><kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="10"/> now you've been used to seeing <pause dur="1.0"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> indifference curves like this <pause dur="2.4"/> okay <pause dur="8.1"/> 
fine <pause dur="0.9"/> they represent the sorts of things <trunc>th</trunc> the sort of assumptions that we've built up the sort of assumptions we built up last week <pause dur="1.1"/> and which is <pause dur="0.3"/> a convex marginal rate of substitution changes <pause dur="0.3"/> as the combinations of the good change <pause dur="0.3"/> <trunc>tha</trunc> <trunc>tha</trunc> it's negative <pause dur="0.6"/> okay so there's a trade off between the goods <pause dur="0.3"/> the consumer prefers a higher indifference curve to a lower one and so on <pause dur="0.7"/> okay <pause dur="1.4"/> if they're the assumptions we make <pause dur="0.8"/> then we want to be able to represent <pause dur="0.3"/> those types of preferences between the goods in some <pause dur="0.4"/> mathematical form <pause dur="1.6"/> and the normal form that is used there <pause dur="3.0"/> okay <pause dur="0.2"/> is <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="4.4"/> is a quadratic form of some kind <pause dur="1.6"/> okay <pause dur="0.3"/> that simply says that <pause dur="0.4"/> # and these here are your marginal rates of substitution alpha and beta <pause dur="1.1"/> okay <pause dur="1.3"/> so these are the marginal utilities of the goods the ratio of those will be the marginal rate of substitution <pause dur="0.7"/> okay <pause dur="0.2"/> so alpha is the marginal utility associated with X-one <pause dur="1.0"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> and beta is the marginal rate of substitution <pause dur="0.3"/> associated with X-two <pause dur="0.5"/> and of course the 
ratio of those which is the slope of the <pause dur="0.2"/> indifference curve <pause dur="0.5"/> will give you the marginal rate of substitution <pause dur="0.8"/> okay <pause dur="2.3"/> and all we've said is okay <pause dur="0.3"/> this mathematical function <pause dur="1.8"/> okay will <trunc>dem</trunc> will will display mathematical properties <pause dur="1.2"/> like <pause dur="0.2"/> we have here <pause dur="1.4"/> okay <pause dur="1.0"/> I-E <pause dur="0.2"/> that represents that will allow us algebraically to represent that <pause dur="0.8"/> okay <pause dur="1.2"/> the alpha <pause dur="0.4"/> marginal utility of of X-one<pause dur="0.2"/>-beta marginal utility of X-two <pause dur="0.6"/> the ratio between alpha and beta marginal rate of substitution which is a piece of information we may want <pause dur="0.4"/> and directly we can represent this algebraically <pause dur="0.2"/> we can get that marginal rate of substitution <pause dur="0.8"/> okay <pause dur="0.9"/> of course it may change <pause dur="1.5"/> according to which point on the indifference curve we are because we've said that's what happens <pause dur="0.8"/> so it will change according to the absolute amounts of X-one and X-two <pause dur="1.2"/> okay <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> but <pause dur="0.9"/> that <pause dur="0.8"/> would represent <pause dur="0.2"/> that <pause dur="0.5"/> and so that is the normal form that is used <pause dur="1.7"/> okay <pause dur="0.4"/> okay it's a bit <pause dur="0.2"/> # more difficult <pause dur="0.2"/> # mathematically <pause dur="0.4"/> to deal with <pause dur="1.0"/> because it's not linear <pause dur="0.4"/> 
but <pause dur="0.2"/> in fact if you take the logs of that it becomes linear anyway <pause dur="0.2"/> so so it's relatively easy to use <pause dur="0.3"/> but that is the sort of thing that we might use to represent the normal types of preferences <pause dur="0.3"/> that we assume consumers have <pause dur="1.6"/> okay <pause dur="0.6"/> so that's <pause dur="0.5"/> one form <pause dur="0.6"/> that we might use <pause dur="0.3"/> and then what we would do <pause dur="0.3"/> okay <pause dur="0.4"/> is <pause dur="0.4"/> X-one and X-two will be the quantities of the goods <pause dur="1.5"/> and of course if there are ten goods there will be ten <pause dur="0.5"/> of these X-one X-two X-three up to X-ten <pause dur="0.3"/> and there'll be ten of these <pause dur="0.2"/> marginal utilities <pause dur="1.3"/> okay <pause dur="0.4"/> and then again there will be a marginal rate of substitution between <pause dur="0.4"/> all of the pairs of goods that the consumer has available to them <pause dur="0.5"/> so X-one and X-two there'll be a marginal rate of substitution between X<pause dur="0.3"/>-one and X-three <pause dur="0.4"/> and so on <pause dur="1.3"/> okay <pause dur="1.0"/> and that will simply be these ratios the ratios between these <pause dur="3.3"/> but all we're saying is that that mathematical form <pause dur="2.4"/> can represent that <pause dur="0.6"/> we're not saying that the consumer goes in the shop <pause dur="0.5"/> and gets out a calculator <pause dur="0.2"/> with that sort of 
mathematical function imprinted in it we're saying that <pause dur="0.2"/> that is a mathematical way of representing the preferences that we've said <pause dur="0.2"/> the consumer might have the model that we've we've actually built up <pause dur="4.1"/><kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="12"/> okay <pause dur="0.2"/><vocal desc="cough" iterated="n"/><pause dur="5.5"/> an alternative form <pause dur="3.9"/> might be as follows <pause dur="12.1"/> these are linear <pause dur="0.7"/> indifference curves straight lines <pause dur="7.3"/> okay <pause dur="4.7"/> they're different to the previous ones because the other ones are convex <pause dur="1.1"/> they're curved <pause dur="0.6"/> these ones are straight lines <pause dur="0.4"/> how much <pause dur="0.2"/> or to what extent does the marginal rate of substitution change as you go up and down on the indifference curve like this <pause dur="2.8"/> go up go down </u><pause dur="0.2"/><u who="sm0758" trans="pause"> constant </u><u who="sf0759" trans="latching"> constant </u><u who="nm0757" trans="latching"> it's constant yeah <pause dur="0.2"/> so the marginal rate of substitution <pause dur="0.2"/> doesn't change <pause dur="1.0"/> it's constant <pause dur="2.2"/> okay <pause dur="0.6"/> it's still going to be <pause dur="0.5"/> that ratio <trunc>al</trunc> A alpha over beta <pause dur="1.6"/> okay because the alpha the coefficient <unclear>of X-four</unclear> <pause dur="0.2"/> represented marginal utility of X-one <pause dur="0.3"/> and the beta represented marginal utility of X-two <pause dur="0.2"/> so the marginal rate of substitution is still exactly the same and in every one of these it's exactly the same <pause dur="0.4"/> 
mathematically <pause dur="0.5"/> but in this case it doesn't change <pause dur="0.6"/> it's it's going to remain exactly constant <pause dur="0.3"/> what sort of goods demonstrate would have that sort of <pause dur="0.7"/> of # <pause dur="0.2"/> indifference curve <pause dur="3.3"/> what we're saying is <pause dur="0.3"/> that <pause dur="1.0"/> your margin utility <pause dur="0.8"/> okay <pause dur="0.2"/> doesn't change according to how much you have <pause dur="0.9"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> the rate at which you substitute between the two goods remains exactly the same <pause dur="0.6"/> so if you <trunc>alwa</trunc> you will always require for example <pause dur="0.3"/> two units of X-one to replace one unit of X-two <pause dur="2.8"/> have you got any idea of the sorts of goods we might <pause dur="0.3"/> see that with <pause dur="4.0"/> how substitutable are these goods <pause dur="4.3"/> do you think <pause dur="1.7"/> very substitutable or <pause dur="0.2"/> not very substitutable <pause dur="2.5"/> very <pause dur="0.3"/> yeah <pause dur="0.5"/> these are perfect substitutes <pause dur="2.1"/> okay <pause dur="0.5"/> that doesn't mean that the marginal rate of substitution is one I-E <pause dur="0.4"/> one unit for one unit one unit of X-one for one unit of X-two <pause dur="0.2"/> but it does mean <pause dur="0.2"/> that the rate of substitution doesn't change at all <pause dur="1.4"/> it remains exactly the same <pause dur="0.3"/> hence they are perfect substitutes for one another <pause dur="0.6"/> and that remains exactly the <pause dur="0.3"/> the same 
however much you have <pause dur="2.2"/> and a function <pause dur="0.8"/> that would represent that <pause dur="0.9"/> is simply alpha-X-one plus beta-X-two <pause dur="2.3"/> okay <pause dur="2.3"/> the marginal rate of substitution is again alpha over beta <pause dur="0.6"/> it's the ratio <pause dur="0.3"/> okay <pause dur="0.2"/> of of the two <pause dur="1.8"/> because alpha's the marginal utility of X-one beta's <trunc>u</trunc> marginal utility of X-two <pause dur="0.2"/> but in this case it remains it's <pause dur="0.2"/> it's a constant <pause dur="1.7"/> okay <pause dur="0.6"/> # however much X-one or X-two the consumer has these are perfect substitutes for one another <pause dur="2.2"/> okay <pause dur="2.2"/> these of course are easy to handle 'cause they're linear <pause dur="0.7"/> it's a very <trunc>s</trunc> simple function <pause dur="0.4"/> but again all we're saying is that if that was <pause dur="0.8"/> if we had two goods <pause dur="0.6"/> for which the consumer <pause dur="0.4"/> you know <pause dur="0.4"/> # regarded them as perfectly <pause dur="0.3"/> # substitutable <pause dur="0.5"/> then that that would represent that <pause dur="1.9"/> okay <pause dur="0.6"/> alpha-X-one plus beta-X-two <pause dur="2.3"/> and <pause dur="0.7"/> so that is the perfect substitute case which is one extreme <pause dur="0.8"/> away from <pause dur="0.4"/> the convex <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> indifference curves that we <pause dur="0.8"/> we saw before <pause dur="2.8"/> the other extreme <pause dur="1.0"/> <trunc>i</trunc> is as follows <pause dur="19.2"/><kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="17"/> right-angled indifference curves <pause dur="3.8"/> have you any idea what sort of grid this

actually give you any more satisfaction because you need another left shoe presumably to consume with it <pause dur="0.6"/> or <pause dur="0.2"/> if you like <pause dur="0.2"/> a certain combination of of milk and and coffee in a drink <pause dur="1.1"/> if you add more milk <pause dur="0.6"/> then you don't get any extra satisfaction <pause dur="0.6"/> and that combination <pause dur="1.1"/> is that point there <pause dur="1.9"/> 
okay that combination says well in this case you require equal amounts of X-one and X-two so it could be left and right shoes for example <pause dur="1.8"/> okay <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> you have to consume them in that combination if you have more X-one <pause dur="0.8"/> okay which is going out along here <pause dur="0.9"/> you don't get any more satisfaction at all <pause dur="0.9"/> it remains exactly the same 'cause you don't go to another indifference curve <pause dur="0.6"/> and likewise if you have more X-two <pause dur="0.3"/> you don't get any more satisfaction <pause dur="0.2"/> you remain on the same indifference curve <pause dur="1.2"/> okay <pause dur="0.6"/> so <pause dur="1.7"/> the only way you get more satisfaction <pause dur="0.5"/> is <pause dur="0.7"/> to <pause dur="1.1"/> move up <pause dur="0.9"/> here <pause dur="1.1"/> on a line <pause dur="5.6"/> with the same combinations of X-one and X-two <pause dur="0.2"/> I-E <pause dur="0.7"/> you need more <pause dur="0.5"/> of both goods in exactly the same ratio <pause dur="0.2"/> to get more satisfaction <pause dur="2.1"/> if you get more 
of one and no more of the other <pause dur="0.4"/> you don't get any more satisfaction at all because you <trunc>m</trunc> you need to consume the two goods together <pause dur="2.2"/> okay <pause dur="0.9"/> now <pause dur="1.9"/> this <pause dur="1.1"/> is the other extreme of course perfect complements perfect substitutes <pause dur="1.0"/> it is however slightly <pause dur="1.0"/> # unrealistic <pause dur="0.9"/> <trunc>i</trunc> in in some senses because <pause dur="1.2"/> what we're saying is that if the consumer has this amount of the two goods so <pause dur="0.5"/> like milk and coffee <pause dur="0.8"/> so in this case the consumer would have white very milky coffee in the sense that they require <pause dur="0.3"/> the same quantities of both <pause dur="0.7"/> okay half and half <pause dur="1.9"/> what we're then saying is okay if this consumer was given <pause dur="0.3"/> coffee <pause dur="0.2"/> with more and more milk <pause dur="1.2"/> the amount of satisfaction they get <pause dur="0.7"/> doesn't go up it doesn't go down <pause dur="1.6"/> okay <pause dur="0.9"/> so they don't get any extra satisfaction <pause dur="0.5"/> but they don't get disutility either <pause dur="1.7"/> now <pause dur="0.2"/> that is probably unrealistic <pause dur="0.3"/> because what probably happens actually is that they require in this case same amount of milk the same amount of coffee <pause dur="0.4"/> but if they get more or less of one <pause dur="0.3"/> their actual utility 
goes down <pause dur="0.4"/> okay because the coffee gets more and more milk they don't like it <pause dur="0.2"/> hence their level of satisfaction goes down <pause dur="1.3"/> okay <pause dur="1.4"/> and we're assuming having the green lines here that that doesn't happen <pause dur="1.3"/> okay so they're perfect complements but if they get out of synch with one another <pause dur="1.0"/> they # you don't get disutility <pause dur="1.1"/> if you get disutility <pause dur="0.7"/> then in fact the indifference curve would simply be <pause dur="2.3"/> the points <pause dur="1.4"/> okay <pause dur="3.5"/> up here <pause dur="0.5"/> because <pause dur="0.3"/> the goods would have to be consumed in absolutely those quantities <pause dur="0.8"/> any other <pause dur="0.2"/> spoils everything <pause dur="1.7"/> okay <pause dur="2.4"/> so in certain cases extreme cases it could be that <pause dur="0.2"/> you have to consume them in <pause dur="0.2"/> absolute quantities <pause dur="0.7"/> in the same ratio <pause dur="0.2"/> or <pause dur="0.5"/> you got no utility at all <pause dur="1.5"/> okay <pause dur="0.2"/><vocal desc="cough" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.2"/> and we're assuming here that that's <pause dur="0.9"/> not quite <pause dur="0.3"/> the extreme <pause dur="0.6"/> okay there is <pause dur="0.9"/> there are these combinations you have to consume them in <pause dur="0.4"/> but <pause dur="0.4"/> if you don't <pause dur="0.9"/> then <pause dur="0.4"/> # you don't get disutility but you don't get any more utility <pause dur="1.5"/> okay <pause dur="1.8"/> how we represent this <pause dur="1.1"/> algebraically is with a very strange <pause dur="2.0"/> function which is minimum <pause dur="0.7"/> alpha-X-one <pause dur="0.4"/> 
comma <pause dur="0.3"/> beta-X-two <pause dur="3.9"/> that is the <pause dur="0.4"/> again alpha is the marginal utility of X-one beta is the marginal utility of X-two <pause dur="1.7"/> the ratio between them will give you the marginal rate of substitution <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> but <pause dur="1.0"/> imagine utility is entirely determined by <pause dur="0.9"/> the <pause dur="0.4"/> good <pause dur="1.4"/> okay which <pause dur="0.4"/> is in the lowest amount <pause dur="1.7"/> okay <pause dur="0.2"/> so there may be excess amounts of one good <pause dur="1.7"/> so you might have say <pause dur="0.2"/> ten units of coffee <pause dur="0.5"/> and thirty units of milk <pause dur="1.4"/> but clearly you'd only use <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.8"/> ten units of milk because you'd need it to go in the coffee <pause dur="1.0"/> okay you'd you could use them in <pause dur="0.2"/> in equal amounts <pause dur="1.4"/> the excess amount of milk doesn't give any <trunc>diss</trunc> dissatisfaction but it doesn't give any satisfaction and so <pause dur="0.2"/> the amount of utility the consumer gets is entirely <trunc>con</trunc> # constrained by the amount of coffee <pause dur="0.3"/> the thing that's in short supply <pause dur="0.9"/> okay <pause dur="0.3"/> and that's the sort of function that would <pause dur="0.3"/> would represent that <pause dur="1.3"/> okay <pause dur="1.9"/> so what we're saying <pause dur="1.7"/><kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="4"/> is that <pause dur="0.6"/> we can represent all types of <pause dur="0.2"/> of preference <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="2.1"/> perfect substitutes <pause dur="0.6"/> like that <pause dur="4.4"/> # perfect complements <pause dur="0.2"/> like that <pause dur="1.0"/> 
and the normal case <pause dur="0.3"/> with convex indifference curves like that <pause dur="0.9"/> and what we do is to represent these <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> types of preference <pause dur="7.8"/> okay <pause dur="0.2"/> mathematically <pause dur="1.7"/> and all we're saying is that <pause dur="0.6"/> if we look at <pause dur="0.8"/> the preferences that consumers have <pause dur="0.7"/> the way in which they trade off <pause dur="0.3"/> between the goods that are available to them <pause dur="0.6"/> and we observe that <pause dur="0.2"/> for some goods <pause dur="0.2"/> that have <trunc>o</trunc> # substitutes that is the consumer <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> doesn't really care which they have <pause dur="0.3"/> and will trade off between them at a rate that doesn't change <pause dur="2.2"/> or if we observe their perfect complements the other extreme <pause dur="0.2"/> these goods are always consumed in exactly the same quantities <pause dur="1.0"/> okay <pause dur="0.2"/> in a particular combination because that's how the two go together <pause dur="0.2"/> to produce something else and on their own they don't give any utillity <pause dur="0.9"/> or <pause dur="0.5"/> the middle case which is <trunc>w</trunc> <trunc>w</trunc> what we would normally # observe <pause dur="0.3"/> we think <pause dur="0.4"/> that in fact <pause dur="0.6"/> the goods <pause dur="0.8"/> are not perfect complements or <trunc>per</trunc> perfect substitutes there is substitutability <pause dur="0.6"/> between the two goods the amount 
of substitutability <pause dur="0.4"/> will depend on the slope <pause dur="0.7"/> so <pause dur="0.2"/> the flatter <pause dur="0.3"/> this indifference curve is <pause dur="0.7"/> this board's getting worse <pause dur="0.3"/> so if it was like <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="1"/> that <pause dur="1.8"/> that would mean <trunc>act</trunc> actually there's not that much <trunc>s</trunc> # # <pause dur="0.2"/> sorry there's a lot of substitutability between those goods <pause dur="0.8"/> okay <pause dur="0.2"/> 'cause it's it's getting towards flat it does change <pause dur="0.4"/> but not that much <pause dur="1.9"/> so we'd be erring in this direction here <pause dur="1.4"/> okay <pause dur="4.2"/> and maybe if we had indifference curves that were like that <pause dur="0.9"/> we'd now erring in this direction here towards perfect complements <pause dur="1.3"/> so the <pause dur="0.2"/> the slope of the indifference curve of course <pause dur="0.2"/> differs <pause dur="0.6"/> but we do have these two extremes perfect substitutes and perfect complements <pause dur="1.2"/> okay <pause dur="1.1"/> # <pause dur="2.8"/> we can represent <pause dur="0.2"/> these so if we observe these types of preference <pause dur="0.7"/> we can represent them <pause dur="0.7"/> in an algebraic way <pause dur="0.2"/> using functions that we've just looked at <pause dur="1.1"/> okay <pause dur="0.3"/> they're ordinal functions which means that all that matters is the higher the number <pause dur="0.2"/> the higher the indifference curve <pause dur="0.4"/> it means that <pause dur="0.5"/> if we have a number <pause dur="0.3"/> # which is higher <pause dur="0.4"/> for example 
we'd be on this indifference curve rather than that one <pause dur="0.4"/> perhaps <pause dur="1.8"/> we're not saying how much <pause dur="0.2"/> they differ <pause dur="1.7"/> we're not saying we can measure utility we are not saying that if the number is higher that means the consumer gets <pause dur="0.2"/> twice the amount of utility <pause dur="1.7"/> we're not doing that because we <pause dur="0.3"/> know we can't measure utility <pause dur="0.3"/> but also we don't need to <pause dur="1.1"/> if all we're interested in <pause dur="0.2"/> is how much of the goods the consumer consumes <pause dur="0.3"/> 'cause that's what we're interested in <pause dur="0.2"/> the choice the consumer makes <pause dur="0.3"/> which we assume is <trunc>meas</trunc> is driven by utility <pause dur="0.7"/> okay they want to maximize then the the degree to which they meet their needs and wants <pause dur="0.4"/> we measure that as this idea of utility or preference whatever <pause dur="0.9"/> we don't actually need to measure <pause dur="0.2"/> preference or utility <pause dur="1.3"/> in a <trunc>c</trunc> in a cardinal sense <pause dur="0.3"/> all we need to know <pause dur="0.7"/> is that the consumer does get the highest level of utility they possibly can <pause dur="1.0"/> okay <pause dur="0.5"/> and to do that we represent these preferences <pause dur="0.5"/> using these mathematical forms <pause dur="1.3"/> okay <pause dur="2.1"/> the mathematical form we use 
depends on the type of preferences we see if they're perfect substitutes <pause dur="0.4"/> then we use the type of function <pause dur="0.3"/> that we've just looked at <pause dur="0.5"/> okay <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.9"/> alpha-X-one plus alpha # plus beta-X-two <pause dur="1.1"/> if <pause dur="0.2"/> we observe they're perfect complements we use minimum <pause dur="0.3"/> alpha-X-one <pause dur="0.8"/> beta-X-two <pause dur="1.7"/> more normally we would <pause dur="0.4"/> # we would have preferences like in in the middle case <pause dur="1.1"/> they would differ in the amount of substitutability complementarity <pause dur="0.4"/> and that would be represented in <pause dur="0.2"/> the alpha and beta values <pause dur="0.2"/> but we would use a function which was <pause dur="0.3"/> # X-one<pause dur="0.3"/>-to-the-alpha <pause dur="0.3"/> X-two-to-the-beta <pause dur="0.3"/> which is the normal <pause dur="0.2"/> form we would use those <trunc>am</trunc> those the values of alpha and beta <pause dur="0.2"/> represent the marginal utilities <pause dur="0.4"/> and therefore the ratio represents the marginal rate of substitution and that will differ according to all the goods that the consumer has <pause dur="0.4"/> and will differ between every consumer according to their preferences <pause dur="1.2"/> okay <pause dur="1.1"/> but all we're saying is that we can represent now <pause dur="0.6"/> these ideas that we've built up <pause dur="0.3"/> the ideas on preference <pause dur="0.3"/> 
and the the the <pause dur="0.2"/> properties that preferences have <pause dur="0.5"/> in a in a mathematical sense <pause dur="0.8"/> which means we can do it for any number of goods we want we're not constrained to three <pause dur="0.2"/> which we are here <pause dur="0.7"/><kinesic desc="indicates point on board" iterated="n"/> and we can now put it together <pause dur="0.2"/> and we can actually produce something that will allow us to measure <pause dur="0.2"/> the marginal rate of substitution <pause dur="0.6"/> which is a useful piece of information <pause dur="1.0"/> to <pause dur="0.2"/> predict <pause dur="0.2"/> the choices that a consumer will make <pause dur="0.4"/> in particular circumstances <pause dur="0.8"/> which is vaguely interesting <pause dur="1.2"/> most interesting <pause dur="0.3"/> we can <pause dur="0.2"/> put it together to <trunc>u</trunc> to build up a model that allows us to predict <pause dur="0.3"/> what happens if things change <pause dur="0.3"/> if this is what the consumer chooses now <pause dur="1.3"/> what happens if <pause dur="0.6"/> something a factor that influences their choices <pause dur="0.2"/> 
changes <pause dur="0.7"/> prices go up <pause dur="0.2"/> income goes down whatever <pause dur="0.4"/> that is very useful <pause dur="0.4"/> 'cause it allows us to derive elasticities <pause dur="0.2"/> for example <pause dur="1.0"/> and that is useful information <pause dur="0.4"/> somebody who wants to market a product wants to know <pause dur="0.3"/> if i increase my price ten per cent <pause dur="0.3"/> how much does demand change will my revenue go up or will my revenue go down <pause dur="0.4"/> what happens if my competitor <pause dur="0.3"/> changes their price <pause dur="0.2"/> reduces their price by five per cent <pause dur="0.3"/> how much is the demand for my product going to change <pause dur="2.1"/> so being able to represent all of this these notions <pause dur="0.3"/> in an algebraic sense allows us to <pause dur="0.2"/> to produce that sort of model <pause dur="0.9"/> okay and that's what we want to do <pause dur="0.5"/> okay let's take a a break there and then when we come back what we're going to do is to put the two sides together <pause dur="0.5"/> okay </u><gap reason="break in recording" extent="uncertain"/> <u who="nm0757" trans="pause">

effectively <pause dur="1.4"/> we've represented <pause dur="0.2"/> that <pause dur="0.7"/> through a series of indifference curves and they're i i <trunc>o</trunc> <pause dur="0.7"/> we emphasize again <pause dur="0.3"/> we're not saying that the consumer goes into the supermarket with indifference curves or utility functions whatever <pause dur="1.0"/> what we're saying is we can represent <pause dur="0.5"/> how they make their choices in this way <pause dur="0.8"/> okay in this <trunc>s</trunc> sort of <pause dur="0.8"/> abstract model <pause dur="1.5"/> and putting the two sides together <pause dur="0.2"/> it will be the point at which <pause dur="0.7"/> the budget line <pause dur="0.3"/> just touches their highest indifference curve <pause dur="1.2"/> okay <pause dur="0.3"/> and that will be the choice they make <pause dur="0.6"/> that amount of X-one <pause dur="0.3"/> that amount of X-two <pause dur="1.1"/> okay <pause dur="2.4"/> if <pause dur="0.5"/> their income changes <pause dur="0.3"/> the choice will change <pause dur="0.9"/> if the price of any of the goods changes <pause dur="0.5"/> their choice will change <pause dur="0.7"/> if their preferences change <pause dur="1.1"/> then the choice may change <pause dur="0.5"/> okay so if <pause dur="0.3"/> there's an advertising campaign <pause dur="0.2"/> about one of the goods say X-one <pause dur="0.3"/> that shifts their preferences so they like X-one more then their choice may change <pause dur="0.7"/> okay <pause dur="0.5"/> and we're going to look at those sorts of changes <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> next week <pause dur="1.1"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> but <pause dur="0.6"/> those 
are the sorts of <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.8"/> changes <pause dur="0.3"/> that might go on <pause dur="0.4"/> and that would be reflected <pause dur="0.4"/> in a shift in <pause dur="0.4"/> the position of that point the choice that the consumer actually makes <pause dur="0.9"/> okay <pause dur="3.2"/> now <pause dur="0.8"/> we can represent that also <pause dur="0.8"/> # algebraically <pause dur="1.3"/> by just putting together <pause dur="3.1"/><kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="3"/> these elements here <pause dur="1.0"/> okay <pause dur="0.4"/> because we've been able <pause dur="0.4"/> we've said to represent <pause dur="0.5"/> mathematically <pause dur="0.2"/> these the indifference curves through this utility function <pause dur="1.0"/> and the availability set through <pause dur="0.4"/> this budget constraint <pause dur="0.7"/> and through these non-negativities <pause dur="0.3"/> so you can't consume negative amounts <pause dur="1.8"/> and <pause dur="1.0"/> so we can represent this <pause dur="1.1"/><kinesic desc="indicates point on board" iterated="y" dur="1"/> mathematically it is simply that we want to <pause dur="3.1"/> maximize <pause dur="0.9"/> that utility function <pause dur="1.9"/> 
okay we want to be on the highest indifference curve possible <pause dur="0.5"/> that's how you want to think about it <pause dur="0.3"/> we want to maximize <pause dur="0.4"/> the utility the consumer gets and what we've done is to represent that <pause dur="0.2"/> through this utility function <pause dur="1.2"/> whatever its mathematical form <pause dur="0.5"/> and all that mathematical form does is to represent <pause dur="0.4"/> the way in which the consumer <pause dur="0.3"/> thinks about the goods the preferences the consumer has <pause dur="0.3"/> perfect complements <pause dur="0.2"/> perfect substitutes <pause dur="0.4"/> anything in between <pause dur="0.3"/> and that will depend on the individual <pause dur="0.4"/> one individual may regard <pause dur="0.2"/> products as <pause dur="0.3"/> perfect substitutes and another individual may not <pause dur="1.1"/> okay <pause dur="0.4"/> but all we're doing is representing how they see <pause dur="0.3"/> those goods <pause dur="0.4"/> in some mathematical sense <pause dur="1.9"/> and we'll maximize that <pause dur="0.9"/> okay <pause dur="0.4"/> and that would go to infinity if they weren't constrained but they are <pause dur="5.0"/> they're subject to <pause dur="0.3"/> two <pause dur="1.0"/> basic constraints <pause dur="0.3"/> the first <pause dur="1.7"/> is the budget line <pause dur="6.4"/> so they can maximize this <pause dur="1.3"/> freely <pause dur="0.4"/> until they hit this <pause dur="1.5"/> they can't spend more than they earn <pause dur="1.6"/> okay <pause dur="2.4"/> so 
they hit this budget line <pause dur="1.4"/> and secondly <pause dur="1.3"/> the non-negativities <pause dur="5.6"/> you can't consume <pause dur="0.3"/> less than zero of a good however much you hate it <pause dur="0.3"/><vocal desc="cough" iterated="n"/><pause dur="1.5"/> now that is obvious in real life but mathematically we have to <pause dur="0.3"/> allow for all eventualities because <pause dur="0.2"/> what we've now done <pause dur="0.5"/> is to say okay <pause dur="0.4"/> we can represent all these things that we can see go on and the assumptions we've made <pause dur="0.3"/> and what we can do <pause dur="0.3"/> is we can <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.8"/> now represent that this in this way because it's now mathematical <pause dur="0.2"/> we of course have to stop it doing stupid things <pause dur="0.6"/> okay <pause dur="0.3"/> when we run this <pause dur="0.5"/> and so we have to include those <pause dur="2.4"/> and that is the basic model <pause dur="0.8"/> that says <pause dur="0.3"/> what the consumer will do <pause dur="0.6"/> when faced with all of the goods and services that are available to them <pause dur="1.2"/> is they will select between those goods and services on the basis of their own personal preferences <pause dur="1.6"/> and we can represent those preferences <pause dur="1.1"/> in <pause dur="0.4"/> the mathematical sense <pause dur="0.9"/> okay <pause dur="0.2"/> and that mathematical representation <pause dur="0.2"/> will encapsulate will include <pause dur="0.3"/> all of the properties <pause dur="0.3"/> that we <pause dur="0.3"/> have observed <pause dur="0.6"/> okay in 
consumer preferences things like transitivity <pause dur="0.2"/> things like non-satiation <pause dur="0.5"/> things like the fact that the marginal rate of substitution diminishes <pause dur="0.5"/> # as or changes as the amount of the goods change because the marginal utility's changed <pause dur="0.3"/> all of those things that we can see <pause dur="1.4"/> okay <pause dur="1.1"/> # and which <pause dur="0.3"/> we know we think <pause dur="0.6"/> influence the way in which <trunc>pe</trunc> # people trade off the goods that they <unclear>based</unclear> <pause dur="0.6"/> we can represent that in within this <pause dur="0.6"/> and <pause dur="0.3"/> the mathematical form we use <pause dur="0.4"/> okay will depend on what we observed <pause dur="0.5"/> okay perfect substitutes we've one form <pause dur="0.6"/> perfect complements another form <pause dur="0.3"/> any other <pause dur="0.3"/> # type <pause dur="0.2"/> we use another form <pause dur="1.3"/> relative values of alpha and beta will again reflect those trade offs how much they like the two goods <pause dur="0.3"/> and how that <pause dur="0.2"/> rate of trade off changes <pause dur="0.2"/> as you get more and less of the goods <pause dur="0.4"/> okay so all of that can be represented <pause dur="1.2"/> and that's all that is doing <pause dur="0.5"/> is representing the way in which the consumer makes those choices <pause dur="1.1"/> again we're not saying that's how they make them we're 
saying that we can represent it in that way <pause dur="2.1"/> and they can <pause dur="0.5"/> do that they <trunc>c</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> they make their choices but they're constrained <pause dur="0.8"/> in so doing <pause dur="0.9"/> because well first of all the non-negativities which are fairly obvious <pause dur="0.9"/> but they're constrained by <pause dur="0.4"/> just economic facts of life <pause dur="0.7"/> the fact that they <pause dur="0.4"/> face these prices which are non-zero so they have to pay for the goods <pause dur="0.3"/> and that's out of their control as an individual consumer <pause dur="1.5"/> okay <pause dur="0.7"/> and they also face their income which at any point in time when they make a choice is fixed <pause dur="0.8"/> okay <pause dur="0.3"/> it will depend on <pause dur="0.4"/> their <pause dur="1.3"/> money income from employment from other sources it will depend on their savings decisions in the past <pause dur="0.5"/> # access to credit and and all that <pause dur="0.4"/> but <trunc>th</trunc> at the point they make their choice will be fixed <pause dur="0.9"/> okay <pause dur="0.6"/> and so <pause dur="1.0"/> what we've done is to break down <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="1.1"/> the choices into these two parts <pause dur="0.5"/> and <pause dur="0.4"/> <trunc>pu</trunc> pulled together <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> the parts that we consider most important <pause dur="0.8"/> okay <pause dur="1.4"/> now of course <pause dur="0.4"/> this model <pause dur="1.5"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> includes and there are certain elements of it include an awful lot of 
factors <pause dur="1.5"/> like utility preferences will include an awful lot of things that influence preferences like advertising access to information <pause dur="0.3"/> your own attitudes and beliefs about # the product about the world whatever <pause dur="0.6"/> and those will change over time <pause dur="1.0"/> and they will be different between individuals every individual will be different <pause dur="0.8"/> and hence <pause dur="0.2"/> this will change <pause dur="0.9"/> but at the point where the consumer <pause dur="0.2"/> stands in the supermarket or or whatever <pause dur="0.7"/> that is fixed <pause dur="0.3"/> okay at the point at which they make the choice <pause dur="0.7"/> the next time they make the choice <pause dur="0.3"/> that may be different <pause dur="0.4"/> that's okay <pause dur="0.5"/> but at the point that they make the choice <pause dur="0.5"/> that will be fixed <pause dur="0.5"/> just like this is fixed <pause dur="1.6"/> and we might be interested in knowing <pause dur="0.2"/> how this differs <pause dur="0.4"/> and the impact of changes in this <pause dur="1.0"/> okay and that's fine so we might <pause dur="0.2"/> be interested in looking at <pause dur="0.2"/> well if a consumer makes a choice now and then they make it next week after there's been an advertising campaign whatever <pause dur="0.3"/> we might be interested in knowing how that has 
changed <pause dur="1.1"/> okay that may be one of the variables that we want to consider <pause dur="0.8"/> but at the point they make the choice standing there <pause dur="0.2"/> that is fixed <pause dur="0.9"/> okay <pause dur="1.2"/> likewise these may change from week to week month to month or whatever <pause dur="0.2"/> but at the point <pause dur="0.4"/> where they're facing a choice at any point in time <pause dur="0.2"/> those are fixed <pause dur="2.1"/> and so what we've done is represent the choices that the consumer makes <pause dur="0.4"/> in this this algebraic sense <pause dur="1.5"/> what that allows us to do <pause dur="0.9"/> is to <pause dur="0.4"/> mathematically <pause dur="0.9"/> # <pause dur="1.5"/> look at the choices people make <pause dur="0.4"/> we can look at <pause dur="0.2"/> the prices people face <pause dur="0.2"/> the incomes they face <pause dur="0.3"/> we can represent their preferences through some utility function <pause dur="0.2"/> and we look at choice <pause dur="1.6"/> okay <pause dur="0.3"/> that combination of the two goods in this case <pause dur="0.5"/> that the consumer's likely to choose <pause dur="0.4"/> and we can then use that model <pause dur="0.8"/> to look at <pause dur="0.2"/> what happens if things change if the price of X-one <pause dur="0.2"/> doubles what's going to happen <pause dur="0.2"/> are they going to stop consuming X-one altogether <pause dur="0.2"/> or do they like X-one so much <pause dur="0.3"/> that they only reduce their consumption by a little 
bit <pause dur="0.4"/> and so on <pause dur="0.8"/> okay so that's what we can <pause dur="0.3"/> we can do with this <pause dur="1.5"/> we can also represent <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> the optimal point <pause dur="0.6"/> okay we can consider <pause dur="1.0"/> what happens at the point where they actually <pause dur="1.8"/> made their choices <pause dur="12.5"/> let me # <pause dur="0.7"/> quickly <pause dur="0.3"/> put this down again <pause dur="9.4"/><kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="5"/> okay so that's the point at which they make their <pause dur="0.2"/> that's the optimal point <pause dur="1.4"/> okay <pause dur="1.4"/> and we can consider <pause dur="1.7"/> what are what <pause dur="0.4"/> what are the conditions <pause dur="0.5"/> # which must be satisfied <pause dur="0.7"/> for <pause dur="0.6"/> for the consumer to be at an optimum <pause dur="0.2"/> for them to actually be <trunc>ma</trunc> <pause dur="0.4"/> achieving <pause dur="0.3"/> the maximum level of satisfaction they can <pause dur="2.5"/> and there are two <pause dur="0.6"/> basic conditions <pause dur="2.7"/> first of all <pause dur="0.5"/> they must be using all of their income <pause dur="2.6"/> okay <pause dur="1.1"/> because <pause dur="0.6"/> we're assuming that we've included within <pause dur="0.3"/> our framework all of the things that give utility and remember this is a world where <pause dur="0.4"/> people get utility from consumption <pause dur="1.7"/> we can include if people like lots of money in the bank we can include that as well because we can include savings <pause dur="0.4"/> as a source of utility that's that's okay <pause dur="0.7"/> but what we have done is we've included <pause dur="0.3"/> 
within their utility function <pause dur="0.2"/> within the idea of our indifference curves everything that gives them satisfaction <pause dur="0.2"/> and hence <pause dur="0.6"/> at the end of the day <pause dur="0.3"/> they must allocate all of their incomings to to those things that give them satisfaction <pause dur="0.5"/> including maybe savings <pause dur="1.3"/> so first of all that must be the case their expenditure <pause dur="0.6"/> which is this <pause dur="1.3"/><kinesic desc="indicates point on board" iterated="n"/> that's their total expenditure <pause dur="6.1"/> must equal <pause dur="0.9"/> their money income <pause dur="4.5"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="5"/> okay <pause dur="2.4"/> that's the first thing that must be <pause dur="0.6"/> # must occur <pause dur="9.5"/> so that means they're going to be on their budget line <pause dur="1.9"/> okay <pause dur="1.3"/> providing we've included everything in the in here that gives them utility they must be on their budget line because they don't get any utility from not allocating their income <pause dur="1.4"/> that's the first # <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> thing we would we would see <pause dur="3.1"/> so their expenditure's not going to be less than their income it's going to be exactly equal to it of course it can't be more <pause dur="1.5"/> the second <pause dur="0.5"/> is that they are at this point here <pause dur="1.2"/> okay they're at that point there <pause dur="7.0"/> okay that means that the slope of the budget line <pause dur="1.2"/> is 
equal to the slope of the indifference curve <pause dur="1.0"/> okay 'cause at that point there <pause dur="0.2"/> they're going to be exactly the same <pause dur="0.9"/> the slope of their <pause dur="0.2"/> budget line <pause dur="0.9"/> and the slope of their indifference curve <pause dur="0.2"/> are going to be exactly the same <pause dur="2.3"/> and that's the second condition <pause dur="0.9"/> okay <pause dur="1.7"/> what is the slope of the budget line <pause dur="0.9"/> equal to </u><pause dur="1.9"/> <u who="sm0761" trans="pause"> inverse price ratio </u><pause dur="0.2"/> <u who="nm0757" trans="pause"> sorry </u><pause dur="0.5"/> <u who="sm0761" trans="pause"> inverse price ratio </u><pause dur="0.2"/> <u who="nm0757" trans="pause"> okay <pause dur="0.2"/> so it's the ratio of the prices yeah <pause dur="8.0"/> so the slope of that at any point is equal to p-one over p-two <pause dur="0.3"/> and it's exactly constant of course it's a straight line the prices do not depend on how much the <pause dur="0.2"/> the # consumer chooses <pause dur="0.3"/> so that one's linear that's a straight line <pause dur="1.8"/> what's the slope of the indifference curve <pause dur="0.3"/> what's the marginal rate of substitution </u><pause dur="7.9"/> <u who="sf0762" trans="pause"> it's the ratio of marginal utility </u><u who="nm0757" trans="latching"> okay <pause dur="0.4"/> it's the ratio of the marginal utility so the the slope of this <pause dur="1.6"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="5"/> is equal to marg utility of X-one <pause dur="1.0"/> over marg utility of X-two <pause dur="2.2"/> and at the optimum <pause dur="4.3"/> they must be equal <pause dur="1.8"/> okay <pause dur="0.3"/> the ratio of prices must be equal to the ratio of the marginal utility <pause dur="2.6"/> 
okay <pause dur="8.7"/> now <pause dur="0.5"/> you you know that that is equal to the marginal rate of substitution <pause dur="0.5"/> okay <pause dur="0.6"/> but in fact that is what is termed <pause dur="0.2"/> the marginal rate for substitution <pause dur="1.0"/> in consumption what it is <pause dur="0.3"/> is the rate at which the consumer <pause dur="0.3"/> wants to substitute <pause dur="0.2"/> between the goods <pause dur="1.2"/> given their preferences how they feel about the goods <pause dur="1.1"/> that is the rate at which they <pause dur="0.2"/> are willing to trade off between them <pause dur="1.5"/> okay or willing to trade off X-one and X-two or whatever goods we're dealing with <pause dur="1.4"/> okay <pause dur="3.3"/> so given their preferences that is the rate at which they are willing to trade them off <pause dur="0.5"/> and at this and it this is at that point there <pause dur="0.3"/> it depends on how much of the two goods because <pause dur="0.3"/> we this is convex to the origin <pause dur="0.5"/> so this differs this changes <pause dur="0.3"/> when diminishes as we move from the top to the bottom <pause dur="2.1"/> this <pause dur="0.8"/> is also the marginal rate of substitution <pause dur="1.3"/> this is the marginal rate of substitution in exchange <pause dur="0.2"/> it is the rate at which they are able <pause dur="0.2"/> to trade off the two goods <pause dur="1.6"/> and that is <pause dur="0.2"/> totally determined by their relative prices <pause dur="1.4"/> so the rate at 
which you are able <pause dur="0.2"/> to trade off <pause dur="0.3"/> one good for another <pause dur="0.2"/> depends on their relative price if one good <pause dur="0.3"/> is <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> costs you know a pound <pause dur="0.9"/> and another good costs fifty pence clearly then <pause dur="0.3"/> you can have you know two of the goods that cost fifty pence or one of the goods that cost a pound <pause dur="0.3"/> and that is totally determined by the prices out of your control <pause dur="0.9"/> okay <pause dur="0.2"/> but that is your your marginal rate of substitution <pause dur="0.2"/> all consumers' marginal rate of substitution in exchange <pause dur="0.2"/> is determined by the market place <pause dur="0.2"/> determined by the collective decisions of the suppliers <pause dur="0.2"/> and of all consumers <pause dur="0.8"/> but for you as an individual it's fixed because you are irrelevant within the market <pause dur="0.5"/> as a consumer <pause dur="1.2"/> and so at the optimal point <pause dur="0.5"/> we're saying <pause dur="0.3"/> that <pause dur="0.9"/> the rate at which the consumer is able to substitute between the goods <pause dur="0.4"/> determined by market prices <pause dur="0.4"/> is exactly equal to the rate at which they want to <trunc>consu</trunc> to to substitute between them <pause dur="0.5"/> which is determined by their ratio of marginal utilities <pause dur="1.1"/> okay <pause dur="0.2"/> so at the 
optimum <pause dur="0.6"/> it is the case that the marginal rate of substitution in exchange <pause dur="0.4"/> is exactly equal to the marginal rate of substitution in consumption <pause dur="0.4"/> the rate at which the consumers <pause dur="0.2"/> are able to substitute between the goods through market transactions <pause dur="0.3"/> is exactly equal to the rate at which they <pause dur="0.3"/> wish <pause dur="0.2"/> to substitute between them <pause dur="0.3"/> given their preferences <pause dur="1.6"/> okay <pause dur="4.7"/> the implication of that <pause dur="0.2"/> is that <pause dur="1.3"/> if we <pause dur="2.7"/> we order this we change this around <pause dur="1.1"/> okay <pause dur="1.2"/> what we find is that <pause dur="14.5"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="10"/> just rejigging this around we find that in fact that is equal to this expression here <pause dur="1.4"/> that at the optimum <pause dur="1.0"/> the ratio of the marginal utilities <pause dur="0.2"/> to the unit prices of the goods is exactly equal for every good that is <pause dur="0.4"/> the amount of utility you get <pause dur="0.9"/> for every unit of money spent <pause dur="0.7"/> is exactly the same for all of the goods <pause dur="1.4"/> okay <pause dur="0.4"/> so <pause dur="2.1"/> the marginal utility the amount of utility you get from consuming <pause dur="0.2"/> one extra unit of the good <pause dur="2.3"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="2"/> the ratio of that to the price that is how much it costs you <pause dur="0.4"/> to consume <pause dur="0.2"/> one extra unit of the good <pause dur="0.7"/> at the optimum <pause dur="0.6"/> is 
exactly equal <pause dur="0.5"/> for all of the goods you consume so the amount of utility <pause dur="0.4"/> for one unit of money <pause dur="0.6"/> is the same <pause dur="0.2"/> for X-one and for X-two <pause dur="1.1"/> can anyone remember what that is called <pause dur="1.9"/> you've done this in part one <pause dur="5.6"/> anyone remember <pause dur="3.5"/> this is termed the equimarginal principle <pause dur="0.8"/> okay <pause dur="0.7"/> if you remember you did it in part one with # looking at cardinal theory <trunc>wi</trunc> of consumer choice <pause dur="1.3"/> you said that what the <trunc>d</trunc> consumer does is they allocate <pause dur="0.3"/> their <pause dur="0.2"/> the goods and we assumed then we could measure it <pause dur="0.3"/> but what they did was they do it in such a way that <pause dur="0.2"/> the amount of income sorry the amount of utility they get for each of the <pause dur="0.3"/> for for the # <pause dur="0.2"/> unit amount of money they spend is the same for all the goods <pause dur="0.5"/> so it's not possible to allocate your money <pause dur="0.3"/> between the goods <pause dur="0.5"/> and get any extra utility <pause dur="1.1"/> so therefore you must be at the optimum <pause dur="0.3"/> okay you cannot reallocate your income <pause dur="0.3"/> in any way <pause dur="0.7"/> given the price of the goods <pause dur="0.2"/> and given the your preferences for those goods <pause dur="0.2"/> and achieve any <pause dur="0.6"/> extra utility <pause dur="0.4"/> this is called the 
equimarginal principle <pause dur="9.0"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="6"/> which you'll have met before <pause dur="0.7"/> so we end up in the <trunc>s</trunc> <trunc>t</trunc> in the same position <pause dur="0.9"/> okay as with other ideas <pause dur="0.6"/> but we're not measuring utility now <pause dur="0.4"/> we've represented it in a far more sophisticated model that we can actually <trunc>applo</trunc> employ <pause dur="0.4"/> to <pause dur="0.4"/> estimate things like elasticities to predict demand change in demand whatever <pause dur="0.4"/> but <pause dur="0.5"/> fundamentally it's based on the principle that consumers <pause dur="0.2"/> given their choices are driven by preferences that are individual to them <pause dur="0.4"/> and given they're constrained by their economic circumstances <pause dur="1.1"/> they will allocate their income in such a way <pause dur="0.3"/> given their preferences <pause dur="0.3"/> that <pause dur="0.2"/> they cannot achieve any extra utility they can't meet any more of their needs and wants <pause dur="0.3"/> by jigging around <pause dur="0.3"/> their <pause dur="0.9"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> their their allocation of their income between the goods <pause dur="3.7"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="2"/> this <pause dur="0.5"/> is also equal <pause dur="0.3"/> to <pause dur="0.2"/> U-M <pause dur="1.5"/> the marginal utility of their money income <pause dur="0.7"/> if the consumer was given <pause dur="0.2"/> a <pause dur="0.7"/> fractional increase in their money income <pause dur="1.5"/> okay <pause dur="1.2"/> at the optimum <pause dur="1.3"/> it wouldn't matter which good <pause dur="0.5"/> 
they bought more of <pause dur="0.8"/> their extra marginal utility would be exactly the same because it has been equated <pause dur="0.9"/> across <pause dur="0.2"/> the groups <pause dur="0.2"/> ratio of the marginal utilities to their money their money to their prices <pause dur="0.2"/> it's exactly the same so if they were given <pause dur="0.3"/> a fractional increase in income it wouldn't matter which good they allocated it to <pause dur="0.4"/> simply because the ratio of marginal utility to prices is the same for every one of them <pause dur="0.8"/> and so that <pause dur="0.3"/> is at the margin <pause dur="0.5"/> the marginal utility of their money income <pause dur="0.2"/> of money <pause dur="1.6"/> okay <pause dur="3.5"/> so <pause dur="0.6"/> what we've done <pause dur="0.5"/> is to build up <pause dur="0.2"/> a model <pause dur="0.9"/> which we can represent <pause dur="1.0"/> okay <pause dur="0.3"/> diagrammatically for up to three goods <pause dur="0.2"/> but we've built it up <pause dur="0.2"/> taking account of <pause dur="0.4"/> all of the characteristics of consumer preferences <pause dur="0.4"/> and of their economic constraints okay that that <pause dur="0.3"/> you know really matter <pause dur="0.9"/> yes sure we have <pause dur="0.5"/> put a lot of things together like <pause dur="0.5"/> the indifference curve represents all of those things <pause dur="0.2"/> well includes all those things that influence the consumer's preferences every 
one of those <pause dur="0.3"/> is included within that <pause dur="0.4"/> and any one of those <pause dur="0.3"/> if it changes will change <pause dur="0.2"/> that indifference curve <pause dur="0.8"/> okay <pause dur="0.2"/> that's fine <pause dur="1.4"/> we've equally included the economic constraints <pause dur="0.2"/> okay and <pause dur="0.3"/> what we've now done is put them together <pause dur="0.5"/> to produce a model which we hope will allow us to <pause dur="0.4"/> okay on the <trunc>f</trunc> on the one hand predict the choice this consumer will make in this circumstance which <pause dur="0.5"/> is vaguely interesting <pause dur="0.3"/> what is more interesting is if we then use this to say <pause dur="0.3"/> okay <pause dur="0.3"/> what happens if things change can we use this <pause dur="0.2"/> given that we can now <pause dur="0.2"/> represent it <pause dur="0.4"/> # mathematically <pause dur="0.8"/><kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="5"/> so we can actually represent it like this <pause dur="0.9"/> so we could <pause dur="0.4"/> given we can represent this mathematically we could apply this <pause dur="0.4"/> to <pause dur="0.8"/> data from the real world price data <pause dur="0.2"/> income data et cetera we so we can actually <pause dur="0.3"/> put <pause dur="0.3"/> real data into this when we've put it in an empirical model <pause dur="0.4"/> <trunc>a</trunc> and predict what will happen and what will happen if things change <pause dur="0.4"/> so now we can do that <pause dur="1.6"/> and to prove that this model <pause dur="1.5"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> really does 
sort of encapsulate the way in which at least economists <pause dur="0.2"/> see the choices consumer makes <pause dur="0.3"/> the consumer makes <pause dur="0.2"/> again <pause dur="0.2"/> we're not saying this is how the consumer does make it <pause dur="0.2"/> we're sort of <pause dur="0.2"/> abstracting from the real world and trying to encapsulate <pause dur="0.2"/> how they make choices in a model that we can <pause dur="0.2"/> we can use <pause dur="1.2"/> that at that point they will spend all their income 'cause <unclear>of</unclear> another <pause dur="0.4"/> black holes that give utility <pause dur="0.3"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> at that point <pause dur="3.0"/> they will maximize <pause dur="0.2"/> their utility <pause dur="0.3"/> they will <pause dur="0.6"/> not be able <pause dur="0.2"/> to reallocate their income in such a way <pause dur="0.3"/> that they can <pause dur="0.7"/> meet more of their needs and wants and so <pause dur="0.7"/> the rate at which they are able <pause dur="0.6"/> to substitute between the goods <pause dur="0.3"/> within the marketplace through <pause dur="0.2"/> through their market transactions <pause dur="0.4"/> is just equal to <pause dur="0.3"/> the rate at which they <pause dur="0.3"/> wish <pause dur="0.3"/> <trunc>t</trunc> to substitute between those goods <pause dur="0.9"/> and <pause dur="0.4"/> that gives us <pause dur="0.7"/> the principle <trunc>the</trunc> the marginal principle which <pause dur="0.3"/> says that <pause dur="0.4"/> the ratio of the marginal utility to price is the same for all of the goods <pause dur="0.5"/> so if the consumer's given a fractional 
increase in income <pause dur="0.3"/> it wouldn't matter <pause dur="0.3"/> which of the goods they allocated it to 'cause it would be exactly the same <pause dur="1.4"/> okay <pause dur="2.8"/> so that is the basic <pause dur="0.4"/> the basic model <pause dur="0.7"/> that we've built up and it encapsulates <pause dur="0.6"/> all of the things that we <pause dur="0.2"/> we have said <pause dur="0.7"/> we think we observe in the real world <pause dur="0.4"/> so <pause dur="0.2"/> the ideas of diminishing marginal rate of substitution because of changes in <pause dur="0.3"/> # marginal utilities <pause dur="0.6"/> okay <pause dur="0.4"/> # the ideas of non-satiation transitivity all of those are encapsulated here <pause dur="0.8"/> 'cause we've built up the indifference curves <pause dur="0.5"/> and therefore are encapsulated here <pause dur="0.3"/> 'cause we can now represent them in a mathematical sense <pause dur="1.2"/> and the availability set <pause dur="0.3"/> which we we've said <pause dur="0.3"/> applies to the consumer <pause dur="0.6"/> the economic constraints they face <pause dur="1.0"/> so we've put all that together and we've produced this <pause dur="0.6"/> rather simple model <pause dur="1.1"/> the complication with it <pause dur="0.3"/> comes when you want to actually employ it in practice and we're not going to look at that in great detail <pause dur="0.2"/> because there <pause dur="0.2"/> you're getting into complex statistical 
procedures econometric procedures <pause dur="0.4"/> relating to the mathematical form that this takes okay and <pause dur="0.2"/> how we can <pause dur="0.3"/> put it together into something we can estimate <pause dur="1.3"/> what we're now going to do <pause dur="0.4"/> next week <pause dur="0.3"/> is to look at how we can use this <pause dur="1.2"/> okay <pause dur="0.2"/> we've said this is how we can model the choice they make <pause dur="1.1"/> okay <pause dur="0.3"/> I-E <pause dur="0.3"/> remember what we're saying is <pause dur="0.2"/> what we can observe in the real world is the prices <pause dur="0.6"/> the income <pause dur="0.3"/> and what people choose <pause dur="0.2"/> okay they're the things we can see <pause dur="0.3"/> we can see what people buy <pause dur="1.4"/> because we can actually collect that information we could do it on an individual basis 'cause we could ask people <pause dur="0.3"/> we could # <pause dur="0.3"/> ask them to give us their till receipts from the supermarket <pause dur="0.2"/> we could follow them around the shop we can gather that information in many ways <pause dur="0.3"/> we can do it on a collective basis <pause dur="0.5"/> of all consumers by looking at how much <pause dur="0.4"/> # how many bananas Sainsbury's and Tesco et cetera sell <pause dur="0.4"/> or <pause dur="0.3"/> at a national account level we can gather that information <pause dur="0.8"/> so we can look at what people choose <pause dur="0.3"/> I-E the X-one 
and X-two <pause dur="1.6"/> we can look at prices because again we can gather that information <pause dur="0.9"/> what the prices are in the shops <pause dur="0.5"/> and we can gather information on income <pause dur="1.1"/> so we can get all the variables income prices and choice we can get all of those <pause dur="0.3"/> and what we are <trunc>go</trunc> what we do <pause dur="0.2"/> is to use this model <pause dur="0.3"/> to make sense of those choices <pause dur="1.1"/> and when we've used this model to make sense of those choices I-E we use this model <pause dur="0.3"/> to understand why they've made the choices they have <pause dur="1.2"/> for example to discover what their preferences are <pause dur="1.0"/> we can then use that <pause dur="0.2"/> to say okay <pause dur="0.8"/> how much do we what do we think the consumption of bananas is going to be next year <pause dur="1.0"/> if we expect the prices to go up ten per cent and we expect people's incomes to go up say three four per cent <pause dur="0.8"/> what's the demand for bananas likely to be <pause dur="0.2"/> is it going to be higher is it going to be lower <pause dur="0.2"/> and by how much <pause dur="0.4"/> and that's useful <pause dur="0.7"/> so we're going to look at <pause dur="0.2"/> what happens if things change <pause dur="0.7"/> okay <pause dur="0.2"/> and what measures can we produce of <pause dur="0.4"/> those changes <pause dur="0.2"/> so things like elasticities <pause dur="0.4"/> # for example <pause dur="0.9"/> okay let's leave it there
