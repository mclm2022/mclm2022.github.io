<u who="nm0693"> i guess in the last three lectures what we've been looking at has been has been the generality <pause dur="0.2"/> of photochemical processes <pause dur="0.5"/> and today <pause dur="0.6"/> i want to continue with the notion of <pause dur="0.2"/> specific problems and looking <pause dur="0.3"/> looking at them in some depth as illustrating <pause dur="0.4"/> # the sorts of things that # <pause dur="0.2"/> you can do with photochemistry <pause dur="0.4"/> now last week we were looking at the splitting of water <pause dur="0.6"/> with <pause dur="0.5"/> sunlight <pause dur="0.5"/> and we recognized that water <pause dur="0.4"/> doesn't draw <pause dur="0.5"/> sunlight at all <pause dur="0.4"/> but if you put it in with the right catalyst <pause dur="0.5"/> and the catalyst we <pause dur="0.6"/> talked about very much was this ruthenium catalyst <pause dur="0.4"/> then <pause dur="0.2"/> provided you had a cocatalyst there as well <pause dur="0.6"/> then you had the <pause dur="0.2"/> possibility of the ruthenium complex <pause dur="0.3"/> splitting the water <pause dur="0.3"/> into hydrogen and oxygen <pause dur="0.5"/> and this could be done <pause dur="0.5"/> but there were drawbacks and that the drawbacks you remember were that # particularly <pause dur="0.5"/> # the catalyst didn't go on for ever <pause dur="0.6"/> the yields were rather low <pause dur="0.3"/> and you had to have a sacrificial donor in the system <pause dur="0.3"/> now if you were going to do that <pause dur="0.3"/> well you might 
as well say we'll go to biomass <pause dur="0.4"/> but it looks as though photoelectrochemistry <pause dur="0.3"/> where you actually generated an electric current from such a system <pause dur="0.4"/> was a much better bet and work is still going on with that <pause dur="0.6"/> now what i'd like to talk about today is something <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/><kinesic desc="puts on transparency" iterated="n"/> which is <pause dur="0.2"/> related but different <pause dur="0.4"/> and that is the <pause dur="0.3"/> use of irradiated # <pause dur="0.2"/> catalyst that absorbs the U-V components of sunlight <pause dur="0.5"/> to destroy organic pollutants <pause dur="0.6"/> and # that will be the subject of today <pause dur="2.2"/><kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="16"/> and the <trunc>f</trunc> the first <pause dur="0.3"/> question is <pause dur="0.5"/> # why should one <pause dur="0.4"/> # choose titanium dioxide <pause dur="0.2"/> as a <pause dur="0.4"/> a a thing to do this <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> there are various other things that one could have maybe thought about <pause dur="0.5"/> but # i'll <pause dur="0.4"/> put down <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> almost a kind of summary of the lecture <pause dur="0.3"/> # before i <trunc>begi</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> # before i've given it <pause dur="0.3"/> and that is that # <pause dur="1.4"/> it's <pause dur="0.3"/> very cheap and it's readily available <pause dur="0.5"/> T-I-O-two as i said before is used as a # the whitener <pause dur="0.3"/> in <pause dur="0.3"/> emulsion paints <pause dur="0.5"/> # for getting a white finish <pause dur="0.3"/> on any gloss paints as well <pause dur="0.4"/> it's also environmentally harmless there's # <pause dur="0.3"/> there's 
sacks of titanium <pause dur="0.3"/> all around the world <pause dur="0.4"/> and nobody suffers from it <pause dur="0.8"/> we know <trunc>f</trunc> # that it's got a very good <pause dur="0.4"/> turnover number <pause dur="0.2"/> in other words you can irradiate it again and again and again and again and again and <pause dur="0.4"/> it will still function <pause dur="1.2"/> # it turns out to be efficient for a wide range of pollutants and i'll illustrate that in the lecture <pause dur="1.0"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> another advantage is you can attach it to supports rather readily <pause dur="0.3"/> in other words <pause dur="0.4"/> # if you take T-I-O-two which is a # a white <pause dur="0.3"/> powder a bit like talcum powder <pause dur="0.3"/> and you stood it up in water <pause dur="0.4"/> or even sonicate it with <trunc>s</trunc> with a <trunc>s</trunc> with a sonicator you know sound wave emitter <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> you get a suspension <pause dur="0.6"/> if you lay the suspension onto glass and allow it to evaporate <pause dur="1.0"/> the T-I-O-two powder sticks to the glass <pause dur="0.6"/> really very fiercely and it's really quite hard to get off <pause dur="0.4"/> particularly if after you've layered it you you heat it <pause dur="0.5"/> maybe to # <pause dur="0.3"/> a hundred degrees or so for a <pause dur="0.6"/> twenty-four hours <pause dur="0.3"/> it becomes even more firmly attached to glass <pause dur="0.4"/> and it means that # you've got a stable <pause dur="0.2"/> thin 
layer <pause dur="0.5"/> # which will be <trunc>c</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> really quite a useful advantage <pause dur="1.0"/> you might have <trunc>p</trunc> <pause dur="0.4"/> predicted at the outset from what we said last week from the # <pause dur="1.2"/> the other lecture <pause dur="0.2"/> where we talked about T-I-O-two <pause dur="0.2"/> it's got rather a large band gap <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> under solar irradiation there isn't a lot of U-V <pause dur="0.5"/> but <pause dur="0.3"/> there is some <pause dur="0.5"/> so that there's a reasonable chance that you'll get something out of it <pause dur="0.2"/> but clearly <pause dur="0.2"/> if you could activate it <pause dur="0.4"/> by # <pause dur="0.5"/> putting in maybe a <trunc>t</trunc> an inorganic ion strip in the lattice to move the action spectrum towards the visible <pause dur="0.4"/> then you could probably <pause dur="0.4"/> increase its # <pause dur="0.3"/> its efficiency <pause dur="0.5"/> # as i've as i've <kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> indicated there <pause dur="0.4"/> so <pause dur="0.3"/> those are the # <pause dur="0.3"/> those are the main features and i shall spend quite a bit of time <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> underlining those notes # throughout the lecture <pause dur="0.8"/> okay have you have you <pause dur="0.3"/> got have you got all that </u><pause dur="0.5"/> <u who="sm0694" trans="pause"> not yet </u><pause dur="0.3"/> <u who="nm0693" trans="pause"> not yet okay i'll <trunc>hol</trunc> i'll hold for on a sec <pause dur="0.5"/> while you # <pause dur="0.3"/> try and get it down </u><gap reason="break in recording" extent="uncertain"/> <u who="nm0693" trans="pause"> right <pause dur="0.6"/> what i'd like to do next is <trunc>t</trunc> for us to sort of think about what a T-I-O-two particle <kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="3"/> titanium dioxide particle is like <pause dur="0.5"/> and we have 
here <pause dur="0.4"/> a <pause dur="0.3"/> very <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> schematic view of what it's like <pause dur="0.5"/> so it's irregular <pause dur="0.2"/> it's roughly roughly kind of spherical <pause dur="0.6"/> and <pause dur="0.5"/> essentially <pause dur="0.4"/> the two points to <pause dur="0.6"/> note <pause dur="0.4"/> are these <pause dur="0.5"/> you've got within the crystal <kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> because it's a semiconductor <pause dur="0.5"/> you've got a valence band and a conduction band <pause dur="0.5"/> got these two energy levels <pause dur="0.7"/><kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> but they're really bands where i've just drawn them as lines for the to simplify things <pause dur="0.7"/> and when you <pause dur="0.4"/> optically pump the thing by shining light on it <pause dur="0.3"/> you push an electron <pause dur="0.3"/> out of the valence band <pause dur="0.3"/> into the conduction band just as <pause dur="0.2"/> just as i talked about last week <pause dur="0.8"/> and <pause dur="0.4"/> the <pause dur="0.4"/> a <trunc>l</trunc> hole <pause dur="0.6"/><kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> here this H-plus <pause dur="0.6"/> or the absent electron <pause dur="0.5"/> this will migrate from within the crystal to the surface <pause dur="0.3"/> so you've got to imagine this in three dimensions of course <pause dur="0.3"/> # so you can imagine to get to the surface <pause dur="0.2"/> and you've got <kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> holes dotted around the surface as i've indicated there <pause dur="0.6"/> the electrons <pause dur="0.3"/> also <pause dur="0.4"/> migrate to the surface <pause dur="1.2"/> they also of course stand a good chance of # recombining <pause dur="0.6"/> and if you didn't have <pause dur="0.2"/> anything else in the system <pause dur="0.4"/> they would recombine <pause dur="0.3"/> and 
<trunc>nothi</trunc> not very much would happen <pause dur="0.6"/> but # <pause dur="0.4"/> what happens is that you're able to fix the charge separation <pause dur="0.5"/> because <pause dur="0.2"/> essentially it's in water <pause dur="0.9"/> and the water <pause dur="0.5"/> is being purged with oxygen <pause dur="0.4"/> or <pause dur="0.8"/> even less extreme if you've got some air in in the water and we would normally have some air there <pause dur="0.3"/> and certainly if you were talking about <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> river water lake water something like that <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> then <pause dur="0.5"/> there will be there would be oxygen present from the air <pause dur="0.2"/> at about you know twenty twenty per cent of the # <pause dur="0.3"/> dissolved gases would would be oxygen <pause dur="0.4"/> so the oxygen <pause dur="1.1"/> in the solution <pause dur="0.5"/> will migrate around of course it will collide with the particles <pause dur="0.4"/> and it will trap the electron <pause dur="1.2"/> and make it O-two-minus the so-called superoxide ion <pause dur="0.9"/> and if it's trapped as this <pause dur="0.4"/> then the electron is no longer mobile because it's become O-two-minus <pause dur="1.1"/> the other thing that happens <pause dur="0.4"/> is that the H-plus <pause dur="0.9"/> is a very powerful oxidizing agent <pause dur="1.6"/> and it will oxidize water <pause dur="0.8"/> to <pause dur="0.9"/> O-H radicals <pause dur="0.4"/> so <pause dur="0.4"/> quite quickly <kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> all of these H-pluses <pause dur="0.8"/> will <pause dur="0.3"/> react with the water <pause dur="0.7"/> on the 
surface of the particle <pause dur="0.4"/> and they will be converted to O-H <pause dur="0.8"/> so you've got O-H which is an oxidizing agent upon the surface <pause dur="0.6"/> and you've got O-two-minus <pause dur="1.0"/> which is <pause dur="0.5"/> also <pause dur="0.5"/> an oxidizing agent it's not as powerful as O-H but it's still <pause dur="0.8"/> certainly not a reducing agent <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="1.0"/> the other thing that can happen <pause dur="0.4"/> is that the O-H <pause dur="0.3"/> is absorbed going to move that into a solution <pause dur="0.2"/> so you've got the absorbed O-H becoming a solution O-H <pause dur="0.5"/> the O-two-minus is absorbed and with that become <pause dur="0.5"/> an O-two-minus in solution <pause dur="0.6"/> so all <pause dur="0.3"/> of the <pause dur="0.5"/> species produced by further excitation end up <pause dur="0.4"/> either by being oxidizing agents absorbed on the surface <pause dur="0.4"/> or they become oxidizing agents out in solution <pause dur="0.6"/> and this is the <pause dur="0.2"/> this is the basis of the <pause dur="0.2"/> the photoreactivity <pause dur="0.4"/> <trunc>o</trunc> of T-I-O-two <pause dur="0.4"/> you're generating all these oxidizing species <pause dur="1.6"/> now before <pause dur="0.3"/> going any further into T-I-O-two and # <pause dur="0.7"/> # its various merits <pause dur="0.3"/> i will # <pause dur="0.3"/> briefly <pause dur="0.5"/> # cast an eye over one or two competitor type systems that you might have thought about <pause dur="0.7"/> and these have all been tried <pause dur="0.5"/> # as 
you can imagine <pause dur="0.7"/> # this is quite a complicated # transparency you may not be able to <pause dur="0.2"/> draw all of this but i'll just <pause dur="0.4"/> highlight <pause dur="0.2"/> what's important <pause dur="0.7"/><kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="3"/> so <pause dur="0.3"/> what have i got down here <pause dur="0.8"/> well this is quite a <pause dur="0.3"/> a complex picture <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> the point here is that # <pause dur="0.4"/> you can look at a whole series of other semiconductors <pause dur="0.4"/> and all of the all of these that are quite well known <pause dur="0.4"/> because they've all been used <pause dur="0.4"/> # in photoelectrochemical cells so the technology has already been explored <pause dur="0.3"/> for these things <pause dur="0.6"/> and what i've got here <pause dur="0.2"/> are the band gaps <pause dur="0.6"/> the band gaps <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="1.2"/> the distance between the <pause dur="0.3"/> valence band and the conduction band <pause dur="0.5"/> the T-I-O-two <pause dur="0.3"/> is about three-point-two electron volts <pause dur="0.5"/> as you go to some of <kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> these ones then it's getting less one-point-seven one-point-four <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> two-point-four <pause dur="0.2"/><kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> these are coloured of course because the band gap is now in the visible <pause dur="0.3"/> and these things are either orange or yellow <pause dur="0.3"/> # or whatever <pause dur="0.6"/> # zinc sulphide white 'cause you've got really really quite a big band gap there <pause dur="0.3"/> and strontium titanate is very similar to this <pause dur="0.4"/> W-O-three <pause dur="0.2"/> is probably just about on the 
edge of the <trunc>o</trunc> of the on the edge of the visible so it will have a faint maybe a probably a <pause dur="0.3"/> a a a a slight colour <pause dur="0.8"/> you know slightly coloured yellow <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> the point is that # <pause dur="0.3"/> the the band gaps for these are very attractive <pause dur="0.4"/><kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> but unfortunately <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> the <pause dur="0.7"/> flip side of having a narrow band gap which would be very sensitive to visible light which is a good thing <pause dur="0.4"/> is that you don't actually get enough <pause dur="0.3"/> in the way of potential <pause dur="0.2"/> to <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> oxidize the water through to O-H <pause dur="0.3"/> you've got if you want to get O-H radicals <pause dur="0.2"/> you've got to get past this <unclear>well</unclear> this potential <kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> here <pause dur="0.2"/> as we run across the bottom <pause dur="0.6"/> so in a sense <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> there's a whole all all <kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> of these ones are going to fail <kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> this might just just about creep in <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> but <pause dur="0.2"/> the ones that are going to win on energy are those <kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> those three there <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> these <pause dur="0.3"/><kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> which might have seemed attractive <pause dur="0.7"/> simply don't win on potential <pause dur="0.2"/> you've got to get the oxidizing potential <pause dur="1.3"/> to get the oxidation to O-H <pause dur="0.5"/> but you've <pause dur="0.3"/> also got to try and match the band gap as best you can to what's <pause dur="0.3"/> in <pause dur="0.2"/> sunlight if you're going to use 
sunlight <pause dur="0.6"/> now if you decide you're not going to use sunlight at all <pause dur="0.3"/> but you're going to use fluorescent tubes <pause dur="0.3"/> you stand a much better chance because <kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> here <pause dur="0.3"/> you can make tubes emitting U-V <pause dur="0.3"/> with a a a a high level of efficiency <pause dur="0.4"/> so <pause dur="0.5"/> the way <pause dur="0.2"/> thinking has gone is to move away from <pause dur="0.6"/> # using sunlight <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> not completely away by the way but <pause dur="0.4"/> more towards using <trunc>U</trunc> <trunc>U</trunc> U-V tubes <pause dur="0.3"/> so the idea would be if you had <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> a <pause dur="0.3"/> a factory <pause dur="0.5"/> emitting some polluted water say polluted with low levels of <pause dur="0.5"/> really <pause dur="0.2"/> poisonous materials <pause dur="0.4"/> but <pause dur="0.5"/> down at say a micromolar <pause dur="0.5"/> if you passed that <pause dur="0.6"/> effluent past a bank of U-V tubes all switched on <pause dur="1.2"/> and <pause dur="0.4"/> if you had the T-I-O-two present in the system in some form <pause dur="0.6"/> it wouldn't be a suspension obviously 'cause it would be washed away <pause dur="0.2"/> but if you can immobilize the T-I-O-two <pause dur="0.5"/> on <pause dur="0.3"/> sheets <pause dur="0.4"/> or rods or fibres <pause dur="0.4"/> then you would destroy <pause dur="0.5"/> the <pause dur="0.2"/><kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> polluting organic <pause dur="0.5"/> and you stand a reasonable chance of cleaning up <pause dur="0.4"/> because <pause dur="0.5"/> i can <trunc>s</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> i can tell you sort of in anticipation <pause dur="0.4"/> <kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> this is a remarkably 
efficient system it works really quite well <pause dur="0.3"/> and much better than you'd ever believe <pause dur="0.2"/> from the outset <pause dur="0.5"/> okay <pause dur="0.2"/> so <pause dur="0.4"/> the the <trunc>messa</trunc> the message from that slide really is that # <pause dur="0.2"/> you got to get <kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> past this point here to get O-H radicals <pause dur="0.4"/> and <kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> those three work quite well <kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> this is another possibility <pause dur="0.3"/> and <kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> those don't really <trunc>s</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> you know stand much of a chance <pause dur="0.8"/> okay <pause dur="1.1"/> right so i'll take that off now hoping that you've got the the the basic message <kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="14"/> without copying everything down furiously <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> what i'd like to do next is # <pause dur="0.3"/> perhaps show you <pause dur="0.3"/> how some of these # <pause dur="0.2"/> semiconductors compare with each other <pause dur="0.3"/> so you can just see <pause dur="0.3"/> <trunc>whi</trunc> you know which really are the good ones and and the not so good ones <pause dur="0.4"/> and what i've got here <pause dur="0.6"/> is a slide <pause dur="0.6"/> and this is where we're looking at # <pause dur="0.6"/> pentachlorophenol <pause dur="1.1"/> now this is <pause dur="0.4"/> all the chlorophenols are quite good things to look at because <pause dur="0.4"/> many <pause dur="0.5"/> of the <pause dur="0.4"/> pollutants that # <pause dur="0.9"/> # <trunc>eman</trunc> emanate from <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> waste sites and dumps and the like <pause dur="0.7"/> they've been partly converted by bacteria <pause dur="0.4"/> from 
something like <pause dur="0.4"/> # polychlorobiphenyls <pause dur="1.1"/> into chlorophenols <pause dur="0.7"/> and so the chlorophenols tend to be the water soluble form which gets leached into the aquifers or the <pause dur="0.4"/> water table <pause dur="0.2"/> and get into rivers <pause dur="0.5"/> so <pause dur="0.4"/> the chlorophenols have been looked at very closely <pause dur="0.4"/> because they are really ideal model compounds to work with <pause dur="0.4"/> and here we've got pentachlorophenol <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> and it's a concentration of about <pause dur="0.2"/> i suppose <pause dur="0.5"/> four <pause dur="0.2"/> times ten-to-the-minus-five mole per litre <pause dur="0.4"/> this has been irradiated various <pause dur="0.4"/> semiconductors <pause dur="0.3"/> are present <pause dur="0.4"/> and you can see <pause dur="0.2"/> T-I-O-two is here <pause dur="0.5"/><kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> Z-N-O <kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> is there <pause dur="0.5"/><kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> this is cadmium sulphide <pause dur="0.4"/> and then up here <kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> you've got W-O-three <pause dur="0.4"/> and tin oxide <pause dur="0.3"/> and you can see that by far the best two <pause dur="0.4"/> are the T-I-O-two and the Z-N-O <pause dur="0.5"/> which the previous slide <pause dur="0.3"/> would have would have led you to believe <pause dur="0.3"/> so the previous slide was a kind of theoretical prediction if you like the rationalization <pause dur="0.4"/> this is the experimental result <pause dur="0.4"/> # i suppose the thing is that # <pause dur="0.5"/> # C-D-S is rather better than we might have thought it was <pause dur="0.3"/> but it's still nothing like as good <pause dur="0.3"/> as T-I-O-two <pause dur="0.2"/> 
or zinc oxide <pause dur="0.7"/> so # <pause dur="0.2"/> that's # <pause dur="0.3"/> a a a <trunc>n</trunc> a nice sort of comparator experiment <pause dur="0.3"/> on pentachlorophenol <pause dur="1.9"/><kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="25"/> the next question is i suppose what actually happens <pause dur="0.4"/> when <pause dur="0.3"/> the # <pause dur="0.5"/> the light falls on the <pause dur="0.3"/> particle what are the subsequent reactions <pause dur="0.3"/> after <pause dur="0.3"/> what i've described so i'll # <pause dur="1.6"/> i'll show you <pause dur="0.2"/> # that as on on the next slide this is quite a complicated one <pause dur="0.4"/> and i'll follow it up with one or two rather easier ones <pause dur="0.4"/> so here we go <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> and i'll take you through it <pause dur="0.4"/> fairly slowly <pause dur="1.0"/> okay <pause dur="0.5"/> can you actually read <kinesic desc="indicates transparency" iterated="n"/> read those on there <pause dur="0.4"/> yeah i'll i'll call them out anyway <pause dur="0.3"/> so we start off on with T-I-O-two with light <pause dur="0.3"/> we get the whole <pause dur="0.2"/> we get the electron <pause dur="0.5"/> so i said before the electron picks up O-two <pause dur="0.3"/> to give O-two-minus <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> it's not very well <pause dur="0.5"/> done as a as a minus but it ought to be a minus dot really 'cause it's a free radical <pause dur="0.5"/><kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> this is a O-two-minus-dot <pause dur="0.3"/> an O-two-minus-dot can go on <pause dur="0.4"/> # it can react two of these react together to give you <kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> these <pause dur="0.2"/> it gives you H-O-two <pause dur="0.6"/> you've got it can react with protons and it's 
slightly acidic to give you H-O-two radicals <pause dur="0.4"/> and H-O-two itself <pause dur="0.3"/> is is # <pause dur="0.3"/> a weak oxidant it can attack organics <pause dur="0.4"/> in the absence of the organics <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> the thing will go on it will form oxygen and hydrogen peroxide <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> it can pick up electrons <pause dur="0.2"/> to give this <pause dur="0.3"/><kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> that's E-minus of the proton is equivalent of H atom <pause dur="0.6"/> and H atom will react with H-O-two to give you H-two-O-two <pause dur="0.5"/> and then <pause dur="0.2"/> further electrons will give you <pause dur="0.2"/> O-H radicals <pause dur="0.5"/> and then you've got further reactions here <kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> so you end up by making some more O-H radicals <pause dur="0.5"/> if the thing is not intercepted <pause dur="0.4"/> by an organic <pause dur="0.6"/> so that's the # <pause dur="0.6"/> that's what's happening to the electron it's being converted ultimately <pause dur="0.3"/> in a number of steps <pause dur="0.2"/> through to <pause dur="0.2"/> hydroxyl radicals <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.8"/> unless the thing gets picked up beforehand <pause dur="1.0"/> this side <pause dur="0.2"/><kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> you've got H-plus <pause dur="0.7"/> and the H-plus surface gets on to the surface <pause dur="0.3"/> it <trunc>ma</trunc> it <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> the contribution system gets to the surface <pause dur="0.5"/> oxidizes the water to O-H radicals <pause dur="0.4"/> the O-H radical sticks <pause dur="0.3"/> # on the surface <pause dur="0.2"/> near to a titanium <pause dur="0.6"/> # what's going to happen then <pause dur="0.4"/> well basically if you've got 
# in the system <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="1.4"/> an organic which we can denote R <pause dur="0.4"/> or a <trunc>f</trunc> organic radical <pause dur="0.7"/> or just set it on carbon or another organic radical which is basically a <pause dur="0.3"/> a semi-oxidized alcohol <pause dur="0.6"/> # all of these things <pause dur="0.3"/> react with # <kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> all of those things which have come from <kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> here you see all most of these will spill down over into <kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> there now <pause dur="0.3"/> and you get oxidized species <pause dur="0.9"/> so ultimately <pause dur="0.5"/> after many many steps <pause dur="0.4"/> and if you think about it if you've got something like pentachloro<pause dur="0.3"/>phenol or even a thing like say phenol itself <pause dur="0.4"/> to get phenol through to carbon dioxide <pause dur="0.5"/> you've got many many electrons needed you need to take many electrons out of phenol <pause dur="0.5"/> to get it <pause dur="0.4"/> to a point <pause dur="0.3"/> where the phenol molecule <pause dur="0.4"/> is often being converted right through to C-O-two <pause dur="0.6"/> the process of converting these organics <pause dur="0.2"/> right through <pause dur="0.3"/> to either C-O-two <pause dur="0.5"/> or <pause dur="0.3"/> if you've got a chloryl organic to chloride anion <pause dur="0.3"/> which is harmless <pause dur="0.5"/> # both of these are <trunc>p</trunc> are pretty harmless <pause dur="0.4"/> # compared with the start material <pause dur="0.5"/> then it's called mineralization <pause dur="0.4"/> because <pause dur="0.3"/> carbonic 
acid and H-shell are mineral acids <pause dur="0.3"/> so the whole process is called mineralization <pause dur="0.4"/> or if you like <pause dur="0.3"/> photomineralization <pause dur="0.7"/> so this this is a <trunc>f</trunc> a a <trunc>f</trunc> <pause dur="0.4"/> a fairly fairly complete mechanism <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> it's told you what's happening to all these oxygen radicals <pause dur="0.3"/> it hasn't said very much of what what's happening <pause dur="0.4"/> # <kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> department there <pause dur="0.2"/> all you can <pause dur="0.3"/> # # <pause dur="0.2"/> all this says at the moment is that these <trunc>c</trunc> these carbon centres <pause dur="0.4"/> are either organic <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> or an organic radical <pause dur="0.3"/> or a hydroxylated organic radical <pause dur="0.2"/> all of these <kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> three will all of these will get oxidized <pause dur="0.4"/> in in the process <pause dur="0.4"/> so that's a <trunc>k</trunc> a kind of total scheme <pause dur="0.8"/> so it's an elaboration of my particle picture <pause dur="0.2"/> i've now got a lot more reactions there <pause dur="1.4"/> okay <pause dur="1.0"/> have you have you got that <pause dur="2.0"/> well <pause dur="0.8"/> now just in slightly more detail <pause dur="0.4"/> # i want to try and explain <pause dur="0.7"/> the kind of <pause dur="0.4"/> reactions that go on <pause dur="0.6"/> when any organic system is being oxidized <pause dur="0.3"/> so <trunc>thi</trunc> <trunc>thi</trunc> what i've got next is not just peculiar to this system <pause dur="0.5"/> this is <pause dur="0.2"/> a generality <pause dur="0.4"/> for the oxidization of all <kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="7"/> organics <pause dur="0.3"/> including polymers as it happens <pause dur="0.6"/> so <pause dur="0.4"/> 
here we go <pause dur="1.6"/> well the one i've got <pause dur="0.2"/> i've put it down # <pause dur="0.2"/> it's actually for the <pause dur="0.4"/> oxidation using hydrogen peroxide <pause dur="0.5"/> # you can use that instead of T-I-O-two <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> but it's not as good because you use it up <pause dur="0.8"/> but the chemistry is exactly the same <pause dur="0.7"/> if you irradiate hydrogen peroxide with pentachlorophenol you destroy it <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.9"/> but of course you destroy the H-two-O-two as well <pause dur="0.3"/> the T-I-O-two <pause dur="0.3"/> you constantly regenerate the T-I-O-two it goes on and on and on <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> going through all these steps <pause dur="0.3"/> but the the key point is this <pause dur="0.6"/> right so <pause dur="0.4"/> we start with off <pause dur="0.5"/> with an organic <pause dur="0.4"/> and we'll call the organic molecule <pause dur="0.4"/> whatever it you know it can be anything you like phenol benzene <pause dur="0.5"/> # ethanol <pause dur="0.6"/> a dye stuff <pause dur="0.6"/> we'll call it H-R-H <pause dur="0.3"/> that's two hydrogens bonded to <pause dur="0.8"/> quite a complex network of carbons <pause dur="0.3"/> but we'll just call it H-R-H <pause dur="1.2"/> you've got the O-H radical formed <pause dur="0.4"/><kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> i've got it formed from H-two-O-two there but of course it's formed as we've already said from T-I-O-two under photolysis <pause dur="1.2"/> so the O-H radical is <kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> formed here <pause dur="0.6"/> and it attacks the H-R-H <pause dur="0.5"/> it pulls a 
hydrogen off <pause dur="0.6"/> to give us water so the O-H becomes water <pause dur="0.5"/> the H-R-H <kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> comes through here <pause dur="0.2"/> and becomes R-H-dot <pause dur="0.4"/> so there's our organic radical <pause dur="0.8"/> the organic radical <pause dur="0.4"/> if you didn't have any oxygen in the system <pause dur="0.5"/> it would almost certainly dimerize <pause dur="0.3"/> to give you a polymeric product <pause dur="0.4"/> and you do actually get some <pause dur="0.2"/> if you have a look at these phenols you do get some # <pause dur="1.6"/> polyphenols in the system you can get dimers from trimers of phenol <pause dur="0.3"/> as a side product <pause dur="0.2"/> but they tend to be fairly minor <pause dur="1.2"/> normally of course <pause dur="0.2"/> you make a point of having oxygen there you make sure the system is has got air <pause dur="0.5"/> absorbed in it <pause dur="0.4"/> or if you're a bit worried about that you can blow air through it <pause dur="0.5"/> and if you want to be really definite you can blow some oxygen through it because what we tend to do in the laboratory <pause dur="0.3"/> is not really <pause dur="0.5"/> a viable proposition for <pause dur="0.2"/> an industrial plant <pause dur="0.2"/> mind you could do it but it would make it more expensive you don't need to really <pause dur="0.7"/> R-H <pause dur="0.5"/> will will react with oxygen <pause dur="0.5"/> to give <pause dur="0.3"/> a peroxide radical <pause dur="0.3"/> that's an organic 
peroxide radical <pause dur="0.4"/> and it's got # <pause dur="0.5"/> normally it's written as R-O-two-dot <pause dur="0.4"/> but because we've written this as R-H-dot we'll just put the oxygen on and call it R-H-O-two-dot <pause dur="0.4"/> so this is <pause dur="0.4"/> this is a <kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> peroxyl <pause dur="0.2"/> radical R-O-two-dot <pause dur="0.7"/> now the R-O-two-dot can do all sorts of things <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> and there's a there's a variety of things that it can do there <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="1.2"/> it can reverse <pause dur="0.6"/> that is not <pause dur="0.3"/> particularly important i will say <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> but what it <pause dur="0.7"/> can also do <pause dur="0.4"/> and this is the important one <pause dur="0.5"/> it can attack another R-H-R-H <pause dur="0.2"/> which i've written <kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> here <pause dur="0.5"/> by pulling off a <trunc>hy</trunc> a hydrogen <pause dur="0.5"/> and we end up by getting <kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> R-H-O-two-H there <pause dur="0.8"/> and we go back <pause dur="0.5"/> to <kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> R-H here <pause dur="0.2"/> so basically you've got little a little chain reaction going along <kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> here <pause dur="0.3"/> where you're constantly diverting H-R-H through to the <pause dur="0.3"/><kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> this hydroperoxide <pause dur="0.6"/> so you convert it through to the hydroperoxide <pause dur="0.5"/> and then you've got some other steps <kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> up here <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> you've got various <trunc>si</trunc> scissions this is to actually cleave to give an R-O radical <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> you can go up to R-H-plus <pause dur="0.3"/> you can go round to O-two-minus <pause dur="0.3"/> 
and get back to H-two-O-two <pause dur="0.5"/> but i would say the important the really important steps here <pause dur="0.3"/> what the first one is the abstraction by O-H to take you through to <kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> here <pause dur="0.5"/> the next important step is the picking up of oxygen to go through to <kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> there <pause dur="0.4"/> the next step is to go round <kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> this way <pause dur="0.3"/> to give you <pause dur="0.6"/> a hydroperoxide <pause dur="0.2"/> so you've now taken your organic <pause dur="0.4"/> which started out like <kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> this <pause dur="0.3"/> through to <kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> there <pause dur="0.5"/> but of course it doesn't stop there <pause dur="0.3"/> because what then happens is <pause dur="0.3"/> the the whole thing starts all over again <pause dur="0.2"/> this time you would write <kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> R-H-O-two-H in here <pause dur="0.3"/> and again you would pull off another hydrogen atom <pause dur="0.3"/> and you'd take it to one higher state of oxidation <pause dur="0.3"/> so it goes round and round and round and round <pause dur="0.2"/> and every time it goes round <pause dur="0.2"/> you strip one hydrogen out <pause dur="0.3"/> and you put an O-H on <pause dur="0.3"/> so <pause dur="0.3"/> you know you in the end you end up with if you like <pause dur="0.2"/> if you imagine a carbon with four hydroxy groups around it <pause dur="0.3"/> that's all that really is C-O-two and some protons so <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> you are really you're really taking the through through the 
thing through <pause dur="0.4"/> from <pause dur="0.2"/> a fully reduced form with carbons with lots of hydrogens <pause dur="0.3"/> through to a very highly oxygenated form <pause dur="0.2"/> that finally becomes C-O-two <pause dur="0.6"/> so <pause dur="0.2"/> that is the # <pause dur="0.2"/> that's the sequence <pause dur="0.2"/> of reactions <pause dur="0.4"/> in in the H-two-O-two U-V process <pause dur="0.3"/> it's exactly the same <pause dur="0.4"/> if you have the T-I-O-two there as well <pause dur="0.3"/> if i wrote T-I-O-two for H-nu <pause dur="0.6"/> it's <trunc>ju</trunc> it's exactly it's just the same sort of thing <pause dur="1.0"/> in fact people working on these systems there are three favourite things to work on one's T-I-O-two <pause dur="0.4"/> one's H-two-O-two and the third one's ozone <pause dur="0.3"/> 'cause if you irradiate ozone <pause dur="0.3"/> you get <pause dur="0.2"/> O-two molecule <pause dur="0.6"/> and an oxygen atom <pause dur="0.4"/> and the oxygen atom inserts into water <pause dur="0.3"/> it's extremely reactive <pause dur="0.3"/> and gives you two O-H radicals <pause dur="0.2"/> so <pause dur="0.2"/> the whole thing is centred on making O-H radicals <pause dur="0.5"/> O-H radicals are the great purifying radicals <kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="20"/> in this life <pause dur="1.8"/> now this system has been looked at very very extensively <pause dur="1.3"/> # with all manner of pollutants <pause dur="0.5"/> and i'll give you a <trunc>t</trunc> a a another slide now <pause dur="0.2"/> with about a million compounds on <pause dur="0.2"/> and you're not to <pause dur="0.2"/> try and write 
all these down <pause dur="0.5"/> but you could just maybe write down well well one or two examples <pause dur="0.4"/> so # <pause dur="0.3"/> here we go <pause dur="0.6"/> so these are <pause dur="0.3"/> photomineralization of organic pollutants <pause dur="0.3"/> sensitized by T-I-O-two <pause dur="0.3"/> examples of compound studied <pause dur="0.6"/> and the very simplest compound methane pentane dodecane <pause dur="0.4"/> they go <pause dur="0.3"/> hologenated hologenated alkanes <pause dur="0.4"/> tetrachloroethane <pause dur="0.3"/> dibromoethane so for all these rather <pause dur="0.2"/> dangerous solvents you know which at one time were very beloved of the dry cleaning industry <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> can be degraded using the T-I-O-two system <pause dur="0.7"/> alcohols <pause dur="0.2"/> absolutely no problem <pause dur="0.6"/> acids the next stage up from alcohols no problem <pause dur="0.4"/> alkenes <pause dur="0.6"/> straight away <pause dur="1.2"/> chloroalkenes again dry cleaning solvents <pause dur="0.4"/> they can be destroyed <pause dur="0.5"/> and the dreaded aromatics like benzene <pause dur="0.6"/> they can be destroyed <pause dur="0.5"/> halogens <pause dur="0.7"/> well here we've got dichlorophenol dichlorophenol <pause dur="0.3"/> these are all the <trunc>de</trunc> degraded products <pause dur="0.3"/> from things like polychloro<pause dur="0.3"/>biphenyls <pause dur="0.3"/> they're also degraded products from dioxins the <pause dur="0.2"/> famous # <pause dur="0.2"/> Seveso disaster in Italy <pause dur="0.5"/> where <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> a whole <pause dur="0.5"/> area # was heavily contaminated 
a lot of people <pause dur="0.5"/> # died <pause dur="0.3"/> from ingesting # the these toxic materials <pause dur="0.9"/> the straightforward phenols are vulnerable <pause dur="0.9"/> carboxylic acids <pause dur="0.5"/> polymers are not they're not quite so easy to do with polymers but they you can <pause dur="0.4"/> degrade polymers with T-I-O-two <pause dur="0.5"/> # 'cause these aren't water soluble <pause dur="0.2"/> so it's it's not it's not straightforward <pause dur="0.2"/> you have to grind them into a powder or do something to them <pause dur="0.3"/> to <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> expose them properly to the T-I-O-two but T-I-O-two will will will remove them <pause dur="0.5"/> whole series of # surfactants <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> all manner of surfactants of course get out into the <pause dur="0.9"/> aqueous systems into rivers <pause dur="0.2"/> streams and lakes <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> they're used very extensively in industry and also domestically <pause dur="0.5"/> and they're really quite <trunc>di</trunc> difficult things to get rid of <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> but T-I-O-two <pause dur="0.2"/> will <pause dur="0.3"/> # attack them all <pause dur="0.4"/> then you get down to herbicides <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> simazine and <pause dur="0.2"/> things like that <pause dur="0.7"/> the pesticides like D-D-T parathion and lindane <pause dur="0.4"/> and then also dye stuffs they're quite important because a lot of factories <pause dur="0.5"/> that use dye stuffs <pause dur="0.4"/> they're only allowed 
to discharge at very very low levels so they have to process their effluent themselves <pause dur="0.4"/> otherwise they're <pause dur="0.2"/> subject to heavy fines <pause dur="0.5"/> and they're always looking for they normally do this by some sort of chemical means <pause dur="0.3"/> but if you get down to very low levels <pause dur="0.4"/> then you can use T-I-O-two <pause dur="0.2"/> to finish off the <pause dur="0.3"/> to finish off the job <pause dur="0.5"/> so a vast array of compounds <pause dur="0.3"/> and they all go <pause dur="0.3"/> through this organic radical route <pause dur="0.4"/> # by going to giving you # <pause dur="0.2"/> O-H attack it to give a carbon radical <pause dur="0.2"/> which picks up oxygen to give a peroxy radical <pause dur="0.4"/> and you get a hydroperoxide <pause dur="0.3"/> and then that <pause dur="0.2"/> in turn is <kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="18"/> destroyed further <pause dur="0.5"/> so that's the kind of thing that # <pause dur="0.3"/> that goes on <pause dur="1.5"/> # <pause dur="7.9"/> this is <pause dur="0.6"/> # # <pause dur="0.3"/> not as not as important a slide but i'll i'll i'll just # show you the the type of thing that people <pause dur="0.3"/> study here <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.9"/> there are two ways of going at this really one is to try and analyse the pollutant disappearance <pause dur="0.5"/> # which you can do by monitoring the pollutant level by G-C-M-S or something like that <pause dur="0.4"/> the other is to look at C-O-two evolution <pause dur="0.5"/> and 
# <pause dur="0.2"/> here are we well beyond looking at C-O-two <pause dur="0.2"/> # evolution <pause dur="0.5"/> and we are measuring <pause dur="0.3"/> pollutants at various concentrations in milligrams per <pause dur="0.4"/> per <pause dur="0.9"/> cubic decimetre <pause dur="0.5"/> and <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> as you can imagine <pause dur="0.5"/> as you begin to increase the concentration of course <pause dur="0.4"/> you'd expect the thing to plateau out <pause dur="0.4"/> because <pause dur="0.6"/> as you raise the concentration <pause dur="0.5"/> you're beginning to saturate the surface of the <pause dur="0.2"/> T-I-O-two particle <pause dur="0.3"/> with the thing you're trying to destroy <pause dur="0.3"/> and so if you go to # <pause dur="0.5"/> # to <pause dur="0.3"/> to levels more than <pause dur="0.5"/> # <kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> around here <pause dur="1.5"/> then <pause dur="0.4"/> you're not going to have such an efficient process <pause dur="0.2"/> simply because <pause dur="0.3"/> you've reached <pause dur="0.3"/> a kind of a <pause dur="0.3"/> saturation of the level it's very much a kind of <pause dur="0.2"/> Langmuir type kinetics # whether you <pause dur="0.4"/> can remember <pause dur="0.3"/> i think i talked about Langmuir kinetics even in first year to you <pause dur="0.5"/> but # <pause dur="0.9"/> Langmuir's idea was that <pause dur="0.3"/> every every surface of a catalyst <pause dur="0.2"/> has a certain number of sites <pause dur="0.9"/> and when the sites were filled <pause dur="0.7"/> then you've got no more catalytic action <pause dur="0.2"/> and you could double treble <pause dur="0.5"/> multiply this concentration by a ten or a 
hundred <pause dur="0.3"/> you'd get no more joy <pause dur="0.3"/> in the way of them <pause dur="0.2"/> producing C-O-two <pause dur="0.4"/> or in this case or whatever it was <pause dur="0.3"/> because you've <trunc>s</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> saturated the catalyst <pause dur="0.3"/> you can see the saturation coming in here <pause dur="0.3"/> so this illustrates that the <pause dur="0.3"/> the Langmuir <pause dur="0.3"/> type of idea <pause dur="0.4"/> is valid for T-I-O-two <pause dur="0.5"/> a lot of people have done done very detailed surface kinetic study of these systems for a number of things <pause dur="0.3"/> a number of different pollutants <pause dur="0.2"/> and they find all the time <pause dur="0.3"/> the sort of behaviour <pause dur="0.2"/><kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> i've illustrated here <pause dur="0.4"/> you you plateau out <pause dur="0.7"/> now this doesn't matter too much because <pause dur="0.3"/> industrially <pause dur="0.3"/> the sorts of things you're trying to remove <pause dur="0.3"/> like the chlorophenyls and dioxins and things <pause dur="0.3"/> surfactants <pause dur="0.2"/> are actually at very very low levels <pause dur="0.6"/> they're very harmful <pause dur="0.7"/> but they are at very very <trunc>le</trunc> very low levels and so <pause dur="0.6"/> the problem <pause dur="0.5"/> is one <pause dur="0.3"/> that you can reasonably attack <pause dur="0.4"/> because you <pause dur="0.3"/> do not normally have <pause dur="0.3"/> for the pollutant levels <pause dur="0.2"/> sort of <pause dur="0.3"/> you know <pause dur="0.5"/> at <kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> this end you tend to be more towards <kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> that end <pause dur="0.3"/> so the <trunc>t</trunc> the the thing is in your sights <pause dur="0.3"/> you can <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/><kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="29"/> stand a 
reasonable chance <trunc>o</trunc> of getting a a conversion <pause dur="0.5"/> to <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> free up the system <pause dur="1.9"/> the <pause dur="0.7"/> question of <pause dur="0.6"/> how <pause dur="0.7"/> good a catalyst <pause dur="0.2"/> <trunc>i</trunc> the the T-I-O-two is <pause dur="0.3"/> of course <pause dur="0.7"/> # also revolves around <pause dur="1.0"/> does it <pause dur="0.7"/> wear out <pause dur="0.9"/> do you <pause dur="0.7"/> come up against having to replace it quite frequently <pause dur="0.2"/> how often does it turn over <pause dur="0.5"/> and this is a a a <trunc>n</trunc> a nice little slide here i think <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> it's only # <pause dur="1.3"/> ten <pause dur="0.3"/> cycles but what what have we got here <pause dur="0.4"/> well we've actually got four-chlorophenol <pause dur="0.5"/> which is again a very typical type of # thing to be looking at <pause dur="0.3"/> and we got one portion of T-I-O-two <pause dur="0.2"/> only one portion <pause dur="0.6"/> we start off <pause dur="0.3"/> # <kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> at <pause dur="0.3"/> this concentration here of about # <pause dur="0.2"/> three times ten-to-minus-#-<pause dur="0.8"/>#-<pause dur="0.2"/>six <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> micromolar <pause dur="0.5"/> you shine the light on <pause dur="0.5"/> and you see the level <pause dur="0.4"/> falls away rapidly and as the <trunc>f</trunc> four-chlorophenol is is being destroyed <pause dur="1.2"/> then what you do <pause dur="0.4"/> is # <pause dur="1.8"/> inject <pause dur="0.4"/> into the system <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> a fresh <pause dur="0.2"/> quantity <pause dur="0.5"/> syringe the four-chlorophenol <pause dur="0.4"/> away it goes <pause dur="0.3"/> you inject <trunc>f</trunc> a fresh amount away it goes <pause dur="0.3"/> so you're you're acid we use in a catalyst to completely destroy <pause dur="0.4"/> or very nearly destroy your four-chlorophenol <pause dur="0.3"/> 
then you if you use some fresh four-chlorophenol <pause dur="0.4"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> you see it goes on and on and on although i think they did they had ten goes at it and then they probably got bored <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> after that 'cause they got up to twelve-hundred minutes <pause dur="0.6"/> # which is i suppose # <pause dur="0.2"/> quite a long time <pause dur="0.4"/> and probably the graduate student who <pause dur="0.3"/> # was doing this just got tired and wanted to go home <pause dur="0.3"/> so that # it <trunc>w</trunc> it wasn't taken any <shift feature="voice" new="laugh"/>further <shift feature="voice" new="normal"/> <pause dur="0.4"/> but <pause dur="0.2"/> i think you get the you get the picture <pause dur="0.3"/> the thing is very <pause dur="0.5"/> # adaptable it's very recyclable <pause dur="0.7"/> it takes a long time to exhaust it <pause dur="0.8"/> i <pause dur="0.7"/> i i can add a sort of footnote to that even even when it begins after many many many cycles maybe hundreds to become exhausted <pause dur="1.0"/> you can actually reactivate it you can you can # take it <pause dur="0.3"/> wash it <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> and heat it to quite a high temperature <pause dur="0.2"/> let it cool down <pause dur="0.2"/> it starts off <pause dur="0.4"/> all over again <pause dur="0.3"/> so you <trunc>i</trunc> it is really renewable <pause dur="0.3"/> so it it's really kind of # <pause dur="0.5"/><kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="21"/> # almost hypnotically successful you know people <pause dur="0.3"/> # really become very enthusiastic about it <pause dur="0.3"/> <trunc>a</trunc> as a way of # <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="1.4"/> trying to degrade <pause dur="0.9"/> noxious organics <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="1.1"/> 
how do you sort of set up things like this how do you get it to work these these are some of the practical points now and then i <trunc>n</trunc> i <trunc>g</trunc> moving away from theory <pause dur="0.4"/> there are there are there are <trunc>s</trunc> various ways of doing it <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> what you can do <pause dur="0.3"/> where we've got we've got # <pause dur="0.2"/> two two set ups and these are two flow reactors <pause dur="0.7"/> flow reactors are probably much better in a way because they model what you want to do <pause dur="0.3"/> in treating industrial effluent <pause dur="0.4"/> much better than batch reactors <pause dur="0.4"/> now you you don't just sort of have to take # <pause dur="0.5"/> a batch of water <pause dur="0.4"/> purify it <pause dur="0.6"/> and then take another batch and purify it you want to be able to purify <pause dur="0.2"/> a constant stream <pause dur="0.2"/> as it comes from some site or other <pause dur="0.5"/> so what have we actually got here <pause dur="0.6"/> well <pause dur="0.2"/> # you've got <pause dur="0.3"/> # in <kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> this one <pause dur="0.5"/> you you're flowing your material <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> well you you've got you start <trunc>o</trunc> to start off with you've got <pause dur="0.7"/> your fluorescent tube <pause dur="0.3"/> okay just like an ordinary ordinary fluorescent tube <pause dur="0.8"/> and then <pause dur="0.4"/> coaxially <pause dur="0.5"/> positioned to this you've got an outer glass jacket <pause dur="0.7"/> and you flow your solution through <kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> 
here <pause dur="0.4"/> up there <pause dur="0.2"/><kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> and out the top <pause dur="0.4"/> and all the way through here <kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> these sort of things <pause dur="0.4"/> are <pause dur="0.3"/> a glass mesh <pause dur="0.3"/> or they could be glass helices <pause dur="0.3"/> they're all coated with T-I-O-two <pause dur="0.3"/> it's very easy to coat the glass with that <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> you know we sort of do it all the time <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="1.8"/> and <pause dur="0.7"/> as the stuff flows up the fluorescent light is on <pause dur="0.2"/> the U-V is coming <kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> this way <pause dur="0.2"/> it hits the helices <pause dur="0.3"/> where the T-I-O-two is layered <pause dur="0.3"/> with a thin layer <pause dur="0.6"/> the T-I-O-two becomes activated by the light <pause dur="0.3"/> you get the degradation occurring <pause dur="0.2"/> so you pass in <pause dur="0.2"/> the chlorophenol or whatever it is at the bottom <pause dur="0.3"/> and at the top <pause dur="0.4"/> you get C-O-two and chloride <pause dur="0.5"/> and that's one way of doing it <pause dur="0.4"/> # another way of doing it <pause dur="0.4"/> is in fact to <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> it would simply spiral <pause dur="0.5"/> the <unclear>ethene</unclear> <pause dur="0.2"/> round the fluorescent tube <pause dur="0.4"/> and the inside of the <pause dur="0.4"/> glass tube <pause dur="0.5"/> is coated with the T-I-O-two <pause dur="0.7"/> if you have a very thin layer <pause dur="0.3"/> that's okay the light the light will get through <pause dur="0.4"/> a very very thick layer of T-I-O-two <pause dur="0.5"/> so # you can you can do it this way so these these are two kind of flow systems that you can <pause dur="0.3"/> you can operate <pause dur="0.7"/> so 
that's a <kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="22"/> that's a kind of a <pause dur="0.7"/> just just a technical point but i mean you know you might wonder <pause dur="0.3"/> how you're going to set about doing these things <pause dur="1.6"/> # <pause dur="0.8"/> if you want to <pause dur="0.2"/> do a # a batch reaction <pause dur="0.3"/> well you can do it <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> i guess the first time you ever <pause dur="0.2"/> study these things you tend to do them in batch <pause dur="0.4"/> so but you this would be <trunc>n</trunc> of not much <pause dur="0.4"/> help <pause dur="0.3"/> in # <pause dur="0.4"/> trying to # establish a kind of industrial process <pause dur="0.5"/> but essentially here <pause dur="0.4"/> you <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> have got # <pause dur="1.6"/> # <pause dur="4.3"/> yeah you've got all your tubes <pause dur="0.8"/><kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> in here you've got a bank of tubes maybe six or eight in in each of those you you sort of bring them together <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> in a core <kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> here <pause dur="0.4"/> B <pause dur="0.6"/> is <pause dur="0.2"/> where you've actually got your # reaction where there's your sample <pause dur="0.5"/> # and you're passing through some oxygen continuously <pause dur="0.5"/> # through through the top <pause dur="0.3"/> through through this # <pause dur="0.2"/><kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> this cylinder here <pause dur="0.7"/> and # <pause dur="2.9"/> it bubbles round and uses the pumping system to pump it around <pause dur="0.7"/> so <pause dur="0.6"/> and you've also got the stirrer <unclear>wheel</unclear> <pause dur="0.5"/> okay so that that would be a typical batch thing <pause dur="0.8"/> # i've got a system here that # <pause dur="0.2"/> i run from time to time which is slightly different 
from that i blow the oxygen up <pause dur="0.9"/> the bottom of the tube <pause dur="0.2"/> and at the sort of bottom of the vessel <pause dur="0.2"/> through a glass sinter <pause dur="0.3"/> and as oxygen goes through <pause dur="0.3"/> the oxygen pressure <pause dur="0.5"/> # keeps the <pause dur="0.2"/> aqueous solution above the sinter <pause dur="0.3"/> and the sinter <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> the oxygen into thousands and thousands of tiny streams <pause dur="0.4"/> and so you get a very very good sparging <pause dur="0.3"/> of the oxygen as it goes up through the solution very good # <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> # use uses <event desc="takes off transparency" iterated="n"/> of the oxygen because you you've broken it down into tiny bubbles <pause dur="0.3"/> you get maximum <pause dur="0.3"/> bubble exposure <pause dur="0.4"/> to to the solution <pause dur="0.9"/> # <pause dur="1.7"/> another way of # <pause dur="0.4"/> # i've got another another slide here <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.9"/> if you're looking at # <pause dur="0.2"/> i mentioned before when you were trying to analyse what was going on <pause dur="0.6"/> you can <pause dur="0.5"/> with <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="2.2"/> pentachlorophenol you can <pause dur="0.3"/> analyse it by G-C-M-S <pause dur="0.4"/> but much easier is to look at C-O-two evolution <pause dur="0.7"/> and also <pause dur="0.7"/> quite easy is to have a sensor electrode for chloride <pause dur="0.4"/> and again in the studies we do here <pause dur="0.5"/> we use a chloride unselective electrode <pause dur="0.4"/> which simply <trunc>d</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> measures chloride as it's 
developed <pause dur="0.3"/> as the organic chloride breaks down to chloride <pause dur="0.4"/> you can follow the chloride <pause dur="0.3"/> electrochemically <pause dur="0.2"/> you might remember in the first year i think there was a experiment <pause dur="0.3"/> where you hydrolyse T-butyl chloride <pause dur="0.3"/> and you measure the chloride evolution <pause dur="0.6"/> <trunc>fro</trunc> from the hydrolysis <pause dur="0.4"/> by <pause dur="0.2"/> looking at the conductivity do you remember this experiment from your <pause dur="0.3"/> your misspent youths <pause dur="0.5"/> well anyway <pause dur="0.3"/> # that used to be in the first year even if it's <pause dur="0.2"/> isn't isn't now <pause dur="0.5"/> it's quite easy to have a a little sensor electrode <pause dur="0.4"/> which is sensitive to chloride you have this dipping in <pause dur="0.3"/> and you simply measure the chloride that's produced <pause dur="0.5"/> if you're looking at dye stuff degradation it's much easier <pause dur="0.4"/><kinesic desc="puts on transparency" iterated="n"/> so this is if you've got a a a <trunc>ni</trunc> a nice big chromoform <pause dur="0.2"/> on your molecule <pause dur="0.3"/> and here <pause dur="0.2"/> this is metheylene blue <pause dur="0.3"/> which is a good model for quite a few dyes as quite a few dyes have got a structure similar to metheylene blue <pause dur="0.5"/> and metheylene blue <pause dur="0.2"/> absorbs # well it's blue of course it absorbs in the red <pause dur="0.5"/> a bit of a bit like a sort of <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> 
solution <pause dur="0.4"/> and you start off by having <pause dur="0.4"/> an absorption band A <kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> there <pause dur="0.2"/> and as you irradiate at various times <pause dur="0.3"/> the thing <kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> falls away <pause dur="0.2"/> like so <pause dur="0.2"/> so you end up with that as your baseline <pause dur="0.5"/> and you you <trunc>s</trunc> you your baseline's rather high 'cause you've got T-I-O-two <pause dur="0.5"/> buzzing around giving you a quite a bit of a background <pause dur="0.5"/> and if you measure the <pause dur="0.2"/> peak maximum <kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> there the plot of the absorbence versus time <pause dur="0.6"/> normalize it to the baseline <pause dur="0.4"/> you get that sort of thing occurring <pause dur="0.2"/> and you can see that # with this metheylene blue <pause dur="0.3"/> that's <pause dur="0.2"/> ten micromolar roughly <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> you only need to expose <pause dur="0.4"/> # for <pause dur="0.2"/> five minutes and it's totally destroyed <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> i've seen this done as a demonstration <pause dur="0.4"/> it's quite effective starts off with deep blue <pause dur="0.3"/> ends up <pause dur="0.2"/> water white <pause dur="0.4"/> so it's really quite a good # <pause dur="0.4"/> quite a good demonstration type experiment <pause dur="0.4"/><event desc="takes off transparency" iterated="n"/> and here we're actually <pause dur="0.3"/> we've got a a a project running at the moment <pause dur="0.3"/> with one of the M-chem students who's going to be looking at other dyes <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> being destroyed by by this type of system <pause dur="0.9"/> # <pause dur="1.1"/> one or two <pause dur="0.2"/> 
other small <pause dur="0.4"/> # kinetic points <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> that # are <trunc>p</trunc> are probably worth making <pause dur="1.6"/> i mentioned before <pause dur="0.2"/> that if you vary the concentration <pause dur="0.9"/> of the <pause dur="1.1"/> molecule you're attacking your substrate <pause dur="0.6"/> then <pause dur="0.3"/> it follows Langmuir type kinetics in other words to begin with <pause dur="0.2"/> if you double the amount of organic <pause dur="0.3"/> you double the rate of degradation <pause dur="0.3"/> but quite soon <pause dur="0.2"/> it turns over to a plateau <pause dur="0.3"/> because you're saturating the surface <pause dur="0.7"/> of the particles <pause dur="0.4"/> with the organic you're wanting to destroy <pause dur="0.3"/> and that <unclear>any</unclear> more isn't isn't <trunc>mu</trunc> really much <pause dur="0.3"/> much use <pause dur="0.6"/> the other thing you can do is to look at the dependence on the light intensity <pause dur="0.4"/> and you might say well if i go from a hundred watt bulb to a two-hundred watt bulb to a four-hundred watt bulb to a kilowatt bulb <pause dur="0.4"/> am i gaining <pause dur="0.8"/> or <pause dur="0.5"/> is it worth the extra energy input <pause dur="0.4"/> there's been quite a bit of work on that <pause dur="0.3"/> and again we've done some work here on it as well <pause dur="0.2"/> this is not our results but our results are very similar <pause dur="0.4"/><kinesic desc="puts on transparency" iterated="n"/> this is actually degrading isopropanol <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> okay <pause dur="0.2"/> and you're destroying 
isopropanol <pause dur="0.3"/> using <trunc>T-I</trunc> # well <pause dur="0.4"/> it says rutile that's one of the forms of T-I-O-two <pause dur="0.3"/> and you can see <pause dur="0.2"/> you what you what what's been plotted here <pause dur="0.3"/> is the log <pause dur="0.2"/> of the rate of the acetone formation you can measure acetone quite easily <pause dur="0.4"/> by again by G-C <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> and <kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> here is the log of the light intensity <pause dur="0.8"/> and <pause dur="0.3"/> if you've got if you remember <unclear>that's really</unclear> if you remember from your again your again from your first year kinetics <pause dur="0.3"/> lectures that # <pause dur="0.6"/> if you've # <pause dur="2.4"/> got <pause dur="0.5"/> a dependence <pause dur="0.6"/> which <pause dur="0.2"/> is <pause dur="1.4"/><event desc="moves board" iterated="n"/> <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> like this and you've got <pause dur="0.6"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="10"/> R <pause dur="0.9"/> is equal to K <pause dur="0.6"/> times some sort of thing like concentration if i call it I for light intensity <pause dur="0.4"/> and you've got that power <pause dur="0.4"/> A <pause dur="0.4"/> okay <pause dur="0.2"/> then what you can do is take logs <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="11"/> say log-<pause dur="0.2"/>R <pause dur="0.6"/> is equal to K <pause dur="1.5"/> log-K sorry <pause dur="0.8"/> plus A-<pause dur="0.5"/>log-<pause dur="0.6"/>I <pause dur="0.4"/> okay that's taking logs <pause dur="0.5"/> that's actually <trunc>f</trunc> you know first year type work <pause dur="0.5"/> and <pause dur="0.9"/> to find out what A is <pause dur="0.4"/> what is the <unclear>value</unclear> is it depending <trunc>t</trunc> on the light intensity of the first power <pause dur="0.2"/> the second power <pause dur="0.9"/> no power at all it does it not depend on the amount of light you put in <pause dur="0.4"/> then you can 
find that out by plotting <pause dur="0.2"/> the log of the rate of the reaction <pause dur="0.3"/> photomineralization in this case <pause dur="0.4"/> versus the log <pause dur="0.8"/> of the light intensity <pause dur="0.4"/> okay <pause dur="0.3"/> so that that that is # <pause dur="0.4"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="n"/><kinesic desc="indicates point on board" iterated="n"/> first year revisited <pause dur="0.4"/> and you ought to keep you you <trunc>rev</trunc> revisiting first year chemistry <pause dur="0.2"/> for as long as you do chemistry because all the fundamentals come out there <pause dur="0.3"/> you can see here <pause dur="0.3"/> that this <kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> this line <pause dur="0.3"/> going up here <pause dur="0.2"/> is is is a good nice forty-five degrees it's a forty-five degree line <pause dur="0.5"/> it means the thing <pause dur="0.2"/> is strictly first order <pause dur="0.2"/> the slope is one-point-nought <pause dur="0.3"/> and so to begin with <pause dur="0.8"/> the <pause dur="0.2"/> and if you double the light intensity <pause dur="0.4"/> you double the rate <pause dur="0.7"/> but <pause dur="0.2"/> when you get past a certain point <pause dur="1.0"/> you find that the slope <pause dur="0.4"/> falls exactly <pause dur="0.4"/> to half <pause dur="0.2"/> it falls from one-point-nought to nought-point-five <pause dur="0.6"/> so it seems that we can go to very high light intensities <pause dur="1.6"/> that at the <pause dur="0.4"/> rate of evolution <pause dur="0.6"/> of your product <pause dur="0.4"/> is no longer first order in the light <pause dur="0.4"/> it becomes half order in the light <pause dur="0.3"/> so if you double the light <pause dur="0.5"/> you only increase the intensity by one-point-four <pause dur="0.9"/> # 
that's an interesting observation <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> and you might think well i can understand easily why it is if you increase the <pause dur="0.7"/> organic <pause dur="0.4"/> concentration <pause dur="0.3"/> you saturate the surface <pause dur="0.7"/> but <pause dur="0.6"/> surely <pause dur="1.7"/> the more light you put on the system surely all the time <pause dur="0.2"/> the more efficient the process would be 'cause you're getting more excited states <pause dur="0.4"/> which would give you more O-H radicals <pause dur="0.6"/> et cetera et cetera <pause dur="0.8"/> has anyone got any idea why it is that it falls away <pause dur="0.2"/> as you get to very high light intensities <pause dur="0.3"/> any thoughts on that <pause dur="2.4"/> imagine you've got a particle <pause dur="0.4"/> tiny particle <pause dur="0.2"/> it's being irradiated with light <pause dur="0.3"/> and you go on increasing the light more and more and more these are logs here <pause dur="0.2"/> you know <kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> this is a <pause dur="0.3"/> # enormous <trunc>dis</trunc> you're going through <pause dur="0.5"/> between <pause dur="0.4"/> thirteen and eighteen that's five orders of magnitude <pause dur="0.3"/> on the light intensity <pause dur="0.2"/> a hundred-thousand times this is a very detailed study <pause dur="0.6"/> when you go to extremely high light intensities <pause dur="0.3"/> what do you think happens to the <pause dur="0.6"/> whole electron pairs formed in the <pause dur="0.3"/> particle <pause dur="0.5"/> any ideas <pause dur="4.1"/> 
well you've got a plus and a minus <pause dur="0.7"/> they're going to move to the surface to <trunc>s</trunc> to <pause dur="0.2"/> localize this plus and minus <pause dur="0.3"/> but what happens when the concentration of the pluses and the minuses on the surface <pause dur="0.6"/> becomes extremely large <pause dur="0.5"/> what will they do to each other </u><pause dur="0.4"/> <u who="sf0695" trans="pause"> they destroy each other </u><pause dur="0.3"/> <u who="nm0693" trans="pause"> they yeah they they mutually destroy each other <pause dur="0.5"/> if you get to growing high light intensities <pause dur="0.3"/> you get to the point <pause dur="0.4"/> where <pause dur="0.2"/> the positive centres <pause dur="0.3"/> and the negative centres although they want to react with the water <pause dur="0.3"/> they want to react with the oxygen <pause dur="0.3"/> they're in such a high concentration now <pause dur="0.8"/> there's quite a good chance they'll actually kill each other off <pause dur="0.3"/> and so you actually begin to lose out <pause dur="0.9"/> once you've gone beyond a certain light intensity the benefits of going to even higher light intensities and i mean <pause dur="0.3"/> enormously powerful lamps <pause dur="0.6"/> tend to be lost <pause dur="0.7"/> so <pause dur="0.2"/> that that again that's an a a a an environmental point well worth <pause dur="0.4"/> kind of taking a note of <pause dur="0.9"/><kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="23"/> okay <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="2.6"/> i can # <pause dur="0.7"/> maybe # <pause dur="0.7"/> finish off with a a few more advanced experiments 
that have been done <pause dur="0.5"/> and # <pause dur="0.9"/> i'll just look at the <trunc>kinetic</trunc> i've <trunc>ju</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> talked about the kinetics several times i'll maybe underline that now by <pause dur="0.3"/> putting up <pause dur="0.7"/> the normal rate of degradation <pause dur="0.8"/> okay so <pause dur="0.5"/> this is for any system now <pause dur="0.4"/> # using a <trunc>semi</trunc> any semiconductor <pause dur="0.4"/> under illumination <pause dur="0.5"/> and what i've got there <pause dur="0.3"/> is the rate of degradation <pause dur="0.7"/> we've got you see got a Langmuir term <kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> here for oxygen <pause dur="0.4"/> and what this what it is what this implies is <pause dur="0.3"/> that <pause dur="0.8"/> if you keep increasing the oxygen <pause dur="0.3"/> you gain benefit <pause dur="0.2"/> but eventually you're going to saturate the surface with oxygen <pause dur="0.6"/><kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> this is the organic chlorophenol <pause dur="0.9"/> you can <pause dur="0.4"/> go on <pause dur="0.2"/> adding chlorophenol but eventually <pause dur="0.7"/> when it when it becomes very high <pause dur="1.4"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/><kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> that term there <pause dur="0.2"/> one plus <pause dur="0.2"/> you know on the right here <pause dur="0.2"/> if C-P is very very high <pause dur="0.3"/> the one is almost negligible <pause dur="0.3"/> and that will then cancel with the thing above <pause dur="0.2"/> and so then it becomes zero order in the chlorophenol in other words it's reached a plateau <pause dur="0.4"/> same with the oxygen <pause dur="0.4"/> so <pause dur="0.3"/> you can you can <pause dur="0.4"/> oxygen is a good thing <pause dur="0.3"/> and 
chlorophenol's a good thing <pause dur="0.3"/> but you can have too much of both <pause dur="0.2"/> okay that's the that's the message there <pause dur="0.7"/> and then <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="1.0"/> you've also well <pause dur="0.6"/> if you've # <pause dur="1.2"/> yeah i think <pause dur="0.2"/> i'll i'll probably skip that i mean # # <pause dur="0.4"/> i think i <trunc>mi</trunc> i might skip <pause dur="0.2"/> the next bit i think i'll leave it at that <pause dur="0.5"/> with just this warning <pause dur="0.4"/><kinesic desc="reveals covered part of transparency" iterated="n"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> i've talked about the light intensity before <pause dur="0.4"/> # it's gamma-I-A-to-the-power-M <pause dur="0.4"/> and M is one-point-nought <pause dur="0.9"/> low light intensities <pause dur="0.9"/> and it's nought-point-five <pause dur="0.5"/> at high light <pause dur="0.2"/> high light intensities <pause dur="0.3"/><event desc="takes off transparency" iterated="n"/> okay <pause dur="0.5"/> so <pause dur="0.3"/> i think that's <trunc>m</trunc> kind of summarizes what i what i said before <pause dur="1.1"/> in trying to go on and look at <pause dur="0.8"/> # other <pause dur="0.3"/> detailed <pause dur="0.3"/> aspects <pause dur="0.2"/> of the process <pause dur="0.5"/> one of the questions is this <pause dur="2.0"/> does all the <pause dur="0.5"/> reaction take place at the surface <pause dur="0.3"/> of the particle <pause dur="0.9"/> or <pause dur="0.4"/> do some of the O-H radicals escape into solution <pause dur="1.5"/> and some of the superoxide ions escape into solution as well <pause dur="1.2"/> and do we have a solution process <pause dur="1.0"/> as well as a surface process <pause dur="0.8"/> and the question <pause dur="0.2"/> # is is <pause dur="0.3"/> here again quite an <trunc>in</trunc> quite an <trunc>instru</trunc> <pause dur="0.3"/> important one mechanistically <pause dur="0.3"/> is it <pause dur="0.2"/> the 
whole thing <pause dur="0.3"/> surface limited <pause dur="0.4"/> or is we've got a surface process <pause dur="0.7"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> a degradation solution <pause dur="0.5"/> so <pause dur="0.6"/> we began to think was there a way of probing this in some detail <pause dur="0.5"/><kinesic desc="puts on transparency" iterated="n"/> and what i've got here <pause dur="0.7"/> is <pause dur="0.2"/> an experiment <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> which has only been i've only done about two or three years ago <pause dur="0.6"/> and this is <pause dur="0.2"/> # one where you've got # <pause dur="1.8"/><kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> this glass slide here <pause dur="0.2"/> with a very thick coating of T-I-O-two <pause dur="0.7"/> okay <pause dur="1.3"/> inside <pause dur="0.3"/><kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> this little bath <pause dur="1.8"/> you've got a <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> dish <pause dur="0.5"/> you've got solution of chlorophenol <pause dur="0.4"/> so the chlorophenol <pause dur="0.4"/> is in <kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> there <pause dur="1.6"/><kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> here <pause dur="0.2"/> you've got a microelectrode <pause dur="0.5"/> and if i say the word microelectrode you ought to think of the <trunc>w</trunc> the two words <gap reason="name" extent="2 words"/> 'cause he's the chap who makes all the microelectrodes here he's one of <pause dur="0.5"/> probably the U-K's leading expert on microelectrodes <pause dur="0.5"/> and this this electrode <pause dur="0.4"/><kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> here <pause dur="1.1"/> is as low as five microns in diameter <pause dur="0.3"/> five microns <pause dur="0.3"/> i think the one we used was about twenty-five microns <pause dur="0.4"/> but he's <pause dur="0.2"/> improved them quite a bit since then <pause dur="0.3"/> this is simply the reference electrode saturated calomel electrode in the 
usual way <pause dur="0.4"/> you always have to have a reference electrode <pause dur="0.5"/> the light comes from a lamp <kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> here <pause dur="0.3"/> going through <pause dur="0.3"/> a <pause dur="0.7"/> bank of lenses <pause dur="0.7"/> and bounced off a mirror <pause dur="0.5"/> to arrive there <pause dur="0.2"/> so <kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> <unclear>collect at</unclear> a highly focused <pause dur="0.3"/> spot of light there <pause dur="0.3"/> on the T-I-O-two film <pause dur="0.5"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> the experiment consisted <pause dur="0.3"/> of looping this microelectrode <pause dur="1.0"/> nearer and further away <pause dur="0.3"/> from the T-I-O-two <pause dur="0.4"/> and the question was <pause dur="0.2"/> would you get <pause dur="0.2"/> a bigger chloride ion development <pause dur="0.4"/> very close <pause dur="0.8"/> or would you get any further away <pause dur="0.2"/> and could you model it <pause dur="0.4"/> with a computer <pause dur="0.5"/> so this is # <pause dur="0.2"/> a <pause dur="0.3"/> # a probe <pause dur="0.4"/> this is a probe type experiment <pause dur="0.2"/> these are becoming really <pause dur="0.4"/> very important # <pause dur="0.3"/> all manner of probe apparatuses have been <pause dur="0.5"/><kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="16"/> # <pause dur="0.9"/> designed and perfected in in recent years <pause dur="0.3"/> and people are now able to look at almost atomic resolution <pause dur="0.5"/> with some kind of probe <pause dur="0.2"/> with this electrochemical probe rather than optical probe <pause dur="0.7"/> and this is the this is just the result of the experiment <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> when <pause dur="0.2"/> <trunc>i</trunc> if you turn the light on here <pause dur="0.8"/><kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> you watch <kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> the voltage <pause dur="0.3"/> develop here and the voltage <pause dur="0.3"/> 
records <pause dur="0.5"/> the <pause dur="0.2"/> amount of chloride that's developed <pause dur="0.7"/> okay <pause dur="0.4"/> and you could see at ten microns <pause dur="0.5"/> you turn the light on <pause dur="0.2"/> very quickly you get chloride developing <pause dur="1.6"/> and then <pause dur="0.2"/> gradually you <trunc>e</trunc> you're exhausting the chlorophenol it tapers off <pause dur="0.4"/> you turn the light off <pause dur="0.7"/> and the chloride ion <pause dur="0.2"/> dissipates <pause dur="0.2"/> and moves through the solution <pause dur="0.3"/> so clearly mass transport's quite important the chloride ion <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> moves away from the electrode tip <pause dur="0.3"/> very soon after you turn the light off <pause dur="0.2"/> that's at ten microns <pause dur="0.3"/> between the tip <pause dur="0.7"/> and the T-I-O-two so imagine <pause dur="0.3"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="8"/> there's the tip <pause dur="0.5"/> of the electrode <pause dur="0.3"/> here is the T-I-O-two here <pause dur="0.6"/> and you're measuring chloride <pause dur="0.4"/> being produced <pause dur="0.5"/> in that region <pause dur="1.0"/> if you move the tip <pause dur="0.2"/> eighty microns away <pause dur="0.6"/> then the development is much much much smaller <pause dur="0.6"/> and what this tells us is <pause dur="0.3"/> that virtually all of the action <pause dur="0.5"/> is taking place <pause dur="0.4"/> very close to the surface <pause dur="0.9"/> and we can model <pause dur="0.2"/> these curves <pause dur="0.6"/> very precisely <pause dur="1.8"/> on the basis of purely a surface process <pause dur="0.6"/> you don't need <pause dur="0.2"/> to invoke <pause dur="1.0"/> a reaction occurring in solution <pause dur="0.2"/> and 
always in chemistry <pause dur="0.6"/> and in science in general <pause dur="0.3"/> if you've got two possible explanations <pause dur="0.6"/> one is simple <pause dur="0.6"/> and one is more complicated <pause dur="1.2"/> and the simple one is actually <pause dur="0.2"/> works <pause dur="0.3"/> slightly better than the complicated one <pause dur="0.5"/> then you always say the simple one is right <pause dur="0.4"/> and that's called the principle of Occam's Razor <pause dur="0.8"/><event desc="takes off transparency" iterated="n"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> after William of Occam <pause dur="0.4"/> who was from Northumberland <pause dur="1.0"/> okay <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> i think the <pause dur="0.5"/> i've got about two minutes to go so i will # <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="1.2"/> try and # <pause dur="3.3"/> summarize things just # i haven't got a slide to summarize this up <pause dur="0.3"/> but essentially <pause dur="0.6"/> there's a lot of interest in this area because of the environmental possibilities of converting <pause dur="1.9"/> very toxic organics <pause dur="0.3"/> at low concentrations in the aquatic environment <pause dur="0.3"/> to harmless substances <pause dur="0.3"/> by shining <pause dur="0.2"/> U-V light on them <pause dur="0.5"/> in the presence of various catalysts <pause dur="0.5"/> and what i've talked about today is T-I-O-two <pause dur="0.7"/> # it's the one that probably on which most work has been done <pause dur="0.7"/> but you can also <pause dur="0.7"/> <trunc>l</trunc> use hydrogen peroxide <pause dur="0.7"/> as a as a <pause dur="0.2"/> that's not a catalyst <pause dur="0.2"/> but it gives you the O-H

the hospital and it alights on the tile <pause dur="1.0"/> then believe it or not <pause dur="0.5"/> the <pause dur="0.4"/> action of the fluorescent tubes <pause dur="0.5"/> in the room <pause dur="0.6"/> on <pause dur="0.6"/> the tile surface <pause dur="0.8"/> is to degrade the bacterium <pause dur="0.3"/> the bacteria <pause dur="0.2"/> are actually killed <pause dur="0.6"/> by <pause dur="1.0"/> their location <pause dur="0.5"/> on the surface of the semiconductor <pause dur="0.3"/> because it's able to produce O-H radicals in the thin monolayer <pause dur="0.3"/> which then attack the bacteria <pause dur="0.4"/> so <pause dur="0.2"/> these tiles are are are are have been patented they're now being produced and they're being tried out in hospitals in the States <pause dur="0.4"/> you know <pause dur="0.3"/> the so they're self <pause dur="0.5"/> it's a kind of self-cleaning tile <pause dur="0.3"/> or self-sterilizing tile <pause dur="0.3"/> obviously if somebody <pause dur="0.5"/> puts a muddy <pause dur="0.3"/> muddy hand on the wall that's not going to <pause dur="0.5"/> influence things very much but <pause dur="0.4"/> it's the bacteria <pause dur="0.2"/> that you're interested in you want to <trunc>sterili</trunc> keep the hospital sterile <pause dur="0.3"/> these tiles are <trunc>s</trunc> autosterilizing <pause dur="0.4"/> and also in the States <pause dur="0.4"/> there are patents taken out on light pipes made of <pause dur="0.3"/> # very thin glass fibres <pause dur="0.3"/> coated with T-I-O-two <pause dur="0.2"/> and you can <pause dur="0.4"/> have these in a in the form of i think if you
