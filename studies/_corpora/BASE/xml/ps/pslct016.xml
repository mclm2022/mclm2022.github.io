<u who="nm0775"> <event desc="overhead projector is on showing covered transparency" iterated="n"/> let me begin by <pause dur="1.3"/> resuming where we finished yesterday <pause dur="1.7"/> we're talking about the concept of elasticity <pause dur="0.6"/> in particular we were looking at the price elasticity of demand <pause dur="0.6"/> we've looked at a number of applications <pause dur="0.3"/> and seen the empirical relevance of this <pause dur="0.6"/> but everything we've done before last time <pause dur="0.4"/> was to talk <pause dur="0.3"/> <trunc>ra</trunc> in rather vague imprecise terms <pause dur="0.4"/> about <pause dur="0.2"/> the elasticity being a measure of the responsiveness <pause dur="0.4"/> of for example demand to change in price <pause dur="0.7"/> towards the end of last time <pause dur="0.4"/> we started making this <pause dur="0.3"/> concept of <trunc>ena</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> elasticity <pause dur="0.2"/> a more precise quantitative measure <pause dur="1.2"/> and where we got to at the end of last time <pause dur="0.5"/> was to this point here <pause dur="1.1"/> we said <pause dur="0.4"/> we can define the price elasticity of demand <pause dur="1.4"/><kinesic desc="reveals covered part of transparency" iterated="n"/> as being the proportional change in quantity demanded <pause dur="0.4"/> divided by the <trunc>prop</trunc> proportional change in price <pause dur="0.8"/> and we can see that easily <pause dur="0.2"/> in terms of the <pause dur="0.9"/> demand curve <pause dur="1.3"/> we start off at some point A we said <pause dur="0.8"/> initial price is P-zero <pause dur="0.4"/> price falls to P-one so delta-P is the change in 
price <pause dur="0.9"/> and that induces a movement down the demand curve to point B <pause dur="0.8"/> the quantity demanded increasing from Q-zero to Q-one <pause dur="1.2"/> so delta-Q measures the increase in quantity <pause dur="1.3"/> and we're saying the elasticity is measured by this <pause dur="0.3"/> change in quantity <pause dur="0.4"/> divided by the original quantity <pause dur="0.5"/> which is the proportional change <pause dur="1.0"/> all divided by this change in price <pause dur="1.5"/> itself divided by <pause dur="0.4"/> the initial price level which gives us the proportional change in price <pause dur="0.6"/> and i said that <pause dur="1.3"/><kinesic desc="reveals covered part of transparency" iterated="n"/> therefore that gives us a formula <pause dur="0.3"/> for calculating <pause dur="0.2"/> the elasticity <pause dur="0.3"/> between two points which i said can be defined as the arc <pause dur="0.2"/> or the interval <pause dur="0.3"/> elasticity of demand <pause dur="1.8"/> and what i want to show now <pause dur="0.3"/> are two properties <pause dur="0.4"/> of this elasticity <pause dur="2.0"/><kinesic desc="reveals covered part of transparency" iterated="n"/> the first property <pause dur="0.3"/> is that clearly <pause dur="0.2"/> the elasticity is negative <pause dur="2.6"/> if the elasticity is negative quite obviously <pause dur="0.5"/> because the demand curve is downward sloping <pause dur="1.9"/> and so <pause dur="0.7"/> if delta-Q is <pause dur="0.5"/> positive <pause dur="0.5"/> because the <pause dur="0.4"/> demand has increased <pause dur="1.0"/> that must be because the price has fallen <pause dur="1.0"/> so if delta-Q is positive <pause dur="1.0"/> that's because delta-P the 
change in price is negative <pause dur="2.0"/> Q and P themselves are positive numbers we assume if we're starting with a positive price <pause dur="0.8"/> and a positive quantity <pause dur="0.3"/> being demanded <pause dur="0.9"/> and so <pause dur="0.2"/> delta-Q is positive Q is positive P is positive <pause dur="1.0"/> and delta-P is negative so the whole thing <pause dur="0.4"/> is negative <pause dur="0.2"/> the elasticity demand <pause dur="0.2"/> is negative <pause dur="2.7"/> let me ask you to tell me <pause dur="0.8"/> when <pause dur="0.5"/> that might not be the case can you think of a case <pause dur="1.5"/> not necessarily thinking of an example of any particular commodity <pause dur="0.5"/> what would the demand curve have to look like <pause dur="0.7"/> for the elasticity not to be a negative number <pause dur="2.5"/><kinesic desc="indicates member of audience" iterated="n"/> point here </u><u who="sm0776" trans="latching"> when the demand is constant </u><pause dur="0.4"/> <u who="nm0775" trans="pause"> when demand is constant so let's look at that in the diagram <pause dur="2.3"/> if the demand is a horizontal straight line <pause dur="0.2"/> is the answer <pause dur="0.4"/> that we're given here <pause dur="1.7"/> then imagine a horizontal straight line <pause dur="1.1"/> that would mean that <pause dur="0.4"/> this change in quantity could be very big <pause dur="0.6"/> even if effectively <pause dur="0.4"/> the change in price <pause dur="1.0"/> was close to zero or essentially zero it approximated zero <pause dur="2.0"/> so that 
would be saying that delta-P would be zero <pause dur="3.2"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> let's think about that answer is that is that a good answer <pause dur="1.3"/> well the demand curve being completely flat <pause dur="0.3"/> would mean that demand is <pause dur="0.7"/> completely responsive to small changes in price <pause dur="0.5"/> so it's <pause dur="0.3"/> infinitely elastic <pause dur="2.5"/> delta-P if delta-P is zero <pause dur="2.7"/><kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> this whole thing is zero <pause dur="0.7"/> so if delta if delta-P is <pause dur="0.7"/> is zero <pause dur="0.5"/><kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> this whole thing is infinite <pause dur="1.4"/> and it's actually <pause dur="0.2"/> minus-infinite <pause dur="0.4"/> so it doesn't give us the answer it's not negative it gives us the answer it's infinity <pause dur="0.4"/> albeit minus-infinity <pause dur="0.8"/> okay so what would be another possible response <kinesic desc="indicates member of audience" iterated="n"/> a hand up at the back here </u><u who="sf0777" trans="overlap"> <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> demand curve <gap reason="inaudible" extent="3 secs"/> </u><pause dur="0.2"/> <u who="nm0775" trans="pause"> okay i'm being told to draw demand curve not as a straight line <pause dur="0.5"/> but as a hyperbola using very technical words <pause dur="1.7"/> that's the case i'm going to go on to in a minute i <unclear>started</unclear> looking at two properties i've said notice A <pause dur="0.3"/> in a moment i'm going to say <pause dur="0.2"/> notice B <pause dur="0.2"/> and that's going to be to do with exactly the case you mentioned so i'll come on to that in a moment <pause dur="0.6"/> any other 
thoughts on this A <kinesic desc="indicates member of audience" iterated="n"/> point here </u><pause dur="0.4"/> <u who="sm0778" trans="pause"> if # the demand curve is upward sloping <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> </u><u who="nm0775" trans="overlap"> okay <pause dur="0.6"/> well if the demand curve is upward sloping then clearly everything i've said here is wrong <pause dur="0.7"/> if the demand curve is upward sloping then we can have that <pause dur="0.9"/> when the price <pause dur="0.9"/> if the price increases the quantity demanded will increase and so <kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> this will be a positive number <pause dur="0.7"/> so to get a positive elasticity we need an upward sloping demand curve which we're going to say is rather unusual <pause dur="0.7"/> less unusual <pause dur="0.4"/> would be the case where the demand curve is <pause dur="0.3"/> perfectly vertical <pause dur="1.8"/> if the demand curve is perfectly vertical <pause dur="0.8"/> then we're saying that demand is <pause dur="0.2"/> inelastic <pause dur="0.2"/> perfectly inelastic <pause dur="0.9"/> and that would give us <pause dur="0.2"/> an elasticity of zero <pause dur="1.0"/> okay so to have <pause dur="0.3"/> elasticity as not being negative either we have an unusual case that it's positive <pause dur="0.4"/> or we or we have <pause dur="0.5"/> a less unusual case <pause dur="0.3"/> that it's simply vertical so the elasticity is <pause dur="0.4"/> zero <pause dur="0.8"/> so let's <pause dur="0.2"/> but in general we're going to assume demand curves are downward sloping <pause dur="0.4"/> and so 
we're going to have this property <pause dur="1.5"/> consider now the second property <pause dur="2.6"/> the second property <pause dur="0.7"/> of the <pause dur="0.6"/> elasticity of <kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> this demand curve <pause dur="1.7"/> is that the elasticity <pause dur="0.5"/> changes <pause dur="0.8"/> as we move along the demand curve <pause dur="2.6"/> and i want to see how <pause dur="8.4"/><kinesic desc="puts on transparency" iterated="n"/> let me just give you a reminder <pause dur="0.3"/> everything i'm saying here <pause dur="0.4"/> relates to this demand curve that i've drawn in the diagram <pause dur="1.2"/> it's a linear demand curve it's a downward sloping straight line <pause dur="0.4"/> or linear demand curve <pause dur="1.7"/> i haven't yet got onto the case i was invited to think about <pause dur="0.3"/> by the contribution at the back the case where <pause dur="0.5"/> the demand curve is not <pause dur="0.2"/> a straight line <pause dur="0.2"/> we'll look at that in a moment <pause dur="1.0"/> for now we assume the demand curve is a straight line <pause dur="1.9"/> and we can show <pause dur="0.6"/> that in that case the elasticity changes as we move along the demand curve <pause dur="2.8"/> okay i'm just <pause dur="0.8"/> i can't always be sure of having two overheads so sometimes i repeat things there's no reason why you should <pause dur="0.4"/> here i just repeat what 
we've already seen <pause dur="0.2"/> in this first line <pause dur="0.7"/> and then i rearrange this first line <pause dur="1.4"/> 'cause a fraction <pause dur="0.8"/> divided by <pause dur="0.5"/> a fraction is a rather awkward thing to deal with <pause dur="1.6"/> and so we can rearrange it <pause dur="0.2"/> to get a fraction multiplied by <pause dur="0.4"/> a different fraction which is less awkward to deal with <pause dur="0.4"/> if you're not happy with the step going from <kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> here to <kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> here <pause dur="0.2"/> check it out afterwards <pause dur="2.2"/> okay so i've <trunc>re</trunc> rewritten or rearranged this expression in the following way <pause dur="0.7"/> when we do that <pause dur="0.3"/> we can now think of these two terms <kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> <pause dur="0.5"/> separately <pause dur="0.9"/> think first of all about <kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> this first term <pause dur="0.5"/> delta-Q divided by delta-P <pause dur="2.0"/> what can you tell me <pause dur="0.2"/> about this first term <pause dur="0.5"/> as we move along <pause dur="0.6"/> the demand curve <pause dur="1.9"/> what happens to delta-Q over delta-P <pause dur="0.3"/> as we move along the demand curve <pause dur="2.6"/> does it rise does it fall does it stay unchanged what happens <pause dur="0.7"/> any thoughts someone said me an answer here <kinesic desc="indicates member of audience" iterated="n"/> </u><u who="sm0779" trans="latching"> it remains constant </u><u who="nm0775" trans="latching"> it remains constant absolutely <pause dur="2.9"/> delta-Q <pause dur="1.1"/> over delta-P <pause dur="0.5"/> stays 
constant <pause dur="1.0"/> along the straight line demand curve <pause dur="0.4"/> we can see that easily <pause dur="0.5"/> in this diagram here <pause dur="5.5"/><kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> the slope <pause dur="0.2"/> of this line <pause dur="0.2"/> slope of this demand curve <pause dur="1.0"/> is given by <pause dur="2.4"/> the gradient of course <pause dur="0.9"/> if you think about point B for a moment it's easiest to <trunc>th</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> to see things in terms of point B <pause dur="0.9"/> address point B and think well what is the slope of this line <pause dur="0.8"/> well in going from B to A <pause dur="0.5"/> the rise is the change in price <pause dur="0.5"/> and the tread the distance travelled <pause dur="0.5"/> is the change in quantity <pause dur="0.3"/> so delta-P <pause dur="0.2"/> over delta-Q <pause dur="0.8"/> is the slope <pause dur="1.2"/> of this straight line demand curve <pause dur="0.7"/> measured against the vertical axis <pause dur="2.9"/> and of course the slope of a straight line demand curve doesn't change <pause dur="0.2"/> so delta-P over delta-Q <pause dur="0.3"/> doesn't change as you move along the demand curve <pause dur="1.5"/> and hence <pause dur="0.4"/> delta-Q over delta-P which is the inverse of the slope <pause dur="0.8"/> or if you like it's the slope <pause dur="0.5"/> of the demand curve measured against the horizontal axis <pause dur="0.6"/> that doesn't change as you move along the demand curve <pause dur="0.9"/> so the first term <pause dur="0.5"/> in this expression for inelasticity <pause dur="0.3"/> is a constant <pause dur="1.0"/> what 
about the second term <pause dur="3.6"/> what can you tell me about <pause dur="0.5"/> P-over-Q the second <pause dur="0.8"/> term in that expression of elasticity <pause dur="0.3"/> as we move along the demand curve any thoughts or suggestions <pause dur="5.0"/> okay <kinesic desc="indicates member of audience" iterated="n"/> </u><pause dur="0.8"/> <u who="sm0780" trans="pause"> as P rises Q falls </u><u who="nm0775" trans="latching"> okay </u><pause dur="0.5"/> <u who="sm0780" trans="pause"> <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/></u><pause dur="0.6"/> <u who="nm0775" trans="pause"> well as we're moving down let's think about moving down the demand curve so moving from A to B to C to D <pause dur="2.3"/> of course what we know is happening is the price is falling and quantity is rising <pause dur="0.6"/> so moving down the demand curve <pause dur="0.7"/> from A down in the direction of D <pause dur="1.9"/><kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> this thing P-over-Q <pause dur="0.3"/> is falling <pause dur="1.9"/> in other words <pause dur="0.5"/><kinesic desc="reveals covered part of transparency" iterated="n"/> as i've written here <pause dur="2.2"/> so in terms of our expressions being # for the elasticity <pause dur="0.8"/> along the straight line demand curve <pause dur="0.5"/> the first term is constant <pause dur="0.8"/> the second term is falling <pause dur="5.5"/> and so <pause dur="0.2"/> the elasticity <pause dur="0.7"/> is falling <pause dur="2.8"/> as we <kinesic desc="reveals covered part of transparency" iterated="n"/> move down the demand curve <pause dur="7.8"/> if you <pause dur="0.2"/> wanted a further way of seeing this i invite <pause dur="0.2"/> you afterwards to <pause dur="1.2"/> to draw <pause dur="0.2"/> the horizontal lines from the axis the P axis <pause dur="0.2"/> to C and to D <pause dur="0.7"/> and to call that the 
change in price <pause dur="1.6"/> then drop down the vertical lines and that's the new change in quantity <pause dur="0.8"/> necessarily <pause dur="0.7"/> comparing <pause dur="0.3"/><kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/>  this move from A to B <pause dur="0.4"/> with <kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> this move from C to D <pause dur="0.6"/> delta-P over delta-Q won't have changed <pause dur="0.5"/> but P-over-Q <pause dur="0.2"/> will have changed and so will have a different elasticity <pause dur="8.6"/> okay so with this the conclusion is with a straight line demand curve the elasticity is falling as we move down the demand curve <pause dur="3.7"/> then we might ask a question <pause dur="1.8"/> so what would the demand curve have to look like <pause dur="0.3"/> for this elasticity <pause dur="0.2"/> not to be changing <pause dur="2.4"/> well we know that P-over-Q must be falling <pause dur="0.9"/> as we move down the demand curve P-over-Q must be falling <pause dur="2.2"/> so we need delta-Q over delta-P to be rising <pause dur="3.3"/> okay <pause dur="0.3"/> it's no good if delta # delta-Q stays constant <pause dur="0.4"/> so one thing you might think about doing afterwards is doing what the suggestion was at the back <pause dur="0.5"/> drawing the demand curve not as a straight line <pause dur="0.4"/> but as a hyperbola <pause dur="7.0"/> drawing 
it like this <pause dur="2.9"/><kinesic desc="writes on transparency" iterated="y" dur="3"/> where <pause dur="0.3"/> if you carried on it asymptotically <pause dur="0.5"/> approaches in other words gets closer and closer to each axis <pause dur="3.6"/><kinesic desc="writes on transparency" iterated="y" dur="1"/> do the same <pause dur="0.6"/> experiment here that we did over here <pause dur="0.7"/> draw points A and B <pause dur="0.3"/> C and D <pause dur="0.7"/> well <kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> these two points <pause dur="0.5"/> are having <pause dur="0.3"/> an interval between them the same as <kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> those two points <pause dur="1.1"/> of course P-over-Q is <trunc>fall</trunc> <pause dur="0.6"/> i'm using Q aren't i <pause dur="1.3"/><kinesic desc="writes on transparency" iterated="y" dur="1"/> P-over-Q is <pause dur="1.0"/> falling <pause dur="0.7"/> think what's happening to delta-Q over delta-P <pause dur="0.9"/> and see if that's given you <pause dur="0.5"/> an elasticity <pause dur="0.2"/> which doesn't change so that's the thing to think about afterwards <pause dur="7.6"/> okay <pause dur="1.1"/><kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="8"/> for the conclusion i'm giving you is <pause dur="2.2"/> is the following <pause dur="5.9"/> okay so this now is going to conclude <pause dur="0.2"/> my discussion of <trunc>e</trunc> of elasticities for now <pause dur="2.7"/> we know that so long as the demand curve <pause dur="1.1"/> is downward sloping this <trunc>th</trunc> this is going to be true <pause dur="0.4"/> whether it's linear or a hyperbola or <pause dur="0.6"/> it doesn't matter as long as 
it's downward sloping <pause dur="1.7"/> we're assuming that the elasticities are not positive <pause dur="0.3"/> they are less than or equal to zero <pause dur="3.5"/><kinesic desc="reveals covered part of transparency" iterated="n"/> think about <pause dur="3.2"/> all points between all negative points <pause dur="0.9"/> less than <pause dur="1.0"/> or all points less than or equal to zero <pause dur="1.6"/> okay so start off at zero <pause dur="1.0"/> and think about all the points going down to minus-infinity which was one of the points that was raised <pause dur="0.7"/> earlier in this lecture <pause dur="2.9"/> then <pause dur="0.4"/> if the elasticity is exactly equal to zero <pause dur="3.4"/> we can of course talk about <pause dur="0.9"/><kinesic desc="reveals covered part of transparency" iterated="n"/> zero elasticity <pause dur="1.0"/> going to make that a bit sharper <pause dur="5.8"/><kinesic desc="writes on transparency" iterated="y" dur="3"/> we can talk about <pause dur="0.5"/> zero elasticity <pause dur="2.7"/> a point further down this <pause dur="0.4"/> scale <pause dur="2.4"/> would be where <pause dur="0.4"/> the elasticity of demand <pause dur="0.2"/> price elasticity of demand is exactly equal to minus-one <pause dur="1.3"/> we talk about that as being <pause dur="0.2"/> unit elasticity <pause dur="14.3"/> think about unit elasticity <pause dur="0.7"/> in our example here <pause dur="1.7"/><kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> i'm just going to put this 
slide <pause dur="0.2"/><kinesic desc="adjusts transparency" iterated="y" dur="7"/> underneath the continuous sheet <pause dur="6.2"/><kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> think about this being equal to minus-one <pause dur="6.8"/><kinesic desc="writes on transparency" iterated="y" dur="1"/> if you then rearranged this expression <pause dur="1.5"/> we get <pause dur="0.6"/><kinesic desc="writes on transparency" iterated="y" dur="9"/> delta-Q <pause dur="1.9"/> over Q <pause dur="1.6"/> equal to <pause dur="1.3"/> minus-<pause dur="0.8"/>delta-P <pause dur="0.8"/> over P <pause dur="2.9"/> so if the <pause dur="0.4"/> elasticity is equal to minus-one <pause dur="1.3"/> in other words if we're dealing with unit elasticity <pause dur="1.3"/> then that's just the same thing as saying that <pause dur="2.0"/> the proportional increase in quantity demanded will be exactly equal to the proportional <pause dur="0.6"/> change in price <pause dur="0.6"/> okay so in other words if for example <pause dur="0.2"/> prices go up by ten per cent <pause dur="0.7"/> and quantity demanded falls by ten per cent <pause dur="0.5"/> then we're talking about unit elasticity <pause dur="0.8"/> so that's what <pause dur="0.6"/><kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> this means <pause dur="4.5"/> as we move down towards minus-infinity <pause dur="0.3"/> we talk about demand being perfectly elastic with respect to changes in price <pause dur="6.3"/> and we distinguished between <pause dur="0.6"/><kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> 
these two ranges either side of minus-one <pause dur="0.8"/><kinesic desc="puts transparency on top of current transparency" iterated="n"/> in the following way <pause dur="3.2"/> any elasticity between zero and minus-one <pause dur="0.4"/> we talk about as being relatively inelastic <pause dur="0.4"/> demand is relatively inelastic <pause dur="2.6"/> and if elasticity is greater than minus-one we talk about it being relatively elastic <pause dur="0.4"/> or <pause dur="0.2"/> elastic for shorthand <pause dur="10.7"/> okay <pause dur="0.8"/> i just want to finish this topic with one <pause dur="0.2"/> small <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> note of caution <pause dur="1.0"/> in interpreting <pause dur="0.5"/> inelasticity <pause dur="5.2"/><kinesic desc="reveals covered part of transparency" iterated="n"/> think about this range where demand is inelastic <pause dur="1.8"/> if demand is in this <trunc>r</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> in <kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> this range here demand elasticity is in this range here <pause dur="0.5"/> then we say that <pause dur="0.2"/> elasticity is less than nought <pause dur="0.3"/> and greater than minus-one <pause dur="5.7"/> so it's a number like <pause dur="1.1"/> minus-a-half or minus-a-quarter or minus-point-one <pause dur="0.2"/> or minus-comma-one <pause dur="0.7"/> depending on <pause dur="2.5"/> how you <pause dur="0.2"/> denote these things <pause dur="2.3"/> we often talk about the absolute size of elasticity <pause dur="0.6"/> we often <pause dur="0.2"/> think <pause dur="0.2"/> well we know that demand elasticity's a negative number <pause dur="0.6"/> let's not keep referring to it as a negative number 
let's think about it just as <pause dur="0.3"/> the absolute number <pause dur="1.5"/> to do that we denote it as <pause dur="0.6"/> the elasticity with these two vertical lines either side of it <pause dur="0.3"/> to remind us that we're just dealing with the <pause dur="0.3"/> the absolute number <pause dur="1.0"/> whether it's a half or a quarter or point-one <pause dur="0.3"/> dropping the minus sign <pause dur="3.1"/> and we say that the absolute size of this elasticity <pause dur="0.3"/> is a number which is less than one <pause dur="0.3"/> it's a half or a quarter et cetera <pause dur="1.6"/> and of course when you do that when you <trunc>cha</trunc> when you drop the minus sign <pause dur="1.5"/> you then talk about <trunc>a</trunc> <pause dur="0.6"/> demand being <pause dur="2.9"/> more elastic <pause dur="2.1"/> as we're moving in <kinesic desc="indicates left" iterated="n"/> this direction <pause dur="0.4"/> so it's more elastic as the as the number's going from a half from nought <pause dur="0.5"/> through a quarter to a half <pause dur="0.2"/> three-quarters et cetera <pause dur="0.3"/> so the absolute size of the elasticity <pause dur="0.3"/> is getting bigger <pause dur="0.7"/> as we're moving in <kinesic desc="indicates left" iterated="n"/> this direction <pause dur="3.7"/> so there's a slight <pause dur="0.2"/> confusion <pause dur="0.2"/> which i'd <unclear>usually</unclear> like to go away and think about <pause dur="2.8"/> be aware that when we talk about demand becoming <pause dur="0.2"/> more elastic <pause dur="0.2"/> it 
means that the elasticity's becoming more negative it's <trunc>go</trunc> it's going from a half to a quarter to a half to three-quarters <pause dur="0.5"/> to <trunc>s</trunc> to six to eight et cetera <pause dur="0.2"/> all on <kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> this negative scale <pause dur="0.7"/> so the absolute size grows <pause dur="0.4"/> as it becomes a bigger negative number <pause dur="3.1"/> so that's a point to go away and and reflect on and be sure you've you've # followed <pause dur="1.7"/><kinesic desc="reveals covered part of transparency" iterated="n"/> and then we can do the same thing for <trunc>el</trunc> for a for an elastic for the elastic range as well of course <pause dur="6.3"/> and that concludes all i want to say <pause dur="0.8"/> about this topic and i now want to move on to a whole new topic <pause dur="0.4"/> which is topic three of the lecture course </u><gap reason="break in recording" extent="uncertain"/><u who="nm0775" trans="pause"> <kinesic desc="overhead projector is on showing transparency" iterated="n"/> okay i want us to go for another <pause dur="1.3"/> sorry there's one question <pause dur="0.3"/> can we can everyone be quiet so i can hear the question please </u><pause dur="0.4"/> <u who="sf0781" trans="pause"> <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> what's the point of the elasticity what what what do we use all this for </u><pause dur="0.6"/> <u who="nm0775" trans="pause"> what do we use it all for we use it for two things one is <pause dur="0.3"/> all those things we've already looked at it's <pause dur="0.4"/> for <pause dur="0.6"/> which is

that's the minimum wage W-lower-bar <pause dur="2.3"/> a floor wage <pause dur="0.9"/> assume it's higher than the equilibrium wage <pause dur="3.3"/><kinesic desc="writes on transparency" iterated="y" dur="1"/> then what will be the effect of this on the labour market very important point in British political economy at the moment <pause dur="0.5"/> and a number of critics of <pause dur="0.3"/> the minimum wage policy <pause dur="0.3"/> are saying that such an action by the government <pause dur="0.5"/> will reduce <pause dur="0.2"/> employment <pause dur="0.5"/> because the equilibrium will go <kinesic desc="writes on transparency" iterated="y" dur="14"/> from the market equilibrium A <pause dur="0.7"/> to the regulated equilibrium of point B <pause dur="2.0"/> where demand <pause dur="0.8"/> which is the short side of the market <pause dur="0.6"/> rations the outcome rations the number of jobs down to L-bar <pause dur="0.6"/> the employment level <pause dur="0.6"/> after the impact of the minimum wage <pause dur="0.9"/> okay so <pause dur="1.4"/><kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> this looks like <pause dur="0.4"/> the minimum wage causes a big reduction in the number of jobs <pause dur="0.2"/> causes a lot of unemployment <pause dur="0.3"/> and that's what a lot of critics of the minimum wage <pause dur="0.2"/> are saying will happen <pause dur="1.4"/> one thing we're going to look at through this term <pause dur="0.3"/> is developing <pause dur="0.6"/> an economic analysis which enables us to

okay do you understand that <pause dur="0.3"/> am i going to draw it yes i'm going to draw it <pause dur="1.9"/> <kinesic desc="writes on transparency" iterated="y" dur="8"/> suppose in other words that <pause dur="0.5"/> the demand were more elastic <pause dur="0.2"/> not <pause dur="1.0"/> inelastic where <pause dur="2.9"/> let's say <trunc>mo</trunc> suppose the demand were more elastic <pause dur="0.4"/> then point B would have been here <pause dur="1.9"/><kinesic desc="writes on transparency" iterated="y" dur="1"/> call it B-dash <pause dur="0.6"/> and the job loss <pause dur="1.6"/><kinesic desc="writes on transparency" iterated="y" dur="2"/> would have been <pause dur="1.1"/> greater <pause dur="0.7"/> so the <trunc>ela</trunc> the <pause dur="0.4"/> the price elasticity of demand <pause dur="0.3"/> which in the labour market means <pause dur="0.3"/> the wage elasticity of demand for labour <pause dur="0.7"/> is a crucial <pause dur="1.1"/> parameter <pause dur="1.1"/> in determining <pause dur="0.3"/> the impact of this important policy on the labour market <pause dur="0.2"/> that's why it's important <pause dur="1.9"/> and but <pause dur="0.2"/> but just in passing we've said that that's just one application <pause dur="0.4"/> we've been looking at a number of applications <pause dur="0.3"/> and that the important one was for the impact of taxation <pause dur="0.7"/> on commodities and indeed we looked at a case of taxation on the labour market <pause dur="1.7"/> okay <pause dur="0.8"/> so let me now <pause dur="0.3"/> go on to the third topic <pause dur="0.4"/> and let me link <pause dur="0.3"/> this third topic with what we've been doing so far <pause dur="2.6"/> topic 
one was a general introduction to <pause dur="0.4"/> economic phenomena <pause dur="0.5"/> economic methodology et cetera <pause dur="0.8"/> topic in topic two we said <pause dur="2.3"/> let's <pause dur="0.6"/> <trunc>deri</trunc> let's # assume something called a demand curve <pause dur="0.3"/><kinesic desc="writes on transparency" iterated="y" dur="16"/> don't bother drawing this for the umpteenth time <pause dur="0.5"/> if you just let me put it for you <pause dur="0.7"/> i vary between whether i use Q or X for quantity <pause dur="0.3"/> forgive me but it's the same thing <pause dur="1.8"/> we add we then added a supply curve <pause dur="0.6"/> and we said look <pause dur="0.6"/> where those intersect <pause dur="1.4"/> we have a market equilibrium <pause dur="0.7"/> potentially <pause dur="0.5"/> and we looked at the possible properties of market equilibria <pause dur="0.5"/> in terms of existence uniqueness stability <pause dur="0.7"/> and we looked at comparative static properties of the equilibrium <pause dur="0.4"/> meaning <pause dur="0.3"/> we shifted one of the curves <pause dur="0.2"/> and looked at what happened <pause dur="0.7"/> for price and quantity outcomes <pause dur="1.3"/> but all we did was <pause dur="0.4"/> assume <pause dur="0.9"/> that in a market economy <pause dur="0.3"/> there are such things as demand and supply curves <pause dur="1.3"/> we said their slopes matter because their elasticities matter <pause dur="0.3"/> we didn't <pause dur="0.3"/> address the issue of <pause dur="0.2"/> where these 
demand and supply curves come from <pause dur="1.6"/> and what we're going to do in topic three <pause dur="1.4"/><kinesic desc="writes on transparency" iterated="y" dur="3"/> is say <pause dur="2.3"/> well <pause dur="0.4"/> where does this demand curve come from <pause dur="0.2"/> how do we derive this demand curve <pause dur="1.0"/> and from that what are its likely properties <pause dur="3.2"/> then in topic four <pause dur="0.8"/><kinesic desc="writes on transparency" iterated="y" dur="5"/> and beyond <pause dur="3.2"/> we're going to say <pause dur="0.3"/> well what about this concept of a supply curve <pause dur="1.5"/> where does that come from <pause dur="0.3"/> what assumption does that make <pause dur="0.4"/> about supplying agents <pause dur="1.1"/> about the motivations of firms and the decisions of firms <pause dur="2.9"/> having <pause dur="0.5"/> gone through <pause dur="0.3"/> the analyses of deriving demand and supply <pause dur="0.5"/> we'll then further address this issue <pause dur="0.6"/> of <pause dur="0.2"/> how these two things interact <pause dur="0.6"/><kinesic desc="writes on transparency" iterated="y" dur="2"/> to give us a market equilibrium <pause dur="0.7"/> because we'll say <pause dur="1.3"/> how does the <pause dur="0.2"/> nature of the market place in which these agents <pause dur="0.4"/> trade <pause dur="0.3"/> how does that determine <pause dur="0.2"/> the nature of the outcome <pause dur="0.8"/> so we'll ask questions about <pause dur="1.4"/><kinesic desc="writes on transparency" iterated="y" dur="4"/> the nature <pause dur="0.7"/> of markets <pause dur="1.9"/> in particular we'll 
focus on issues of <pause dur="0.6"/> does the outcome depend upon <pause dur="0.4"/> how many agents there are demanding this commodity <pause dur="0.2"/> and or supplying this commodity <pause dur="3.0"/> so that's a <kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> scheme of <pause dur="0.5"/> of <pause dur="0.3"/> how we <pause dur="0.2"/> what we've been doing so far <pause dur="1.7"/> links in with what we're going to be doing from now onwards <pause dur="0.9"/> and there's one more thing i <pause dur="0.2"/> i might say before going on into topic three <pause dur="1.3"/> and it's the following <pause dur="2.7"/><kinesic desc="writes on transparency" iterated="y" dur="10"/> we're assuming that <pause dur="0.5"/> the two most important groups of agents in the economy <pause dur="1.0"/> for our initial purposes of analysis <pause dur="0.6"/> are <pause dur="1.7"/> households <pause dur="3.1"/> and firms <pause dur="2.7"/> what we're going to be doing <pause dur="1.0"/> in the in topic three <pause dur="0.2"/> is addressing the question <pause dur="1.4"/><kinesic desc="writes on transparency" iterated="y" dur="4"/> of <pause dur="1.8"/> what determines the demand <pause dur="0.6"/> for the commodities X <pause dur="1.7"/> bought by households from firms <pause dur="3.9"/> then in topic four and beyond we're going to <pause dur="0.4"/> address the # other <kinesic desc="writes on transparency" iterated="y" dur="4"/> aspect of that which is <pause dur="0.5"/> well what do we know about <pause dur="1.6"/> firms' decisions concerning the supply of X <pause dur="0.4"/> to households <pause dur="0.3"/> all within some market context <pause dur="0.4"/> that later on we'll also be analysing <pause dur="2.7"/> 
X of course <pause dur="0.6"/> is just one commodity <pause dur="0.5"/> that is traded between <kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> these two broad groups <pause dur="2.1"/> what's an what's another <pause dur="0.2"/> commodity <pause dur="1.8"/> that's traded between these two groups </u><u who="sf0783" trans="latching"> labour </u><pause dur="0.3"/> <u who="nm0775" trans="pause"> labour good <pause dur="1.9"/> just as households are demanding <pause dur="1.0"/> commodities <pause dur="0.5"/> from firms <pause dur="1.9"/><kinesic desc="writes on transparency" iterated="y" dur="4"/> they're supplying <pause dur="0.6"/> labour <pause dur="1.1"/> to firms <pause dur="1.3"/> and the other side of that <kinesic desc="writes on transparency" iterated="y" dur="5"/> coin <pause dur="2.7"/> is that firms are demanding labour from households <pause dur="4.0"/> okay <pause dur="0.9"/> so topic three <pause dur="1.6"/> is going to be analysing this <pause dur="1.0"/><kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> topic four onwards is going to be <kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> analysing supply <pause dur="0.9"/> and later on in the course we'll look at <pause dur="0.6"/> what determines <pause dur="1.2"/><kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> households' supply of <pause dur="0.6"/> labour <pause dur="0.7"/><kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> and firms' demand for labour <pause dur="2.4"/> those are just two agents of course in the economy <pause dur="2.1"/> a third agent which we've already touched upon <pause dur="0.3"/> earlier in the course would be government for example <pause dur="2.0"/> how does government come into <kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> this analysis <pause dur="0.5"/> well <pause dur="1.5"/> you might <pause dur="0.2"/> say that <pause dur="0.7"/> 
households are demanding <pause dur="0.4"/> goods not only from firms but also from governments so this box <pause dur="2.4"/><kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> might consist not only of firms but also of government <pause dur="0.8"/><kinesic desc="writes on transparency" iterated="y" dur="2"/> 'cause government provides things just as firms do <pause dur="1.0"/> sometimes in a market place sometimes outside of a market place <pause dur="1.9"/> another way in which government <pause dur="0.2"/> would influence this <pause dur="1.7"/><kinesic desc="indicates transparency" iterated="n"/>  scheme <pause dur="0.3"/> of things <pause dur="0.4"/> would be <pause dur="0.2"/> that the way in which these <pause dur="0.3"/> relationships are determined <pause dur="0.6"/> the <trunc>relation</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> the the nature of the supply and demand relationships <pause dur="0.3"/> and how they interact within a market place <pause dur="0.5"/> itself is regulated or governed by <pause dur="0.6"/> government <pause dur="1.0"/> okay so the very nature in which these things occur <pause dur="0.7"/> we could argue <pause dur="0.4"/> is determined by <pause dur="0.2"/> to some extent at least <pause dur="0.4"/> the nature and role of governments <pause dur="0.4"/> # within the market <pause dur="1.6"/> okay so that's what we're going to go on to <pause dur="0.2"/> to consider <pause dur="1.4"/> let's immediately make a start <pause dur="0.7"/> on topic three <pause dur="3.7"/> which is that as the demand <pause dur="0.8"/> theory <pause dur="0.3"/> or consumer 
theory <pause dur="8.1"/><kinesic desc="reveals covered part of transparency" iterated="n"/> in particular <pause dur="0.2"/> we're going to be looking at <pause dur="0.6"/> what determines <pause dur="0.3"/> the <pause dur="1.8"/> properties <pause dur="0.6"/> of demand curves <pause dur="3.8"/> and how those properties follow <pause dur="0.3"/> from assumptions about the behaviour <pause dur="0.6"/> of rational economic agents <pause dur="1.8"/> okay you remember in the very first lecture <pause dur="0.4"/> i touched upon a little bit <pause dur="0.3"/> the concept of rationality <pause dur="0.4"/> what we mean by rationality <pause dur="0.6"/> we're going to use some of that now <pause dur="0.4"/> and develop that <pause dur="2.0"/> and we're going to proceed with this for fifteen minutes <pause dur="0.2"/> and then have <pause dur="0.3"/> a break <pause dur="2.6"/> okay <pause dur="0.5"/> so what are our <pause dur="1.0"/> assumptions about rationality <pause dur="0.3"/> for these purposes <pause dur="1.1"/> well we suppose that individuals <pause dur="1.3"/> who we're going to refer to more generally as rational economic agents <pause dur="2.4"/> for the purposes of their <pause dur="0.7"/> economic activity <pause dur="2.0"/> we assume that they have preferences <pause dur="4.3"/> and we further assume that these preferences <pause dur="0.2"/> have certain properties <pause dur="6.1"/> and what i want us to do is to consider <pause dur="0.9"/> what those properties are <pause dur="17.2"/> first question we should say is <pause dur="0.7"/> first question we should ask is <pause dur="0.5"/> well preferences over what <pause dur="3.4"/> and if you think about yourself you have preferences over 
a very wide range of different things commodities activities et cetera <pause dur="1.4"/> we're going to be <pause dur="0.5"/> pretty tight in defining <pause dur="0.9"/> our preferences to just lie over <pause dur="0.2"/> two possible commodities <pause dur="0.6"/> so we're going to be talking about preferences <pause dur="0.9"/> by individuals <pause dur="0.7"/> over different combinations <pause dur="0.5"/> of two commodities <pause dur="3.5"/> and those commodities are going to be two goods X and Y <pause dur="0.7"/> you can think about X and Y as being anything you like <pause dur="2.7"/> okay it could be # it could be that <pause dur="0.3"/> the two things which you think of as <trunc>giv</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> as giving you <pause dur="0.3"/> a lot of happiness <pause dur="0.2"/> over which you have preferences <pause dur="0.4"/> are <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> new clothes and C-Ds <pause dur="0.7"/> or it might be <pause dur="0.6"/> economics lectures and accountancy lectures <pause dur="0.7"/><vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" n="ss" dur="1"/> anything you like <pause dur="4.4"/> so <pause dur="3.9"/><kinesic desc="reveals covered part of transparency" iterated="n"/> i'm going to call those combinations of these two goods X and Y <pause dur="0.3"/> as being bundles <pause dur="0.4"/> you can think of them as baskets of goods think about someone with a basket <pause dur="0.3"/> in which they've got <pause dur="0.5"/> some <pause dur="0.4"/> C-Ds and some new clothes <pause dur="0.4"/> and they're comparing that basket <pause dur="0.3"/> with another basket with different combinations of those 
two things <pause dur="0.5"/> i'm not going to use the word baskets i'm going to use the word bundles <pause dur="2.0"/> meaning a collection of or a combination of <pause dur="1.7"/> two commodities or two goods <pause dur="0.2"/> which i'll call X and Y <pause dur="5.1"/> we can represent <pause dur="0.3"/> these bundles <pause dur="0.2"/> in a diagram <pause dur="3.9"/><kinesic desc="reveals covered part of transparency" iterated="n"/> where on the <pause dur="0.8"/> axes we have the amount of X <pause dur="1.0"/> in this bundle <pause dur="0.7"/> and on the vertical axis the amount of Y <pause dur="0.3"/> in this bundle <pause dur="6.5"/> and i've drawn on here two possible points two possible bundles of goods <pause dur="1.5"/> the bundle at A and the bundle at B <pause dur="1.5"/> and i'm saying suppose <pause dur="0.6"/> A is the bundle of goods in which there are two units of Y <pause dur="0.4"/> and two units of X <pause dur="0.8"/> whilst at point B <pause dur="2.0"/> the bundle represented <pause dur="0.4"/> has one unit of Y <pause dur="0.5"/> and four units of X <pause dur="9.9"/> okay so those are two bundles of goods that you <trunc>m</trunc> as an individual <pause dur="1.8"/> might confront <pause dur="3.3"/><kinesic desc="reveals covered part of transparency" iterated="n"/> and let's suppose that this individual <pause dur="1.3"/> is asked <pause dur="1.4"/> to <pause dur="0.2"/> state a preference between these two bundles of goods <pause dur="6.1"/> and asked to say which <pause dur="0.4"/> he or she prefers <pause dur="11.7"/> okay now <pause dur="1.3"/> without knowing this person's preferences <pause dur="0.2"/> and without knowing what these commodities are <pause dur="0.4"/> 
course <pause dur="0.3"/> we can't easily answer it <pause dur="0.9"/> but what <pause dur="0.4"/> what i can do now is to say <pause dur="0.3"/> well <pause dur="0.2"/> what assumptions are we making about the kind of answers that people might give <pause dur="0.5"/> what properties <pause dur="0.9"/> might their answers satisfy <pause dur="4.0"/><kinesic desc="puts on transparency" iterated="n"/> and the first property <pause dur="1.3"/> is the property <pause dur="0.6"/> that their preferences <pause dur="0.2"/> are ordinal <pause dur="1.1"/> we'll just discuss this here <pause dur="0.8"/> and then be a little bit more precise about it <pause dur="5.5"/> i'm assuming <pause dur="0.9"/> that when asked this question <pause dur="2.7"/> people can rank their preferences ordinally <pause dur="5.7"/> I-E that we're assuming that the individual is able to answer <pause dur="0.5"/> this question <pause dur="3.4"/> about which bundle A or B he or she prefers <pause dur="0.8"/> in one of the following ways <pause dur="4.4"/> that they might say <pause dur="0.9"/> i prefer B <pause dur="0.2"/> to A <pause dur="3.6"/> sorry <pause dur="0.3"/> i might <pause dur="0.2"/> i <pause dur="1.0"/> i they might say i prefer A to B <pause dur="0.8"/> alternatively they might say i prefer <pause dur="0.6"/> B to A <pause dur="2.8"/> what would be a third possible response </u><pause dur="1.1"/> <u who="sf0784" trans="pause"> <gap reason="inaudible" extent="2 secs"/></u><pause dur="0.3"/> <u who="nm0775" trans="pause"> sorry </u><u who="sf0784" trans="latching"> if you like them equally </u><u who="nm0775" trans="overlap"> okay <pause dur="0.3"/> that i like them equally <pause dur="2.8"/> my terminology for that is <pause dur="0.8"/><kinesic desc="reveals covered part of transparency" iterated="n"/> they might say i'm indifferent between the two <pause dur="0.8"/> i'm equally happy with A <pause dur="0.5"/> as with B <pause dur="3.7"/> okay so <pause dur="0.7"/> 
we're going to <trunc>a</trunc> <pause dur="0.3"/> assume that <pause dur="0.9"/> all of those answers are meaningful answers <pause dur="1.7"/> well you might say well that's just that's just kind of obvious <pause dur="2.1"/> but it isn't i hope <pause dur="0.7"/> so obvious <pause dur="0.9"/> because in allowing <kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> these possible answers we're ruling out <pause dur="0.7"/> different possible answers <pause dur="1.7"/> such as the following <pause dur="2.2"/> in particular we're ruling out we're ruling out the possibility <pause dur="0.7"/> that an individual says <pause dur="0.5"/> i don't know which of those two things i prefer <pause dur="4.2"/> there might actually be <pause dur="0.6"/> many situations in the real world where <pause dur="0.2"/> that might be the answer <pause dur="1.1"/> i'm sure you've all been in a situation sometime where you've had to make a <trunc>choo</trunc> a choice between two things <pause dur="1.5"/> and they've either been so similar <pause dur="1.0"/> that <pause dur="0.2"/> it's been hard to choose <pause dur="0.4"/> or they've been so very different from each other <pause dur="0.4"/> it's hard to choose <pause dur="3.0"/> it's most <pause dur="0.2"/> easy i guess to think that if these two goods are so if these two bundles of goods are so very different <pause dur="0.7"/> it it could be hard to make a choice <pause dur="0.6"/> but we're ruling that out we're going to be adopting an assumption <pause dur="0.7"/> that 
individual rationality <pause dur="1.0"/> from which we're going to derive demand curves <pause dur="0.7"/> individual rationality <pause dur="0.2"/> is such that people can always state <pause dur="0.5"/> a preference in these ways <pause dur="1.0"/> that they never <pause dur="0.7"/> are unable <pause dur="0.9"/> to <pause dur="0.7"/> rank their preferences <trunc>a</trunc> across bundles <pause dur="0.6"/> no matter how similar or how different those bundles are <pause dur="1.2"/> now <pause dur="0.3"/> i've said here <pause dur="0.8"/> that they're ranking their preferences between those goods <pause dur="0.5"/> ordinally <pause dur="0.3"/> in an ordinal way <pause dur="0.3"/> what do i mean by that <pause dur="5.6"/> well i by ordinal ranking <pause dur="0.9"/> i mean something different from cardinal ranking <pause dur="0.3"/> which i'll define in a second <pause dur="1.2"/> so by assuming that the individuals can rank preferences ordinally <pause dur="0.5"/> we're ruling out the possibility that preferences can be ranked <pause dur="0.2"/> cardinally <pause dur="0.5"/> so what does that mean <pause dur="8.5"/><kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="7"/> what that means <pause dur="2.4"/> is that <pause dur="3.8"/> we rule out the possibility that people are able to say <pause dur="0.2"/> things like the following <pause dur="1.9"/> that <pause dur="1.4"/> that given the choice between A and B <pause dur="1.0"/> i am twice as happy <pause dur="0.5"/> as A as i am with B <pause dur="1.0"/> we're saying that <pause dur="0.4"/> that's too strong a requirement <pause dur="0.5"/> we merely want people 
to say do you prefer A or B <pause dur="0.5"/> we don't want them to say <pause dur="0.2"/> by how much they prefer A to B <pause dur="5.3"/><kinesic desc="reveals covered part of transparency" iterated="n"/> we're also ruling out the possibility that people can say things like <pause dur="0.3"/> <reading>B makes me fifteen units of satisfaction better off than A</reading> <pause dur="1.3"/> okay so <pause dur="1.2"/> back in your room on campus <pause dur="1.0"/> in the privacy of your of your own <pause dur="0.3"/> study room <pause dur="0.7"/> you haven't got some kind of thermometer or barometer of your own level of happiness and you can gauge it each day <pause dur="1.3"/> and give it an actual calibrated number <pause dur="1.4"/> and if someone comes to your door and offers you either a takeaway pizza <pause dur="0.6"/> or a takeaway can of # Boddingtons bitter or <pause dur="0.2"/> Coca-cola or whatever <pause dur="0.7"/> # that you're not able to say <pause dur="0.2"/> <trunc>le</trunc> hang on a minute i'll just measure exactly how much happiness i get from that one and from that one and compare the two <pause dur="1.2"/> so you know which you'd prefer of those two choices <pause dur="0.3"/> but you don't know by how much you don't calibrate <pause dur="0.3"/> cardinally <pause dur="0.7"/> your level of happiness <pause dur="0.4"/> you rank ordinally <pause dur="0.5"/> where things are in a hierarchy <pause dur="0.5"/> but not measured <pause dur="0.3"/> in the way that you measure temperature <pause dur="0.3"/> on a 
calibrated scale <pause dur="4.0"/><kinesic desc="reveals covered part of transparency" iterated="n"/> so those are three kinds of <pause dur="1.3"/> of ways of thinking about utility that we're not going to be adopting <pause dur="1.7"/> in our definitions of individual rationality <pause dur="1.3"/> some of you who've done economics before <pause dur="1.8"/> might have come across the idea of <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> of levels of utility <pause dur="1.4"/> anyway you could even perhaps think of writing an equation which gives you someone's level of utility <pause dur="1.7"/> and when people talk about utility they also sometimes talk about the idea of <pause dur="0.2"/> marginal <pause dur="0.2"/> utility <pause dur="1.9"/> by which they mean <pause dur="0.6"/> if i have an extra unit of X or an extra slice of pizza for example <pause dur="0.3"/> then my utility level for today goes from twenty <pause dur="0.3"/> to twenty-two <pause dur="0.4"/> and so my marginal utility from this extra slice of pizza <pause dur="0.2"/> is two units of utility <pause dur="1.3"/> but we're saying that we don't <pause dur="0.3"/> believe for the purposes of our <pause dur="0.7"/> # analysis of rationality <pause dur="0.2"/> that people <pause dur="0.5"/> can make those kind of judgements <pause dur="0.3"/> so we're ruling out the idea of measuring utility <pause dur="0.3"/> by numbers <pause dur="0.4"/> and that means we're ruling 
out the idea of measuring marginal utility <pause dur="1.1"/> okay so for most of this course <pause dur="0.4"/> there might be times in which we say <pause dur="0.2"/> well let's look at what happens if we can do that <pause dur="0.3"/> but on the whole we're going to say <pause dur="0.2"/> we don't believe that marginal utility <pause dur="0.7"/> is a meaningful concept that people don't have that way of thinking about their own utility <pause dur="1.6"/> so if you've <pause dur="0.2"/> if you've heard of marginal utility <pause dur="0.5"/> as you all have now 'cause i've just mentioned it <pause dur="0.3"/> forget it for a while <pause dur="0.8"/> that's not our way of dealing with <pause dur="0.2"/> this <pause dur="0.9"/> notion of <pause dur="0.7"/> of preferences <pause dur="3.0"/><kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="24"/> okay so <pause dur="0.6"/> the properties we're looking at then <pause dur="0.4"/> the preferences so far <pause dur="2.0"/> are that people can rank their preferences <trunc>o</trunc> over different bundles <pause dur="0.4"/> their ranking <pause dur="0.3"/> is done in an ordinal <pause dur="0.2"/> not a cardinal way <pause dur="9.6"/> to recap the <pause dur="0.2"/> preferences are complete <pause dur="1.2"/> in the sense that <pause dur="0.5"/> you can compare an individual can compare any two bundles of goods <pause dur="0.4"/> so we've got ordinal ranking of preferences <pause dur="0.4"/> completeness of preferences <pause dur="4.6"/> thirdly <pause dur="3.6"/> you've got <pause dur="0.6"/> non-satiation of preferences <pause dur="3.8"/> 
we're assuming <pause dur="1.2"/> that individuals' preferences <pause dur="0.7"/> have this property of non-satiation <pause dur="3.1"/> in other words <pause dur="1.4"/> <reading>the consumer always prefers more to less of any commodity</reading> <pause dur="4.2"/> goes by the idea of <reading>you can't have too much of a good thing</reading> <pause dur="0.3"/> if a thing gives you <pause dur="0.3"/> happiness then the more of it the better <pause dur="1.7"/> is that always strictly true <pause dur="2.4"/> someone says yes but we don't # <pause dur="2.1"/> okay well you've <trunc>do</trunc> you've demonstrated by being here <pause dur="1.1"/> that even though there are many other things you could've gone away to do <pause dur="0.6"/> you've decided to come here <pause dur="1.5"/> i don't believe that <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> University campus is <pause dur="0.5"/> has nothing else to offer than this you've come here <pause dur="1.8"/> # and that means that on balance it's a good thing okay it might be <pause dur="0.2"/> that might be a dismal experience <pause dur="0.4"/> but you can survive it <pause dur="0.3"/> and maybe see you take away something that will <trunc>hel</trunc> enable you <pause dur="0.3"/> to do better on the course pass the exams and that will mean you've got a summer without having to bother about resits <pause dur="0.4"/> all these calculations might be there <pause dur="1.1"/> but if that's true is it would be the 
case that you'd be happy to sit here until May or June <pause dur="0.4"/> doing nothing else <pause dur="0.3"/> maybe with a sleeping bag and <pause dur="0.9"/> and some food supplies coming every now and again <pause dur="0.4"/> course it isn't <pause dur="0.2"/> you can certainly have too much <pause dur="0.3"/> even of such a good thing as an economics lecture <pause dur="0.5"/> if that's true of an economics lecture it's certainly very very true <pause dur="0.3"/> of other commodities <pause dur="0.6"/> i happen to have one or two friends who enjoy <pause dur="0.4"/> # consuming substances like alcohol <pause dur="1.5"/><vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" n="ss" dur="1"/> and i know it's terrible for me to admit that but it's true <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> and # <pause dur="0.3"/> and pizza <pause dur="0.8"/> okay some of my best friends like pizza <pause dur="1.0"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> and i have some people who are devoted to pizza and eat and and eat nothing else <pause dur="0.5"/> but even they get to some point where if you offer them an extra slice of pizza <pause dur="0.3"/> they'd have to turn it down <pause dur="0.3"/> because it's no longer giving them <pause dur="0.3"/> positive levels of happiness <pause dur="0.8"/> it's having quite contrary effects <pause dur="0.9"/> on their physiological well-being <pause dur="1.2"/> okay <pause dur="1.0"/> so <pause dur="0.7"/> it certainly is unreasonable <pause dur="1.3"/><kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> to assume that this is always true 
but for now we're going to assume it <pause dur="2.3"/><kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="6"/> one fourth and final <pause dur="0.6"/> property of preferences that i want to introduce before <pause dur="0.4"/> pausing for a break <pause dur="1.8"/> is the property of transitivity <pause dur="2.3"/> we're assuming that peoples' preferences <pause dur="1.4"/> have this property <pause dur="1.0"/> of <pause dur="1.1"/> being transitive <pause dur="7.7"/> now what we mean by this <pause dur="2.4"/><kinesic desc="reveals covered part of transparency" iterated="n"/> let me introduce the following notation <pause dur="0.5"/> this sign here which is a bit like a <pause dur="0.3"/> a greater than sign <pause dur="0.6"/> with a slight twist <pause dur="3.2"/> is to be read as <pause dur="1.4"/> in the <pause dur="0.2"/> to be read in the following way if <pause dur="1.1"/> the individual prefers A <pause dur="0.3"/> to B <pause dur="0.6"/> okay so that's read as <pause dur="3.5"/> if A <pause dur="0.5"/> is preferred to B or if if the individual prefers A to B <pause dur="2.3"/><kinesic desc="reveals covered part of transparency" iterated="n"/> and if the individual prefers B to C <pause dur="2.3"/><kinesic desc="reveals covered part of transparency" iterated="n"/> then by transitivity <pause dur="0.8"/> it follows that the individual must prefer A <pause dur="0.3"/> to C <pause dur="3.8"/> okay so <pause dur="0.5"/> i go along to one individual <pause dur="0.6"/> and i say to him <pause dur="0.9"/> # <pause dur="2.1"/> point A <pause dur="0.3"/> is you have a ticket to go to the next home match of <gap reason="name" extent="2 words"/> <pause dur="2.1"/> # <pause dur="1.8"/> bundle B is <pause dur="0.4"/> you get a free pizza from me <pause dur="1.5"/> and bundle C is you get four tickets for the national lottery <pause dur="1.0"/> there's A B and 
C <pause dur="0.8"/> if i offer you the choice between A and B do you want to go to <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> <gap reason="name" extent="2 words"/> <pause dur="0.2"/> or do you want the pizza <pause dur="0.4"/> and if you say pizza <pause dur="1.3"/> and then i offer you the choice between the pizza and the national lottery tickets <pause dur="0.3"/> and you say the national lottery tickets <pause dur="0.6"/> if i then say to you okay <pause dur="0.2"/> what now about the choice between <gap reason="name" extent="2 words"/> and the national lottery tickets <pause dur="0.2"/> if you said ah well in that case <gap reason="name" extent="2 words"/> <pause dur="0.5"/> i say your your preferences are intransitive <pause dur="0.6"/> they don't satisfy this assumption of transitivity <pause dur="0.4"/> and i regard that as <pause dur="0.5"/> for these purposes <pause dur="0.5"/> not satisfying my conditions for rationality <pause dur="0.5"/> so this element of rationality <pause dur="0.3"/> imposes transitivity <pause dur="0.5"/> let me just say one more thing about transitivity before pausing <pause dur="4.3"/><kinesic desc="reveals covered part of transparency" iterated="n"/> it's true of strict preference it's true in this relationship between <pause dur="0.4"/> preferring one thing to another <pause dur="1.6"/> it's also true <pause dur="0.5"/> of <pause dur="0.2"/> the <pause dur="0.2"/> indifference relationship <pause dur="1.8"/> if asked the same questions the answer was <pause dur="0.4"/> i'm indifferent between A and B <pause dur="0.4"/> okay so 
this is this reads as <pause dur="0.4"/> if the individual is indifferent between A and B <pause dur="0.6"/> and if they're indifferent between B and C <pause dur="0.8"/> then again by transitivity <pause dur="1.5"/> upper case T is my shorthand for transitivity <pause dur="0.7"/> the individual must also report being <pause dur="0.9"/> in # having <pause dur="1.5"/> transitive <pause dur="0.5"/> # having indifference between A and C <pause dur="0.3"/> if their preferences are <pause dur="0.5"/> transitive <pause dur="1.8"/> okay think about <pause dur="0.2"/> this property of transitivity which you mostly might not have come across before <pause dur="1.4"/> think about something which is <pause dur="0.6"/> think about some phenomenon in the real world <pause dur="0.2"/> which does have transitivity <pause dur="0.6"/> one example would be people's heights <pause dur="0.4"/> if i compared three people A B and C <pause dur="0.5"/> A is taller than B B is taller than C <pause dur="0.3"/> it follows <pause dur="0.6"/> in a kind of logical way that A is bigger than C <pause dur="0.8"/> think about some different phenomenon <pause dur="0.9"/> think about football matches <pause dur="1.7"/> and the question is are football results <pause dur="0.2"/> transitive do they satisfy the property of transitivity <pause dur="0.5"/> okay well look <pause dur="0.6"/> again i have friends who are interested in football <pause dur="1.5"/> and some of them are interested in some <pause dur="0.2"/> 
football competition called the European Champions League or something of the kind <pause dur="0.9"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> this is a very European arena a global arena so let's think not just about <pause dur="0.2"/> domestic football let's not just think about <gap reason="name" extent="2 words"/> <pause dur="0.7"/> who i believe aren't in the Champions League <pause dur="1.9"/> tomorrow there are some games in the Champions League of European football <pause dur="0.8"/> # in one particular group there is a team which goes by the name of Manchester United <pause dur="1.1"/> and in their first game of that competition they drew with Barcelona <pause dur="1.3"/> in their second game <pause dur="0.3"/> they drew with Bayern Munich <pause dur="0.8"/> tomorrow night Bayern Munich <pause dur="0.3"/> play Barcelona <pause dur="0.8"/> if football results are transitive <pause dur="0.3"/> then Bayern Munich and Barcelona will draw <pause dur="1.4"/> if you believe that that's true you won't be in this lecture theatre you'll be at the bookmakers putting a lot of money on the outcome <pause dur="1.1"/> if you do that you might well be disappointed <pause dur="0.4"/> 'cause football results <pause dur="0.2"/> sadly or mercifully <pause dur="0.2"/> depending on which way you look at it <pause dur="0.4"/> are not transitive <pause dur="0.6"/> okay so that's the phenomenon of transitivity <pause dur="0.4"/> we'll break there and we'll resume in about ten minutes
