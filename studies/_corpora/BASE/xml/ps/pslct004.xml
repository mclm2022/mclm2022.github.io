will get the formation of a <sic corr="carbocation">carbocathion</sic> <pause dur="0.6"/> but <pause dur="0.2"/> in actual fact <pause dur="14.1"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="14"/> what reacts in cyclohexanol <pause dur="0.2"/> in acidic solution <pause dur="0.3"/> is <pause dur="0.4"/> the <pause dur="1.5"/> two groups that are trans antiperiplanar to each other <pause dur="2.3"/> so the O-H has got to be pointing down the hydrogen's got to be pointing up <pause dur="0.5"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> it does that and you get an elimination reaction <pause dur="8.9"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="9"/> right <pause dur="0.5"/> so <pause dur="0.4"/> elimination requires you remember from <pause dur="0.3"/> Dr <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/>'s course or perhaps you don't <pause dur="1.0"/><vocal desc="laughter" n="ss" iterated="y" dur="1"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> there's <pause dur="0.5"/> was <pause dur="0.8"/> elimination <pause dur="0.4"/> the groups have to be trans antiperiplanar <pause dur="0.8"/> now <pause dur="1.3"/> in the case of this weird and wonderful decalin system that i showed you <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="16.8"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="14"/> we protonate that <pause dur="0.7"/> now i'm going to save time drawing it <pause dur="1.8"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="2"/> i'm going to protonate it up there <pause dur="3.8"/> now <pause dur="0.2"/> can we get elimination <pause dur="2.3"/> well the answer is no because <pause dur="0.2"/> <trunc>n</trunc> we need to have a hydrogen <pause dur="1.1"/> obviously we're going to eliminate H-two-O <pause dur="0.6"/> we need to have a hydrogen in an antiperiplanar <pause dur="0.2"/> arrangement <pause dur="0.7"/> and that means that <pause dur="0.7"/> that in this case <pause dur="0.6"/> the ring 
can't flip <pause dur="0.4"/> as you probably recall <pause dur="0.7"/> decalin rings <pause dur="0.7"/> fused rings in general have very very little <pause dur="0.3"/> conformational freedom <pause dur="0.3"/> so this ring is fixed <pause dur="0.2"/> and it means it can't flip such that the O-H is pointing down in an axial position <pause dur="0.7"/> and so in this case <pause dur="0.2"/> you don't get elimination <pause dur="0.3"/> what you get rather is a migration <pause dur="1.0"/> so you form a cation <pause dur="0.2"/> and you get a group <pause dur="0.2"/> migrating <pause dur="0.3"/> this group here <pause dur="1.2"/><kinesic desc="indicates point on board" iterated="n"/> for example <pause dur="0.2"/> will migrate <pause dur="1.6"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="3"/> and the O-H will fall off <pause dur="0.8"/> in the normal way <pause dur="0.2"/> and <pause dur="16.9"/> and the product we eventually get is the eliminated product <pause dur="0.3"/> but now it's in actual fact <pause dur="7.0"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="6"/> that compound <pause dur="4.3"/> it seems a bit mysterious really but it's not <pause dur="0.6"/> all it all that we're saying is that the groups have to be <pause dur="0.4"/> trans antiperiplanar <pause dur="0.2"/> to each other <pause dur="0.4"/> in order to <pause dur="0.5"/> be able to <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> migrate <pause dur="5.2"/> okay <pause dur="1.8"/> in general rearrangements really come into their own in cyclic systems <pause dur="0.4"/> the cyclic systems are where you can get some good transformations <pause dur="0.3"/> in particular <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> you can form <pause dur="0.2"/> five and six member rings and 
you remember last week we were discussing the pinacol arrangement <pause dur="0.6"/> and we had <pause dur="0.2"/> two options with a <pause dur="0.2"/> with a one-two-cyclohexanediol <pause dur="2.2"/> depending on the <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> configuration of the diol at the start whether the O-Hs were trans or cis <pause dur="35.7"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="24"/> now <pause dur="0.4"/> this is a good one <pause dur="0.4"/> here <pause dur="0.7"/> and this is also <pause dur="0.2"/> in your tutorial <pause dur="1.3"/> it's also <pause dur="0.2"/> if <pause dur="0.6"/> i don't normally recommend colleagues' books <shift feature="voice" new="laugh"/>only <pause dur="0.2"/> only my own should i happen to have one <pause dur="0.3"/> # <vocal desc="laughter" n="sl" iterated="y" dur="1"/> <pause dur="0.5"/> but <pause dur="0.3"/><kinesic desc="holds up book" iterated="n"/> Professor <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/>'s little <pause dur="0.8"/> monogram on <pause dur="0.2"/> polar rearrangements <pause dur="0.3"/> has all the answers in <pause dur="0.2"/> because that's what i used to write the course before he came here <pause dur="0.3"/> even <pause dur="0.5"/> and so <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> it will have all the answers in <pause dur="0.8"/> it's <pause dur="0.6"/> probably not necessary to buy these things we did arrange to have all these <pause dur="0.4"/> Oxford primers in the library in the short loan collection <pause dur="0.5"/> so if you go over there you should be able to get hold of it <pause dur="1.3"/> but <pause dur="0.3"/> this is # <pause dur="0.4"/> a particularly good one because it <trunc>b</trunc> both of them give the same product <pause dur="4.2"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="13"/> oh-oh <pause dur="0.2"/> which i've have 
to draw out properly <pause dur="8.9"/> this spirocyclic compound <pause dur="17.7"/> perhaps i'll put in the # <pause dur="0.5"/> the wedge line <pause dur="0.4"/> here <pause dur="3.5"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="3"/> from the hash line at the back <pause dur="0.6"/> just to emphasize you see these are spiro compounds <pause dur="0.2"/> those <pause dur="0.3"/> spiro systems are are not necessarily very easy <pause dur="0.2"/> to form <pause dur="19.2"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="9"/> but you often find <pause dur="0.5"/> that rearrangements can give you that sort of <pause dur="0.2"/> unusual <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> cyclic arrangement <pause dur="1.1"/> the other <pause dur="0.2"/> the other type of reaction where you get some really strange <pause dur="0.3"/> cyclic compounds are <pause dur="0.3"/> photochemical reactions <pause dur="0.7"/> but <pause dur="0.3"/> it's outside of the scope <pause dur="0.9"/> of this <pause dur="0.6"/> series of lectures to talk about that <pause dur="9.3"/><event desc="looks through transparencies" iterated="y" dur="11"/> now <pause dur="1.2"/> i'm going to put up <pause dur="3.7"/> some alternatives here i'll just # <pause dur="0.8"/><kinesic desc="turns on overhead projector showing transparency" iterated="n"/> try and <pause dur="4.6"/> because i # <pause dur="2.2"/><event desc="shuts curtains" iterated="y" dur="6"/> i'll have to shut the curtains i think <pause dur="3.1"/> because i'm so kind to you and gave you the printed handout you don't need to copy this down <pause dur="1.4"/> it's also on the web <pause dur="0.2"/> and some of that's in colour <pause dur="0.4"/> and that was brought to my attention yesterday that i'd <pause dur="0.3"/> i'd write on this sheet things are blue <pause dur="0.2"/> 
when of course they're black and white <pause dur="0.5"/> but i couldn't afford colour photocopying to <pause dur="0.4"/> give to you all <pause dur="0.7"/> here we have some variations on a theme as it were <pause dur="5.4"/> and these are <pause dur="0.2"/> all <pause dur="1.4"/> what i would classify as semi-pinacol rearrangements <pause dur="16.6"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="11"/> right <pause dur="0.2"/> the driving force is always <pause dur="0.2"/> formation of a carbocation <pause dur="0.3"/> with a positive charge <pause dur="0.2"/> adjacent to the lone pair on the oxygens <pause dur="0.7"/> that's what causes <trunc>u</trunc> us to get this pinacol arrangement <pause dur="1.8"/> that's what's happening here indeed <pause dur="0.2"/> one of those O-Hs is being lost <pause dur="0.2"/> and then <pause dur="0.2"/> a group is migrating <pause dur="1.3"/> i haven't put up the mechanism because i'm sure <pause dur="0.2"/> you will all be capable of doing that yourself now <pause dur="2.7"/> i hope so anyway <pause dur="0.6"/> right <pause dur="2.0"/><kinesic desc="indicates point on board" iterated="n"/> these are <pause dur="1.3"/> diols <pause dur="0.2"/> and and the # the classic pinacol arrangement is <pause dur="0.2"/> the rearrangement of a one-two-diol <pause dur="1.7"/> we can generate <trunc>w</trunc> there's a ready source of diols <pause dur="0.2"/> we can generate <pause dur="0.3"/> diols from <pause dur="0.3"/> <trunc>v</trunc> via the dimerization of <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.8"/> ketones <pause dur="1.2"/> dimerization of ketones <pause dur="0.2"/> using <pause dur="0.2"/> mediated by <pause dur="0.2"/> <trunc>n</trunc> normally magnesium <pause dur="0.4"/> magnesium and mercury or something 
like that <pause dur="0.4"/> would be <pause dur="0.2"/> suitable <pause dur="0.2"/> but we can also generate diols from <pause dur="0.2"/> alkene plus osmium tetroxide <pause dur="0.5"/> should we so desire <pause dur="0.2"/> and that that way we can actually get <pause dur="0.8"/> a <trunc>f</trunc> # a handle on some unsymmetric <pause dur="1.0"/> diols <pause dur="1.5"/> there are <pause dur="1.9"/> other ways of producing diols of course <pause dur="1.2"/> osmium tetroxide always in cyclic systems gives you cis <pause dur="0.6"/> diols if you want trans diols <pause dur="0.3"/> then <pause dur="0.9"/> you can <trunc>s</trunc> <pause dur="0.3"/> also generate them from <pause dur="0.2"/> you can generate them from alkenes by <pause dur="1.7"/> epoxidization followed by <pause dur="0.4"/> # nucleophilic attack and ring opening with base <pause dur="1.3"/> so we we got a handle on diols there's there's plenty of them around <pause dur="0.2"/> so synthetically this has got <pause dur="0.6"/> enormous utility <pause dur="2.2"/> 
if you want to make that <pause dur="0.7"/> type of compound <pause dur="1.9"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> and <pause dur="0.4"/> really the gist of what i'm i'm trying to get across <pause dur="0.2"/> is that <pause dur="0.8"/> in <trunc>a</trunc> in aliphatic systems i mean <pause dur="0.2"/> that's all very well <trunc>ver</trunc> very interesting <pause dur="0.2"/> but in cyclic systems you can often use this to change <pause dur="0.2"/> the way in which the ring looks <pause dur="1.7"/> now <pause dur="0.4"/> we're not restricted to diols <pause dur="1.7"/> we are <pause dur="0.5"/> we have this range of other systems <pause dur="0.2"/> which generate <pause dur="0.5"/> in the last case a similar <pause dur="0.2"/> in the other cases the same <pause dur="0.3"/> carbocation intermediate <pause dur="0.5"/> here <pause dur="1.8"/> so <pause dur="1.8"/> where we have an amine there <pause dur="1.3"/> we <pause dur="0.6"/> treat with nitrous acid <pause dur="0.4"/> and we diazotize <pause dur="0.2"/> we then lose the nitrogen <pause dur="0.2"/> as gas <pause dur="0.3"/> it's entropically driven <pause dur="0.5"/> it's a very rapid reaction you remember <pause dur="0.6"/> in in <pause dur="0.5"/> aliphatic systems at least <pause dur="0.2"/> so we lose the nitrogen <pause dur="0.5"/> and <pause dur="0.7"/> we <pause dur="0.7"/> generate <pause dur="0.2"/> the carbocation <pause dur="1.0"/> similarly <pause dur="0.2"/> we can ring open an epoxide <pause dur="0.4"/> with a Lewis acid <pause dur="3.4"/> lithium iodide for example <pause dur="0.9"/> ring open the expoxide <pause dur="0.2"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> we will <pause dur="0.6"/> somehow magically <pause dur="0.7"/> 
presumably from solvent <pause dur="0.3"/> pick up a proton <pause dur="0.4"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> we will <trunc>l</trunc> <pause dur="0.4"/> get once again <pause dur="1.0"/> a <pause dur="2.0"/> cation <pause dur="1.3"/> the same cation <pause dur="1.0"/> once again a Lewis acid and a <pause dur="1.2"/> alcohol halide <pause dur="3.4"/> the <pause dur="0.3"/> the silver <trunc>m</trunc> mops up the chloride silver <trunc>c</trunc> silver chloride being insoluble <pause dur="0.3"/> disappears from <pause dur="1.9"/> the <pause dur="0.4"/> the phase <trunc>th</trunc> from <trunc>th</trunc> from from availability as it were as a precipitate <pause dur="0.4"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> we get this cation <pause dur="1.9"/> here <pause dur="0.2"/> proteination <pause dur="1.0"/> gives us the most stable <pause dur="0.2"/> driven by <trunc>m</trunc> Markovnikov's rules <pause dur="0.4"/> gives us the most stable cation <pause dur="3.4"/> right <pause dur="1.0"/> none of those cations exist very long # <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> they're all similiar cations <pause dur="0.6"/> but <pause dur="0.2"/> they don't exist very long because a group's going to migrate <pause dur="0.2"/> one of these groups is going to migrate <pause dur="1.1"/> depending on the migratory aptitude <pause dur="1.1"/> and <pause dur="2.0"/> we're going to get <pause dur="0.2"/> a cation there <pause dur="1.8"/> on this carbon <pause dur="0.2"/> which is adjacent to the lone pair on the oxygen <pause dur="0.2"/> which then <pause dur="0.2"/> delocalizes pumps electrons into the system <pause dur="0.2"/> and gives us a relatively stable cation <pause dur="1.6"/> okay is that <pause dur="0.4"/> does that make sense <pause dur="0.3"/> is everyone happy with that <pause dur="1.4"/> fine <pause dur="0.5"/> so these are all <pause dur="0.4"/> variations on a theme semi-pinacol type 
rearrangements <pause dur="0.4"/> and <pause dur="3.7"/><kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="2"/> i have got <pause dur="0.2"/> a few more examples here <pause dur="3.8"/> and we we we we have to <pause dur="0.3"/> sort of rush through them i'm afraid <pause dur="0.2"/> once again <event desc="looks through handout" iterated="y" dur="4"/> this should be <pause dur="0.4"/> i'll just check <pause dur="0.6"/> yes it's in your handout <pause dur="1.7"/> so <pause dur="0.8"/> <trunc>i</trunc> probably <trunc>i</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> more likely to be correct <pause dur="0.5"/> if you <pause dur="0.2"/> just leave it <pause dur="0.4"/> <trunc>with</trunc> without copying it down <pause dur="0.4"/> once again <pause dur="0.2"/> these these are all <pause dur="0.4"/> semi-pinacol rearrangements <pause dur="0.3"/> nitrous acid <pause dur="2.0"/> diazonium cation <pause dur="1.7"/> once it falls off <pause dur="0.2"/> and we then get <pause dur="0.2"/> this group <pause dur="0.4"/> migrating round <pause dur="0.2"/> note <pause dur="0.2"/> it's the trans <pause dur="1.8"/> antiperiplanar arrangement that allows migration <pause dur="4.4"/> because <pause dur="0.3"/> <trunc>yo</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> <trunc>th</trunc> <pause dur="0.7"/> stress the antiperiplanar because of course <pause dur="0.5"/> these are <pause dur="2.4"/> actually in a trans arrangement aren't they <pause dur="0.7"/> but they're not <pause dur="0.2"/> in a suitable arrangement for migration <pause dur="1.8"/> so it's got to be <pause dur="0.2"/> this group here <pause dur="0.9"/> <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="1"/> and that group there <pause dur="0.2"/> <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="1"/> which are <pause dur="2.6"/> going to be <pause dur="0.2"/> are going to be the relevant # <trunc>s</trunc> have the relevant stereochemistry <pause dur="0.5"/> and <pause dur="1.2"/> of course we then <pause dur="0.4"/> get <pause dur="0.3"/> loss of a proton from the rearranged cation to give us a ketone <pause dur="2.3"/> <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="1"/> 
so we've made converted a <pause dur="2.1"/> six member ring to a five member ring <pause dur="4.3"/> here <pause dur="1.1"/> we get two <pause dur="0.8"/> different stereochemistry <pause dur="2.0"/> in this case we've got <pause dur="0.2"/> <trunc>s</trunc> the O-H and the N-H-two-cis <pause dur="2.3"/> and <pause dur="1.1"/> now <pause dur="0.3"/> we have the possibility <pause dur="0.3"/> of <pause dur="0.3"/> two <pause dur="1.0"/> conformations <pause dur="0.4"/> mediating the <pause dur="0.3"/> the process <pause dur="0.4"/> here <pause dur="0.7"/> we can have <pause dur="0.2"/> this one formations of a cation <pause dur="0.3"/> migrating group trans to the leaving group <pause dur="0.3"/> note <pause dur="0.2"/> the <pause dur="0.2"/> the the <trunc>f</trunc> the fact is and i <pause dur="1.1"/> must admit <pause dur="0.2"/> <trunc>t</trunc> <pause dur="0.3"/> confess to being slightly surprised or even baffled by this <pause dur="0.4"/> that <pause dur="0.2"/> that the <pause dur="0.7"/> the azo group falls off and it appears this group does migrate selectively <pause dur="0.2"/> even though <pause dur="0.2"/> we don't get any of this neighbouring group participation <pause dur="0.2"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> and compare the aliphatic example <pause dur="0.3"/> based on # <pause dur="0.3"/> neopentyl cation that i gave you last week <pause dur="1.2"/> where <pause dur="0.2"/> where one got really a quite a mixture of products so <pause dur="0.2"/> so even though <pause dur="0.2"/> this is going to fall off very very quickly <pause dur="0.2"/> you'd still get this this trans group migrating <pause dur="2.7"/> and we get <pause dur="0.2"/> the same <pause dur="0.2"/> similar product to <pause dur="0.3"/> previously the same product <pause dur="0.2"/> but <pause dur="0.2"/> we've got this other 
conformational arrangement available here <pause dur="1.6"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> in this case <pause dur="0.9"/> we now get <pause dur="1.5"/> migration and <pause dur="0.5"/> it's easier for the <pause dur="0.2"/> hydride <pause dur="0.2"/> to migrate <pause dur="0.5"/> because it's trans <pause dur="0.4"/> to <pause dur="0.2"/> the leaving group <pause dur="1.1"/> and so that's what happens and now we get a six member ring <pause dur="1.7"/> there <pause dur="0.7"/> of course <pause dur="0.2"/> if we get ring-flipping <pause dur="0.2"/> then we still are left with <pause dur="0.3"/> the <pause dur="2.1"/> the ring <pause dur="0.2"/> methylenes <pause dur="0.2"/> being trans to the leaving group <pause dur="0.2"/> so <pause dur="0.3"/> ring-flipping doesn't really matter there <pause dur="4.3"/> right <pause dur="0.2"/> now <pause dur="0.2"/> i have <pause dur="0.9"/> a huge range of other examples <pause dur="3.2"/> so <pause dur="1:19.6"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="54"/> right <pause dur="2.5"/> ring expansions it's a good way <pause dur="0.2"/> to make to get ring expansions or contractions to give us # <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> by using rearranged <pause dur="0.3"/> materials <pause dur="0.4"/> here <pause dur="0.8"/><kinesic desc="indicates point on board" iterated="n"/> we start with cyclo-<pause dur="0.3"/>hexanone <pause dur="4.0"/> we then <pause dur="0.5"/> react it with <pause dur="0.4"/> <trunc>diazome</trunc> with sorry with <trunc>nitro</trunc> nitromethane <pause dur="2.1"/> in base <pause dur="1.3"/> nitromethane of course <pause dur="0.3"/> is <pause dur="0.5"/> # is somewhat acidic <pause dur="0.2"/> so in base we form this <pause dur="6.2"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="6"/> highly delocalized anion <pause dur="4.3"/> have to be very careful with diazomethane in base and don't let it dry out <pause dur="0.3"/> of course <pause dur="0.8"/> because <pause dur="0.6"/> one interesting when i for my sins used to do <pause dur="0.7"/> E-S-R spectroscopy <pause dur="0.3"/> i # <pause dur="0.4"/> we used to 
use <pause dur="0.9"/> nitromethane as a <trunc>s</trunc> as a spin trap <pause dur="0.2"/> and if you shake the flask containing the nitromethane in the base <pause dur="0.4"/> you see a huge amount of radicals being produced in your E-S-R spectrometer <pause dur="0.5"/> from goodness knows what source <pause dur="0.3"/> but to me <pause dur="0.2"/> the production of radicals <trunc>spontaneous</trunc> # <pause dur="0.5"/> <trunc>spontaneous</trunc> <pause dur="0.7"/> spontaneously <pause dur="0.2"/> indicates <pause dur="0.2"/> something alarming could be happening <pause dur="0.3"/> and certainly is it says on the bottle <pause dur="0.3"/> that <pause dur="0.2"/> it is quite explosive that <pause dur="1.5"/> but <pause dur="0.5"/> that is a good # # a good nucleophile and it will react <pause dur="0.2"/> with <pause dur="0.7"/> cyclohexanone there to give us <pause dur="0.8"/> that alcohol <pause dur="0.2"/> which then <pause dur="0.5"/> we reduce <pause dur="3.9"/> # <pause dur="1.1"/> i really don't have to remind you the difficulties of making amines <pause dur="0.4"/> aliphatic amines you can't do it simply by <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.9"/> just # just whacking in ammonia and and doing a nucleophilic substitution <pause dur="0.4"/> type reaction <pause dur="0.3"/> because there's <pause dur="0.2"/> you get all these <pause dur="0.4"/> # quarternarized ammonium <pause dur="0.2"/> ions and that sort of thing <pause dur="0.3"/> so <pause dur="0.2"/> you <pause dur="0.2"/> this is a good way to do to <pause dur="0.2"/> to get an amine there <pause dur="0.3"/> we then <pause dur="0.8"/> we have that <pause dur="0.3"/> we then reduce it <pause dur="1.9"/> it would seem hydrogenation is the method of 
choice here <pause dur="0.3"/> and <pause dur="0.3"/> then <pause dur="0.2"/> we treat <pause dur="0.2"/> with <pause dur="0.4"/> nitrous acid <pause dur="7.5"/> <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="3"/> to give us <pause dur="29.0"/> <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="19"/> the <trunc>n</trunc> the the <pause dur="0.9"/> <trunc>nit</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> the N-two falls off <pause dur="0.2"/> the cation the # the <pause dur="0.9"/> methylene group from the ring migrates and gives us the <pause dur="0.3"/> the ring-expanded product <pause dur="0.4"/> so we've got a seven member ring <pause dur="2.1"/> now alternatively <pause dur="10.6"/> <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="9"/> we can use <pause dur="0.3"/> diazomethane <pause dur="1:01.1"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="40"/> right <pause dur="0.9"/> now <pause dur="10.6"/> we can <pause dur="1.9"/> get <pause dur="0.5"/> a migration <pause dur="0.2"/> but in actual fact we get two migrations happening <pause dur="0.3"/> we get one path <pause dur="0.3"/> gives us <pause dur="25.4"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="20"/> gives us cycloheptanone <pause dur="1.0"/> the other path <pause dur="0.6"/> is <pause dur="17.7"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="21"/> gives us that <pause dur="3.0"/> that <pause dur="0.3"/> epoxide ring <pause dur="0.4"/> in a <pause dur="0.2"/> spirocyclic system again <pause dur="11.9"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="2"/> of course <pause dur="0.3"/> you can then treat that <pause dur="0.5"/> with lithium iodide <pause dur="1.5"/> as we mentioned earlier <pause dur="0.3"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> produce <pause dur="0.3"/> the <pause dur="0.9"/> cyclohexanone <pause dur="29.1"/> 
<kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="5"/> i guess the trick is somewhere in the <pause dur="0.2"/> the more basic conditions you use <pause dur="0.3"/> in the <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> diazomethane synthesis <pause dur="8.5"/> it seems to fall apart into <pause dur="0.4"/> sort of more <pause dur="0.2"/> more readily i guess would be <pause dur="0.3"/> would be the answer there's more <pause dur="0.7"/> <trunc>i</trunc> <pause dur="0.6"/> it's <trunc>n</trunc> there's not so much thermodynamic control of the product <pause dur="2.5"/> but <pause dur="0.8"/> the important point is <pause dur="0.3"/> that the root <pause dur="0.2"/> at which you do this <pause dur="0.3"/> does <pause dur="0.2"/> affect what products you get <pause dur="2.3"/> even though nominally you're getting the same intermediate there <pause dur="0.6"/> but of course the intermediates are being formed <pause dur="0.4"/> in a different way in one <pause dur="0.2"/> you <trunc>f</trunc> you generate the N-two-plus <pause dur="0.2"/> in highly acidic media <pause dur="0.3"/> in the other <pause dur="0.2"/> i <pause dur="1.6"/> it is it it is actually according to <pause dur="0.3"/> to my <pause dur="0.3"/> notes done in in acid but i guess it's not as <pause dur="0.4"/> quite as acidic as as previously <pause dur="12.5"/> another example <pause dur="36.3"/> <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="29"/> right do you get that occurring <pause dur="1.6"/> no <pause dur="1.9"/> what you get is <pause dur="2.7"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="3"/> that <pause dur="1.5"/> exclusively <pause dur="1.2"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="1"/> gives us that exclusively <pause dur="9.0"/> right <pause dur="2.7"/> i <pause dur="0.2"/> think we should leave the semi-pinacol 
rearrangement there <pause dur="3.4"/> and move on <pause dur="0.3"/> rapidly <pause dur="0.5"/> to <pause dur="2.2"/> the <pause dur="1.1"/> Beckmann rearrangement and <trunc>rel</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> related analogues <pause dur="24.7"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="14"/> right <pause dur="0.6"/> i hope you're all happy with that <pause dur="0.2"/> idea of the semi-pinacol rearrangement <pause dur="0.3"/> we've seen <pause dur="0.3"/> the pinacol rearrangement <pause dur="0.4"/> guided <pause dur="0.3"/> governed by the formation of this <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> highly stable cation adjacent to the oxygen <pause dur="0.3"/> we've seen that we can modify that <pause dur="0.3"/> using these semi-pinacol <pause dur="0.8"/> type system <pause dur="0.2"/> where <pause dur="1.2"/> the classic the best example is where we have an amine <pause dur="0.3"/> on the the adjacent group carbon rather than <pause dur="0.3"/> # an O-H <pause dur="0.2"/> and then we get rid of that by diazotization <pause dur="0.7"/> and you can see <pause dur="0.3"/> how <pause dur="0.2"/> one can use that <pause dur="0.2"/> particularly to form <pause dur="0.2"/> rings that wouldn't <pause dur="0.7"/> that are larger to form <pause dur="0.2"/> ring-expanded systems <pause dur="1.3"/> or <pause dur="0.9"/> ring-contracted systems <pause dur="0.7"/> depending on the precise conditions you use <pause dur="0.5"/> but you can change <pause dur="0.2"/> the ring size <pause dur="1.9"/> it's actually very useful to be able to form a <trunc>cyclo</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="1.0"/> heptanone <pause dur="0.6"/> or a # seven member ring <pause dur="0.3"/> it's a good it's a good skill to <trunc>le</trunc> to have in our armoury as <pause dur="0.3"/> as synthetic 
chemists <pause dur="0.8"/> okay so it's useful to be able to know <pause dur="0.3"/> that these types of reactions lead us to seven member rings <pause dur="0.8"/> albeit with some <pause dur="0.2"/> complications <pause dur="0.3"/> particularly with the <pause dur="0.3"/> the diazomethane <pause dur="0.8"/> the diazomethane is a <pause dur="0.2"/> is a good is a really good reagent 'cause you can buy it from Aldrich <pause dur="0.4"/> and so <pause dur="0.2"/> that means that you don't have to go through several steps <pause dur="0.3"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> it means that that that it much <pause dur="0.2"/> quicker than <pause dur="0.5"/> the <trunc>ste</trunc> the the the <trunc>a</trunc> the alternative methods i've shown you which <pause dur="0.2"/> require you to synthesize <pause dur="0.2"/> you know <pause dur="0.3"/> where does that come from <pause dur="1.1"/> well <pause dur="0.5"/> goodness only knows <pause dur="0.9"/> look at the look at the the <trunc>m</trunc> the the <pause dur="0.7"/> two steps you have to get to even to get to the amine <pause dur="0.3"/> in the <pause dur="0.3"/> first synthesis <pause dur="0.9"/> right <pause dur="0.3"/> so <pause dur="0.2"/> bit of a downer that you get a side product but you can convert the side product <pause dur="1.8"/> synthetic utility <pause dur="0.2"/> of <pause dur="0.3"/> semi-pinacol rearrangements <pause dur="0.3"/> and pinacol rearrangements <pause dur="0.6"/> it's <pause dur="0.3"/> particularly <pause dur="0.2"/> to my mind <pause dur="0.2"/> where you want to form larger rings <pause dur="0.9"/> okay <pause dur="1.0"/> right so <trunc>summarizi</trunc> i've summarize that as i <pause dur="0.4"/> always do after i've started the 
title of the next bit <pause dur="2.1"/> the Beckmann rearrangement <pause dur="1.6"/> like i say <pause dur="0.2"/> i <trunc>d</trunc> <pause dur="0.7"/> i don't like all these named reactions but <pause dur="0.7"/> it is <pause dur="0.5"/> helpful to have a title for a section <pause dur="0.3"/> and <pause dur="1.3"/> this is the rearrangement <pause dur="11.1"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="7"/> now to my ignorant <pause dur="0.4"/> <trunc>poi</trunc> # <pause dur="0.2"/> point of view <pause dur="0.5"/> the Beckmann rearrangement's the only <pause dur="0.2"/> sort of <pause dur="0.2"/> really big <trunc>rac</trunc> reaction of oximes <pause dur="0.3"/> of course <pause dur="0.4"/> in actual fact i will be <pause dur="0.2"/> hauled over the coals if i said that in <pause dur="0.2"/> the presence of <trunc>so</trunc> genuine synthetic chemists because they <pause dur="0.3"/> have all sorts of <pause dur="0.3"/> reactions and there's all sorts of chemistry of oximes that goes on <pause dur="0.3"/> but this is <pause dur="0.2"/> this is this is the biggie <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="6.3"/> perhaps i'm bias because this is the way that nylon is formed <pause dur="0.4"/> for example <pause dur="1.6"/> now <pause dur="0.2"/> what is the Beckmann rearrangement i'm just reminding myself <pause dur="0.5"/> ah yes <pause dur="12.8"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="13"/> an oxime <pause dur="1.4"/> there is an oxime <pause dur="0.2"/> now you can get an oxime <pause dur="0.2"/> from <pause dur="0.8"/> the reaction of a ketone <pause dur="0.2"/> with <pause dur="0.4"/> a <pause dur="3.4"/> <trunc>hydro</trunc> with <sic corr="hydroxylamine">hydroxyl xylamine</sic> <pause dur="1.6"/> ketone plus hydroxylamine <pause dur="0.2"/> goes to <pause dur="0.7"/> oxime <pause dur="0.4"/> so we have <pause dur="0.3"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="21"/> we would have our <pause dur="11.2"/> # <pause dur="11.2"/> 
normally we use hydroxylamine hydrochloride and buffer it with # <pause dur="0.2"/> sodium acetate <pause dur="0.8"/> just like your first year practical <pause dur="0.5"/> you remember <pause dur="0.7"/> the one that doesn't work <pause dur="0.8"/> well <pause dur="0.3"/> <shift feature="voice" new="laugh"/> no <vocal desc="laughter" n="sl" iterated="y" dur="1"/><shift feature="voice" new="normal"/><pause dur="0.9"/> but <pause dur="0.3"/> well perhaps there are more of them that <pause dur="0.4"/> don't work but the one where you make the semi-carbazone <pause dur="0.5"/> and you were adding in buckets of sodium acetate and buckets of <pause dur="0.4"/> # semi-carbazone hydrochloride it's <trunc>s</trunc> very similar <pause dur="1.2"/> so you buffer it with sodium acetate <pause dur="1.0"/> easy to produce oximes <pause dur="3.0"/> now <pause dur="0.9"/> if you've got an oxime with a specific stereochemistry <pause dur="0.4"/> then <pause dur="1.1"/> like that <pause dur="0.3"/> then that's that's quite important <pause dur="0.3"/> because <pause dur="0.3"/> in fact the stereochemistry will <pause dur="0.3"/> follow through in the process <pause dur="1.0"/> what happens now we protonate we go to <pause dur="8.9"/> <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="8"/> to that <pause dur="1.6"/> make that a good leaving group and that's going to fall off <pause dur="3.6"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="4"/> and as it falls off <pause dur="0.2"/> the group <pause dur="0.3"/> trans to the leaving group migrates <pause dur="34.9"/> <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="32"/> so we're left with that horrible intermediate <pause dur="0.2"/> which then picks up water <pause dur="6.9"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="7"/> 
or i should say picks up hydroxide from water <pause dur="7.6"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="6"/> to give us that <pause dur="1.1"/> which then <pause dur="0.2"/> tautomerizes <pause dur="21.8"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="18"/> so the net result is <pause dur="0.2"/> we've generated an amide <pause dur="2.6"/> from <pause dur="1.2"/> our <pause dur="7.8"/> from from our oxime <pause dur="20.1"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="6"/>  
right <pause dur="0.3"/> now <pause dur="0.3"/> pay attention <pause dur="1.2"/> the group trans to the leaving group migrates <pause dur="1.9"/> if you get some <pause dur="0.2"/> of a mixture of material <pause dur="0.2"/> which doesn't contain <pause dur="0.4"/> just one group migrating <pause dur="0.2"/> it means either you started off with something of mixed stereochemistry <pause dur="0.7"/> or <pause dur="0.3"/> the system <pause dur="0.2"/> has <pause dur="0.2"/> somehow <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> isomerized <pause dur="0.2"/> in situ <pause dur="2.3"/> now this one <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="14"/> for example <pause dur="0.9"/> let's show you what i mean <pause dur="10.8"/> oh sorry what am i doing <pause dur="0.8"/> C <pause dur="0.6"/> <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="8"/> <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 word"/> <pause dur="7.5"/> you get exclusively the phenyl group migrating <pause dur="3.9"/> but <pause dur="0.4"/> certainly <pause dur="0.2"/> there are <pause dur="0.6"/> there is some evidence to suggest <pause dur="0.4"/> that <pause dur="40.5"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="40"/> you <trunc>w</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> you might you get a trace of that <pause dur="1.0"/> where both groups are aliphatic particularly according to <pause dur="0.4"/> # March <pause dur="1.4"/> March being a particularly useful <pause dur="0.3"/> textbook for <pause dur="0.3"/> sort 
of detailed synthetic information <pause dur="1.0"/> so <pause dur="0.8"/> there but what's happening there well it's not possible that that <pause dur="0.6"/> that group can migrate it's not trans <pause dur="0.3"/> what happens is <pause dur="0.2"/> that you get <pause dur="2.0"/> <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="3"/> H-plus <pause dur="0.2"/> and you can hydrolize the oxime <pause dur="0.3"/> back to the ketone and the hydroxylamine <pause dur="0.9"/> and then <pause dur="0.2"/> you <pause dur="0.6"/> reform it <pause dur="27.3"/> <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="22"/> you reform it as the other isomer <pause dur="0.2"/> in actual fact you don't need to even go that far <pause dur="2.2"/> you don't need to go that far as soon as you protonate it then you you you <trunc>y</trunc> <trunc>y</trunc> if you protonate across here <pause dur="0.4"/> then you've got the option of the bond rotating <pause dur="0.2"/> of course <pause dur="0.2"/> but you're aware <pause dur="0.2"/> because you did this practical in the first year <pause dur="0.2"/> of the danger of adding H-plus <pause dur="0.4"/> to <pause dur="0.6"/> these sorts of <trunc>derivati</trunc> derivatives <pause dur="0.7"/> because <pause dur="0.2"/> they are it is a reversible reaction <pause dur="0.7"/> and i guess <pause dur="0.3"/> here <pause dur="0.4"/> the <pause dur="1.8"/> the exception to the rule <pause dur="0.2"/> is only because <pause dur="0.2"/> somehow you're getting some isomerization in the presence of the acid <pause dur="3.8"/> but <pause dur="0.4"/> on the whole <pause dur="1.7"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="1"/> the trans migration is a <pause dur="0.2"/> is a golden 
rule <pause dur="0.9"/> so we can we can we can stick to that <pause dur="0.4"/> now <pause dur="11.4"/> you could do you could do other things <pause dur="0.2"/> for example you can use <pause dur="13.2"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="17"/> <trunc>s</trunc> sorry P-C-L-five <pause dur="2.8"/> you use P-C-L-five <pause dur="0.2"/> in which case <pause dur="0.2"/> you get <pause dur="0.6"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="12"/> one of these inorganic <pause dur="10.8"/> you get that which is a really <pause dur="0.3"/> whizzo leaving group as it were <pause dur="0.2"/> because of course it's going to form the phosphorous-oxygen double bond <pause dur="1.4"/> or you can <pause dur="0.2"/> make <pause dur="0.2"/> the tosylate <pause dur="3.4"/> or you can use <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="32"/> boron trifluoride <pause dur="43.3"/> <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="11"/> <trunc>perit</trunc> <trunc>t</trunc> # toluene <trunc>sulf</trunc> sulfinyl chloride <pause dur="1.3"/> forms a tosylate which also is a good leaving group as you remember <pause dur="0.4"/> the S-O-three-minus <pause dur="0.2"/> because <pause dur="0.2"/> para-toluenesulfonic acid <pause dur="0.2"/> is extremely acidic <pause dur="1.1"/> now the last point i wanted to <pause dur="0.6"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="3"/> make on the # <pause dur="8.3"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="7"/> sorry on the Beckmann rearrangement is <pause dur="0.2"/> nylon <pause dur="37.6"/> <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="37"/> right <pause dur="1.5"/> epsilon caprolactam <pause dur="0.5"/> seven member ring <pause dur="1.3"/> formed <pause dur="0.2"/> from this oxime <pause dur="0.2"/> the oxime is of course
