things that could happen to it </u><pause dur="2.4"/> <u who="sf0888" trans="pause"> could get scattered or absorbed </u><pause dur="0.5"/> <u who="nm0885" trans="pause"> right it can get scattered <pause dur="0.4"/> or absorbed <pause dur="2.3"/> okay <pause dur="0.3"/> and so now the amount we worked out depends on a couple of different things <pause dur="0.3"/> okay some of them are pretty obvious <pause dur="0.3"/> <trunc>y</trunc> # you lose more if you have more going in <pause dur="0.4"/> so it depends on the amount of radiance that's incident on our <pause dur="0.2"/> little slab of atmosphere <pause dur="0.7"/> it depends on <pause dur="0.9"/> something called K <pause dur="0.6"/> what <pause dur="0.3"/> does K tell us about </u><pause dur="8.6"/> <u who="sf0889" trans="pause"> <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> </u><pause dur="1.1"/> <u who="nm0885" trans="pause"> # <pause dur="1.0"/> scattering is one of the things that go that <trunc>g</trunc> that goes into it </u><pause dur="2.0"/> <u who="sf0890" trans="pause"> # is it the extinction coefficient </u><pause dur="0.3"/> <u who="nm0885" trans="pause"> yeah it it's it's the extinction coefficient which is the sum of the scattering coefficient plus the absorption coefficient <pause dur="1.0"/> okay <pause dur="0.2"/> and so what it's telling us about is it's telling us about the characteristics of the material <pause dur="0.3"/> is this material an effective scatterer or an effective absorber <pause dur="0.3"/> and we'll be getting into later on in the course what it is actually that makes the material a good scatterer or absorber <pause dur="0.5"/> and then it depends on <pause dur="0.4"/> rho-secant-theta-D-Z what's that <pause dur="0.6"/> that's the easy one </u><pause dur="3.8"/> <u who="sf0891" trans="pause"> pathlength </u><pause dur="0.7"/> <u who="nm0885" trans="pause"> 
pardon </u><pause dur="0.2"/> <u who="sf0891" trans="pause"> pathlength <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> </u><pause dur="0.4"/> <u who="nm0885" trans="pause"> yep this one's the pathlength why do we have a rho in there </u><pause dur="1.4"/> <u who="sf0892" trans="pause"> <gap reason="inaudible" extent="2 secs"/></u><pause dur="0.4"/> <u who="nm0885" trans="pause"> yeah it's the density of the material that's doing the interaction <pause dur="0.5"/> so <pause dur="0.2"/> if your total this thing up pathlength times the density that's the amount of material <pause dur="0.3"/> per unit area <pause dur="1.7"/><vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.8"/> okay <pause dur="0.4"/> so that's for <pause dur="0.3"/> a very thin slab <pause dur="0.3"/> and that means and because it's a very thin slab we can say well things like density <pause dur="0.4"/> the amount of material <pause dur="0.3"/> extinction coefficents all all of these things don't vary much as you go across the slab <pause dur="0.4"/> i mean in principle <pause dur="0.3"/> they can vary <pause dur="0.3"/> so <pause dur="2.1"/> if we have <pause dur="0.8"/> a <pause dur="0.2"/> finite <pause dur="3.0"/> slab of material <pause dur="2.8"/> if you have a finite slab of material <pause dur="0.4"/> so <pause dur="0.2"/> instead of just <pause dur="0.3"/> a thin layer <pause dur="1.2"/> D-Z here <pause dur="0.3"/> we've actually got <pause dur="0.3"/> a thick layer <pause dur="0.4"/> which <pause dur="0.3"/> ranges between <pause dur="0.9"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> you know <pause dur="0.5"/> a finite slab of material <pause dur="1.4"/> from Z-one <pause dur="1.0"/> to Z-two <pause dur="0.8"/> so we've got <pause dur="0.7"/> two heights involved and so if we say Z-one is the top where it's entering and Z-two is the bottom <pause dur="0.5"/> where it's going out <pause dur="1.1"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/><vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.2"/> we can integrate <pause dur="0.3"/> this expression <pause dur="0.2"/> to add up <pause dur="0.7"/> the changes in the # add up the amount of depletion in 
all the different layers <pause dur="0.4"/> and give us the amount coming out the bottom <pause dur="0.3"/> so if we've got an initial radiance L-nought-sub-nu <pause dur="1.3"/> in our direction here <pause dur="0.7"/> passes through the slab <pause dur="0.7"/> then <pause dur="2.2"/> what comes out <pause dur="0.5"/> is <pause dur="1.3"/> at the bottom is something less <pause dur="0.4"/> and i'll call that L with a superscript-<pause dur="0.4"/>D <pause dur="0.5"/> so that's # the depleted beam so it's lost some stuff <pause dur="0.7"/> and that's L-nu and it's <pause dur="0.2"/> of course <pause dur="0.4"/> coming out in the same direction <pause dur="0.2"/> theta-phi <pause dur="1.8"/> okay <pause dur="0.7"/> so <pause dur="0.4"/> if we have a finite slab of material from Z-one to Z-two <pause dur="0.5"/> we <pause dur="0.6"/> can <pause dur="0.8"/> integrate <pause dur="2.9"/> this <pause dur="1.1"/> expression <pause dur="2.2"/> # <pause dur="3.8"/> to give <pause dur="1.1"/> <unclear>D</unclear> <pause dur="1.2"/> direct <pause dur="2.7"/> <trunc>compo</trunc> <pause dur="2.4"/> of the <pause dur="0.2"/> emerging <pause dur="1.9"/> beam <pause dur="2.3"/> 'cause remember the emerging beam is also going to have contributions from emission <pause dur="0.3"/> and contributions from scattered stuff which we're going to have to work on a little bit later <pause dur="0.6"/> but # <pause dur="0.4"/> but the direct part of it <pause dur="1.3"/> L-D <pause dur="0.5"/> and actually yeah i <trunc>m</trunc> i made a mistake that D stands for direct <pause dur="4.2"/> we can get that by doing the integral <pause dur="0.6"/> so <pause dur="0.3"/> what we do <pause dur="0.3"/> is we <pause dur="0.5"/> take this expression <pause dur="0.6"/> and # <pause dur="0.7"/> you notice we've got <pause dur="0.3"/> L-nu on both sides so we'll take this one over to 
the other side <pause dur="0.4"/> so we'll write this as D-L-nu over L-nu <pause dur="0.6"/> and that's <pause dur="0.4"/> excuse me going to be equal to <pause dur="0.4"/> minus-<pause dur="1.5"/>K-<pause dur="0.2"/>nu-E-<pause dur="1.0"/>rho-secant-<pause dur="0.2"/>theta-D-Z <pause dur="0.9"/> okay now we integrate this <pause dur="0.4"/> across <pause dur="1.7"/> the layer <pause dur="2.7"/> # <pause dur="1.0"/> so <pause dur="0.2"/> integral signs on both sides we're now going to sum up those layers <pause dur="0.7"/> so <pause dur="0.3"/> the integral on the right hand side we're integrating <pause dur="0.3"/> with respect to Z <pause dur="0.3"/> so we're integrating in height what are the limits of integration <pause dur="2.2"/> what's the bottom one </u><pause dur="0.5"/> <u who="sf0894" trans="pause"> <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> </u><pause dur="0.9"/> <u who="nm0885" trans="pause"> pardon </u><pause dur="0.6"/> <u who="sf0894" trans="pause"> <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/></u><pause dur="0.2"/> <u who="nm0885" trans="pause"> Z-one <pause dur="0.2"/> that's right <pause dur="0.8"/> it's where the stuff's going in <pause dur="0.3"/> and it goes up to Z-two where the stuff's coming out <pause dur="0.4"/> now on the left hand side <pause dur="0.3"/> we're integrating over radiance <pause dur="0.4"/> D-L-nu <pause dur="0.4"/> so what's the starting radiance where we start the integration </u><pause dur="0.9"/> <u who="sm0895" trans="pause"> L-nought-sub-nu </u><pause dur="0.2"/> <u who="nm0885" trans="pause"> yeah <pause dur="0.2"/> L-nought-<pause dur="0.5"/>sub-nu <pause dur="0.4"/> and finishing up at L-D-<pause dur="0.2"/>sub-nu <pause dur="0.7"/> so <pause dur="0.9"/> that's our integral <pause dur="0.5"/> it's now a matter of doing it <pause dur="0.7"/> now <pause dur="0.9"/> left hand side <pause dur="0.6"/> is <pause dur="0.5"/> pretty simple what's the integral of D-L-over-L </u><pause dur="1.5"/> 
<u who="sf0896" trans="pause"> <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/></u> <pause dur="0.4"/> <u who="nm0885" trans="pause"> right log-L <pause dur="1.0"/> so <pause dur="0.3"/> on this side we get <pause dur="0.8"/> log <pause dur="0.3"/> of L-nu <pause dur="1.7"/> and you're <pause dur="0.2"/> ranging from L-nought to L-D-<pause dur="0.4"/>sub-nu <pause dur="0.3"/> and on this side <pause dur="1.0"/> # what do we get there <pause dur="6.6"/> this is a trick question so have a guess at it and <trunc>y</trunc> and <trunc>y</trunc> and you'll be wrong but but you won't be have to be embarrassed because it's <pause dur="0.3"/> it's a trick question </u><pause dur="4.0"/> <u who="sf0896" trans="pause"> Z </u><pause dur="1.7"/> <u who="nm0885" trans="pause"> pardon </u><u who="sf0896" trans="latching"> # <pause dur="0.3"/> Z times all that </u><pause dur="1.6"/> <u who="nm0885" trans="pause"> Z times <pause dur="0.2"/> that stuff okay <pause dur="0.2"/> and that <pause dur="0.2"/> is indeed the wrong answer <pause dur="0.4"/> and <vocal desc="laugh" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.3"/> the <trunc>r</trunc> <trunc>r</trunc> <pause dur="0.7"/> but it's exactly what i was hoping you'd say <pause dur="0.4"/> because that would be true <pause dur="0.3"/> if all this stuff was constant <pause dur="0.4"/> then you could just pull it out of the integral sign <pause dur="0.5"/> but <pause dur="0.4"/> these properties may well the secant-theta shouldn't vary <pause dur="0.8"/> but the other stuff <pause dur="0.3"/> might potentially vary as you go through the layer and certainly you know if you imagine a beam of sunlight going down through the atmosphere <pause dur="0.4"/> # the density of just about everything <pause dur="0.2"/> is going to be increasing as as you go down to the surface <pause dur="0.5"/> and probably the only significant thing where that's not really true <pause dur="0.4"/> is 
going to be something like ozone where it's really varying wildly <pause dur="0.4"/> or clouds or something <pause dur="0.3"/> so we can't do much <pause dur="0.2"/> with that side <pause dur="0.3"/> so what i'm going to do is i'm just going to leave that side as <pause dur="0.2"/> an integral <pause dur="2.0"/> from Z-one to Z-two K-nu-E-rho-secant-<pause dur="0.5"/>theta-<pause dur="1.1"/>D-Z <pause dur="1.0"/> and # <pause dur="1.6"/> i'm going <pause dur="0.6"/> to give it <pause dur="0.3"/> a name <pause dur="2.9"/> and the name is going to be <pause dur="0.6"/> optical thickness or optical depth <pause dur="0.3"/> so i'm going to write that as minus-<pause dur="0.7"/>delta lower case delta <pause dur="0.5"/> and the # and we'd better put a subscript-nu on that <pause dur="0.3"/> because this is going to be a function of frequency <pause dur="3.3"/> so <pause dur="1.2"/> where <pause dur="0.8"/> delta-nu <pause dur="0.2"/> is equal <pause dur="0.5"/> by definition to this integral Z-one to Z-two <pause dur="0.7"/> extinction coefficient <pause dur="0.2"/> times density times <pause dur="0.8"/> pathlength <pause dur="0.5"/> secant-theta-D-Z <pause dur="1.1"/> is the <pause dur="1.2"/> optical <pause dur="2.1"/> thickness <pause dur="1.6"/> or <pause dur="1.5"/> optical depth <pause dur="3.0"/> these two terms mean the same thing and <pause dur="0.4"/> people will tend to use them <trunc>in</trunc> interchangeably <pause dur="1.5"/><vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.6"/> so what that is is that's a <trunc>m</trunc> <pause dur="0.4"/> is that's going to be some measure <pause dur="0.4"/> of how much <pause dur="0.2"/> stuff is getting pulled out of the beamer or what or what fraction of it <pause dur="1.0"/> and if we define the optical depth this way <pause dur="1.5"/> then <pause dur="0.3"/> 
we can say that <pause dur="0.3"/> our <pause dur="1.7"/> direct beam <pause dur="0.3"/> L-D-of-nu <pause dur="0.4"/> is going to be equal to <pause dur="1.3"/> the initial beam times <pause dur="0.5"/> E-to-the-minus-<pause dur="0.3"/>delta-nu <pause dur="3.5"/> just rearranging that equation <pause dur="3.6"/> and this <pause dur="0.2"/> is a very important relationship i mean in some sense in in the theory of radiative transfer this was the first <pause dur="0.4"/> really quantitative law <pause dur="0.3"/> that was discovered <pause dur="0.7"/> and # <pause dur="1.4"/> and so it's named after its <pause dur="0.2"/> discoverer <pause dur="0.9"/> not what he was drinking at the time <pause dur="0.4"/> Beer's law <pause dur="1.4"/> # you will also find <pause dur="0.3"/> this is sometimes called <pause dur="1.3"/> Lambert's law <pause dur="2.6"/> and it is also sometimes called <pause dur="3.0"/> Bouguer's law <pause dur="2.6"/> and sometimes it's called the Beer-Lambert law and sometimes it's called the Lambert-Bouguer law and sometimes it's called the Beer-Lambert-Bouguer law <pause dur="0.3"/> or whatever <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> i think it <pause dur="0.2"/> probably has to do with which nation you are and which nationality this person <pause dur="0.8"/> these people are <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="1.5"/> 'cause this 'cause this relationship was probably discovered independently several times <pause dur="0.5"/> we're going to call it Beer's law <pause dur="0.5"/> in this course just for simplicity <pause dur="1.3"/> okay <pause dur="0.2"/> and so what it says is that the 
amount of radiation that's coming through directly <pause dur="0.4"/> is # <pause dur="0.4"/> decreasing exponentially <pause dur="0.7"/> in <pause dur="0.5"/> the optical <pause dur="0.2"/> thickness <pause dur="0.3"/> so the fraction of energy <pause dur="5.0"/> the fraction of <pause dur="1.2"/> well radiance <pause dur="3.5"/> that <pause dur="0.8"/> emerges <pause dur="1.3"/> is <pause dur="1.8"/> given <pause dur="0.4"/> by <pause dur="0.6"/> the <pause dur="1.6"/> monochromatic <pause dur="1.6"/> transmittance <pause dur="4.2"/> and it's monochromatic because we're always doing this as a function of wave number <pause dur="0.2"/> or or sorry as a function of <pause dur="0.5"/> # frequency but we can always add up over frequency <pause dur="0.4"/> and that is defined as <pause dur="0.2"/> tau <pause dur="1.5"/> lower case Greek letter tau <pause dur="0.6"/> and that by definition is going to be the amount that's coming out the bottom L-D <pause dur="0.3"/> divided by the amount that's going in the top L-nu <pause dur="0.6"/> and you can see immediately <pause dur="0.2"/> that that's directly related to the optical depth <pause dur="0.9"/> E-to-the-minus-delta-nu <pause dur="3.4"/> so there's a couple of different ways that we can think about how much is going through we can think about a transmittance <pause dur="0.4"/> <trunc>wh</trunc> so you may have a transmittance of point-five <pause dur="0.3"/> which says half the stuff gets through <pause dur="0.6"/> # you may have an optical depth here <pause dur="0.4"/> and the <pause dur="0.2"/> thing about the optical depth is that's going 
to be directly proportional <pause dur="0.4"/> to things like pathlength and density and so on so if you double the density you double the optical depth <pause dur="2.5"/> and # <pause dur="1.6"/> yeah so that that's that's the amount <pause dur="0.8"/> that gets through <pause dur="0.6"/> okay so that's transmittance but of course remember <pause dur="0.3"/> there are two other things <pause dur="0.3"/> two other ways that energy is coming out the bottom of the slab <pause dur="0.5"/>

Kirchoff <pause dur="0.8"/> and you're really clever <pause dur="1.8"/> or you might be really clever but if your name isn't Kirchoff they still won't name the law after you <pause dur="0.7"/><vocal desc="laugh" iterated="n"/> </u><pause dur="6.4"/> <u who="sf0907" trans="pause"> is it because good emitters are good <trunc>abs</trunc> good absorbers </u><pause dur="0.6"/> <u who="nm0885" trans="pause"> that's <pause dur="0.2"/> exactly right <pause dur="0.7"/> and that that's Kirchoff's law <pause dur="0.3"/> and what Kirchoff's law says and this is what what you have to <trunc>wor</trunc> work your way through in a physics course <pause dur="0.5"/> is <pause dur="0.2"/> Kirchoff's law <pause dur="0.2"/> says <pause dur="0.3"/> that if you're in thermodynamic <pause dur="0.2"/> if you're in a local thermodynamic equilibrium <pause dur="0.6"/> then <pause dur="0.7"/> a property must be equally good at absorbing and emitting <pause dur="0.5"/> and the reason for that is if you're in thermodynamic equilibrium <pause dur="0.5"/> you're # you've got to be at the same temperature <pause dur="0.7"/> in in different parts that are that are close together <pause dur="0.9"/> and if you're at <pause dur="0.5"/> and if you're at the same temperature <pause dur="0.4"/> but <pause dur="0.5"/> one part of <trunc>th</trunc> <trunc>th</trunc> <trunc>b</trunc> but your substance is a good emitter <pause dur="0.7"/> # but a very bad <pause dur="0.4"/> absorber <pause dur="0.2"/> or something like that then what that means <pause dur="0.2"/> is that you'll end up with a flux of energy going from one part to the other <pause dur="0.5"/> and one part of your substance will try and 
heat up relative to the other <pause dur="0.5"/> and that's a contradiction with the thermodynamic equilibrium <pause dur="0.6"/> so <pause dur="0.2"/> if you're going to have an equilibrium and have nearby stuff at the same temperature <pause dur="0.2"/> you've got to be equally good at absorbing and emitting <pause dur="0.4"/> so that there's no net flow of energy from one place to another by radiation <pause dur="0.8"/> so <pause dur="0.8"/> anyway i mean <trunc>th</trunc> that that kind of detail doesn't matter <pause dur="0.4"/> but <pause dur="1.0"/> what matters for our purposes is <pause dur="0.3"/> is that for any part of the atmosphere that we're interested in and this means not the <pause dur="0.6"/> the far outer thermosphere or whatever <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> we're in thermodynamic equilibrium at least locally <pause dur="0.5"/> and <pause dur="0.6"/> the <pause dur="0.3"/> absorption coefficient and the emission coefficient <pause dur="0.2"/> are going to be <pause dur="0.4"/> the same <pause dur="0.2"/> thing <pause dur="1.3"/> so # <pause dur="2.7"/> K-A-of-nu <pause dur="1.2"/> # <pause dur="2.5"/> well gives <pause dur="1.2"/> the <pause dur="1.3"/> emission <pause dur="1.1"/> properties <pause dur="4.1"/> of the material <pause dur="1.8"/> for <pause dur="1.9"/> substances <pause dur="2.1"/> in <pause dur="2.5"/> thermodynamic <pause dur="1.5"/> equilibrium <pause dur="4.1"/> and i'll just put in brackets here that this is # Kirchoff's law <pause dur="8.6"/> so <pause dur="0.2"/> it's the same for absorption <pause dur="0.6"/> so K is the same for absorption and emission <pause dur="0.9"/> okay <pause dur="0.2"/> final bit we need is the amount of

scattered bit <pause dur="1.1"/> so <pause dur="0.3"/> our next <pause dur="0.4"/> thing to talk about here <pause dur="0.4"/> is <pause dur="0.4"/> radiation <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="2.7"/> scattered <pause dur="1.3"/> in <pause dur="0.7"/> from <pause dur="1.0"/> other <pause dur="0.3"/> directions <pause dur="10.6"/> so if we're sitting below our slab <pause dur="1.5"/> here <pause dur="0.4"/> and we're observing <pause dur="0.5"/> a scattered radiance L-S-of-nu which is coming out in that direction <pause dur="0.6"/> # that radiance could be getting into that direction <pause dur="0.5"/> from <pause dur="0.4"/> anywhere else <pause dur="0.3"/> and it could be coming from above the slab it could be coming from below the slab <pause dur="0.4"/> or whatever <pause dur="1.0"/> 
so there could be a contribution <pause dur="0.3"/> to this scattered irradiance <pause dur="0.3"/> coming from <pause dur="0.6"/> any direction so <pause dur="1.8"/> by the way is this pen fading out too much can you still read it <pause dur="1.2"/> okay give <trunc>m</trunc> give me a <trunc>sh</trunc> give me a shout if it's if it's getting bad <pause dur="0.6"/> so <pause dur="0.9"/> radiance <pause dur="2.4"/> can be <pause dur="0.8"/> scattered <pause dur="1.9"/> can be scattered <pause dur="1.9"/> into <pause dur="2.2"/> direction <pause dur="1.7"/> theta-phi <pause dur="2.1"/> from <pause dur="0.9"/> any <pause dur="1.1"/> other <pause dur="0.4"/> direction <pause dur="2.6"/> and so we'll write an arbitrary other <pause dur="0.5"/> direction <pause dur="0.5"/> as <pause dur="0.3"/> a # <pause dur="1.6"/> as a <pause dur="0.8"/> theta-primed-<pause dur="0.4"/>phi-primed <pause dur="0.8"/> so from any direction theta-prime-phi-prime <pause dur="0.5"/> the energy could potentially <pause dur="0.4"/> be scattered in into the direction that we're interested in <pause dur="15.8"/> so <pause dur="0.5"/> what's the scattered energy <pause dur="0.3"/> going to

so <pause dur="0.9"/> some radiance <pause dur="0.3"/> comes from or or is initially travelling in in direction <pause dur="1.1"/> omega-prime <pause dur="0.6"/> then <pause dur="1.1"/> in this certain pathlength and given this certain nature of material it turns out that it <pause dur="0.8"/> interacts with one of the particles there <pause dur="0.3"/> now it could in principle get sent off in any direction <pause dur="0.5"/> but the proportion that gets sent off <pause dur="0.3"/> in the direction that we're interested in <pause dur="0.4"/> omega <pause dur="0.7"/> omega <pause dur="0.4"/> is given by the phase function <pause dur="1.7"/> so the phase function says whichever angle you come from <pause dur="0.3"/> what are the odds that you're going to get scattered into the direction that we want <pause dur="2.5"/> and # again <pause dur="0.3"/> when we get on to talking about scattering in more detail <pause dur="0.3"/> we're going to have to think about what this phase function looks like so what direction does <pause dur="0.4"/> the radiance get scattered <pause dur="3.3"/> okay so # <pause dur="2.2"/> what this means then now <pause dur="0.3"/> is that if we want to get <pause dur="0.4"/> the radiance <pause dur="2.3"/> which is scattered into our direction omega <pause dur="0.4"/> what we're going to need to do <pause dur="0.3"/> is we're going to need to integrate <pause dur="0.3"/> over this phase function 'cause we're going to need to 
add up the contributions <pause dur="0.3"/> from all the different possible directions <pause dur="0.7"/> that get bounced into our direction <pause dur="1.0"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> i'm fed up with this pen so i'm going to <pause dur="1.5"/><event desc="puts pen in bin" iterated="n"/> throw it away <pause dur="4.6"/> lovely <pause dur="0.7"/> okay <pause dur="1.5"/> so # <pause dur="0.9"/> so <pause dur="2.6"/> we must integrate <pause dur="3.3"/> over <pause dur="0.9"/> all <pause dur="0.5"/> incident <pause dur="1.4"/> directions <pause dur="3.2"/> omega-prime <pause dur="1.2"/> to <pause dur="2.3"/> to get <pause dur="0.6"/> the <pause dur="1.3"/> total <pause dur="2.1"/> emerging <pause dur="2.3"/> radiance <pause dur="3.1"/> in direction <pause dur="1.5"/> omega <pause dur="4.0"/> so <pause dur="0.5"/> what does this mean well <pause dur="0.5"/> what this means is if we want to write <pause dur="0.6"/> our <pause dur="0.4"/> scattered radiance <pause dur="0.4"/> so L-superscript-capital-S-<pause dur="0.5"/>sub-nu <pause dur="0.8"/> and # <pause dur="1.1"/> forgot here let's <pause dur="1.0"/> in the direction <pause dur="0.2"/> omega <pause dur="1.1"/> we can now <pause dur="1.8"/> write this <pause dur="0.7"/> as # <pause dur="3.6"/> what are we going to have well we've got to <pause dur="0.2"/> get in <pause dur="0.4"/> all our <pause dur="0.8"/> little bits of stuff here <pause dur="0.4"/> it's going to be in terms of the # <pause dur="3.0"/> of the <pause dur="1.7"/> well let's <trunc>ca</trunc> let's write it as the mass scattering coefficient <pause dur="0.4"/> so i could also write this as <pause dur="0.2"/> omega-nu times the extinction coefficient <pause dur="0.5"/> 
let's write it as as the scattering coefficient <pause dur="0.7"/> then <pause dur="0.5"/> an integral <pause dur="1.0"/> over all possible directions <pause dur="0.6"/> of # <pause dur="6.0"/> of the <pause dur="0.6"/> incident radiance <pause dur="0.2"/> in that direction <pause dur="0.9"/> so <pause dur="0.4"/> L-nu-<pause dur="1.2"/>omega-prime <pause dur="1.5"/> and # <pause dur="2.9"/> the <pause dur="1.5"/> multiply by <pause dur="0.3"/> the phase function <pause dur="1.0"/> which is the <pause dur="0.3"/> probability <pause dur="0.6"/> that # <pause dur="0.5"/> you're going to go from <pause dur="0.3"/> omega-prime <pause dur="0.4"/> into direction <pause dur="0.2"/> omega <pause dur="5.9"/> and let me <pause dur="0.3"/> clear a little bit more space here <pause dur="2.5"/> then we're going to need to write <pause dur="0.6"/> the # <pause dur="0.4"/> pathlength <pause dur="0.7"/> which is part of the probability that you're going to get scattered <pause dur="0.4"/> at all <pause dur="0.3"/> so we've got a rho-secant-theta-<pause dur="2.8"/>D-Z <pause dur="4.0"/> and # <pause dur="1.2"/> and then we're going to need to integrate over <pause dur="0.3"/> all directions <pause dur="0.2"/> omega-prime <pause dur="0.7"/> and actually i mean it's a <trunc>f</trunc> a few things like like the D-Z we can take out of that integral <pause dur="0.3"/> but the <trunc>pa</trunc> but the the <trunc>s</trunc> the secant-theta part you know the pathlength is going to depend on which direction <pause dur="0.4"/> the radiance comes in <pause dur="1.1"/> because if something's coming in at a different angle it's going to 
have a different probability of getting scattered if it's coming in at a low angle <pause dur="0.4"/> it's going to get scattered <pause dur="0.7"/> much more <pause dur="1.8"/> so <pause dur="0.8"/> what we'll do is we'll integrate this <pause dur="0.3"/> over <pause dur="1.9"/> the whole sphere <pause dur="2.1"/> and that means we'll need to divide out <pause dur="0.6"/> four-pi <pause dur="0.4"/> we're integrating over the whole sphere all possible directions because radiation can <pause dur="0.3"/> can get into the slab from above and below <pause dur="0.6"/> why are we dividing out four-pi <pause dur="12.2"/> in the context of solid angle and sphere what does four-pi represent </u><pause dur="0.6"/> <u who="sf0915" trans="pause"> whole </u><pause dur="1.1"/> <u who="nm0885" trans="pause"> yeah four-pi is is the <trunc>ra</trunc> is is the solid angle <pause dur="0.2"/> of the whole sphere <pause dur="0.3"/> so we're adding up contributions from all of this <pause dur="0.3"/> and then we're dividing out the total solid angle <pause dur="0.6"/> so 'cause remember <pause dur="0.2"/> radiance is in units of per steradian <pause dur="0.4"/> so we want to keep it as per steradian <pause dur="1.7"/> okay <pause dur="0.8"/> so <pause dur="0.9"/> with that <pause dur="0.6"/> hideous mess <pause dur="0.5"/> we now have <pause dur="0.4"/> all the contributions <pause dur="0.4"/> to <pause dur="0.7"/> the # <pause dur="0.5"/> to the radiance <pause dur="0.6"/> so <pause dur="2.3"/> the radiance <pause dur="3.5"/> emerging <pause dur="2.6"/> from a slab <pause dur="1.3"/> is then going to be <pause dur="1.9"/> what is it going to be it's going to be <pause dur="1.0"/> L-nu <pause dur="1.2"/> in some direction <pause dur="1.5"/> theta-phi <pause dur="0.2"/> and it's going to be 
the the sum <pause dur="0.4"/> of all these bits <pause dur="0.4"/> that we've put together <pause dur="0.4"/> so it's going to be a sum of the <pause dur="0.4"/> direct beam <pause dur="0.2"/> L-D-nu-<pause dur="0.2"/>theta-phi <pause dur="0.9"/> plus <pause dur="0.4"/> the # <pause dur="1.3"/> emitted <pause dur="0.2"/> that's right <pause dur="0.2"/> L-E-nu <pause dur="0.7"/> again what's emitted in our direction theta-phi although <pause dur="0.6"/> emission of course is going to be <pause dur="0.8"/> isotropic <pause dur="0.8"/> and it's going to be <pause dur="2.9"/> added to the scattering <pause dur="0.7"/> L-S <pause dur="0.6"/> of theta-phi <pause dur="0.7"/> so <pause dur="1.6"/> our <pause dur="0.7"/> emission at the bottom of of the slab <pause dur="0.4"/> is # <pause dur="0.4"/> is given by these three terms <pause dur="0.4"/> but remember <pause dur="0.6"/> as as we were mentioning in the last lecture <pause dur="0.3"/> these terms are not <pause dur="0.2"/> all <pause dur="0.4"/> always important <pause dur="0.3"/> at certain wavelengths <pause dur="0.4"/> the radiation is going to be <pause dur="0.3"/> dominated by # <pause dur="0.3"/> by different <pause dur="0.4"/> parts <pause dur="0.4"/> of this for example with solar radiation <pause dur="0.5"/> coming into a <trunc>fra</trunc> solar wavelengths <pause dur="0.3"/> the emission by the atmosphere is going to be negligible the atmosphere's just too cold <pause dur="0.5"/> to emit <pause dur="0.4"/> those high energy photons <pause dur="0.6"/> but on the other hand scattering is going to be <pause dur="0.2"/> pretty important <pause dur="1.1"/> and # <pause dur="0.4"/> and of course there will be some depletion of the direct beam as well <pause dur="1.7"/> okay <pause dur="5.4"/> so that's kind of cool <pause dur="0.2"/> that basically <pause dur="0.4"/> 
covers the # <pause dur="0.4"/> definition <pause dur="0.2"/> section <pause dur="0.3"/> of the course we now know what we're talking about <pause dur="0.8"/> now for the rest of the course <pause dur="0.2"/> we can talk about it <pause dur="0.4"/> so what we're going to do during the rest of the course <pause dur="0.3"/> is # <pause dur="0.9"/> it's going to be divided into <pause dur="0.4"/> two <pause dur="0.4"/> big chunks <pause dur="0.3"/> okay <pause dur="0.3"/> first big chunk <pause dur="0.3"/> is we're going to do <pause dur="0.3"/> scattering <pause dur="0.9"/> and we're going to look at scattering in quite a bit of detail <pause dur="0.2"/> we're going to look at what it is in the atmosphere that does the scattering <pause dur="0.4"/> how those properties determine what the scattering does <pause dur="0.5"/> and then <pause dur="0.3"/> if you actually look up in the sky <pause dur="0.3"/> how does <pause dur="0.2"/> that knowledge of scattering actually explain the stuff <pause dur="0.3"/> that we see <pause dur="0.4"/> so we're going to do fairly obvious <pause dur="0.2"/> or <pause dur="0.8"/> reasonably obvious things like why is the sky blue <pause dur="0.4"/> why is the # <pause dur="1.0"/> why is the # well why why do rainbows form <pause dur="0.4"/> we're going to get into slightly more subtle things like why do photographers always use polarizing filters when they want to look <pause dur="0.3"/> want to photograph clouds <pause dur="0.5"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> a few other things like that <pause dur="1.0"/> and then after that we're going 
to do <pause dur="0.4"/> emission and absorption and remember emission and absorption are actually sort of two sides of the same coin so we're going to do <pause dur="0.3"/> that part together <pause dur="0.2"/> and that means the direct beam <pause dur="0.3"/> that depletion bit <pause dur="0.4"/> and the emission bit <pause dur="0.2"/> we're going to handle them together <pause dur="0.5"/> and # and there we're going to get into a little bit of the properties of the particles <pause dur="0.3"/> so we're going to get into <pause dur="0.3"/> a little bit of quantum mechanics we're not going to do it in <trunc>an</trunc> in any sort of great detail <pause dur="0.2"/> but just enough that we can see why <pause dur="0.3"/> some particles are better at certain things than some other particles <pause dur="0.5"/> and # and then we're going to get <pause dur="0.2"/> into at the end <pause dur="0.4"/> how you actually do these calculations <pause dur="0.3"/> if you happen to be interested in weather or climate or something <pause dur="0.3"/> and you want to know <pause dur="0.2"/> how to put those effects into <pause dur="0.3"/> a model or into some kind of explanation <pause dur="0.3"/> of how climate's going to change or how # <pause dur="0.6"/> or how <pause dur="0.4"/> you know is there going to be ice on the roads tomorrow morning this kind of thing we're going to get into <pause dur="0.6"/> # 
how you'd actually do those calculations but we can only do that once we've actually gotten into detail of all <pause dur="0.4"/> the processes <pause dur="0.5"/> so we've just got five minutes left today <pause dur="0.3"/> so <pause dur="1.2"/> i want to # <pause dur="0.4"/> point out <pause dur="0.9"/> one slight subtlety <pause dur="0.5"/> of what we've done <pause dur="1.2"/> earlier on today <pause dur="0.2"/> now you remember <pause dur="0.4"/> optical depth <pause dur="0.4"/> is a measure <pause dur="0.3"/> of how much stuff you lose from the beam <pause dur="1.2"/> but <pause dur="0.7"/> optical depth <pause dur="0.3"/> gets used a lot you'll hear that term a lot <pause dur="0.2"/> but you want to be slightly careful with it because as we've seen <pause dur="0.3"/> optical depth is composed of two bits it's composed of absorption <pause dur="0.4"/> and scattering <pause dur="0.5"/> and those can have very different <pause dur="0.2"/> effects you know if if say you've got <pause dur="0.5"/> # a water cloud in the atmosphere with an optical depth of <pause dur="0.6"/> point-five or something like that <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="2.0"/> on a day like today which actually actually the <trunc>o</trunc> <pause dur="0.3"/> what would you guess the optical depth was going to be <pause dur="0.4"/> on a day like today <pause dur="0.9"/> that's that's that's a good question <pause dur="0.2"/> <trunc>sli</trunc> slightly subtle <pause dur="7.1"/> let me give it to you as a multiple choice <pause dur="0.7"/> ten-million <pause dur="1.0"/> one <pause dur="0.7"/> or <pause dur="0.9"/> one-over-ten-million <pause dur="1.9"/> 
ten-to-the-minus-seven <pause dur="6.8"/> well <pause dur="1.5"/> think of it this way <pause dur="0.7"/> remember <pause dur="0.3"/> the transmittance the fraction of the radiation <pause dur="0.3"/> that's getting through <pause dur="0.6"/> okay <pause dur="0.3"/> suppose the optical depth <pause dur="0.2"/> were <pause dur="0.8"/> ten-to-the-minus-seven what's E-to-the-minus ten-to-the-minus-seven is that going to be a <pause dur="0.6"/> big number little number <pause dur="9.1"/> let's draw a graph <pause dur="0.3"/> so <pause dur="0.5"/> E-to-the-minus-X as a function of X <pause dur="3.7"/> what's it going to be at X-equals-zero </u><pause dur="3.5"/> <u who="sf0916" trans="pause"> one </u><pause dur="1.1"/> <u who="nm0885" trans="pause"> sorry </u><pause dur="0.4"/> <u who="sf0916" trans="pause"> one </u><pause dur="0.5"/> <u who="nm0885" trans="pause"> one <pause dur="0.7"/> okay <pause dur="0.2"/> going to be one <pause dur="0.4"/> what's it going to be as X gets big </u><pause dur="2.0"/> <u who="sm0917" trans="pause"> <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/></u><pause dur="0.5"/> <u who="nm0885" trans="pause"> sorry </u><pause dur="2.4"/> <u who="sm0917" trans="pause"> it goes small </u><pause dur="0.6"/> <u who="nm0885" trans="pause"> yeah <pause dur="0.2"/> it's going to <pause dur="1.3"/> fade away <pause dur="2.4"/> # <pause dur="0.8"/> where is it going to get to be <pause dur="0.8"/> ten-and-one-halfish sort of thing how fast is it fading away <pause dur="6.4"/> so if there's point-one-five <pause dur="0.3"/> is that point there is that going to be closer to <pause dur="1.4"/> ten-to-the-minus-seven or ten-million or to one or <pause dur="0.5"/> which of those three </u><pause dur="0.9"/> <u who="sf0918" trans="pause"> one </u><pause dur="1.3"/> <u who="nm0885" trans="pause"> pardon </u><u who="sf0918" trans="latching"> <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/></u><pause dur="0.5"/> <u who="nm0885" trans="pause"> yeah it's <trunc>go</trunc> it's going to be kind of oneish 'cause <pause dur="0.5"/> if if if <pause dur="0.4"/> if X is one then that's going to be E-to-the-minus-one which is going to be one-over-E <pause dur="0.3"/> which is one-over-two-point-seven whatever <pause dur="0.5"/> so <pause dur="1.5"/> 
so basically <pause dur="0.4"/> if you have <pause dur="0.3"/> an optical depth which is really small sort of ten-to-the-minus-seven or something like that <pause dur="0.3"/> then basically what you're saying is the transmission is pretty much one <pause dur="0.4"/> all the light's getting through <pause dur="0.8"/> so on a day like today a lot of the light is not getting through so the optical depth is not going to be that small <pause dur="0.3"/> on the other hand if you've got an E that's something like <pause dur="0.3"/> ten-million <pause dur="0.4"/> then E is going to be very small and you're saying only a very very very small fraction of the radiation is getting through it's going to be very dark <pause dur="0.4"/> and it's not that dark <pause dur="1.3"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> so it's going to be something of order one <pause dur="1.5"/> but <pause dur="1.4"/> that's because the radiation is scattered <pause dur="0.5"/> suppose we had an <trunc>abs</trunc> an absorbing case suppose we had a single scattering albedo in in our cloud today 
of zero <pause dur="0.7"/> then what would the transmission look like <pause dur="9.7"/> i'm asking that question in a <trunc>co</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> kind kind of confusing way <pause dur="1.1"/> the transmission what's directly getting through <trunc>depe</trunc> depends on <pause dur="0.8"/> depends on the optical depth and that's not a problem <pause dur="0.4"/> # the problem is relating <pause dur="0.3"/> what you see when you look up at the sky <pause dur="0.4"/> to the <trunc>trans</trunc> to the transmission because what we see when we look up at the sky <pause dur="0.3"/> is actually <pause dur="0.2"/> very little <pause dur="0.2"/> direct beam <pause dur="0.2"/> and it's almost all scattered radiation <pause dur="0.5"/> so actually the optical depth today <pause dur="0.4"/> is pretty big <pause dur="1.6"/> but <pause dur="0.4"/> because of the fact that the single scattering albedo <pause dur="0.3"/> is pretty close to one <pause dur="0.4"/> most of that light <pause dur="0.3"/> that's getting taken out of the direct beam is getting bounced around and <pause dur="0.5"/> some fraction of it <pause dur="0.3"/> maybe half of it or something <pause dur="0.3"/> is getting down to us <pause dur="0.3"/> so we can still see where 
we're going <pause dur="0.3"/> if we had a smoke cloud <pause dur="0.4"/> like say from a forest fire or something like that and <trunc>th</trunc> did you guys see the Australian bush fires a couple of years ago <pause dur="0.9"/> on T-V there's showing pictures of that <pause dur="0.4"/> and basically it was black <pause dur="0.6"/> under <trunc>tho</trunc> if you got close to those things and that was because <pause dur="0.7"/> you had a cloud which in terms of optical depth was probably pretty similar to what we have today <pause dur="0.3"/> but because it had a very low single scattering albedo <pause dur="0.6"/> it was very dark <pause dur="2.1"/> so <pause dur="0.3"/> you got to watch out with optical depth optical depth tells you how much is taken out of the direct beam <pause dur="0.3"/> but it doesn't tell you how much light you're actually going to see <pause dur="0.8"/> on any given day that was actually the point that i wanted to make in a <pause dur="0.3"/> slightly roundabout way <pause dur="0.3"/> okay that's it for today see you next week
