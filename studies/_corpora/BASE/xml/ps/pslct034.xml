<u who="nf0934"> <kinesic desc="overhead projector is on showing transparency" iterated="n"/> holography is a very modern <pause dur="0.3"/> part <pause dur="0.4"/> in optics <pause dur="0.6"/> it's very complicated subject <pause dur="0.4"/> as well as interesting <pause dur="0.6"/> it's possibly one of the most interesting things <pause dur="0.2"/> <trunc>m</trunc> most of the interesting topics that <pause dur="0.6"/> we have discussed in the lecture <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> and # <pause dur="0.3"/> it is going to be in a very simplified manner <pause dur="0.7"/> what i'm going to show you <pause dur="0.4"/> so <pause dur="0.2"/> don't be surprised if <trunc>y</trunc> if i'm just <pause dur="0.3"/> if i just throw formulas at you <pause dur="0.6"/> # that <pause dur="0.2"/> are <pause dur="0.2"/> are the final result don't expect any complicated mathematics the mathematics in holography are very very complex <pause dur="0.7"/> so the intention that i have today with holography is to just <pause dur="0.4"/> explain to you what it is <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> make you understand the basic principles of holography <pause dur="0.4"/> and make you feel comfortable with the idea <pause dur="0.5"/> so that's the intention <pause dur="1.4"/> there isn't much math <pause dur="0.6"/> but <pause dur="0.2"/> there are some very interesting though complex ideas regarding <pause dur="0.4"/> waves in optics <pause dur="0.6"/> and # <pause dur="1.0"/> i would ask you to pay a little bit of attention and try to think <pause dur="0.3"/> on the way <pause dur="1.4"/> okay <pause dur="1.5"/> i am sure that you <pause dur="0.2"/> all <pause dur="0.3"/> have heard before the word holography <pause dur="0.5"/> you know that it 
is technique that produces three-dimensional images <pause dur="0.7"/> and # <pause dur="0.2"/> the question is <pause dur="0.4"/> what is it that's different <pause dur="0.2"/> in holography compared to two-dimensional <pause dur="0.4"/> photographs <pause dur="1.5"/> what is that we miss <pause dur="1.4"/> when we've got a normal photograph <pause dur="0.3"/> or we've got <pause dur="0.2"/> our television screen <pause dur="0.5"/> what we see is just a two-dimensional flat image <pause dur="0.4"/> we don't see depth <pause dur="1.1"/> basically what we see is just irradiance <pause dur="1.0"/> so <pause dur="0.6"/> light intensity <pause dur="0.2"/> goes on the screen it gets reflected and that information goes into our eye and we see <pause dur="0.3"/> a two-dimensional image <pause dur="1.2"/> but <pause dur="0.5"/> we miss something <pause dur="1.1"/> the what we miss is information <pause dur="1.0"/> and that information that we miss <pause dur="0.2"/> is the phase <pause dur="0.3"/> of the reflected <pause dur="0.5"/> wavefront <pause dur="2.2"/> as we all know <pause dur="0.3"/> a wave can be described by two things <pause dur="0.8"/> can be described by <pause dur="0.2"/> the amplitude <pause dur="0.5"/> which effectively defines the irradiance <pause dur="0.6"/> and the phase <pause dur="1.2"/> so in two dimensions <pause dur="0.2"/> what we see <pause dur="0.5"/> is simply irradiance <pause dur="0.4"/> but we don't see phase <pause dur="1.2"/> with techniques of holography <pause dur="0.5"/> what we see <pause dur="0.2"/> is both <pause dur="0.4"/> irradiance <pause dur="0.3"/> and phase <pause dur="0.4"/> and this is how we end up seeing a three-dimensional image <pause dur="1.5"/> 
now the question is <pause dur="0.2"/> that if we want to see <pause dur="0.3"/> both the irradiance <pause dur="0.2"/> and the phase <pause dur="0.3"/> we need to have a mechanism <pause dur="0.4"/> from which we can code <pause dur="0.4"/> that information <pause dur="1.9"/> and when we talk <pause dur="0.2"/> about <pause dur="0.5"/> phase <pause dur="0.4"/> then <pause dur="0.6"/> sometimes it's easy to think <pause dur="0.4"/> interference <pause dur="2.8"/> and basic idea of holography <pause dur="0.3"/> is to encode <pause dur="0.6"/> both information <pause dur="0.5"/> phase <pause dur="0.4"/> and amplitude <pause dur="0.7"/> in form of interference fringes <pause dur="2.0"/> later on we'll see how <pause dur="0.6"/> we can achieve that <pause dur="1.5"/> right <pause dur="0.6"/> and what i'm going to show you now <pause dur="0.4"/> after i just made a <pause dur="0.4"/> short introduction <pause dur="0.6"/> is <pause dur="0.6"/> give you a schematic representation of what happens in holography <pause dur="0.9"/> holography is defined <pause dur="0.2"/> # is separated sorry <pause dur="0.4"/> into two parts <pause dur="0.3"/> one part is <pause dur="0.2"/> the recording of the information <pause dur="0.9"/> the other part is <pause dur="0.2"/> the reconstruction <pause dur="0.4"/> of the information <pause dur="0.5"/> so keep that <pause dur="0.3"/> balance <pause dur="0.5"/> so you can keep <pause dur="0.3"/> good control on what's being said in the lecture <pause dur="1.0"/> right <pause dur="0.9"/> now <pause dur="0.3"/> here i'm going to show you two <pause dur="0.8"/><kinesic desc="reveals covered part of transparency" iterated="n"/> figures <pause dur="0.2"/> oops <pause dur="0.6"/> i don't want to ruin that <vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" dur="1"/><pause dur="1.8"/> so we've got two figures here <pause dur="1.1"/> i do not can you can you see it clearly <pause dur="0.8"/> is it <pause dur="0.3"/> okay <pause dur="1.8"/> okay <pause dur="0.4"/> 
no complaints so i can understand that <pause dur="0.2"/> you can see everything clearly <pause dur="3.4"/> now let's see what we've got here <pause dur="3.5"/> before to those who didn't hear it i said that <pause dur="0.6"/> the basis of holography is storing <pause dur="0.3"/> information <pause dur="0.2"/> about both <pause dur="0.4"/> amplitude <pause dur="0.2"/> and phase <pause dur="1.6"/> and let's see what happens <pause dur="1.8"/> we've got <pause dur="0.6"/> here <pause dur="0.4"/> a beam <pause dur="1.1"/> that is broad <pause dur="0.9"/> and it's coming from a laser <pause dur="2.2"/> that beam is split then in two <pause dur="2.0"/> one part of the beam <pause dur="1.2"/> gets reflected <pause dur="0.2"/> on a mirror <pause dur="1.0"/> and shines <pause dur="0.3"/> on a photographic plate <pause dur="1.6"/> so that's one part of the recording <pause dur="0.7"/> the other part of the beam <pause dur="1.2"/> carries on <pause dur="0.7"/> shines on the object <pause dur="0.2"/> that we're studying <pause dur="0.9"/> and then <pause dur="0.6"/> it gets reflected back <pause dur="0.5"/> on the photographic plate <pause dur="1.6"/> so we've got two beams <pause dur="0.8"/> coming from a laser <pause dur="1.3"/> that travel <pause dur="0.7"/> different paths <pause dur="1.5"/> and <pause dur="0.3"/> what do you think <pause dur="0.2"/> is going to happen on that photographic plate <pause dur="0.5"/> when these two beams come together <pause dur="0.6"/> there are two beams that are coherent <pause dur="0.5"/> because they come from a laser <pause dur="0.8"/> and they travel different paths <pause dur="2.2"/> and i'm sure you all know by now after the exam that you did all your homework <pause dur="0.5"/> that what we have <pause dur="0.3"/> is 
interference <pause dur="0.6"/> these two beams are going to interfere <pause dur="1.3"/> and what happens when they interfere <pause dur="0.4"/> we're expecting <pause dur="0.3"/> on this photographic plate <pause dur="0.5"/> to have <pause dur="0.4"/> a complex <pause dur="0.3"/> set <pause dur="0.5"/> of <pause dur="0.8"/> dark <pause dur="0.4"/> and bright fringes <pause dur="0.4"/> that's the result of interference <pause dur="0.4"/> and take my word for it at the moment <pause dur="0.5"/> that these fringes <pause dur="0.5"/> are a coded form <pause dur="0.6"/> of the information <pause dur="0.6"/> that you need <pause dur="0.5"/> to have a three-dimensional reconstruction <pause dur="0.2"/> of that object <pause dur="0.8"/> these fringes <pause dur="0.6"/> tell you <pause dur="0.2"/> everything you need to know if you want to have a three-dimensional reconstruction of that object <pause dur="0.4"/> we'll see later the explanation for that <pause dur="1.5"/> right <pause dur="0.4"/> so <pause dur="1.1"/> then <pause dur="0.6"/> when we <pause dur="0.2"/> develop that <pause dur="0.7"/> photographic film <pause dur="0.7"/> we say <pause dur="0.6"/> that we can reconstruct <pause dur="0.5"/> the actual object <pause dur="0.7"/> how <pause dur="1.9"/> that is illustrated <pause dur="0.5"/> on the second figure here <pause dur="1.2"/> and what we have <pause dur="1.0"/> is <pause dur="0.4"/> a laser beam <pause dur="0.3"/> again <pause dur="0.2"/> shining <pause dur="0.4"/> on that <pause dur="0.8"/> photographic plate <pause dur="0.9"/> and these fringes that are there on the photographic plates <pause dur="0.9"/> make <pause dur="0.7"/> an <pause dur="0.6"/> a complex wave <pause dur="0.7"/> to arise on the other side of the plate <pause dur="1.5"/> and <pause dur="0.4"/> believe me at this stage <pause dur="0.3"/> that if you look <pause dur="1.1"/> at an angle <pause dur="0.6"/> through <pause dur="0.4"/> that photographic plate <pause dur="0.4"/> you will see <pause dur="0.2"/> a three-dimensional reconstruction of the original object <pause dur="1.9"/> 
so that is the basic idea the very <pause dur="0.3"/> simplistic idea <pause dur="0.3"/> behind holography <pause dur="1.6"/> now <pause dur="0.6"/> what i'm going to do is i'm going to try to explain to you <pause dur="0.2"/> the mechanisms of holography <pause dur="0.4"/> using two different ways <pause dur="0.9"/> one is a pictorial Fourier way <pause dur="1.0"/> and the second one is going to be <pause dur="0.3"/> a direct <pause dur="0.2"/> mathematical <pause dur="0.2"/> simple <pause dur="0.2"/> way <pause dur="0.9"/> they're both important to understand <pause dur="0.7"/> so i'd like to ask you to pay attention to both <pause dur="0.5"/> # ways of dealing with the problem <pause dur="1.3"/> my first explanation is going to be based on <pause dur="0.2"/> Fourier <pause dur="0.2"/> analysis or <pause dur="0.2"/> Fourier optics <pause dur="0.5"/> i'm not quite sure how many of you feel <pause dur="0.4"/> familiar with <pause dur="0.2"/> Fourier analysis <pause dur="0.4"/> can you just <pause dur="0.5"/> put your hands up the ones that feel comfortable with it <pause dur="1.5"/> have you heard of it before <pause dur="0.4"/> at all <pause dur="0.6"/><kinesic desc="put hands up" n="ss" iterated="n"/> you have # <pause dur="0.2"/> # anybody else <pause dur="0.5"/> is it totally new to you Fourier analysis <pause dur="0.8"/> hands up to those that don't know anything about Fourier analysis <pause dur="1.1"/><kinesic desc="put hands up" n="ss" iterated="n"/> ooh okay <pause dur="0.9"/> <shift feature="voice" new="laugh"/> okay <shift feature="voice" new="normal"/><pause dur="0.8"/> now <pause dur="1.5"/> because i wasn't certain <pause dur="1.0"/> which of you know things and which don't <pause dur="0.7"/> i've added <pause dur="0.2"/> an extra <pause dur="0.3"/> some extra information <pause dur="0.8"/> regarding basic things about Fourier analysis <pause dur="0.3"/> most 
of them when they most the people when they hear about Fourier analysis they panic they think it's too complicated <pause dur="0.5"/> but <pause dur="0.6"/> if you just try to concentrate <pause dur="0.5"/> on the idea <pause dur="0.2"/> i'm sure that you will all be better than experts <pause dur="1.2"/> so what is Fourier analysis then <pause dur="0.6"/> Fourier analysis <pause dur="0.4"/> is a way <pause dur="0.6"/> to describe <pause dur="0.6"/> an image <pause dur="0.4"/> to describe <pause dur="0.2"/> a signal <pause dur="0.5"/> to describe <pause dur="0.3"/> a function <pause dur="0.3"/> it's a language <pause dur="1.0"/> nothing more or less than that <pause dur="1.0"/> for that particular case when we talk for images <pause dur="0.3"/> we say that Fourier analysis provides the tools <pause dur="0.2"/> to analyse an image <pause dur="0.6"/> how <pause dur="0.6"/> i'll show you <pause dur="0.4"/> first the horrid thing the mathematics <pause dur="2.7"/><kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="8"/> so that's what it is <pause dur="1.1"/> <trunc>c</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> can you see it <pause dur="2.9"/> i think it's quite <pause dur="0.3"/> oops <pause dur="0.7"/> i don't see that <pause dur="0.4"/> surviving <vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" dur="1"/><pause dur="0.8"/> okay <pause dur="0.8"/> so what's the first formula <pause dur="0.7"/> the first formula shows you <pause dur="0.5"/> how <pause dur="0.2"/> a function <pause dur="0.2"/> F-<pause dur="0.7"/>of-X-and-Y <pause dur="0.5"/> with that particular function and that particular case is an image <pause dur="0.2"/> is an intensity <pause dur="0.8"/> can be analysed <pause dur="0.6"/> in <pause dur="0.6"/> Fourier <pause dur="0.8"/> spatial frequencies <pause dur="1.7"/> of a particular amplitude <pause dur="0.2"/> and phase <pause dur="0.6"/> you must have seen that <pause dur="0.5"/> that <pause dur="0.2"/> integration <pause dur="0.2"/> 
before i mean <pause dur="0.4"/> it is very popular <pause dur="0.8"/> here is in two dimensions because we're talking about two-dimensional <pause dur="0.3"/> images <pause dur="1.6"/> so a scene <pause dur="0.5"/> can be expressed <pause dur="0.3"/> as a series of some Fourier coefficients <pause dur="1.0"/> the coefficients are characterized with a capital letter <pause dur="0.5"/> the spatial frequencies are U <pause dur="0.2"/> and V <pause dur="0.7"/> the integration is over the spatial frequencies i'll tell you later what a spatial frequency is so don't <pause dur="0.3"/> don't be demotivated <pause dur="0.6"/> and here is again another expression <pause dur="0.3"/> where i show how these Fourier coefficients <pause dur="0.4"/> can be expressed can be calculated <pause dur="0.3"/> when you know the scene F-of-X <pause dur="1.1"/> so that's <pause dur="0.3"/> basically the mathematical idea <pause dur="0.5"/> the relation <pause dur="0.3"/> between <pause dur="0.3"/> the scene <pause dur="0.6"/> and something <pause dur="0.4"/> that we call Fourier coefficients <pause dur="1.3"/> the important thing about Fourier coefficients is spatial frequency have you heard that term before spatial frequency <pause dur="0.8"/> okay <pause dur="0.6"/> so <pause dur="0.5"/> now let's forget the math <pause dur="0.2"/> and see <pause dur="0.3"/> in practice what we mean <pause dur="2.1"/> so what i've got here <pause dur="0.6"/> is a very simple image <pause dur="0.7"/> on the right <pause dur="0.4"/> which is a step <pause dur="1.5"/> what i've got here 
is let's say high intensity <pause dur="1.0"/><kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> what i've got here is no intensity <pause dur="0.9"/><kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> so it's <pause dur="0.9"/> high intensity <pause dur="0.4"/> dark <pause dur="0.3"/> high intensity dark and so on <pause dur="0.3"/> it's a simple function <pause dur="0.8"/> the reason why i picked a simple function is because it's easier to represent <pause dur="0.4"/> but what holds for that particular function holds for <pause dur="0.2"/> the complex image <pause dur="0.5"/> so it's the same thing <pause dur="1.1"/> now <pause dur="0.5"/> to make it more simple <pause dur="1.5"/> what i've done <pause dur="0.3"/> is i've taken one line <pause dur="1.1"/><kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> out of that image one line across that image <pause dur="0.3"/> and that line is shown here <pause dur="0.7"/> as a one-dimensional image <pause dur="1.3"/> and what i want you to see now <pause dur="0.2"/> is how we can reconstruct that <pause dur="0.4"/> sort of complex <pause dur="0.7"/> intensity line <pause dur="0.3"/> using Fourier <pause dur="0.3"/> analysis <pause dur="0.7"/> and that result <pause dur="0.6"/> is shown <pause dur="0.6"/> on the last figure here <pause dur="0.9"/><kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> and what i have <pause dur="0.6"/> is <pause dur="0.3"/> the square of intensity <pause dur="1.7"/> and on top <pause dur="0.5"/> i've drawn a simple <pause dur="0.5"/> sine function <pause dur="1.9"/> then <pause dur="1.0"/> on top of that <pause dur="0.3"/> basic simple sine function <pause dur="1.0"/> i've drawn <pause dur="0.4"/> another sine function of different <pause dur="0.2"/> frequency <pause dur="1.9"/> and on the last figure here if you've got more than two <pause dur="0.4"/> sine functions <pause dur="0.6"/> and these sine functions when you add them up <pause dur="1.0"/> you're going 
to have <pause dur="0.6"/> their initial <pause dur="0.2"/> intensity reconstructed <pause dur="0.7"/> so what is Fourier analysis <pause dur="0.2"/> it's a way to break a complex scene <pause dur="0.5"/> into simpler things <pause dur="0.4"/> that you can play with that you can work with <pause dur="0.6"/> what <pause dur="0.5"/> simple sine functions <pause dur="0.3"/> of different amplitudes <pause dur="0.4"/> of different wavelength <pause dur="0.3"/> when you add all these sine functions <pause dur="0.3"/> what's the idea <pause dur="0.2"/> it's to reconstruct <pause dur="0.4"/> your one-dimensional image <pause dur="1.3"/> so that's Fourier analysis <pause dur="0.7"/> and it's shown here <pause dur="0.3"/> in one dimension for a simple image <pause dur="0.8"/> and <pause dur="0.5"/> on the figure above <pause dur="0.2"/> what i'm showing <pause dur="0.4"/> is one sine <pause dur="0.6"/> function <pause dur="0.4"/> shown in one dimension <pause dur="0.5"/> and here it is how that function shows on two dimensions <pause dur="0.9"/> that represents <pause dur="0.2"/> intensity <pause dur="1.4"/> yeah <pause dur="1.1"/> so that's the idea behind Fourier analysis <pause dur="0.3"/> now what <pause dur="0.5"/> i'm wanting you to concentrate if you want to understand the rest is <pause dur="0.3"/> what is spatial <pause dur="0.4"/> frequency <pause dur="1.1"/> that's very important <pause dur="1.6"/> and that is shown on the figure below <pause dur="1.0"/> so what i've done on the figure below <pause dur="0.3"/> is i have taken <pause dur="0.3"/> one of these sine functions <pause dur="0.5"/> and i've plotted it out <pause dur="0.7"/> and i'm saying that the period of that sine function <pause dur="0.3"/> 
is <pause dur="0.3"/> T <pause dur="0.7"/> the period <pause dur="0.3"/> is <pause dur="0.2"/> T <pause dur="0.3"/> T is not time <pause dur="0.3"/> just a period of that time function <pause dur="0.5"/> what is its spatial frequency <pause dur="0.5"/> is one<pause dur="0.4"/> over-T <pause dur="0.9"/> that's what it is <pause dur="1.8"/> that's a spatial frequency and spatial frequency <pause dur="0.4"/> can be defined <pause dur="0.7"/> linearly <pause dur="0.2"/> as one-<pause dur="0.2"/>over-T <pause dur="0.7"/> or angularly <pause dur="0.4"/> as i've <pause dur="0.2"/> shown on that <kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> part of the figure <pause dur="0.4"/> where <pause dur="1.0"/> the difference with angular spatial frequency is that <pause dur="0.4"/> it's important <pause dur="0.2"/> from which position you're looking at something <pause dur="0.6"/> so <pause dur="0.2"/> you've got this period <pause dur="0.2"/> of that sine function <pause dur="0.3"/> you're sitting there <pause dur="0.3"/> looking <pause dur="0.5"/> at that sine function <pause dur="0.5"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> that <pause dur="0.3"/> period is making an angle theta <pause dur="0.7"/> with you with the observer <pause dur="0.5"/> the angular spatial frequency is one-<pause dur="0.3"/>over-theta <pause dur="2.5"/> so <pause dur="0.2"/> what i'm wanting you to remember out of that transparency is that <pause dur="0.3"/> a scene can be analysed <pause dur="0.2"/> in spatial frequencies <pause dur="0.3"/> these spatial frequencies are a way to reconstruct <pause dur="0.3"/> a more complex scene <pause dur="0.7"/> and why is it important to analyse it <pause dur="0.3"/> it is <pause dur="0.3"/> because <pause dur="0.2"/> as the light <pause dur="0.3"/> falls <pause dur="0.2"/> on an object and then gets reflected <pause dur="0.3"/> there is a theory in optics that say <pause dur="0.3"/> that what travels 
actually <pause dur="0.3"/> after the light has been reflected is the spatial frequencies <pause dur="0.3"/> of that particular scene <pause dur="0.3"/> and each spatial frequency <pause dur="0.3"/> is <pause dur="0.4"/> travels <pause dur="0.2"/> on a wave <pause dur="0.4"/> and depending <pause dur="0.4"/> on <pause dur="0.6"/> <trunc>th</trunc> how big that spatial frequency is <pause dur="0.9"/> no <pause dur="0.4"/> the angle that the spatial frequency makes <pause dur="0.3"/> with the central axis <pause dur="0.5"/> is higher <pause dur="0.2"/> for higher spatial frequencies <pause dur="0.8"/> so what i'm saying is that maybe i need to use blackboard for that one <pause dur="0.4"/> what i'm saying is that <pause dur="0.9"/> when you have light reflected <pause dur="0.2"/> off that scene <pause dur="0.4"/> you've got <pause dur="1.6"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="20"/> that's the central axis <pause dur="0.4"/> you've got <pause dur="0.2"/> a spatial frequency <pause dur="0.5"/> travelling <pause dur="0.3"/> let's say straight through <pause dur="0.3"/> which is the zero order but <pause dur="0.2"/> but don't worry about that at the moment <pause dur="0.4"/> you've got <pause dur="1.2"/> another spatial frequency <pause dur="0.3"/> travelling like this <pause dur="0.5"/> you've got another one <pause dur="0.8"/> travelling like this <pause dur="0.6"/> and so on <pause dur="0.7"/> and they propagate <pause dur="0.3"/> these spatial frequencies <pause dur="0.2"/> and because of the lens <pause dur="0.6"/> they just come back together <pause dur="0.2"/> on the image plane <pause dur="0.2"/> they recombine <pause dur="0.2"/> and there you see the final image <pause dur="0.9"/> okay <pause dur="1.4"/> so <pause dur="0.2"/> that's something that we need to remember how the light propagates <pause dur="0.2"/> in terms of 
spatial frequencies <pause dur="2.5"/><kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="13"/> now why is it important <pause dur="3.3"/> is <pause dur="0.2"/> shown <pause dur="0.4"/> and understood <pause dur="1.3"/> from the following transparency <pause dur="2.5"/> so <pause dur="0.8"/> going back to the <trunc>dea</trunc> the idea of holography <pause dur="0.3"/> we said that we've got <pause dur="0.3"/> two <pause dur="0.2"/> parts of a laser beam <pause dur="0.7"/> recombining <pause dur="0.4"/> on a photographic plate <pause dur="0.4"/> and we said that there we've got <pause dur="0.2"/> fringes <pause dur="1.1"/> on that photographic plate <pause dur="0.5"/> and what i'm trying to go # what i'm going to do now <pause dur="0.3"/> is to show you the result of taking <pause dur="0.4"/> one spatial frequency <pause dur="0.6"/> and see the result of that spatial frequency with the original laser beam <pause dur="0.8"/> and if i <pause dur="0.7"/> put up <pause dur="0.5"/> the figure it's going to be easier for you to follow <pause dur="2.2"/> 
right <pause dur="0.4"/> so what do i have here <pause dur="0.4"/> this is going to be an attempt to explain to you <pause dur="0.2"/> how the image is recorded <pause dur="0.2"/> with holography <pause dur="0.5"/> yeah <pause dur="1.8"/> so i am taking just <pause dur="0.2"/> one <pause dur="0.2"/> spatial frequency <pause dur="0.6"/> of the scene <pause dur="1.1"/> yeah <pause dur="0.6"/> that particular spatial frequency is shown here <pause dur="1.0"/> in in <pause dur="0.2"/> it is assumed that it makes an angle theta <pause dur="0.6"/> with <pause dur="0.3"/> the reference wave <pause dur="0.5"/> which is the part of the beam that comes straight from the laser <pause dur="0.3"/> and is shown on the photographic plate <pause dur="1.5"/> right <pause dur="0.9"/> the straight 
lines <pause dur="0.4"/> represent <pause dur="0.4"/> crests <pause dur="0.8"/> and the dotted lines <pause dur="0.2"/> represent <pause dur="0.5"/> troughs <pause dur="2.0"/> and that is our photographic plate <pause dur="0.2"/> and i need to hurry <pause dur="0.3"/> and that is our photographic plate <pause dur="0.5"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> the reference beam is assumed <pause dur="0.3"/> in this figure to have a maximum <pause dur="0.6"/> on that photographic plate <pause dur="1.8"/> now <pause dur="0.5"/> what i'd like you to do is to tell me <pause dur="0.3"/> if you can see <pause dur="0.6"/> at which points on the photographic <pause dur="0.2"/> plate <pause dur="0.2"/> i'm going to have <pause dur="0.3"/> maxima <pause dur="0.4"/> occurring <pause dur="0.3"/> from <pause dur="0.2"/> interference between the two beams </u><pause dur="0.7"/> <u who="sm0935" trans="pause"> A B and C </u><pause dur="0.3"/> <u who="nf0934" trans="pause"> that's excellent <pause dur="0.5"/> this is where you have your maxima <pause dur="1.6"/> A <pause dur="0.2"/> B and C <pause dur="1.4"/> now <pause dur="0.4"/> what is going to happen to the light intensity <pause dur="0.3"/> in between these points </u><pause dur="0.8"/> <u who="sm0936" trans="pause"> <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> </u><pause dur="1.0"/> <u who="nf0934" trans="pause"> it will depend <pause dur="0.2"/> on the phase difference between the two beams <pause dur="0.6"/> the classic line from interference <pause dur="1.2"/> so the next step is <pause dur="0.2"/> is to actually mathematically <pause dur="0.4"/> try and calculate <pause dur="0.4"/> how much that phase difference is going to be <pause dur="0.5"/> as a function <pause dur="0.3"/> of position <pause dur="0.3"/> on top of that photographic plate <pause dur="0.7"/> that's our next aim <pause dur="0.2"/> that's what we need to do <pause dur="1.1"/> and <pause dur="0.5"/> now <pause dur="0.2"/> i've got <pause dur="1.3"/> well <pause dur="1.7"/><kinesic desc="reveals covered part of transparency" iterated="n"/> another figure <pause dur="0.2"/> which is basically <pause dur="0.5"/> part <pause dur="0.4"/> of the first one <pause dur="0.5"/> 
but only showing the interesting bits for the calculation <pause dur="0.6"/> so again i've got my photographic plate there <pause dur="0.3"/> i've got an axis X on that photographic plate <pause dur="0.5"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> i've got the angle theta <pause dur="0.3"/> that <pause dur="0.2"/> the spatial frequency makes with the reference wave <pause dur="0.4"/> got the wavelength of my radiation <pause dur="0.3"/> and what i'm wanting to do is to calculate <pause dur="0.2"/> the phase <pause dur="1.1"/> phi <pause dur="0.2"/> phi <pause dur="0.2"/> how do you call it <pause dur="0.2"/> phi <pause dur="0.5"/> yes <pause dur="0.2"/> phi <pause dur="0.2"/> along <pause dur="0.3"/> that photographic <pause dur="0.3"/> plate <pause dur="1.5"/> now <pause dur="1.1"/> you're not supposed to see that bit yet <vocal desc="laugh" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.9"/> so <pause dur="0.7"/> how much do you think <pause dur="0.3"/> that phase difference is going to change <pause dur="0.3"/> if i travel <pause dur="0.3"/> from B <pause dur="0.3"/> to A <pause dur="0.4"/> where the two maxima occur </u><pause dur="2.4"/> <u who="sm0937" trans="pause"> two-pi </u><pause dur="0.5"/> <u who="nf0934" trans="pause"> exactly <pause dur="0.5"/> so when i go from the two maxima <pause dur="0.4"/> the phase has changed <pause dur="0.3"/> by two-pi <pause dur="1.5"/> therefore <pause dur="0.2"/> taking that into consideration <pause dur="0.4"/> one can write <pause dur="0.2"/> that the phase <pause dur="0.4"/> phi <pause dur="0.3"/> at some point <pause dur="0.3"/> X <pause dur="0.5"/> satisfies that relationship <pause dur="0.2"/> that analogy <pause dur="0.6"/> if you want <pause dur="0.7"/> but phi <pause dur="0.3"/> over two-pi <pause dur="0.2"/> equals <pause dur="0.2"/> X <pause dur="0.3"/> over <pause dur="0.2"/> the length <pause dur="0.4"/> A-B <pause dur="1.2"/> don't worry making notes about that because you've got everything in your <pause dur="0.2"/> handout <pause dur="0.4"/> so <pause dur="1.6"/> you don't you needn't worry about it <pause dur="0.5"/> unless of 
course if it helps you learn things better to which is which is fine by me <pause dur="0.7"/> and now what we want to do is to <pause dur="0.2"/> isolate that phi <pause dur="0.3"/> and we say that the phase <pause dur="0.7"/> is <pause dur="0.4"/> two-pi <pause dur="0.2"/> multiplied by X <pause dur="0.2"/> divided <pause dur="0.2"/> by <pause dur="0.2"/> A-B <pause dur="1.3"/> that calculation though is not finished because what because what we actually want to relate <pause dur="0.4"/> is that phase difference <pause dur="0.2"/> with the angle <pause dur="0.4"/> theta <pause dur="1.2"/> that the spatial frequency makes with the reference wave <pause dur="1.7"/> and how do we do that <pause dur="1.1"/> usual way <pause dur="0.3"/> we use that triangle <pause dur="0.9"/> yeah <pause dur="0.6"/> and from that triangle we're going to substitute <pause dur="0.6"/> the length A-B that is not very helpful to us at the moment <pause dur="1.2"/> and it's quite straightforward to see that the sine of that angle theta <pause dur="0.3"/> is the wavelength lambda <pause dur="0.2"/> over <pause dur="0.2"/> A-B <pause dur="0.3"/> therefore that length <pause dur="0.2"/> A-B is going to be the length <pause dur="0.4"/> sorry the wavelength <pause dur="0.2"/> divided by the sine <pause dur="0.5"/> of the wanted angle <pause dur="1.3"/> therefore <pause dur="0.2"/> our final result is that <pause dur="0.3"/> the phase <pause dur="0.2"/> along the photographic plate <pause dur="0.2"/> as a function of position <pause dur="0.2"/> is going to be two-pi <pause dur="0.4"/> over the wavelength <pause dur="0.3"/> multiplied <pause dur="0.2"/> by the distance <pause dur="0.2"/> 
multiplied <pause dur="0.2"/> by the sine <pause dur="0.4"/> of the angle <pause dur="0.4"/> that the spatial frequency makes <pause dur="0.2"/> with the reference wave <pause dur="2.1"/> and now what is it important to see <pause dur="0.3"/> the calculation is quite straightforward i'm sure you all <pause dur="0.6"/> understood it <pause dur="0.7"/> the important is <pause dur="0.3"/> that <pause dur="0.5"/> the phase <pause dur="0.3"/> X <pause dur="0.8"/> that defines if we're going to have intensity maxima <pause dur="0.2"/> or minima <pause dur="1.2"/> is not only a function of position <pause dur="0.3"/> X <pause dur="0.7"/> it is a function <pause dur="0.4"/> of the angle <pause dur="0.3"/> that the spatial frequency makes with the reference wave <pause dur="1.2"/> and what did we say before <pause dur="0.3"/> that a complex scene <pause dur="0.5"/> can be broken into a number of spatial frequencies <pause dur="0.2"/> that travel with different angles <pause dur="1.4"/> where do i want to end <pause dur="0.2"/> i want to say that <pause dur="0.3"/> for each spatial frequency <pause dur="0.5"/> that angle theta is going to be different <pause dur="1.5"/> therefore <pause dur="0.3"/> what we're expecting to see <pause dur="1.1"/> on the photographic plate when you've got a complex object <pause dur="0.5"/> is a very complicated <pause dur="0.5"/> form of of of dark and bright fringes <pause dur="1.3"/> that's what we're expecting to see <pause dur="5.6"/> but before <pause dur="0.5"/> we go to that point the next bit is <pause dur="0.3"/> to see <pause dur="0.3"/> what is going to be <pause dur="0.3"/> the light field on that 
photographic plate <pause dur="2.2"/> and the light field on that photographic plate <pause dur="0.7"/> is going to be given <pause dur="0.3"/> by this <pause dur="0.6"/> formula <pause dur="0.2"/> that comes to you <pause dur="0.3"/> like <pause dur="0.2"/> out of the blue now <pause dur="0.3"/> but it really comes from interference <pause dur="0.5"/> the point is not to go through all the steps <pause dur="0.2"/> it's to make you understand what's behind holography <pause dur="0.7"/> yeah <pause dur="0.5"/> and that's the resultant <pause dur="0.3"/> wave <pause dur="0.5"/> of <pause dur="0.7"/> two <pause dur="0.6"/> beams <pause dur="0.6"/> that have got the same <pause dur="0.2"/> amplitude <pause dur="1.3"/> now what's the resultant intensity <pause dur="0.7"/> when the field is like that the resultant intensity <pause dur="0.3"/> as we all know is going to be proportional to the square of the wave time average blah blah <pause dur="0.3"/> and believe me <pause dur="0.2"/> that is going to be given by that equation <pause dur="1.7"/> so what do we see that for one spatial frequency <pause dur="0.3"/> the intensity on the photographic plate <pause dur="0.3"/> is expected <pause dur="0.3"/> to have a constant term <pause dur="1.3"/> and another term <pause dur="1.1"/> who has got a cosine <pause dur="0.8"/> dependence <pause dur="0.8"/> cosine dependence <pause dur="0.2"/> on the phase <pause dur="0.2"/> difference <pause dur="0.9"/> and enough about math how's it going to look like <pause dur="1.7"/><event desc="takes off transparency" iterated="n"/> i'm going to show you <pause dur="0.9"/> here <pause dur="0.6"/> how the fringes are going to look like on that photographic plate 
for this simple case <pause dur="0.8"/> and we said <pause dur="0.3"/> that it's going to look like a cosine <pause dur="0.3"/> and indeed <pause dur="2.4"/><kinesic desc="puts on transparency" iterated="n"/> it looks <pause dur="0.2"/> like <pause dur="0.6"/> that <pause dur="1.2"/> which is <pause dur="0.6"/> a cosine <pause dur="0.4"/> function <pause dur="4.1"/> okay <pause dur="1.5"/> so that's <pause dur="0.2"/> now <pause dur="0.3"/> the intensity on the photographic plate <pause dur="0.3"/> and what do we do when we have that information <pause dur="0.5"/> we develop the film <pause dur="0.6"/> and then we say okay <pause dur="0.2"/> now we've got our fringes <pause dur="0.2"/> we want to reconstruct <pause dur="1.3"/> what's the idea behind reconstruction <pause dur="0.8"/> that is very simply <pause dur="0.4"/> shown on that one <pause dur="0.3"/> where you've got now another laser <pause dur="0.3"/> shining on that photographic plate <pause dur="0.3"/> and because you've got intensity variations on that photographic plate <pause dur="0.3"/> you've got a complex wavefront arising <pause dur="0.2"/> behind that plate <pause dur="1.1"/> and you've got <pause dur="0.2"/> a number of spatial frequencies <pause dur="0.3"/> travelling in different <pause dur="0.2"/> directions <pause dur="1.5"/> and what i'm saying is <pause dur="0.3"/> that <pause dur="0.3"/> if one <pause dur="0.2"/> looks <pause dur="0.5"/> from that position <pause dur="0.4"/> he's going to see <pause dur="0.3"/> a three-dimensional object <pause dur="1.1"/> the explanation about <pause dur="0.2"/> reconstructing <pause dur="0.7"/> is going to be <pause dur="0.2"/> from my point of view more successful <pause dur="0.2"/> with the other approach with a direct mathematical approach <pause dur="1.1"/> but that's the end <pause dur="0.3"/> of the first <pause dur="0.2"/> way of 
dealing with holography <pause dur="0.4"/> the Fourier way <pause dur="2.4"/> how <pause dur="0.3"/> are the fringes going to look for <pause dur="0.6"/> a more complicated object <pause dur="2.9"/><kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="10"/> 
they're going to look more complex <pause dur="1.5"/> and <pause dur="1.9"/> they are bound <pause dur="0.4"/> to look <pause dur="0.6"/> more complicated <pause dur="0.5"/> the more complicated the object you are studying is <pause dur="0.4"/> so <pause dur="0.8"/> i'm just showing you here two pictures to see <pause dur="0.4"/> how do they look like <pause dur="3.8"/> one <pause dur="0.2"/> finds it hard to believe that <pause dur="0.3"/> out of that <pause dur="0.4"/> you've got so much information but <pause dur="0.7"/> that's how it is in holography <pause dur="2.0"/> two more points that i need to make <pause dur="0.3"/> is that <pause dur="0.9"/> as we said before <pause dur="0.5"/> when you have a more complex <pause dur="0.2"/> object <pause dur="0.4"/> you're expecting <pause dur="0.2"/> the phase difference <pause dur="0.6"/> phi <pause dur="0.5"/> to give you a more <pause dur="0.3"/> complicated configuration of fringes <pause dur="0.6"/> and <pause dur="0.5"/> if the amplitude of the waves <pause dur="0.3"/> is not the same as we said before <pause dur="0.3"/> then that is going to reflect <pause dur="0.3"/> on how bright <pause dur="0.3"/> these fringes are <pause dur="2.0"/> we'll see more details of that one <pause dur="0.4"/> on the second <pause dur="0.2"/> part of <pause dur="0.5"/> how to work with holography which is <pause dur="0.4"/> something that you may feel more comfortable which is direct <pause dur="0.2"/> mathematical <pause dur="0.4"/> way <pause dur="3.2"/><kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="23"/> so <pause dur="1.8"/> we're going back <pause dur="0.5"/> to the usual <pause dur="1.2"/> old known ideas about <pause dur="0.4"/> 
waves <pause dur="1.0"/> and <pause dur="0.4"/> to remind you again <pause dur="0.2"/> of the <pause dur="0.4"/> idea of holography <pause dur="0.4"/> i'm just going to very briefly show you <pause dur="2.5"/> what we said about recording <pause dur="0.2"/> we said we've got a laser beam it's been broadened <pause dur="0.5"/> part of it shines on that photographic plate <pause dur="0.4"/> and another part <pause dur="0.3"/> of the beam <pause dur="0.4"/> shines on the object and then ends up on the photographic plate <pause dur="0.5"/> so what do we've got <pause dur="0.7"/> we've got <pause dur="0.2"/> two <pause dur="0.4"/> electric <pause dur="0.3"/> fields <pause dur="0.2"/> recombining on a photographic plate <pause dur="0.2"/> usual interference problem <pause dur="0.8"/> right <pause dur="0.6"/><kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="10"/> so what do we know about the usual interference problem we just write down the two parts <pause dur="0.3"/> of the wave <pause dur="0.6"/> in a simple mathematical <pause dur="0.2"/> form <pause dur="2.0"/> so what's the first equation represent <pause dur="0.2"/> the first equation represents <pause dur="0.2"/> the part of the laser beam <pause dur="0.2"/> that has not been reflected <pause dur="0.2"/> off <pause dur="0.2"/> from the object <pause dur="0.5"/> and that <pause dur="1.0"/> part of the beam <pause dur="0.2"/> we call it the background beam or reference <pause dur="0.2"/> beam <pause dur="1.3"/> and <pause dur="0.6"/> this is why you've got the <trunc>substr</trunc> subscript-<pause dur="0.2"/>B <pause dur="0.5"/> for background beam <pause dur="1.0"/> that's the electric field <pause dur="0.5"/> that is being produced <pause dur="0.5"/> on the photographic plate <pause dur="0.6"/> and is <pause dur="0.4"/> of constant amplitude <pause dur="0.7"/> and <pause dur="0.4"/> of phase 
that is a function <pause dur="0.2"/> of position <pause dur="0.7"/> on the photographic plate <pause dur="1.5"/> that's the description of the first part of the beam <pause dur="0.8"/> now we've got <pause dur="0.2"/> the <pause dur="0.2"/> beam <pause dur="0.3"/> that has been scattered <pause dur="0.4"/> by the object <pause dur="0.7"/> that <pause dur="0.2"/> we give the name <pause dur="0.4"/> E-<pause dur="0.2"/>O <pause dur="0.4"/> O stands for object <pause dur="0.9"/> and that <pause dur="0.2"/> is again the amplitude <pause dur="0.2"/> which is now a position <pause dur="0.8"/> of <pause dur="0.8"/> <trunc>i</trunc> it's a function sorry of position on the photographic <trunc>fil</trunc> on the photographic film <pause dur="0.6"/> and <pause dur="0.3"/> a <trunc>f</trunc> # a phase <pause dur="0.6"/> phi <pause dur="0.7"/> with the subscript-<pause dur="0.3"/>O <pause dur="0.4"/> for object <pause dur="0.8"/> which is again a function of position on the photographic field <pause dur="0.8"/> and what we want to do is to calculate <pause dur="0.3"/> the total electric field <pause dur="0.4"/> that arises <pause dur="0.2"/> from these two fields overlapping <pause dur="0.2"/> adding with each other <pause dur="1.6"/><kinesic desc="reveals covered part of transparency" iterated="n"/> and what we do is we say <pause dur="0.3"/> that <pause dur="0.9"/> the field is going to be <pause dur="0.2"/> the addition of these two <pause dur="0.3"/> and <pause dur="0.3"/> the intensity <pause dur="1.0"/> that it is what we are worried about <pause dur="0.4"/> is going to be <pause dur="0.2"/> as we all know <pause dur="0.6"/> the field squared <pause dur="0.6"/> and then time averaged <pause dur="2.2"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> the result of that calculation <pause dur="0.3"/> is going to be <pause dur="0.7"/> as you all know <pause dur="0.5"/> the amplitude <pause dur="0.4"/> of the background beam squared <pause dur="1.3"/> plus <pause dur="0.2"/> the amplitude of the object beam 
squared <pause dur="0.8"/> plus <pause dur="0.3"/> that <pause dur="0.2"/> interesting bit here <pause dur="0.6"/> which is a cosine <pause dur="0.4"/> of the difference <pause dur="0.2"/> in phase these two beams have <pause dur="1.5"/> now never mind about amplitudes and about constants <pause dur="0.4"/> that's <pause dur="0.4"/> that's the key point <pause dur="0.6"/> here <pause dur="1.3"/> so <pause dur="1.0"/> we say then <pause dur="1.3"/> we see <pause dur="0.4"/> that <pause dur="0.2"/> the intensity <pause dur="0.2"/> formed <pause dur="1.1"/> on that photographic film <pause dur="0.6"/> is really a function <pause dur="0.4"/> of the difference in phase between these two beams <pause dur="1.2"/> so what can we say <pause dur="0.3"/> that the intensity <pause dur="0.3"/> is <pause dur="0.2"/> a coded <pause dur="0.2"/> form <pause dur="0.4"/> of the phase difference <pause dur="1.4"/> that's the whole point <pause dur="0.2"/> that i want you to remember on that one <pause dur="2.4"/> right <pause dur="0.3"/> we understood now the importance of the phase <pause dur="0.4"/> that the phase has been recorded <pause dur="0.3"/> on the photographic film <pause dur="0.2"/> but what about the other bit of information which is the intensity <pause dur="0.9"/> and we're saying that the intensity <pause dur="0.7"/> in holography <pause dur="0.5"/> defines the contrast <pause dur="0.4"/> as i said to you before <pause dur="1.2"/> in the scene <pause dur="0.9"/> and that contrast <pause dur="0.2"/> V <pause dur="0.7"/> is <pause dur="0.2"/> the maximum-intensity-minus-the-minimum-intensity over <pause dur="0.5"/> the maximum-intensity-plus-<pause dur="0.3"/>the-minimum that's a simple definition of what contrast is <pause dur="0.8"/> and that contrast relates if you want to amplitude <pause dur="0.5"/> by 
this <pause dur="0.2"/> simple definition <pause dur="1.3"/> and we see <pause dur="0.3"/> that the amplitude <pause dur="0.3"/> of the object <pause dur="0.3"/> E-O-O <pause dur="1.1"/> indeed <pause dur="0.2"/> defines the contrast of these fringes <pause dur="0.7"/> so the contrast <pause dur="0.6"/> and the intensity really <pause dur="0.2"/> of that photographic plate <pause dur="0.3"/> give you all the information you need <pause dur="0.9"/> both <pause dur="0.2"/> information for intensity <pause dur="0.2"/> and phase <pause dur="0.7"/> to reconstruct <pause dur="0.7"/> your original scene in three dimensions <pause dur="3.9"/><event desc="takes off transparency" iterated="n"/> right <pause dur="3.2"/> so that's the bit about <pause dur="0.2"/> recording <pause dur="0.4"/> for the direct mathematical approach <pause dur="0.5"/> what about reconstruction <pause dur="1.2"/><kinesic desc="puts on transparency" iterated="n"/> again <pause dur="1.0"/> i'm showing you very briefly <pause dur="0.3"/> the figure for those that <pause dur="0.8"/> didn't pay that much attention before <pause dur="0.5"/> you've got your <pause dur="0.2"/> reference beam on reconstruction <pause dur="0.5"/> that shines on that photographic film <pause dur="0.5"/> that has all the information encoded <pause dur="0.8"/> and <pause dur="0.4"/> part of the beam <pause dur="1.2"/> is going through <pause dur="0.2"/> and the wavefront that arises <pause dur="0.7"/> behind that photographic field <pause dur="0.6"/> <trunc>ph</trunc> photographic film sorry <pause dur="0.2"/> is giving you the information you need <pause dur="0.3"/> to see <pause dur="0.4"/> that <pause dur="0.5"/> three-dimensional image <pause dur="0.5"/> now one may say <pause dur="0.2"/> hold on a minute <pause dur="0.2"/> you've got two images there <pause dur="0.9"/> you've got <pause dur="0.2"/> one <pause dur="0.3"/> here <pause dur="0.4"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> one <pause dur="0.2"/> there <pause dur="0.8"/> and indeed you've got two images formed in holography <pause dur="0.4"/> the thing is <pause dur="0.2"/> that the one of them <pause dur="0.2"/> is not good <pause dur="1.9"/> and i'll show 
you later why <pause dur="2.9"/> right <pause dur="0.2"/> so let's go now <pause dur="0.6"/> to the mathematics <pause dur="1.3"/> and i'm saying that we've got <pause dur="0.2"/> one laser beam shown <pause dur="0.4"/> on that <pause dur="0.4"/> # photographic film <pause dur="0.9"/> a laser beam <pause dur="0.6"/> and that's <pause dur="1.8"/> its <pause dur="0.4"/> formula <pause dur="0.5"/> how you define that <pause dur="0.5"/> beam mathematically <pause dur="0.7"/> we call it the reconstructive <pause dur="0.5"/> reconstructing <pause dur="0.2"/> wave or reconstructive <pause dur="0.2"/> beam <pause dur="0.4"/> that's the name for it <pause dur="0.3"/> and you've got this R-subscript there <pause dur="0.8"/> and it's <pause dur="0.2"/> very simple to describe it <pause dur="0.7"/> it's a wave <pause dur="0.2"/> it's got its amplitude <pause dur="0.2"/> and it's got its phase <pause dur="0.6"/> that's what it is <pause dur="1.0"/> now that beam <pause dur="0.4"/> reads <pause dur="0.3"/> the information <pause dur="0.4"/> on the photographic plate <pause dur="0.5"/> that reading <pause dur="0.7"/> is mathematically expressed <pause dur="0.8"/> as <pause dur="1.4"/> # multiplication <pause dur="0.9"/> of the <pause dur="0.3"/> wave <pause dur="0.4"/> the reconstructing wave <pause dur="0.4"/> with the intensity <pause dur="0.7"/> on that photographic <pause dur="0.3"/> plate <pause dur="2.3"/> so what i'm saying is that the final wave <pause dur="0.3"/> the emerging wave behind <pause dur="0.4"/> the photographic plate <pause dur="0.7"/> is going to be a multiplication <pause dur="0.5"/> of the reconstructing wave <pause dur="0.6"/> with <pause dur="0.3"/> the <pause dur="0.2"/> intensity <pause dur="0.4"/> of that <pause dur="1.3"/> that is stored on that photographic plate <pause dur="2.0"/> that's how 
it is <pause dur="0.9"/> that's the starting point <pause dur="0.4"/> now what's going to happen <pause dur="0.6"/> let's see <pause dur="1.1"/> next bit is okay let's see what happens if we substitute <pause dur="0.6"/> the reconstructing wave <pause dur="0.3"/> with its <pause dur="0.5"/> analytical form <pause dur="0.6"/> and <pause dur="0.5"/> i substituted here the intensity <pause dur="0.6"/> with the formula that i've shown you on the <pause dur="0.2"/> on the previous page <pause dur="0.5"/> nothing new <pause dur="0.3"/> here <pause dur="1.8"/> and what we do <pause dur="0.2"/> is we <pause dur="0.2"/> multiply <pause dur="0.4"/> all that <pause dur="1.3"/> with a constant <pause dur="0.5"/> provided by these two terms <pause dur="1.1"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> if we do that <pause dur="0.8"/> multiplication <pause dur="0.5"/> we're going to see <pause dur="0.2"/> that <pause dur="0.5"/> it is the reconstructing <pause dur="0.9"/> wave <pause dur="0.6"/> multiplied by this constant <pause dur="1.0"/> and then <pause dur="0.2"/> the second bit of the multiplication is to take <pause dur="0.2"/> all that <pause dur="1.0"/> and multiply it <pause dur="0.3"/> with <pause dur="0.3"/> all that <pause dur="1.6"/> so what's interesting <pause dur="0.2"/> in this multiplication <pause dur="0.4"/> you've got the multiplication of two cosines now <pause dur="0.8"/> the cosine appearing here <pause dur="0.6"/> the cosine <pause dur="0.6"/> there <pause dur="1.2"/> and <pause dur="0.3"/> the result <pause dur="0.8"/> is shown <pause dur="0.5"/> on that <pause dur="0.2"/> second line i'm showing <pause dur="1.5"/> so what do you have here <pause dur="0.5"/> you've got all your constants <pause dur="0.2"/> that you're not <pause dur="0.3"/> particularly worried about at the moment <pause dur="0.5"/> and you've got the cosine <pause dur="0.4"/> of the reconstructing <pause dur="0.2"/> wave <pause dur="0.5"/> multiplied with 
the cosine of that phase difference <pause dur="0.3"/> between the reference beam <pause dur="0.5"/> and <pause dur="0.6"/> the object <pause dur="2.0"/> right <pause dur="0.3"/> and when we see cosines multiplied together <pause dur="0.7"/> what do we do <pause dur="0.3"/> we use the known <pause dur="0.4"/> trigonometric formula <pause dur="1.1"/> and <pause dur="0.3"/> finally <pause dur="0.3"/> we've got here <pause dur="2.0"/> the <trunc>f</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> the result <pause dur="1.5"/> that <pause dur="0.2"/> is telling you <pause dur="0.6"/> that the final <pause dur="0.2"/> E-F <pause dur="0.3"/> wave that emerges behind the photographic film <pause dur="1.4"/> is <pause dur="1.1"/> the first term <pause dur="1.2"/> that we saw here <pause dur="0.6"/> the reference wave multiplied by constant but that's not giving you any information so basically <pause dur="0.4"/> you're not worried too much as a physicist about that <pause dur="0.7"/> and then you've got the interesting bits <pause dur="0.6"/> you've got <pause dur="1.4"/> the constant here <pause dur="0.4"/> which is <pause dur="0.4"/> the <pause dur="0.7"/> amplitude of the wave arising from the object multiplied by something you're not worried about <pause dur="0.8"/> and you've got <pause dur="0.5"/> the cosine <pause dur="0.9"/> of the <pause dur="0.2"/> summation <pause dur="0.7"/> of these two phase terms <pause dur="0.8"/> do you see what i mean <pause dur="1.5"/> i've taken the multiplication of cosines <pause dur="0.6"/> and i said <pause dur="0.5"/> that cosine-A cosine-B is going to be cosine A-plus-B <pause dur="0.5"/> A being that <pause dur="0.3"/> B being that big term <pause dur="0.5"/> and then i've <trunc>g</trunc> ended up then with that expression <pause dur="1.5"/> and on the third term <pause dur="1.0"/> 
which is called <pause dur="0.9"/> the difference <pause dur="1.2"/> i've got <pause dur="0.4"/> cosine <pause dur="0.7"/> of <pause dur="0.2"/> A-<pause dur="0.4"/>minus-B <pause dur="0.5"/> so <pause dur="0.3"/> cosine of <pause dur="0.2"/> all that phase <pause dur="0.3"/> minus <pause dur="0.5"/> all that phase <pause dur="1.2"/> and that's <pause dur="0.7"/> the final wave that emerges <pause dur="0.7"/> behind the photographic plate <pause dur="1.1"/> what does that mean <pause dur="6.0"/><kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="15"/> to make it more easy <pause dur="1.2"/> i've written out here <pause dur="0.2"/> again <pause dur="1.6"/> the three terms <pause dur="1.1"/> and we're going to make comments on these three terms <pause dur="6.7"/> so the first term <pause dur="0.4"/> as we said before <pause dur="0.5"/> contains not much interesting information <pause dur="0.3"/> just a constant <pause dur="1.5"/> now the second term <pause dur="0.9"/> which we called the sum <pause dur="1.1"/> term <pause dur="0.9"/> what does it contain <pause dur="0.7"/> we saw here <pause dur="1.2"/> it's got an amplitude <pause dur="1.2"/> which is a modified version of E-nought-nought but what does modified mean well it's been multiplied <pause dur="0.8"/> that's what it is <pause dur="1.2"/> and it also <pause dur="0.6"/> contains the phase here <pause dur="0.7"/> contains <pause dur="1.0"/> the factor <pause dur="0.5"/> two-<pause dur="0.4"/>phi <pause dur="1.1"/> i'll remind you <pause dur="0.2"/> that phi is the phase <pause dur="0.3"/> of the wave <pause dur="0.3"/> coming from a laser <pause dur="1.1"/> now it's getting a little bit complex <pause dur="0.2"/> and trust me on that stage <pause dur="0.3"/> that that <pause dur="0.2"/> term two-phi <pause dur="0.3"/> is responsible <pause dur="0.2"/> for the separation of the two images <pause dur="0.6"/> like i've shown you before <pause dur="1.9"/> the appearance of that term <pause dur="0.3"/> makes the two images that 
we've seen on the previous <pause dur="0.8"/> figure <pause dur="0.6"/> appear <pause dur="5.5"/> and it also contains information about the phase of the object <pause dur="0.7"/> phi-nought <pause dur="0.4"/> only <pause dur="0.8"/> what's the difference <pause dur="0.2"/> it's got a minus there <pause dur="1.4"/> so that particular term <pause dur="0.5"/> contains information about both the amplitude <pause dur="0.3"/> of the object <pause dur="0.4"/> plus <pause dur="0.5"/> the phase <pause dur="0.3"/> and somebody may say oh okay <pause dur="0.3"/> i've got my amplitude i've got my phase i've got my three-dimensional image <pause dur="0.2"/> no <pause dur="0.2"/> it's not quite right <pause dur="0.2"/> because the phase <pause dur="0.2"/> appears here <pause dur="0.2"/> with a minus <pause dur="0.7"/> what does that mean in practice <pause dur="0.4"/> that that particular image that we called the real image <pause dur="0.2"/> is not right <pause dur="0.4"/> it's upside down <pause dur="1.0"/> so <pause dur="0.2"/> if in reality let's say <pause dur="1.0"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> something is supposed to <pause dur="0.2"/> be closer to you <pause dur="0.6"/> on that image that bit looks to be <pause dur="0.2"/> further away than you <pause dur="0.6"/> it's the other way around <pause dur="0.7"/> that effect is caused by this minus-<pause dur="0.4"/>phi <pause dur="0.6"/> and the image occurring <pause dur="0.4"/> due to that term <pause dur="0.2"/> is not <pause dur="0.2"/> right <pause dur="0.2"/> is not correct <pause dur="1.9"/> the correct <pause dur="0.5"/> three-dimensional image <pause dur="1.4"/> <trunc>acu</trunc> occurs <pause dur="0.3"/> from the other term on the final wave <pause dur="0.5"/> which is the difference <pause dur="0.6"/> term <pause dur="0.8"/> and if you see <pause dur="1.3"/> in that 
difference term <pause dur="0.2"/> you've got the amplitude <pause dur="1.6"/> of the wave <pause dur="0.9"/> coming from the object <pause dur="0.4"/> and now <pause dur="0.3"/> you've got <pause dur="0.2"/> the correct <pause dur="0.4"/> phase <pause dur="0.4"/> phi-nought <pause dur="0.5"/> of the object <pause dur="0.4"/> and that <pause dur="0.7"/> part of the final image <pause dur="0.5"/> is the one that is given you <pause dur="0.5"/> the three-<pause dur="0.4"/>dimensional <pause dur="0.2"/> image in holography <pause dur="4.0"/> so <pause dur="0.6"/> to conclude what we've done today <pause dur="0.8"/> is <pause dur="0.4"/> first thing <pause dur="0.3"/> to remember <pause dur="0.6"/> is the difference between two-dimensional and three-dimensional imaging <pause dur="0.5"/> in two dimensions <pause dur="0.3"/> what we do <pause dur="0.2"/> is we store <pause dur="0.2"/> information about irradiance intensity however you want to put it <pause dur="0.3"/> but we have no information about phase <pause dur="0.3"/> and holography comes and says okay <pause dur="0.5"/> there is a technique where <pause dur="0.2"/> i can store information <pause dur="0.4"/> on both intensity and phase <pause dur="1.0"/> then <pause dur="0.7"/> we shown the basic mechanism <pause dur="0.4"/> of recording and reconstruction <pause dur="0.4"/> in holography <pause dur="0.5"/> and we tried to explain <pause dur="0.6"/> that idea <pause dur="0.2"/> using two ways <pause dur="0.3"/> one way 
was based on Fourier analysis <pause dur="0.6"/> and we had to <pause dur="0.5"/> say some things about spatial frequencies and the way they propagate in space <pause dur="0.6"/> and the other way to do it <pause dur="0.3"/> was direct mathematical way <pause dur="0.4"/> by using simple techniques of adding waves <pause dur="0.3"/> and calculating intensities <pause dur="0.2"/> and giving physical meanings to various <pause dur="0.4"/> mathematical results <pause dur="1.9"/> and that brings this lecture to an end <pause dur="0.9"/> thank you for your attention <pause dur="1.1"/> and # <pause dur="0.4"/> i'm sure you will <pause dur="0.2"/> all be pleased to hear <pause dur="0.3"/> that there is no workshop today and there is no second hour today <pause dur="0.3"/> so you're free to go home and <shift feature="voice" new="laugh"/>enjoy your weekend <shift feature="voice" new="normal"/><pause dur="0.7"/> and as about the marks because some people <pause dur="0.2"/> asked me <pause dur="0.2"/> at the beginning of the lecture i haven't done your marking yet <pause dur="0.4"/> i will have by Monday <pause dur="0.5"/> but <pause dur="0.2"/> the gentleman who deals with giving you the marks is Dr <gap reason="name" extent="2 words"/> <pause dur="0.3"/> so don't know when you will know the results of the of the examination you have to ask him <pause dur="1.2"/> that's it
