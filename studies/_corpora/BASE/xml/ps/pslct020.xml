<u who="nm0827"> now today we're going to talk about <pause dur="0.2"/> fatigue <pause dur="1.1"/> and that doesn't mean that i'm going to <pause dur="0.3"/> pack the lecture in half way through because i'm worn out <pause dur="0.9"/> although with you lot <pause dur="1.0"/> the ability to feel knackered after a lecture is very easy <pause dur="0.2"/> i will say that <pause dur="1.0"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> you've all got i hope this piece of <pause dur="0.3"/> paper these notes come on <pause dur="1.2"/> which i've given out <pause dur="0.2"/> take this please <pause dur="2.8"/> we're not going to get on to this yet <pause dur="0.2"/> but we will in a moment <pause dur="0.9"/> now <pause dur="0.4"/> fatigue <pause dur="0.4"/> is a strange <pause dur="0.6"/> phenomenon <pause dur="0.8"/> and it's <pause dur="0.2"/> to do <pause dur="0.2"/> with <pause dur="1.1"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="7"/> loading <pause dur="1.8"/> which varies <pause dur="6.8"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="11"/> it varies <pause dur="1.8"/> so in other words it's oscillating <pause dur="0.4"/> well here's some good words <pause dur="0.3"/> oscillating <pause dur="0.3"/> or fluctuating <pause dur="3.8"/> loads <pause dur="1.2"/> so a classic example of this would be a car going over a bumpy road what's <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> does the # <pause dur="0.2"/> suspension experience <pause dur="0.6"/> what about an out of balance piece of machinery <pause dur="0.5"/> some pieces of machinery of course are deliberately out of balance <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> if you want to crush things you very often will have an out of balance thing to give a 
sort of hammer effect <pause dur="0.8"/> and <pause dur="0.4"/> things like jackhammers that you use for <pause dur="0.5"/> # making holes in the road <pause dur="0.5"/> these also <pause dur="0.3"/> are <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> they're not out of balance but they're <trunc>c</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> controlled by air <pause dur="0.5"/> yep <pause dur="3.1"/> we're on air so be on your best behaviour <pause dur="2.2"/> so <pause dur="0.5"/><vocal desc="sigh" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.6"/> rotating machinery <pause dur="1.1"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="3"/> is <pause dur="2.0"/> a very important example of this and we'll come on to an example of that at the end <pause dur="0.3"/> as a sort of case study which is what you've got your <pause dur="0.5"/> # notes on <pause dur="1.3"/> now <pause dur="0.9"/> the <pause dur="0.5"/> simplest way <pause dur="0.2"/> to understand fatigue and indeed to understand the history <pause dur="0.5"/> how how it came to be <pause dur="0.5"/> a <pause dur="0.2"/> topic <pause dur="0.7"/> is to consider <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="7"/> what happens in a spoked <pause dur="0.2"/> wheel <pause dur="1.9"/> so you have <pause dur="0.2"/> some sort of wheel it could be a horse and cart wheel it could be a bicycle wheel it could be a <pause dur="0.8"/> gun wheel i don't know anything you <trunc>wa</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> name it <pause dur="0.3"/> think of what it <pause dur="0.5"/> looks like <pause dur="0.4"/> now <pause dur="0.7"/> obviously <pause dur="0.3"/> if you have a wheel <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> let's say <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="2.9"/> right you'll get shot <pause dur="2.6"/> let's say that's the front wheel of your bike or something or other <pause dur="0.4"/> your weight on the frame <pause dur="0.4"/> pushes down <pause dur="0.9"/> on there <pause dur="0.3"/> so 
there is a vertical loading or a # <pause dur="0.3"/> an inclined loading <pause dur="0.5"/> on <pause dur="0.3"/> the axle <pause dur="0.2"/> which is here <pause dur="1.0"/> okay <pause dur="0.2"/> so you've got that <pause dur="1.0"/> now <pause dur="0.7"/> the question then is what prevents the fork of the bike going into the ground <pause dur="0.3"/> well obviously because the wheel is pushing back on the end of the fork <pause dur="0.4"/> so that if we take that spoke as an example <pause dur="0.4"/> this spoke is pushing back <pause dur="1.5"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="9"/> but because the hub if you like does come down a bit because you've got a tyre it's squidgy <pause dur="0.4"/> the <pause dur="0.3"/> spoke above <pause dur="0.2"/> is coming down <pause dur="0.6"/> so if you think about it the upper spoke is in tension <pause dur="0.4"/> and the lower <pause dur="0.2"/> spoke <pause dur="0.3"/> is in <pause dur="0.2"/> compression <pause dur="0.9"/> at that <trunc>p</trunc> particular instant <pause dur="0.5"/> and so if the vehicle is stationary <pause dur="0.5"/> that is a stress pattern <pause dur="0.3"/> which will be there <pause dur="0.5"/> # as long as you leave it in that condition <pause dur="1.3"/> if you consider other spokes at angles well they have <pause dur="0.3"/> some load in them <pause dur="0.4"/> # <trunc>w</trunc> i'm not going to bother <pause dur="0.3"/> to work out <pause dur="0.6"/> how you <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> calculate what <pause dur="0.5"/> <trunc>f</trunc> force is in the spokes <pause dur="0.4"/> but the general idea is that below <pause dur="0.5"/> the middle <pause dur="0.5"/> there is compression and above <pause dur="0.5"/> the <pause dur="0.2"/> middle <pause dur="0.2"/> there is tension <pause dur="1.7"/> now the 
next question is what happens when this thing starts to move <pause dur="1.1"/> so that <pause dur="0.2"/> this now goes forward <pause dur="0.2"/> so that that point there <pause dur="1.0"/><kinesic desc="indicates point on board" iterated="n"/> # if we move the wheel <pause dur="0.2"/> along we rotate it through <pause dur="0.4"/> # a hundred-and-<pause dur="0.2"/>eighty degrees <pause dur="0.6"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="12"/> what happens <pause dur="1.8"/> well what we find of course is that that <pause dur="0.2"/> blobbed point there <pause dur="0.8"/> is now down here <pause dur="0.7"/> and so here are the spokes <pause dur="0.2"/> et cetera et cetera <pause dur="1.1"/> and so what it means is that that spoke <pause dur="0.2"/> which was above the axis <pause dur="0.2"/> is now below <pause dur="0.9"/> and what was below <pause dur="0.2"/> a hundred-and-eighty degrees later is now above <pause dur="1.2"/> but the stress state <pause dur="0.4"/> what the wheel has to do to hold the thing up <pause dur="0.3"/> is exactly the same as before <pause dur="0.6"/> so this bottom thing is in compression <pause dur="0.4"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> the top one <pause dur="0.2"/> is in <pause dur="0.3"/> tension still <pause dur="1.2"/> but this one <pause dur="0.3"/> was up there <pause dur="1.2"/> so what was in tension <pause dur="0.5"/> is now in compression <pause dur="0.7"/> and if you roll it another a hundred-and-eighty degrees it goes back to where it was <pause dur="0.6"/> and <pause dur="0.3"/> so <pause dur="0.3"/> the tension has become compression <pause dur="0.2"/> has become tension has become <trunc>pompre</trunc> # progression <pause dur="0.3"/><vocal desc="whistle" iterated="n"/> <pause dur="0.6"/> tension <pause dur="0.2"/> has become compression <pause dur="0.3"/> has become tension <pause dur="1.2"/> so if you were 
to plot this out <pause dur="0.5"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="45"/> as <pause dur="0.7"/> the force <pause dur="0.6"/> experienced <pause dur="0.4"/> by the spoke force in spoke <pause dur="0.6"/> against <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> rotation <pause dur="1.9"/> revolutions whatever you want to call it <pause dur="1.0"/> of the wheel <pause dur="2.2"/> what you'd have <pause dur="0.2"/> is <pause dur="0.7"/> a <pause dur="0.4"/> load up there <pause dur="0.2"/> if we consider one spoke <pause dur="0.3"/> tension <pause dur="0.7"/> it drops down to nothing when it's half way <pause dur="0.8"/> because the horizontal spokes don't have anything in them <pause dur="0.3"/> because they're not resisting any <pause dur="0.3"/> horizontal <pause dur="0.3"/> motion <pause dur="0.2"/> if <pause dur="0.3"/> the <pause dur="0.8"/> force is <pause dur="0.4"/> truly vertical <pause dur="0.7"/> and then <pause dur="0.3"/> going on a bit more <pause dur="0.4"/> it goes below <pause dur="0.5"/> and goes to an equal value <pause dur="0.4"/> but in <pause dur="0.5"/> compression and then it does this and so on and so forth <pause dur="2.3"/> and <pause dur="0.5"/> this <pause dur="0.5"/> you can show with a bit of trigonometry i'm not going to do it today <pause dur="0.2"/> but in fact it's a sine curve <pause dur="3.4"/> so the process of rolling or rotating a wheel or an axle or <pause dur="0.7"/> anything like that <pause dur="0.6"/> produces <pause dur="0.2"/> alternating <pause dur="0.2"/> tension and compression <pause dur="1.6"/> so that the <pause dur="0.4"/> spoke of the wheel <pause dur="0.3"/> is experiencing <pause dur="0.2"/> this <pause dur="0.3"/> phenomenon of <pause dur="0.5"/> a varying <pause dur="0.3"/> tension compression <pause dur="0.2"/> alternating <pause dur="0.3"/> fluctuating <pause dur="0.4"/> oscillating whatever the those words you wish to use <pause dur="1.3"/> and the question <pause dur="0.2"/> is 
well so what <pause dur="1.6"/> why should we be worried <pause dur="0.8"/> well we have to be worried <pause dur="0.2"/> because it turns out <pause dur="0.5"/> that this oscillating loading <pause dur="0.2"/> can <pause dur="0.2"/> break things <pause dur="0.2"/> can fail things <pause dur="0.5"/> at much <pause dur="0.3"/> lower <pause dur="0.2"/> stresses <pause dur="0.6"/> than you would <pause dur="0.6"/> work out <pause dur="0.2"/> on the basis of a simple <pause dur="0.3"/> single <pause dur="0.3"/> monotonic <pause dur="0.3"/> pull <pause dur="0.3"/> or push <pause dur="1.9"/> that's why it's important <pause dur="2.9"/> who first thought about this <pause dur="0.8"/> well you might think that people with <pause dur="0.2"/> horses and carts go up to the Museum of English Rural Life up the top of campus <pause dur="0.4"/> have a look in there you might have thought that farmers might have been interested in this <pause dur="0.7"/> and perhaps they were <pause dur="0.3"/> but if you think of the state of roads before eighteen-thirty forty or fifty or whatever <pause dur="0.5"/> they were sort of rutted tracks <pause dur="0.2"/> even the so-called turnpikes <pause dur="0.4"/> and therefore if anything broke it was probably because <pause dur="0.2"/> there was a big pothole in the road <pause dur="0.4"/> in the way that we all <pause dur="0.5"/> have problems with cars and bikes if we <pause dur="0.5"/> go over a <pause dur="0.6"/> what appears to be a puddle but in fact it's a <pause dur="0.5"/> like a <pause dur="0.2"/> bucket-shaped hole full of water and you damage your front 
suspension and so on <pause dur="1.0"/> so <pause dur="0.9"/> and what you've got <pause dur="0.4"/> is the problem <pause dur="0.2"/> of <pause dur="0.9"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> rotating <pause dur="0.2"/> machinery <pause dur="0.9"/> rotating wheels <pause dur="0.7"/> in the old days there were fractures but they never thought about it <pause dur="0.7"/> what <pause dur="0.2"/> made this an important subject <pause dur="0.2"/> was the growth of railways <pause dur="2.5"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="3"/> because for the first time you had a smooth <pause dur="0.2"/> track <pause dur="0.9"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="5"/> and you had <pause dur="0.3"/> wheels <pause dur="0.3"/> going along that smooth track <pause dur="1.7"/> and of course <pause dur="0.2"/> the engineers of the day <pause dur="0.4"/> although <pause dur="0.7"/> they were <pause dur="0.4"/> not <pause dur="0.6"/> # given all the materials that we have today we've done a bit of that a bit of the history wrought iron <pause dur="0.5"/> malleable iron <pause dur="0.2"/> et cetera et cetera Bessemer steel <pause dur="0.4"/> not coming along until the eighteen-fifties this in fact held up <pause dur="0.2"/> the <pause dur="0.5"/> growth of railways because all of the manual methods of making <pause dur="0.4"/> ductile <pause dur="0.4"/> # steel before that <trunc>han</trunc> before that time <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> nevertheless you had a reasonably smooth <pause dur="0.5"/> thing <pause dur="0.6"/> system with a reasonably smooth wheels and all the rest of it <pause dur="0.5"/> and what they discovered was that these axles were breaking the axles were breaking not so much the wheels <pause dur="0.5"/> they might have had spokes but 
they might have been solid wooden blocked wheels it doesn't matter <pause dur="0.9"/> why were the axles breaking <pause dur="0.4"/> well <pause dur="0.3"/> let's look <pause dur="0.2"/> at <pause dur="0.2"/> this picture <pause dur="0.7"/><kinesic desc="indicates point on board" iterated="n"/> but looking at it from the <pause dur="0.3"/> end this way <pause dur="0.3"/> and let it not be a bicycle wheel any more <pause dur="0.3"/> let it be <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> two wheels on an axle <pause dur="0.2"/> like a railway <pause dur="0.5"/> axle so this <pause dur="0.3"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="20"/> look at it sideways <pause dur="0.5"/> and you've got this <pause dur="0.3"/> sort of <pause dur="0.6"/> device <pause dur="0.8"/> and there <pause dur="0.4"/> is the <pause dur="0.6"/> axle <pause dur="2.2"/> and here is the wheel <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> and there is the <pause dur="0.8"/> the rail <pause dur="2.0"/> do you know <pause dur="0.4"/> by the way some clever <pause dur="0.9"/> character <pause dur="0.2"/> said there was a method of preventing <pause dur="0.4"/> trains coming off <pause dur="0.6"/> rails <pause dur="1.3"/> and what he said was <pause dur="0.5"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="16"/> that when you look end on like this what you actually need <pause dur="0.6"/> is a <pause dur="0.3"/> wheel <pause dur="1.1"/> which looks like this <pause dur="2.0"/> and the <pause dur="0.3"/> you know the rail is in there <pause dur="1.6"/> and so <pause dur="0.2"/> you know <pause dur="0.2"/> the wheel wouldn't come off <pause dur="2.8"/> that a good idea <pause dur="2.8"/> well it isn't a good idea <pause dur="0.4"/> but you know the original explanation for why it wasn't a good idea <pause dur="1.0"/> because they said that's no good <pause dur="0.3"/> you'd have to go to the end of the track to get the vehicles on <pause dur="3.4"/><vocal desc="laughter" n="ss" iterated="y" dur="1"/> think of it <pause dur="1.3"/> right <pause dur="0.6"/> now <pause dur="0.4"/> if you have <kinesic desc="indicates point on board" iterated="n"/> this system <pause dur="0.6"/> and if you have outside 
bearings <pause dur="0.3"/> so it's like a goods wagon with <pause dur="0.2"/> springs and so on <pause dur="0.8"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="5"/> there's the <pause dur="0.3"/> axle box <pause dur="0.3"/> there here's the spring the force is pushing down there <pause dur="1.5"/> so <pause dur="0.4"/> what does that do <pause dur="0.3"/> well obviously if you think about it <pause dur="0.3"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="6"/> it must bend the axle <pause dur="0.4"/> i'm exaggerating it but that's what <pause dur="0.3"/> happens the axle gets <pause dur="0.2"/> bent <pause dur="2.7"/> what happens when you bend a beam <pause dur="0.3"/> you've had <gap reason="name" extent="2 words"/>'s lectures last year <pause dur="0.5"/> when you bend a beam that bit goes into tension <pause dur="0.6"/> the <pause dur="0.2"/> underneath goes into compression <pause dur="1.4"/> that is a hogging beam remember the word hogging from <pause dur="0.6"/> pigs <pause dur="0.8"/> sagging and hogging that's hogging <pause dur="0.7"/> tension <pause dur="0.8"/> compression <pause dur="1.9"/> what happens <pause dur="0.2"/> a hundred-and-eighty degrees later <pause dur="0.3"/> well this bottom bit has gone on the top the top's gone on the bottom <pause dur="0.2"/> it's exactly the same as this it's the top and bottom of the axle now <pause dur="0.4"/> not the <pause dur="0.6"/> upper and lower spokes <pause dur="0.4"/> and so <pause dur="0.4"/> the <pause dur="0.3"/> stress state in that <pause dur="0.5"/> axle is exactly the same <pause dur="0.9"/> as <pause dur="0.3"/> the stress state in the spoke <pause dur="0.6"/> and in fact in those wheels if they were spoked wheels <pause dur="0.2"/> the spokes were being fatigued <pause dur="0.3"/> and the axles were also <pause dur="0.3"/> 
being <pause dur="0.3"/> fatigued <pause dur="1.4"/> anyway <pause dur="0.2"/> these <pause dur="0.3"/> axles <pause dur="0.2"/> began to break <pause dur="0.4"/> for no apparent reason <pause dur="0.8"/> and <pause dur="0.6"/> so <pause dur="0.6"/> the <pause dur="0.4"/> people in charge of the railways <pause dur="0.5"/> <trunc>s</trunc> thought well <pause dur="0.4"/> either we're not making the wheels very <pause dur="0.2"/> well <pause dur="0.2"/> or <pause dur="0.9"/> there is a problem <pause dur="0.3"/> that we don't understand <pause dur="0.7"/> and it was a problem that they didn't understand and the problem was this thing called fatigue <pause dur="0.9"/> and the man who <pause dur="0.5"/> started all this work off <pause dur="0.5"/> was an Austrian <pause dur="0.3"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="4"/> whose name was Wöhler <pause dur="0.7"/> that name keeps coming up <pause dur="1.1"/> W-O-umlaut-H-L-E-R Wöhler <pause dur="0.9"/> who was <pause dur="0.7"/> not sure what he was might be some sort of chief engineer of the Austrian railways one of the Austrian railway companies <pause dur="0.5"/> anyway he <pause dur="1.8"/> started to investigate this <pause dur="0.4"/> business <pause dur="1.0"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> he very cleverly <pause dur="0.4"/> came up <pause dur="0.2"/> with a sort of test <pause dur="0.6"/> which <pause dur="0.2"/> in many ways is still used as a fatigue test even <pause dur="0.3"/> today <pause dur="0.8"/> and the 
best way for you to think about it is to think of going downstairs into the workshop <pause dur="0.7"/> and going to one of <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> <pause dur="0.3"/> <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/>'s lathes <pause dur="0.5"/> and saying okay here <pause dur="0.4"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="4"/> is a chuck <pause dur="0.2"/> on the lathe <pause dur="1.1"/> can't spell <pause dur="0.2"/> chuck <pause dur="0.9"/> and what you do <pause dur="0.2"/> you have a <pause dur="0.2"/> normal round <pause dur="0.4"/> tensile <pause dur="0.3"/> test piece <pause dur="0.7"/> which you <pause dur="0.4"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="4"/> are used to <pause dur="0.2"/> so <pause dur="0.2"/> here is this round <pause dur="0.4"/> tensile test piece <pause dur="0.3"/> but instead of putting it in one of <gap reason="name" extent="2 words"/>'s machines and pulling it until it breaks or whatever you're doing <pause dur="0.6"/> what you do is you stuff one end into the chuck <pause dur="1.1"/> so you lock it in the chuck <pause dur="0.4"/> and if you <pause dur="0.3"/> turned the lathe on <pause dur="0.2"/> the thing would <pause dur="0.2"/> rotate <pause dur="2.1"/> but what Wöhler then did was to say right <pause dur="0.3"/> at this end <pause dur="0.2"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="3"/> i'm going to put some sort of collar <pause dur="0.5"/> with <pause dur="0.5"/> roller bearings or ball bearings it doesn't matter <pause dur="0.6"/> so here's looking <pause dur="0.2"/> from the end elevation <pause dur="0.8"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="7"/> there <pause dur="0.4"/> is the specimen <pause dur="0.4"/> here is a sort of collar <pause dur="0.2"/> going round it with <pause dur="0.9"/> ball bearings and things like that <pause dur="0.4"/> and from that <pause dur="0.2"/> you hang a weight you put a mass on it <pause dur="1.4"/> and so <pause dur="0.2"/> 
obviously <pause dur="0.6"/> the weight <pause dur="0.2"/> on the end of this thing <pause dur="0.5"/> what is it <pause dur="0.2"/> it's a cantilever <pause dur="0.4"/> and it's like the things that you solved in part one <pause dur="1.0"/> so you can work out the deflection you can work out the bending stress and you can do everything else <pause dur="3.7"/> and what happens well <pause dur="0.5"/> the cantilever the top is tension the bottom's compression <pause dur="1.1"/> hundred-and-eighty degrees later <pause dur="1.3"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="4"/> the <pause dur="0.4"/> compression has become tension and the tension has become <trunc>p</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> compression et cetera et cetera <pause dur="1.4"/> and old Wöhler <pause dur="0.5"/> very clever <pause dur="0.6"/> he started to do <pause dur="0.3"/> tests <pause dur="2.1"/> what sort of tests did he do <pause dur="1.7"/> he put different weights <pause dur="0.4"/> on <pause dur="1.3"/> these <pause dur="0.2"/> test pieces <pause dur="0.8"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="9"/> so he changed <pause dur="0.2"/> this <pause dur="1.2"/> W <pause dur="0.5"/> weight <pause dur="1.6"/> and he rotated the lathe <pause dur="1.3"/> and he found out <pause dur="0.3"/> how many rotations it took <pause dur="0.4"/> before <pause dur="0.4"/> the specimen broke <pause dur="2.3"/> all right <pause dur="2.0"/> and <pause dur="0.5"/> he then <pause dur="0.6"/> plotted <pause dur="1.4"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="12"/> the load <pause dur="1.5"/> against the number of cycles N <pause dur="0.2"/> cycles <pause dur="0.6"/> to failure <pause dur="0.8"/> and failure here is breakage <pause dur="3.3"/> i say it's breakage because of course <pause dur="0.6"/> you could define failure <pause dur="0.3"/> and <pause dur="0.5"/> in <pause dur="0.4"/> part three i'll teach you plasticity and failure of course could be <pause dur="0.3"/> permanently being bent <pause dur="1.1"/> obviously if 
an axle <pause dur="0.5"/> permanently gets bent it's not much good as an axle <pause dur="1.1"/> # so you always design within the elastic stress range we've already been through this in this course <pause dur="1.1"/> so he's got load <kinesic desc="indicates point on board" iterated="n"/> he's got number of cycles to failure <pause dur="0.4"/> now <pause dur="0.5"/> if you have <pause dur="0.5"/> no cycles <pause dur="0.8"/> it's really just bending bending bending bending bending until it breaks <pause dur="0.9"/> and that's like a static quasi-static test <pause dur="0.5"/> and you'd have a a value there <pause dur="0.5"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="2"/> say <pause dur="3.1"/> if you then <pause dur="0.3"/> increase <pause dur="0.3"/> the weight <pause dur="1.1"/> and <pause dur="0.6"/> start the machine up <pause dur="0.8"/> and <pause dur="0.6"/> wait for something to happen <pause dur="0.5"/> you'll find <pause dur="0.5"/> that <pause dur="0.7"/> the <pause dur="0.7"/> lifetime or the number of cycles to failure <pause dur="1.0"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="12"/> is <pause dur="0.8"/> lower <pause dur="2.1"/> in other words <pause dur="0.8"/> if you want the thing to last <pause dur="1.4"/> a hundred cycles a thousand cycles <pause dur="1.4"/> it will only take a certain load <pause dur="0.4"/> and then it'll break <pause dur="1.5"/> he puts <pause dur="1.2"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="1"/> more weights on <pause dur="0.4"/> and he finds that he <pause dur="0.9"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="9"/> can <pause dur="0.6"/> go out <pause dur="0.3"/> there <pause dur="1.5"/> more cycles lower <pause dur="0.2"/> loads <pause dur="0.4"/> so these loads are dropping <pause dur="0.6"/> all the time <pause dur="0.9"/> and he finds <pause dur="0.2"/> that sort of behaviour <pause dur="2.1"/> and that is a <pause dur="0.2"/> classic <pause dur="0.2"/> sort <pause dur="0.2"/> of so-called fatigue curve <pause dur="1.7"/> and in the literature <pause dur="0.3"/> you'll find these things called <pause dur="0.2"/> <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="5"/> 
S-<pause dur="1.3"/>N <pause dur="0.4"/> curves <pause dur="1.3"/> now <pause dur="0.4"/> we these days use sigma <pause dur="0.2"/> for stress <pause dur="1.1"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> and <trunc>h</trunc> originally of course he used load <pause dur="0.2"/> but you can convert it to stress <sic corr="very">verily</sic> easy <pause dur="0.2"/> easily using bending theory <pause dur="1.6"/> so <pause dur="0.4"/> in the books you'll find that <pause dur="0.2"/> called very often an S-N curve <pause dur="0.4"/> and it means a fatigue curve <pause dur="6.0"/> now <pause dur="0.9"/> because <pause dur="0.4"/> these numbers of cycles in fact are very high they go into the millions <pause dur="0.9"/> you don't normally <pause dur="0.2"/> plot it on Cartesian coordinates <pause dur="1.0"/> you can have load or stress <pause dur="0.2"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="9"/> here <pause dur="0.4"/> in <pause dur="0.3"/> Cartesian coordinates <pause dur="0.4"/> but here <pause dur="0.2"/> you have the log <pause dur="0.4"/> you do it on a semi-log plot <pause dur="0.4"/> of log <pause dur="0.2"/> numbers of cycles <pause dur="1.3"/> and what you find <pause dur="0.6"/> more or less <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="6"/> is that the data follow <pause dur="0.5"/> some sort of falling line like that <pause dur="1.0"/> and maybe <pause dur="0.3"/> that's <pause dur="0.2"/> ten-to-the-six so that's a million cycles <pause dur="0.5"/> ten-five ten-four ten-three thousand cycles <pause dur="0.5"/> hundred cycles <pause dur="0.3"/> ten and <pause dur="1.0"/> et cetera one remember there's <trunc>no</trunc> not a zero <pause dur="0.2"/> on a log scale <pause dur="0.2"/> what's the log of zero <pause dur="2.0"/> come on what <pause dur="2.2"/> what is it </u><u who="sm0828" trans="overlap"> <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 word"/> </u><pause dur="0.4"/> <u who="nm0827" trans="pause"> log of zero <pause dur="0.5"/> no the log of one is zero what's the log of zero </u><u who="sm0829" trans="overlap"> <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/></u><pause dur="2.8"/> <u who="nm0827" trans="pause"> it may be in Dublin dear boy

your stresses below this endurance limit <pause dur="0.8"/> then you have an <pause dur="0.3"/> infinite <pause dur="0.2"/> life <pause dur="3.3"/> so you can have <pause dur="0.3"/> a life forever <pause dur="0.8"/> providing <pause dur="0.4"/> you <pause dur="0.8"/> recognize that there is an endurance limit <pause dur="0.5"/> or what is sometimes called a fatigue <pause dur="0.2"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="6"/> limit <pause dur="2.2"/> i'll explain there is a difference and i'll explain that in a minute <pause dur="0.8"/> but fatigue limit or endurance limit <pause dur="0.5"/> and that happens for steels <pause dur="7.3"/> now <pause dur="3.7"/> if you <pause dur="3.6"/> don't <pause dur="0.6"/> test it just in bending which is what we've <pause dur="0.2"/> been doing here <pause dur="0.7"/> you might for example <pause dur="0.4"/> want to test something in axial fatigue so you would have your specimen in the usual way <pause dur="0.6"/> but you would <pause dur="0.2"/> oscillate it <pause dur="0.2"/> in the axial direction <pause dur="0.2"/> this would be like trying to <pause dur="0.4"/> estimate what's going on with the spokes <pause dur="1.2"/> 'cause they're going <pause dur="0.5"/> tension compression tension <trunc>compre</trunc> <pause dur="0.3"/> but in <pause dur="0.6"/> unidirectional loading not in bending <pause dur="0.5"/> is there a difference <pause dur="0.9"/> can you make a machine <pause dur="0.3"/> which <pause dur="0.2"/> does this well of course you can do it on the types of testing machines down in <gap reason="name" extent="2 words"/>'s lab <pause dur="0.6"/> these are screw-driven machines <pause dur="0.4"/> and if you think about it you just drive 
the screw one way drive the screw the other way and you can do <pause dur="0.2"/> this <pause dur="1.8"/> you might be saying to yourself well <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> it's all very well <pause dur="0.2"/> talking about rotation <pause dur="0.4"/> speed <pause dur="0.2"/> of oscillation frequency of oscillation <pause dur="0.3"/> but does <pause dur="0.3"/> how fast you do it matter <pause dur="0.6"/> is there a difference between sort of oscillating very slowly <pause dur="0.5"/> and <pause dur="0.3"/> oscillating <pause dur="0.3"/> you know like a <pause dur="0.9"/> i don't know <pause dur="1.0"/> a # <pause dur="0.2"/> bird flaps its wings or something else something very very fast <pause dur="0.4"/> and the answer is yes there is <pause dur="0.9"/> and it's particularly important in things like plastics <pause dur="0.6"/> where because you are <pause dur="0.3"/> oscillating the load you're obviously doing work <pause dur="0.5"/> force point of application <pause dur="0.6"/> that work <pause dur="0.3"/> becomes heat <pause dur="0.6"/> in a metal <pause dur="0.2"/> the heat tends to be dissipated but in plastics it tends to be localized where the thing is happening <pause dur="0.7"/> that then alters as we saw the other week <pause dur="0.3"/> the properties <pause dur="1.0"/> the strength varies with the temperature and the speed at which you're doing it and so on <pause dur="0.4"/> so the speed does matter <pause dur="0.8"/> but <pause dur="1.2"/> whilst in the lab with the <gap reason="name" extent="2 words"/> type machine <pause dur="0.2"/><kinesic desc="indicates point on board" iterated="n"/> the oscillation rate is <pause dur="0.6"/> pretty 
limited <pause dur="0.3"/> pretty limited <pause dur="0.6"/> you can have very <pause dur="0.2"/> fast <pause dur="0.2"/> <trunc>v</trunc> <pause dur="0.7"/> axial oscillations <pause dur="0.5"/> and the firm that <pause dur="0.2"/> invented the <pause dur="1.0"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="2"/> method of doing this is a firm called Amsler <pause dur="0.4"/> who are in Switzerland <pause dur="0.6"/> and what they did was really very clever <pause dur="0.7"/> because <pause dur="0.3"/> they <pause dur="0.2"/> attached what amounts to a whacking great big <pause dur="0.2"/> tuning fork <pause dur="0.2"/> to the bottom of the specimen <pause dur="0.8"/> i mean a big one <pause dur="0.5"/> really big <pause dur="1.1"/> the biggest Amsler machines the tuning fork would be <pause dur="0.3"/> about <pause dur="0.3"/> the size of <pause dur="0.3"/> where i am here <pause dur="1.2"/> and you can get that resonating <pause dur="0.6"/> and of course it puts the <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> device into <pause dur="0.3"/> oscillation <pause dur="0.9"/> and you <pause dur="0.5"/> by altering the amplitude of the tuning fork <pause dur="0.2"/> you <pause dur="0.2"/> alter the load you can set this on the machine <pause dur="0.8"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> then you can generate <pause dur="0.4"/> # these same sort of data <pause dur="0.9"/> well what do you get <pause dur="0.4"/> what do you get what do you get well <pause dur="0.9"/> it's like this <pause dur="0.5"/> but <pause dur="0.6"/> this plot if i say this is bending pure bending <pause dur="1.0"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="1"/> if you have the <pause dur="0.3"/> axial thing <pause dur="0.5"/> this <pause dur="0.7"/> says the same sort of thing <pause dur="0.3"/> but <pause dur="0.4"/> goes to a lower <pause dur="0.2"/> value <pause dur="0.4"/> before it <pause dur="0.2"/> levels out <pause dur="1.4"/> so this would be axial <pause dur="1.0"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="1"/> fatigue <pause dur="2.7"/> and you might also say <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> well what about other methods of 
loading <pause dur="0.6"/> what about if we <pause dur="0.2"/> twist things you've heard of torsional suspensions on motor cars <pause dur="0.5"/> what happens if you think of having <pause dur="0.2"/> a tube or a rod <pause dur="0.3"/> which itself is <pause dur="0.4"/> not <pause dur="0.2"/> being twisted monotonically but is fluctuating in the twist what happens there <pause dur="0.7"/> well <pause dur="0.4"/> # the same sort of thing <pause dur="0.3"/> but this time <pause dur="0.2"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="4"/> it goes down <pause dur="0.3"/> <trunc>h</trunc> even lower <pause dur="1.8"/> down to there <pause dur="0.3"/> not drawn that very well <pause dur="2.1"/> so that this endurance limit <pause dur="0.4"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="6"/> although <pause dur="0.4"/> it's very good <pause dur="2.7"/> the values that you have depend on the mode <pause dur="0.5"/> of <pause dur="0.9"/> deformation so bending to axial <pause dur="0.5"/> # to torsion to twist <pause dur="6.6"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="5"/> now <pause dur="1.0"/> # before the days of what's called fracture mechanics which is the subject i shall teach you next term <pause dur="0.6"/> where we are talking about the progression of cracks <pause dur="0.5"/> through bodies <pause dur="0.2"/> before that time <pause dur="0.9"/> people <pause dur="1.1"/> were <pause dur="1.8"/> limited in a sense as to what they could use for data <pause dur="0.4"/> and they tended rightly or wrongly <pause dur="0.5"/> to reference everything to the simple tension test <pause dur="0.8"/> so in the simple tension test which you know about <pause dur="0.5"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="10"/> load against extension or stress against strain <pause dur="0.5"/> # engineering stress and 
strain <pause dur="1.0"/> there is your yield <pause dur="0.9"/> there is the <pause dur="0.2"/> ultimate tensile strength we discussed this in the corresponding lectures in part one <pause dur="0.6"/> so what these <pause dur="1.1"/> chaps <pause dur="0.2"/> did from about eighteen-fifty up until well up until the second war and even now in fact <pause dur="0.5"/> for a for an empirical sort of <trunc>corre</trunc> correlation <pause dur="0.3"/> they said <pause dur="0.3"/> what's that value bend or axial or torsion <pause dur="0.3"/> as a proportion of something that i can easily measure <pause dur="0.5"/> and the thing that they could easily measure was the ultimate tensile strength <pause dur="0.2"/> 
maximum load over the starting area <pause dur="1.6"/> all right <pause dur="1.0"/> so <pause dur="1.0"/> when you look at these types of diagrams <pause dur="0.4"/> you will find labelled on to the diagrams <pause dur="0.4"/> what these levels are <pause dur="1.0"/> so <pause dur="0.3"/> if i <pause dur="1.3"/> just rub that out <pause dur="0.4"/> put them in again <pause dur="2.3"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="8"/> you'll find that the <pause dur="0.2"/> bending-only one <pause dur="0.4"/> is about <pause dur="0.2"/> and it's very rough <pause dur="0.3"/> about point-five of the U-T-S <pause dur="0.7"/> so in other words if you had a piece of steel with a U-T-S of about three-hundred megapascals <pause dur="0.4"/> # that value for pure bending <pause dur="0.4"/> pure reverse bending Wöhler bending would be about <pause dur="0.4"/> # three-hundred-over-two <pause dur="0.2"/> which is a hundred-and-fifty <pause dur="1.8"/> if you have the <pause dur="0.3"/> axial fatigue <pause dur="0.5"/> that value is about <pause dur="0.2"/> point-four-three of U-T-S <pause dur="0.7"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="2"/> i don't know that i believe the point-three <pause dur="0.6"/> i suppose i believe the point-four <pause dur="0.2"/> but it's that sort of thing <pause dur="1.2"/> and if you go down to torsion <pause dur="0.6"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="2"/> the <pause dur="0.8"/> lowest one there <pause dur="0.3"/> it's about point-three of the U-T-S <pause dur="0.7"/> so again a three-hundred megapascal very weak <pause dur="0.3"/> low carbon steel in torsion <pause dur="0.5"/> would not <pause dur="0.2"/> take <pause dur="0.7"/> more <pause dur="0.3"/> than <pause dur="0.4"/> three-hundred-over-three <pause dur="1.0"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> about <pause dur="0.2"/> a hundred <trunc>megapa</trunc> pascals <pause dur="0.3"/> reversed <pause dur="0.2"/> twist <pause dur="0.5"/> so you need to 
think about that if you're designing a torsional suspension for a motor car <pause dur="2.4"/> now then <pause dur="2.4"/> this is all very well <pause dur="1.6"/> but <pause dur="1.7"/> is it true for all materials <pause dur="0.5"/> and unfortunately the answer it is not true <pause dur="0.4"/> for all materials <pause dur="1.7"/> what i've drawn there <pause dur="0.2"/> with these endurance limits <pause dur="0.5"/> are true <pause dur="0.6"/> only <pause dur="0.3"/> of <pause dur="0.2"/> irons and steels <pause dur="0.3"/> <unclear>as</unclear> <pause dur="0.2"/> for practical purposes <pause dur="0.7"/> titanium and one or two other funny things perhaps <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> have these sort of features <pause dur="0.6"/> but <pause dur="0.5"/> the important thing <pause dur="0.3"/> is and in particularly in terms of normal engineering <pause dur="0.4"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="13"/> is that aluminium alloys <pause dur="4.0"/> do not have <pause dur="0.9"/> there's no fatigue limit <pause dur="3.2"/> so if you were to plot these types of things for aluminium alloys <pause dur="0.5"/> you would have this just going down and down and down and down and down <pause dur="2.5"/> and <pause dur="1.2"/> so <pause dur="0.3"/> if <pause dur="0.2"/> ten-to-the-six a million cycles <pause dur="0.5"/> is the endurance limit for <pause dur="0.5"/> # steels <pause dur="0.6"/> then <pause dur="0.7"/> it doesn't level out <pause dur="0.14"/> for <pause dur="0.2"/> most <pause dur="0.3"/> aluminium <pause dur="0.2"/> alloys <pause dur="2.5"/> you check <pause dur="0.2"/> in the books <pause dur="0.6"/> which particular metals obey <pause dur="0.5"/> the endurance limit idea <pause dur="0.3"/> and which don't <pause dur="1.2"/> the <pause dur="0.5"/> important ones <pause dur="0.4"/> 
as i say are the ferrous <pause dur="0.2"/> and <pause dur="0.4"/> aluminium <pause dur="0.2"/> alloys <pause dur="1.2"/> but what does that mean <pause dur="1.0"/> what does that mean if you want to design an aeroplane <pause dur="0.6"/> which is made <pause dur="0.2"/> mostly <pause dur="0.2"/> out <pause dur="0.2"/> of <pause dur="0.6"/> aluminium <pause dur="0.4"/> alloys </u><pause dur="2.7"/> <u who="sm0830" trans="pause"> has to be scrapped after ten years <gap reason="inaudible" extent="2 secs"/> </u><u who="nm0827" trans="overlap"> <vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" dur="1"/> <pause dur="0.5"/> ten years <pause dur="0.5"/> no well good idea <pause dur="0.5"/> well <pause dur="0.2"/> the implication of this is that of course you cannot design for infinite life <pause dur="0.5"/> that is very true <pause dur="1.3"/> and what it does say is that you have to be very very careful about inspections <pause dur="1.1"/> you have to look for cracks it's cracks that we're dealing round to and i'll be showing you some pictures of fatigues in a minute <pause dur="0.9"/> you have to look <pause dur="0.2"/> for <pause dur="0.5"/> # cracks <pause dur="0.6"/> now <pause dur="1.0"/> of course <pause dur="0.2"/> if you have <pause dur="0.4"/> a piece of steel <pause dur="0.6"/> and you <pause dur="1.1"/> are <pause dur="0.2"/> in an application where <pause dur="0.7"/> you don't want it to last <pause dur="0.3"/> more than a million cycles <pause dur="0.8"/> then you don't have to limit yourself to working below here you can work up here <pause dur="1.3"/> and a typical example of that would be a gun barrel <pause dur="0.5"/> think of the old naval guns <pause dur="0.2"/> you know twelve inch shells whatever <pause dur="0.7"/> i'm reading a book at the moment by Edmund Blunden called Undertones of War 
about all the ghastly things in the trenches in the First World War and he goes on about these <pause dur="0.4"/> whizz-bangs that go over <pause dur="0.5"/> and <pause dur="0.3"/> you know these are <pause dur="0.2"/> ten inch shells which just plop in the mud <pause dur="0.2"/> and they're duds they don't go off <pause dur="1.3"/> if they do go off <pause dur="0.3"/> he wouldn't have been around to <pause dur="0.6"/> write the book <pause dur="0.8"/> anyway these big gun barrels you're not going to fire that barrel <pause dur="0.3"/> a million times <pause dur="0.2"/> naval guns <pause dur="0.4"/> if you read Jane's Ships and things like that naval guns <pause dur="1.0"/> those big guns were not even after things like Jutland were not fired that many times <pause dur="0.6"/> so you might argue <pause dur="0.4"/> that you could be in a thousand cycles <pause dur="0.2"/> and so you could design <pause dur="0.4"/> at the higher stress level <pause dur="1.2"/> if you design at the higher stress level of course you want less material <pause dur="0.8"/> so it's this weight <pause dur="0.2"/> business that comes into this <pause dur="1.4"/> and this is important in relation to aluminium because of you know <pause dur="0.4"/> space vehicles aerospace <pause dur="0.5"/> light<pause dur="0.3"/>weight <pause dur="0.5"/> materials <pause dur="0.3"/> very high specific strengths toughnesses and so on and so forth <pause dur="0.5"/> so <pause dur="0.9"/> you don't have to go 
below there but if you want the thing to last for a long time and you don't want your customers coming back and saying oi i you know bought something from you and it's broken <pause dur="0.5"/> you don't want to have the reputation of being the Arthur Daley of # engineering design or whatever it is <pause dur="0.5"/> then you have to <pause dur="0.2"/> think about these things and of course there are standards which say <pause dur="0.4"/> you <pause dur="0.2"/> must <pause dur="0.2"/> design below these stresses if it satisfies this particular standard <pause dur="0.7"/> but you don't have to and in some circumstances you needn't <pause dur="0.6"/> but the problem is <pause dur="0.4"/> that <pause dur="0.3"/> although this part of the diagram is called the <pause dur="0.3"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="3"/> finite <pause dur="0.3"/> life <pause dur="1.2"/> region and of course this is the infinite <pause dur="0.2"/> life <pause dur="0.5"/> region <pause dur="0.9"/> you have a problem with the 
aluminium alloys 'cause you don't know where you are <pause dur="0.7"/> because it's all <pause dur="0.3"/> finite <pause dur="0.2"/> life <pause dur="5.3"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="5"/> there is not an infinite life with those things <pause dur="1.8"/> you've still got a design <pause dur="0.2"/> you still have to tell people how good or how bad <pause dur="0.3"/> aluminium alloys are <pause dur="0.5"/> so what happens is you still quote <pause dur="0.3"/> this value here <pause dur="0.6"/> in the same way that you quote this value here <pause dur="0.3"/> even though it <pause dur="0.2"/> doesn't <pause dur="0.2"/> plateau <pause dur="0.2"/> out <pause dur="1.8"/> and you don't call it the endurance limit <pause dur="0.6"/> you call it the fatigue limit which was the other word you see <pause dur="1.7"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="2"/> # those of us like me who tend to be a bit sloppy we use the things <trunc>in</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> interchangeably <pause dur="0.8"/> but strictly endurance limit is the ferrous thing and fatigue limit is a chosen value <pause dur="0.7"/> at a given number of cycles
