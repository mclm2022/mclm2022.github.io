<u who="nm0863"> # a number of you went to the first year discussion evening yesterday <pause dur="1.4"/> and <pause dur="3.1"/> i wasn't able to be there myself but if any of you here <pause dur="0.4"/> have any feedback about <pause dur="0.7"/> this particular course that you'd like to relay to me <pause dur="0.8"/> that came up at that meeting i'd be very grateful to hear it so come and see me <pause dur="0.9"/> after the session if there are any special points that i can address <pause dur="2.1"/> let's just cast our mind back over the last two weeks what have we been doing in this course <pause dur="3.4"/> we've been <pause dur="0.4"/> looking at arithmetic from <pause dur="0.8"/> a new point of view <pause dur="0.9"/> we've taken familiar ideas like <pause dur="0.2"/> adding subtracting multiplying dividing <pause dur="0.5"/> ordinary numbers <pause dur="1.6"/> and <pause dur="0.6"/> looking at them from <pause dur="0.8"/> different structural viewpoints through division with remainder Euclid's algorithm <pause dur="0.9"/> using that to <pause dur="3.3"/> prove formally <pause dur="0.6"/> the fundamental theorem of arithmetic which says every <pause dur="0.2"/> natural number can be <pause dur="0.2"/> uniquely <pause dur="0.3"/> expressed as a product of prime powers <pause dur="1.4"/> we've also taken time out to <pause dur="0.6"/> study very quickly <pause dur="0.2"/> the complex numbers those of you who hadn't <pause dur="0.4"/> met them before <pause dur="0.3"/> are strongly advised to <pause dur="1.2"/> get plenty of practice at 
using them and if you have trouble with the ideas to consult <pause dur="0.9"/> a mate <pause dur="0.4"/> a buddy who does know about them <pause dur="2.3"/> and # <pause dur="2.8"/> we also # <pause dur="0.9"/> took time out to study <pause dur="2.4"/> mathematical induction <pause dur="2.2"/><kinesic desc="puts on transparency" iterated="n"/> and # <pause dur="0.4"/> i thought you'd be amused to see this <pause dur="0.5"/><vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" n="ss" dur="1"/> alternative <pause dur="0.2"/> image <pause dur="0.8"/> for the <pause dur="0.4"/> falling dominoes <pause dur="0.8"/> as an indication of how induction works <pause dur="4.4"/> so basically <pause dur="0.5"/> we've been doing two things we've been bridging the gap <pause dur="1.0"/> looking at <pause dur="0.2"/> arithmetic in a <pause dur="0.9"/> a more professional way <pause dur="0.6"/> and we've been <pause dur="1.1"/> filling a gap <pause dur="0.4"/> of knowledge in <pause dur="1.0"/> complex numbers <pause dur="0.3"/> and we've been studying <pause dur="0.7"/> at least one method of proof namely <pause dur="0.5"/> mathematical induction <pause dur="0.4"/> well today i want to focus on the <pause dur="1.3"/> foundations aspect of the course <pause dur="1.7"/><kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="3"/> and i want to go <pause dur="1.4"/> right back to the very beginning <pause dur="6.3"/> do you <pause dur="0.2"/> read these notes i produced do you actually read them or do you <pause dur="1.0"/> i mean in your own time <pause dur="0.3"/> they are meant to be read i don't have <pause dur="0.6"/> time within the lecture to read out every word <pause dur="0.5"/> and i hope you do <pause dur="2.2"/> look for the # <pause dur="0.4"/> the details when you <pause dur="0.2"/> take them away <pause dur="1.1"/> i hope the <pause dur="0.2"/> assignments i set give you the 
motivation to go away and read them <pause dur="1.1"/> # <pause dur="0.8"/> today we're <pause dur="1.4"/> talking about the fact that mathematics could be entirely based <pause dur="0.2"/> on set theory <pause dur="0.4"/> and that the notion of a set <pause dur="1.5"/> is <pause dur="0.3"/> a primitive <pause dur="0.2"/> undefined <pause dur="0.4"/> concept <pause dur="2.0"/> and i'd like to make the point that <pause dur="0.6"/> however good your dictionary is <pause dur="0.7"/> it cannot define <pause dur="0.4"/> everything <pause dur="0.4"/> without <pause dur="0.3"/> some kind of <pause dur="0.6"/> circular definition <pause dur="1.3"/> and <pause dur="0.4"/> to check this out i took a couple of words at random <pause dur="0.9"/> # and i pursued them <pause dur="0.2"/> through a list of definitions <pause dur="0.6"/> mathematics <pause dur="0.3"/> the science of magnitude and number <pause dur="0.8"/> i looked up science <vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.6"/> <reading>knowledge ascertained by observation <pause dur="0.5"/> and experiment critically tested systematized brought under general principals <pause dur="0.9"/> knowledge <pause dur="0.2"/> that which is known <pause dur="0.6"/> to know is to be informed of</reading> and then we get our first circular definition <pause dur="0.5"/> <reading>to inform is to pass on knowledge</reading> so at some point <pause dur="0.4"/> you must reach words in the dictionary which cannot be <pause dur="0.5"/> defined <pause dur="1.3"/> without making a circular argument <pause dur="2.6"/> i looked up another word at random i don't know <kinesic desc="reveals covered part of transparency" iterated="n"/> why i chose cow <pause dur="0.5"/> but it very 
quickly became <pause dur="0.7"/> circular <pause dur="1.3"/> cow <reading>the female <pause dur="0.3"/> bovine animals <pause dur="0.4"/> bovine <pause dur="0.3"/> of or pertaining to cattle <pause dur="1.4"/> # cattle bovine animals <pause dur="0.7"/> of the genus Bos especially <pause dur="0.2"/> oxen bulls and cows</reading> and we're back in the circle again <pause dur="9.0"/><kinesic desc="reveals covered part of transparency" iterated="n"/> so i say there are only a finite number of English words so it's impossible to avoid circular definitions unless <pause dur="0.5"/> you accept certain basic words as <pause dur="0.2"/> primitive undefined concepts <pause dur="0.4"/> which we all know the meaning of but don't need or not even able to define <pause dur="3.2"/> and <pause dur="0.6"/> mathematicians of course are bound by the same rules <pause dur="2.3"/> we're very big on definitions but we can't define absolutely everything <pause dur="1.2"/> however <pause dur="0.5"/> we do rather well <pause dur="0.9"/> we make just one <pause dur="0.9"/> we make do with just one <pause dur="0.2"/> primitive idea <pause dur="0.8"/> the concept of a set so i'm not going to define the concept of a set <pause dur="1.0"/> but i'm going to talk about it <pause dur="0.7"/> and hope that your idea of what a set is <pause dur="0.8"/><kinesic desc="reveals covered part of transparency" iterated="n"/> coincides closely <pause dur="0.7"/> with my idea <pause dur="0.7"/> and that of most mathematicians <pause dur="2.0"/> <reading>it turns out that the whole of mathematics can be founded on this one simple notion <pause dur="0.9"/> and a subtext of this 
course of lectures a not so hidden agenda <pause dur="0.3"/> is to show how this can be achieved</reading> <pause dur="2.7"/> so we we can't offer a formal definition of a set because that's our primitive undefined object but we can <pause dur="0.9"/> make an informal <pause dur="0.6"/> definition as to what we mean by it <pause dur="17.2"/><kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="10"/> and we now come to <pause dur="1.1"/> A-point-one definitely not a definition <pause dur="0.3"/> a set is just a collection of things <pause dur="0.6"/> and the things in the set are called elements <pause dur="0.4"/> whoops <pause dur="0.8"/> or <pause dur="0.6"/><vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" n="ss" dur="1"/> the members <pause dur="1.9"/> of that set <pause dur="0.8"/> and we have a bit of standard notation <pause dur="1.4"/> typically we use <pause dur="0.2"/> upper case letters for the sets themselves <pause dur="0.8"/> not always but <pause dur="1.9"/> very often <pause dur="0.3"/> and we use lower case <pause dur="0.8"/> letters often related closely to the upper case letter in the alphabet <pause dur="0.3"/> to denote the members <pause dur="0.4"/> or the elements of that set so <pause dur="0.4"/> here's a bit of <pause dur="0.2"/> standard <pause dur="0.5"/> notation <pause dur="1.0"/> X <pause dur="1.6"/> this funny epsilon sign <pause dur="0.3"/> big-X <pause dur="1.3"/> this should be read out loud as <pause dur="0.6"/> the element X <pause dur="0.4"/> is a member of <pause dur="0.2"/> or belongs to <pause dur="0.4"/> or is in <pause dur="0.6"/> the set <pause dur="0.7"/> of capital-X <pause dur="2.9"/> if we have a finite set we can <pause dur="0.8"/> list its elements <pause dur="0.2"/> X-one X-two up to X-N <pause dur="1.4"/> if we know what N is we can write them all out <pause dur="1.7"/> but we 
don't always deal with just finite sets <pause dur="0.9"/> # <pause dur="0.8"/> the integers themselves are <pause dur="1.2"/> an example of an infinite set and even integers you can describe <pause dur="0.2"/> in this way <pause dur="1.3"/> we use these braces a set of <pause dur="1.5"/> integers N elements <pause dur="0.2"/> little-N in Z the set of all integers <pause dur="0.4"/> two-divides-N that's a way of describing <pause dur="0.6"/> in set theoretical notation the even integers <pause dur="0.6"/> or sometimes we <pause dur="1.1"/> suggest <pause dur="0.5"/> what <pause dur="0.4"/> the set looks like <pause dur="0.8"/> this is meant to indicate the set of all <pause dur="0.4"/> even integers <pause dur="4.7"/> but this sort of notation depends <pause dur="0.5"/> on <pause dur="1.1"/> the tacit understanding <pause dur="0.3"/> that i've given enough information <pause dur="1.4"/> for you to see what's going on <pause dur="0.2"/> and that you've cottoned on to what i mean <pause dur="7.7"/><kinesic desc="reveals covered part of transparency" iterated="n"/> someone who is bloody-minded might say well why isn't the next one seven there's no reason why it shouldn't be <pause dur="0.5"/> but i've meant to indicate <pause dur="0.3"/> what i'm up up to there <pause dur="2.0"/> so what do we expect of a set these are <pause dur="0.2"/> important <pause dur="1.4"/> properties <pause dur="3.4"/> <reading>a set <pause dur="0.2"/> is determined by its elements</reading> and that sounds rather trite <pause dur="1.4"/> but a lot of people have trouble deciding when two sets are equal <pause dur="1.3"/> so let's be very 
clear about this <pause dur="1.8"/> <reading>two sets are equal <pause dur="0.2"/> if and only if <pause dur="0.5"/> they contain <pause dur="0.5"/> the same <pause dur="0.2"/> elements</reading> <pause dur="1.0"/> so we have the notion of equality which we use the usual equal sign for <pause dur="0.4"/> between <pause dur="0.2"/> sets <pause dur="5.9"/> <reading>the elements of a set <pause dur="0.4"/> must be distinguishable <pause dur="0.4"/> from each other</reading> <pause dur="0.4"/> we only count each element once <pause dur="0.5"/> so if we wrote down one and one <pause dur="1.1"/> it's really only got one element and we should <pause dur="0.4"/> accept the convention of writing it <pause dur="0.6"/> as a single <pause dur="0.2"/> one <pause dur="0.2"/> so we think of all the elements <pause dur="0.4"/> of the set when we list them <pause dur="0.7"/> as being different <pause dur="4.3"/> now this is an important one <pause dur="0.4"/> when you write out a set <pause dur="0.6"/> the order <pause dur="0.7"/> the way you write them out the <trunc>l</trunc> the order in which you write them out <pause dur="0.3"/> or label them <pause dur="1.0"/> is <pause dur="0.4"/> unimportant so <pause dur="0.3"/> the set containing <pause dur="0.3"/> X and Y can be written <kinesic desc="indicates point on screen" iterated="n"/> that way <pause dur="0.7"/> or <kinesic desc="indicates point on screen" iterated="n"/> that way those two sets are the X and Y have the same <pause dur="0.3"/> elements therefore they are equal <pause dur="0.4"/> even though <pause dur="0.5"/> they're written out in different order so <pause dur="1.8"/> <trunc>th</trunc> the property of being a set takes no account of the ordering or the <trunc>labeli</trunc> or the labelling of the elements <pause dur="2.7"/> if you've got a set <pause dur="1.4"/> it's not well defined unless we 
have some method of deciding whether <pause dur="0.7"/> anything <pause dur="0.3"/> is in the set <pause dur="0.3"/> or not <pause dur="0.9"/> so there's got to be some well defined <pause dur="0.6"/> procedure <pause dur="0.4"/> that tells you <pause dur="0.3"/> if i give you this is it in your set or not if you can always do that then your set <pause dur="0.4"/> is a genuine set and well defined <pause dur="1.8"/> now this last one <pause dur="0.9"/> <trunc>i</trunc> is # <pause dur="0.8"/> is just perhaps important to stress a lot of people think the objects of a set <pause dur="0.4"/> should be somehow <pause dur="0.2"/> related to each other like a set of numbers or a set of <pause dur="0.5"/> # students in a room or whatever <pause dur="0.4"/> but they can be totally <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> different have <trunc>n</trunc> no relation to each other no uniformity no common property so <pause dur="0.3"/> for instance <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> a particular cat <pause dur="0.4"/> and a particular fiddle <pause dur="0.4"/> and a particular cow <pause dur="0.6"/> and the moon <pause dur="0.2"/> and a certain dog <pause dur="0.4"/> and the word laughter can all be <pause dur="1.0"/> elements of this set with one <pause dur="0.5"/> two <pause dur="0.2"/> three <pause dur="0.2"/> four five six elements <pause dur="6.1"/><kinesic desc="reveals covered part of transparency" iterated="n"/> if you've got any questions about sets <pause dur="0.4"/> i'll give you a break in the middle <pause dur="0.6"/> to <pause dur="2.3"/> have you got one now i'm happy to take questions at any point but if you <pause dur="0.3"/> it's <pause dur="0.2"/> often hard to ask questions in a big audience if you've got some questions <pause dur="0.4"/> i'll let you 
have a chance to talk to your neighbours about it and then <pause dur="0.6"/> you might feel more confident about asking <pause dur="1.6"/> so here are some examples of <trunc>s</trunc> <pause dur="0.4"/> sets the students attending the first <pause dur="0.5"/> foundations lecture <pause dur="1.5"/> you here today i presume are a subset <pause dur="0.3"/> of that set probably a proper subset it being now nine o'clock in the morning <pause dur="0.2"/> although the first one was at nine too <pause dur="0.4"/> but you were <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> bit less <pause dur="2.0"/> # <pause dur="0.9"/> inured to the ways of the world on the first day on the first Wednesday of term <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> here's an interesting set the set of <pause dur="0.4"/> real numbers that satisfy this equation <pause dur="0.8"/> if you draw the graph so the graph lies the X axis completely so <pause dur="0.6"/> there are no real numbers satisfying that so that's another way of defining the empty set <pause dur="0.5"/> however <pause dur="0.3"/> if we allow <vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.3"/> the <pause dur="0.7"/> variable X to be in the field of complex numbers rather than the field of real numbers <pause dur="1.0"/> there are indeed <pause dur="0.4"/> two numbers <pause dur="0.3"/> in that set so be <pause dur="0.3"/> very <pause dur="0.3"/> specific <pause dur="0.2"/> where the elements come from <pause dur="0.3"/> if you are using <kinesic desc="indicates point on screen" iterated="n"/> this notation <pause dur="0.3"/> the set of <pause dur="0.4"/> certain things with <pause dur="0.4"/> a straight line and then <pause dur="0.3"/> a certain  
property <pause dur="0.4"/> the set of all X in here <pause dur="0.4"/><kinesic desc="indicates point on screen" iterated="n"/>  satisfying that property <pause dur="5.5"/> some non-examples <pause dur="2.8"/> there are a set of people <pause dur="0.3"/> in the first foundations lecture <pause dur="0.4"/> who will be alive on January the first <pause dur="0.6"/> two-thousand we hope that is <pause dur="0.4"/> the same set but we won't know <pause dur="0.5"/> until the first of January two-thousand-and-fifteen <pause dur="0.6"/> # but i certainly shan't be around and so that's one <pause dur="0.5"/> less <trunc>peop</trunc> one less person <pause dur="0.3"/> we won't know until two-thousand-and-fifteen <pause dur="0.4"/> # whether what what set is who belongs to it <pause dur="1.4"/> # the set of water <pause dur="0.6"/> in <pause dur="0.4"/> the Atlantic Ocean <pause dur="0.5"/> well there are lots of problems with that set <pause dur="0.9"/> water <pause dur="0.3"/> doesn't have any <pause dur="0.3"/> discreteness so <pause dur="0.5"/> you could talk about the molecules of water perhaps but water <pause dur="0.3"/> is <pause dur="0.4"/> # # an amorphous <pause dur="0.5"/> structure <pause dur="1.2"/> # <pause dur="1.5"/> you could <pause dur="0.5"/> talk about the molecules of water in the Atlantic Ocean you'd still have trouble <pause dur="0.4"/> # because <pause dur="0.6"/> the Atlantic Ocean isn't terribly well defined where does it stop and where does it begin <pause dur="0.6"/> and molecules of water are constantly dancing <pause dur="0.4"/> # above the surface of the water are they in or are they out <pause dur="0.2"/> and if someone gave you <vocal desc="laugh" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.4"/> a molecule how 
could you ever tell <pause dur="0.2"/> whether it came from the Atlantic Ocean or not because all molecules of water are the same <pause dur="0.2"/> so i wouldn't accept <kinesic desc="indicates point on screen" iterated="n"/> this as a set <pause dur="0.5"/> and then <pause dur="0.4"/> # there are also problems <pause dur="0.7"/> in logic <pause dur="0.5"/> with making sets too big <pause dur="0.9"/> and in particular the set of all sets <pause dur="1.0"/> is not allowed <pause dur="0.4"/> for reasons that we shall see later <pause dur="2.7"/> okay <pause dur="0.9"/> everyone happy about sets anybody got any questions <pause dur="2.4"/> right the first important idea <pause dur="0.7"/> in sets is to talk about subsets </u><gap reason="break in recording" extent="uncertain"/> <u who="nm0863" trans="pause"> <kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="6"/> i don't think it's a very difficult idea <pause dur="1.1"/> a subset <pause dur="0.2"/> of a set <pause dur="1.0"/> is a set consisting of <pause dur="0.6"/> some <pause dur="0.3"/> possibly all the elements i haven't done that <pause dur="0.7"/> very clearly <pause dur="22.6"/><kinesic desc="adjusts transparency" iterated="n"/> # the <trunc>sub</trunc> # B is a subset of A <pause dur="0.2"/> if any element of B <pause dur="0.8"/> is in A <pause dur="0.6"/> that's all it says <pause dur="1.0"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> the notation is important however <pause dur="0.9"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> for any old subset we use this <pause dur="1.9"/> curly less than or equal to sign <pause dur="0.3"/> that allows the possibility that B <pause dur="0.2"/> is equal to A note from the definition that A <pause dur="1.0"/> is one of the subsets of A A itself's a whole set <pause dur="0.7"/> and that the empty set of course is also <pause dur="0.4"/> a subset <pause dur="1.2"/> if we want to <pause dur="0.4"/> highlight the fact that we have a <pause dur="0.8"/> a proper subset we use 
the slightly different <pause dur="0.3"/> notation <pause dur="0.6"/> if we remove the bottom line there <pause dur="0.4"/> and <pause dur="0.3"/><kinesic desc="indicates point on screen" iterated="n"/> this notation means B <pause dur="0.2"/> is a subset of A <pause dur="0.3"/> and B <pause dur="0.2"/> is not equal to A <pause dur="0.5"/> that means there's something <pause dur="0.2"/> in A <pause dur="0.3"/> but not in B <pause dur="12.3"/><kinesic desc="reveals covered part of transparency" iterated="n"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> so the remarks i've already made <pause dur="0.2"/> don't forget that A <pause dur="0.2"/> is one of the subsets of A <pause dur="0.8"/> note that every set contains the empty set as a subset because the condition <pause dur="0.4"/> is vacuously satisfied <pause dur="0.8"/> now this is very important <pause dur="1.0"/> you're often asked to <pause dur="2.3"/> show that two sets <pause dur="0.2"/> described in different ways <pause dur="1.0"/> are actually equal <pause dur="0.8"/> and there's <pause dur="0.8"/> one standard <pause dur="0.4"/> and infallible technique for doing that <pause dur="2.1"/> what does it mean to say two sets are equal <pause dur="0.4"/> means they've got you've got to show they have the same <pause dur="0.2"/> elements <pause dur="0.6"/> and the way you do it is to show that if you've got anything in <pause dur="0.7"/> B <pause dur="1.5"/> it's in C if you got anything in C <pause dur="0.4"/> it's in B <pause dur="1.1"/> those two together <pause dur="0.7"/> tell me that the elements in B are the same as the elements in C and therefore the two sets are equal <pause dur="0.5"/> so the routine is this is what i call a double inclusion argument <pause dur="0.5"/> to show that B equals C <pause dur="0.9"/> you show first that B is a subset 
of C <pause dur="0.3"/> then you show C as a subset of B <pause dur="0.7"/> # and you've got a safe <pause dur="0.2"/> way <pause dur="0.5"/> of checking that <pause dur="0.2"/> the two sets have the same elements <pause dur="1.9"/> and finally the observation i already made if B is a proper subset of A <pause dur="0.5"/> there's at least one element of A which is not in B <pause dur="3.1"/><kinesic desc="reveals covered part of transparency" iterated="n"/> let's have some <pause dur="0.8"/> examples <pause dur="1.9"/> every non-empty set <pause dur="0.4"/> has a least two subsets mainly the whole set <pause dur="0.9"/> and the empty subset <pause dur="5.8"/> for each <pause dur="0.6"/> X in a non-empty set A there's always a one element subset <pause dur="1.3"/> and we use the notation <pause dur="0.8"/> X with <pause dur="1.3"/> braces round it <pause dur="2.3"/> and it's important to distinguish <pause dur="0.5"/> X <pause dur="0.2"/> as an element of <pause dur="0.6"/> X <pause dur="1.0"/> and this <pause dur="0.5"/><kinesic desc="indicates point on screen" iterated="n"/>  subset <pause dur="1.2"/> or sometimes a singleton <pause dur="0.2"/><vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> is a subset <pause dur="1.3"/> and therefore it's known to the set of all subsets <pause dur="0.4"/> of A so <pause dur="1.1"/> X <pause dur="0.6"/> is distinct from it's different from <pause dur="0.4"/> the set containing it <pause dur="2.9"/> and this is an excuse to remind you of some <pause dur="0.2"/> important subsets of the real numbers <pause dur="0.3"/> that <pause dur="0.2"/> crop up time and time again <pause dur="0.6"/> in <pause dur="0.7"/> analysis i don't know if you've met them yet but <pause dur="0.2"/> if not <pause dur="0.5"/> you soon will <pause dur="1.1"/> # <pause dur="3.7"/> round brackets <pause dur="1.3"/> A comma B <pause dur="0.2"/> the assumption there is that A and B are

now <pause dur="3.9"/> one important thing in studying <pause dur="0.6"/> sets <pause dur="0.2"/> is to have a safe space in which to do your set theory <pause dur="1.0"/> if you allow <pause dur="0.8"/> too much extraneous possibility you get into logical difficulties which we will see <pause dur="1.1"/> # so what we tend to do <trunc>i</trunc> when we're working with set theory is to fix some <pause dur="1.1"/> genuine <pause dur="0.3"/> set some bona fide set U <pause dur="0.3"/> that's big enough to contain <pause dur="0.2"/> all the sets that we're <pause dur="0.4"/> likely to consider <pause dur="0.3"/> in a given <pause dur="0.2"/> setting <pause dur="2.0"/> and # <pause dur="4.6"/> to call that the universe <pause dur="0.3"/> the the set everything happens in so in this case <pause dur="0.4"/> i've drawn the universe as a sort of square <pause dur="0.2"/> containing box <pause dur="0.2"/> and the assumption is that <pause dur="0.6"/> while i'm doing set theory <pause dur="0.8"/> everything will happen inside that box <pause dur="2.2"/> if you find the universe you chose is to small <pause dur="0.4"/> to begin with you can obviously enlarge it <pause dur="0.9"/> # so that # <pause dur="0.7"/> you include new sets if you have to <pause dur="0.7"/> so if we <pause dur="0.4"/> started out with the real numbers as the universe <pause dur="0.4"/> and we came upon an equation which had complex roots <pause dur="0.3"/> it might be convenient just to enlarge the universe <pause dur="0.4"/> to U <pause dur="0.5"/> and then you'd include those roots <pause dur="2.0"/> # the only

the only <pause dur="0.3"/> bit that's not in the set <pause dur="0.7"/> if you take the right-hand side <pause dur="3.3"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="2"/> you have to take the <pause dur="0.5"/> complement of A <pause dur="7.3"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="1"/> the complement of A <pause dur="0.4"/> is everything <pause dur="4.3"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="5"/> outside A <pause dur="8.1"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="10"/> and the complement of B <pause dur="0.9"/> is everything <pause dur="1.1"/> outside B <pause dur="2.6"/> and anything that's not <pause dur="0.8"/> in the union of <kinesic desc="indicates point on board" iterated="n"/> those two the pink and the white <pause dur="0.3"/> is again <kinesic desc="indicates point on board" iterated="n"/> the intersection <unclear>of the two</unclear> so <pause dur="0.7"/> the two sets are equal <pause dur="0.6"/> in Venn terms as well <pause dur="1.3"/> but <pause dur="0.9"/> because you can't fully represent <pause dur="1.5"/> the <pause dur="0.8"/> sets using <pause dur="0.9"/> traditional Venn diagrams with circles you have to be very cautious about saying <pause dur="0.4"/> the Venn diagram <pause dur="0.3"/> is a proof <pause dur="0.5"/> it's okay up to three sets <pause dur="0.5"/> but you get into difficulty <pause dur="0.6"/> if you have more than <pause dur="0.4"/> three <pause dur="3.5"/><kinesic desc="reveals covered part of transparency" iterated="n"/> so <reading>De Morgan's Laws are examples of set theoretical identities <pause dur="1.3"/> they're equations that hold <pause dur="0.4"/> whatever sets are substituted for A and B <pause dur="1.4"/> we can think of the symbols <pause dur="0.3"/> A and B as variables that range over all possible sets <pause dur="0.4"/> an identity <pause dur="0.3"/> is an equation between two set theoretical expressions <pause dur="0.3"/> that hold for all values of the variable</reading> <pause dur="3.9"/><kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="15"/> there are lots and lots of identities <pause dur="1.6"/> involving two sets <pause dur="8.3"/> # there are 
some fairly obvious ones like the <pause dur="0.3"/> <trunc>u</trunc> the intersection of A and B is the same as the intersection of B and A the same with unions <pause dur="0.6"/> # not quite so obvious are these distributed laws <pause dur="0.5"/> A intersect the union of B and C <pause dur="0.3"/> is the union of A-intersect-B and A-intersect-C <pause dur="0.3"/> and similar one with <pause dur="0.4"/> unions and <pause dur="1.4"/><kinesic desc="reveals covered part of transparency" iterated="n"/> intersections interchange <pause dur="3.3"/> and this <pause dur="0.5"/> raises the principle of duality <pause dur="0.4"/> and if you have any <pause dur="0.6"/> identity <pause dur="1.3"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> involving sets <pause dur="0.8"/> intersections and unions <pause dur="0.7"/> you will automatically get another <pause dur="0.2"/> identity <pause dur="1.1"/> interchanging all the <pause dur="0.7"/> unions and intersections <pause dur="0.9"/> so it's all <pause dur="0.2"/> from the first <pause dur="0.7"/><kinesic desc="indicates point on screen" iterated="n"/>  distributed law there i swap over <pause dur="0.9"/> the unions and the intersections and i get another <pause dur="0.3"/> true identity <pause dur="0.3"/> and the reason for it <kinesic desc="indicates point on screen" iterated="n"/> here <pause dur="0.4"/> is spelled out <pause dur="0.4"/> using De Morgan's Laws <pause dur="1.4"/> i'll leave you to read that one in your own time <pause dur="1.2"/> because in the last <vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.3"/> few minutes <pause dur="1.4"/> i want to come on to <pause dur="0.7"/><kinesic desc="reveals covered part of transparency" iterated="n"/> some <pause dur="0.5"/> logical problems that you <pause dur="0.3"/> get if you <pause dur="0.6"/> allow <pause dur="1.2"/> too many sets to <pause dur="0.2"/> arise <pause dur="2.6"/> it's it's worth knowing that # <pause dur="0.6"/><kinesic desc="indicates point on screen" iterated="n"/> this book which i will <pause dur="0.8"/> circulate on a list of recommended books for the 
course in due course <pause dur="0.7"/> it's a <trunc>di</trunc> it's <pause dur="0.2"/> rather large book called Discrete Mathematics with Application <pause dur="0.3"/> it's pretty strong on set theory <pause dur="0.3"/> and it has a very comprehensive list <pause dur="0.4"/> of all the basic identities for sets <pause dur="0.4"/> of this kind <pause dur="3.9"/><kinesic desc="reveals covered part of transparency" iterated="n"/> yep <pause dur="0.5"/> there is a snake <pause dur="0.6"/> lurking in the grass <pause dur="1.3"/> # <pause dur="1.1"/> incidentally if you like this kind of <pause dur="0.7"/><kinesic desc="reveals covered part of transparency" iterated="n"/> there was a splendid book <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> by <pause dur="1.0"/> Raymond Smullyan <pause dur="0.6"/> the title of the book is What is the Name of this Book <pause dur="0.7"/> and # <pause dur="1.5"/> it has lots of # <pause dur="0.6"/> splendid examples of <pause dur="1.2"/> logical and verbal paradoxes <pause dur="0.2"/> anyway consider this particular one you've got a certain town there's a barber <pause dur="0.7"/> who shaves <pause dur="0.5"/> all the men <pause dur="0.5"/> who do not shave themselves <pause dur="0.3"/> I go there <pause dur="1.2"/> but no one else <pause dur="0.4"/> if they shave themselves the barber doesn't shave <pause dur="1.3"/> so <pause dur="0.7"/> let the universe U <pause dur="0.8"/><kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="16"/> consist of all the men in that town <pause dur="5.8"/> and let the set A <pause dur="2.6"/> consist of all the men <pause dur="0.9"/> who shave themselves <pause dur="2.4"/> by definition of the universe <pause dur="2.1"/> either someone shaves themselves <pause dur="1.5"/> or they don't <pause dur="2.3"/> and the question is <pause dur="0.5"/> does the barber belong to A <pause dur="0.6"/> or A-complement if he belongs to A and he shaves himself <pause dur="0.4"/><vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.4"/> but that's not 
possible because he only shaves men not in A <pause dur="0.3"/> on the other hand if he belongs to the complement of A <pause dur="0.2"/> by definition of <pause dur="0.4"/> A <pause dur="0.7"/> he shaves himself and so he belongs to A <pause dur="0.5"/> so you have the contradiction that the barber is in <pause dur="0.4"/> the set and its complement <pause dur="0.9"/> which is the set to the empty set <pause dur="1.4"/><kinesic desc="reveals covered part of transparency" iterated="n"/> # <pause dur="1.7"/> there are two ways to escape <pause dur="0.7"/> from this paradox <pause dur="0.7"/> you can either assume the barber had a beard <pause dur="1.2"/> or <pause dur="0.5"/> you can point out that # <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.9"/> the paradox is just a logical <pause dur="0.4"/> booby trap <pause dur="0.5"/> # because it's not possible <pause dur="0.8"/> for the statement <pause dur="0.7"/> the barber shaves all men who do not shave themselves <pause dur="0.6"/> and shaves no one else it's not possible for that be a true statement <pause dur="0.7"/> if you allow <pause dur="0.7"/> the barber in the universe <pause dur="0.4"/><kinesic desc="reveals covered part of transparency" iterated="n"/> so that was <pause dur="1.1"/> # a trick <pause dur="1.3"/> but a more serious problem <pause dur="0.2"/> # was pointed out by Bertrand Russell who <pause dur="0.2"/> spent years <pause dur="0.5"/> # trying to <pause dur="1.6"/> # flog himself to death in <pause dur="0.6"/> using <pause dur="0.6"/> set theory <pause dur="0.3"/> mathematical logic to <pause dur="0.8"/> prove all mathematics <pause dur="1.4"/> # <pause dur="1.5"/> he's sometimes defined <pause dur="0.2"/> as the <pause dur="1.5"/> philosopher who shaves all people who do not shave themselves <pause dur="0.9"/><kinesic desc="reveals covered part of transparency" iterated="n"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> but his <pause dur="1.1"/> problem was the following <pause dur="0.3"/> his paradox <pause dur="1.6"/> take the 
universe to be the set of all sets <pause dur="1.2"/> and then you can define the subset of that universe <pause dur="0.5"/> # to consist of all sets that don't contain themselves <pause dur="1.3"/> i point out that # <pause dur="1.1"/> the set of integers that's not an integer so <pause dur="0.8"/> Z is not in Z <pause dur="0.3"/> Z does not contain itself <pause dur="0.3"/> so Z <pause dur="0.2"/> that set <pause dur="0.6"/> is in our set A <pause dur="0.3"/> on the other hand the set of all sets is a set <pause dur="0.6"/> so it belongs to itself <pause dur="0.5"/> and so <pause dur="1.1"/> the complement of A contains U so there are both kinds of sets those that contain themselves <pause dur="0.4"/> those that don't <pause dur="6.6"/><kinesic desc="reveals covered part of transparency" iterated="n"/> now the question <pause dur="1.2"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> we have to ask is <pause dur="0.8"/> does A <pause dur="1.0"/> the set of all sets that don't contain themselves does it contain itself <pause dur="0.3"/> or not does it belong to A or the complement of A <pause dur="1.3"/> well if A <pause dur="1.4"/> belongs to itself <pause dur="1.3"/> then <pause dur="0.8"/> what does A define <pause dur="0.9"/> it <reading>must be one of those sets that do not belong to itself in other words A is not in A</reading> <pause dur="1.1"/> so it's in the complement <pause dur="0.4"/> <reading>on the other hand if A 
belongs to the complement then A belongs to itself <pause dur="0.5"/> or it symbols A is in A</reading> either way we get A in A-<pause dur="0.5"/>intersect A-complement which is the empty set so that's a serious <pause dur="0.3"/> objection <pause dur="0.6"/> if we allow the set of all sets <pause dur="0.6"/> to be a set <pause dur="1.8"/><kinesic desc="reveals covered part of transparency" iterated="n"/> so we don't <pause dur="0.6"/> so we have to be much stricter about what sets are allowed in the scheme of things <pause dur="0.8"/> and # there are ways of <pause dur="1.0"/> for getting round this <pause dur="0.6"/> basically you start with the <trunc>em</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> the empty set and build up <pause dur="0.7"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> what you can get by that process <pause dur="0.9"/> is what's allowed and you don't end up with a set of all sets <pause dur="0.9"/><vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/><pause dur="2.8"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> poor old Russell <pause dur="0.6"/> got his comeuppance because <pause dur="0.7"/> in nineteen-thirty-one <pause dur="1.1"/> <reading>Gödel showed it wasn't possible to prove rigorously that mathematics is free from contradictions</reading> <pause dur="0.8"/> so <pause dur="0.8"/> we always have to live with a cloud of doubt over our heads
