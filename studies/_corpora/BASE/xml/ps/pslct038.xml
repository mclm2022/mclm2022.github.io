<u who="nf0951"> to start with <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="1.0"/> i gather that Newton-Raphson having happened at A-level was rather a long time ago <pause dur="0.6"/> and you had a bit of fun with it on Friday <pause dur="1.9"/> so i thought i'd just give you a <pause dur="0.2"/> quick reminder <pause dur="1.2"/> <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="4"/> the idea is we've got some sort of function <pause dur="0.2"/> that crosses zero <pause dur="1.3"/> what we want to know is the point <pause dur="1.4"/> X-star <pause dur="0.4"/> such that <pause dur="1.2"/> F-of-X-star equals zero <pause dur="0.4"/> you shouldn't need to write this down by the way <pause dur="1.0"/> # <pause dur="1.3"/> and there are all sorts of ways we could find that what Newton-Raphson depends on is saying <pause dur="0.7"/> well <pause dur="0.4"/> <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="1"/> we'll take a guess <pause dur="0.3"/> at where we're starting so we'll call that guess <pause dur="1.2"/> <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="1"/> X-zero <pause dur="1.0"/> and we'll evaluate <pause dur="1.9"/> <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="2"/> F-of-X-zero <pause dur="1.9"/> and then we have to decide what to do <pause dur="0.8"/> having seen what size it is <pause dur="0.4"/> and Newton-Raphson is based on the principle that what we do is <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="2"/> look at the tangent at that point <pause dur="1.7"/> and we follow the tangent down <pause dur="0.9"/> 
<kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="1"/> and that will bring us closer to <kinesic desc="indicates point on board" iterated="n"/> this root <pause dur="0.9"/> so we follow the tangent down to <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="1"/> X-one <pause dur="2.8"/> well <pause dur="0.3"/> <vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/><pause dur="1.1"/> one way you can think about <pause dur="2.0"/> <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="5"/> that obviously the tangent <pause dur="0.7"/> is <pause dur="0.9"/> F-of-X-nought which is the gradient <pause dur="0.5"/> and what is the gradient well the gradient is <pause dur="1.2"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="2"/> F-of-X-nought <pause dur="1.2"/> minus zero <pause dur="1.8"/> <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="5"/> divided by <pause dur="2.0"/> if we have mm <pause dur="0.3"/> i don't know if we really need an origin let's put an origin somewhere <pause dur="0.4"/> but it's divided by <pause dur="0.9"/> <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="1"/> X-nought minus X-one <pause dur="1.6"/> so one way of thinking of Newton-Raphson is precisely this that we're taking a triangle <pause dur="0.7"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="4"/> we then do the same thing we come here <pause dur="1.2"/> follow the gradient up and we're <pause dur="0.2"/> very near a <pause dur="0.2"/> 
nearly at the spot <pause dur="2.3"/> so conceptually that's what Newton-Raphson's doing if you land up forgetting it <pause dur="0.8"/><kinesic desc="indicates point on board" iterated="n"/> that's one way of remembering it if <pause dur="0.4"/> if you like the geometrical way of remembering it <pause dur="0.6"/> an alternative is the thing we were <trunc>lo</trunc> talking about a lot in the asymptotics <pause dur="0.3"/> which was series expansions <pause dur="0.8"/> so <pause dur="0.3"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="1"/> what we're interested in <pause dur="1.0"/> is <kinesic desc="indicates point on board" iterated="n"/> this point where F-of-X equals zero <pause dur="0.6"/> well <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="17"/> let's do an expansion that's approximately equal to <pause dur="1.1"/> F-of-<pause dur="0.4"/>X-nought <pause dur="0.5"/> plus <pause dur="2.2"/> X-star <pause dur="0.2"/> minus <pause dur="2.2"/> # which way around is it X-nought minus <pause dur="0.3"/> X-star <pause dur="2.7"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="4"/> and then the first derivative <pause dur="7.9"/> and <pause dur="2.1"/> in either case what we do is we basically just solve <pause dur="0.8"/> those equations so if we look at this equation <pause dur="1.1"/> what we're saying is that <pause dur="1.4"/> <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="5"/> X-star <pause dur="0.2"/> minus <pause dur="1.0"/> X-nought <pause dur="2.3"/> so i've changed the sign <pause dur="1.0"/> equals <pause dur="1.5"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="8"/> F-of-<pause dur="0.4"/>X-nought over <pause dur="2.0"/> F-dashed-of-X-nought <pause dur="1.8"/> and then <pause dur="6.3"/> <vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/> <pause dur="0.8"/> we're going to <pause dur="2.7"/> actually i have a feeling <pause dur="0.3"/> you might have to 
check me on the signs on this one <pause dur="1.4"/> <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="3"/> off <pause dur="0.2"/> the top of my head <pause dur="2.6"/> we've got <pause dur="1.6"/> a solution so typically we take <kinesic desc="indicates point on board" iterated="n"/> this as our <pause dur="1.0"/> X-one and then we'd iterate <pause dur="1.7"/> okay that that's the basic principle you can <pause dur="0.5"/> check whether i've memorized which way round <kinesic desc="indicates point on board" iterated="n"/> that goes <pause dur="1.0"/> # <pause dur="2.1"/> by looking at <pause dur="0.3"/><kinesic desc="indicates point on board" iterated="n"/> solving for that one <pause dur="1.1"/> X-one <pause dur="1.9"/> yep <pause dur="1.8"/> the other point is that it's actually much easier to remember Newton-Raphson <kinesic desc="indicates board" iterated="n"/> in a simple form like this write it down <pause dur="0.4"/> and then fill in what the function is in that second exercise <pause dur="1.1"/> rather than trying to write it in too full of generality <pause dur="2.2"/> and <pause dur="0.4"/> in terms of tutorials the next tutorial's going to be <pause dur="0.2"/> a week on Wednesday <pause dur="1.0"/> so you'll get another chance to <pause dur="0.2"/> both look at those exercises <pause dur="0.2"/> or ask about the <pause dur="0.5"/> projects <pause dur="3.0"/> okay so that was my way of being an aside because what <pause dur="0.8"/> we're starting to talk about now until <pause dur="0.4"/> pretty well the end of term <unclear>module</unclear> the tutorials <pause dur="0.7"/> and <pause dur="1.0"/> some lectures on <pause dur="0.4"/> ethics <pause dur="0.5"/> is <pause dur="0.4"/> survival 
analysis <pause dur="2.3"/> so i'm just going to take you back to the first lecture <pause dur="1.3"/> where <pause dur="6.6"/><kinesic desc="puts on transparency" iterated="n"/> we had a whole lot of lifetimes of people <pause dur="2.8"/> and the reason for the odd shape was <kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> these were all people who were dead <pause dur="0.5"/> and <kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> these were a mixture of people who are alive <pause dur="0.2"/> and dead <pause dur="0.8"/><kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="10"/> and i showed you <pause dur="1.5"/> what a survival plot looked like <pause dur="4.6"/> and <pause dur="3.6"/> that's a fairly standard survival plot <pause dur="0.2"/> where we start with <pause dur="0.8"/> everyone being alive <pause dur="1.2"/> and then <pause dur="0.5"/> <vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/> <pause dur="1.3"/> we drop the estimates in a step function <pause dur="1.7"/> so that if we look at <kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> this group <pause dur="0.4"/> those who are wheelchair-bound <pause dur="0.9"/> we see that <pause dur="1.3"/> seventy per cent of them survive <pause dur="0.7"/> to age ten <pause dur="2.3"/> for this cohort <pause dur="0.3"/> i know the group who's studying cerebral palsy <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> somebody's got a friend <pause dur="0.6"/> who wasn't expected to live past primary <pause dur="0.8"/> school age but you can see from this that even quite severely handicapped people have got a good chance of living beyond primary school age <pause dur="5.6"/> <event desc="takes off transparency" iterated="n"/> right <pause dur="0.5"/> so <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> right <pause dur="1.7"/><event desc="puts away projector" iterated="y" dur="5"/> i'm actually going to <pause dur="3.3"/> put this down now <pause dur="0.6"/> you might 
like to think about what the crucial elements of survival analysis are that make it a different topic i'm just going to move the screen <pause dur="1.5"/><event desc="puts away screen" iterated="n"/> which <pause dur="0.6"/> justifies <pause dur="2.3"/> having a separate section about it <pause dur="16.9"/> okay so <pause dur="1.0"/> cerebral palsy's rather a large dataset it's difficult to draw some examples so what i'm going to do is give another couple of examples <pause dur="0.6"/> of the data and then i'm going to go into <pause dur="0.7"/> a discussion of the crucial definitions and the actual definitions themselves <pause dur="0.8"/> <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="9"/> so the topic's called survival analysis <pause dur="8.8"/> and <pause dur="0.6"/> most people tend to think of lifetimes are <unclear>for <trunc>d</trunc></unclear> of human lifetimes <pause dur="1.4"/> with a <pause dur="0.4"/> with the word survival you do tend to think of death <pause dur="0.7"/> it's also called failure time analysis because it's used in economics <pause dur="0.2"/> where <pause dur="0.6"/> you stress test components see how long they last <pause dur="0.4"/> it's used in economics how long are people unemployed or <pause dur="0.2"/> how long are <pause dur="0.6"/> do companies survive and is it different for <pause dur="0.3"/> greenfield versus brownfield sites <pause dur="1.4"/> it 
can even be used for lengths <pause dur="1.8"/> how long a piece of wool can you get <pause dur="0.2"/> before it breaks <pause dur="0.5"/> <vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/><pause dur="1.0"/> if you're spinning it with one or two strands that's going to be different from spinning with multiple strands <pause dur="0.9"/> # <pause dur="1.0"/> and that's actually <pause dur="0.4"/> Cox and <pause dur="0.2"/> Oakes which is one of the books that's mentioned <pause dur="0.5"/> David Cox actually worked in the <pause dur="0.6"/> Wool Research Institute i think it was called <pause dur="0.5"/> precisely on <pause dur="0.3"/> lengths of yarn so that that is actually <pause dur="0.6"/> quite a major application <pause dur="1.2"/> but as i say typically we're going to be thinking in medical examples <pause dur="0.5"/> of people doing something like entering a screening programme entering a trial <pause dur="1.1"/> being born <pause dur="0.4"/> and then we follow them up till an event <pause dur="1.2"/> and <pause dur="0.9"/> <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="14"/> the reality of what will actually happen <pause dur="0.3"/> is that <pause dur="0.9"/> we've got <pause dur="0.3"/> calendar time so <trunc>im</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> got say <pause dur="0.7"/> nineteen-ninety here <pause dur="1.7"/> two-thousand here <pause dur="1.9"/> but not everybody turns up in nineteen-ninety at the beginning so we get people <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="19"/> coming in <pause dur="0.7"/> maybe dying <pause dur="0.6"/> coming in living <pause dur="1.7"/> coming in dying at some 
stage <pause dur="1.0"/> carrying on living <pause dur="1.5"/> # that person's just emigrated to Australia <pause dur="6.3"/> and <pause dur="2.6"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="4"/> we've stopped the study <pause dur="1.4"/> in two-thousand so <pause dur="1.1"/> in calendar time that's the kind of pattern we've got <pause dur="0.9"/> but in terms of what we want to analyse <pause dur="4.6"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="3"/> we'll much more typically just use <pause dur="0.3"/> time from zero up to <pause dur="0.9"/> we'll <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="1"/> try to draw this reasonably to scale <pause dur="0.5"/> zero up to ten so <kinesic desc="indicates point on board" iterated="n"/> these first two points <pause dur="0.7"/> <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="27"/> whoops <pause dur="0.7"/> <vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/> <pause dur="2.3"/> are <pause dur="1.5"/> pretty much at the same point <pause dur="0.6"/> but then we start <pause dur="1.9"/> having to think <kinesic desc="indicates point on board" iterated="n"/> about these points coming <pause dur="5.0"/> back to being censored <kinesic desc="indicates point on board" iterated="n"/> that point's <pause dur="3.4"/> if you want to draw yourselves a more accurate picture <pause dur="0.9"/> <shift feature="voice" new="laugh"/># <shift feature="voice" new="normal"/><pause dur="5.3"/> you can so the idea is that <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="14"/> we can either measure on a scale of calendar time <pause dur="3.3"/> or <pause dur="1.1"/> in some sense an exposed time <pause dur="3.5"/> so if we're thinking of something like 
hormone replacement therapy <pause dur="0.3"/> and whether it carries a greater risk of heart attack <pause dur="0.4"/> or stroke <pause dur="0.8"/> we're interested in the length of time <pause dur="0.2"/> women are <pause dur="0.2"/> on hormone replacement therapy <pause dur="1.3"/> <vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/> we may secondarily be interested in the date 'cause it'll change the prescriptions of the components but primarily we're just interested in the length of time <pause dur="2.2"/> another way you may actually get data <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="1.9"/> is that <pause dur="0.2"/> you don't actually get it in that form <pause dur="0.2"/> <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="9"/> much more likely <pause dur="0.2"/> in this example from kidney <pause dur="0.5"/> register data <pause dur="4.8"/> it's quite a lot <pause dur="0.4"/> quite likely that instead of actually getting a graph like that somebody will have done the <pause dur="1.3"/> the summary <pause dur="3.1"/> so this is <pause dur="1.1"/> counter-registry type data <pause dur="0.5"/> and the kind of thing you would <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="15"/> get is <pause dur="1.6"/> year since diagnosis <pause dur="0.9"/> zero to one <pause dur="0.2"/> one to two <pause dur="1.8"/> two to three <pause dur="0.7"/> three to four <pause dur="4.3"/> so 
you'd get subdivisions by year <pause dur="1.4"/> and those of you who are going to do actuarial science will find you <pause dur="0.3"/> tend most typically to work <pause dur="0.6"/> in subdivisions of year as opposed to exact times <kinesic desc="indicates board" iterated="n"/> that i've used there <pause dur="1.6"/> <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="30"/> then you're going to have <pause dur="0.3"/> the number <pause dur="1.3"/> at the start <pause dur="7.1"/> oh a hundred-and-twenty-six <pause dur="1.0"/> the number of deaths in that year <pause dur="3.9"/> was forty-seven <pause dur="2.0"/> and the number <pause dur="0.4"/> what are called <pause dur="0.8"/> lost <pause dur="0.4"/> to follow-up <pause dur="4.1"/> lost to follow-up's meant to be quite a general term <pause dur="0.2"/> because remember in the cerebral palsy case <pause dur="0.9"/> you're going to land up with people who are still alive <pause dur="1.10"/> so you you're losing them in <trunc>tha</trunc> in that sense <pause dur="2.2"/> <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="47"/> okay so we had nineteen <pause dur="3.6"/> sixty <pause dur="0.2"/> five <pause dur="1.2"/> seventeen <pause dur="4.4"/> thirty-eight <pause dur="1.4"/> two <pause dur="0.4"/> fifteen <pause dur="1.8"/> # <pause dur="2.2"/> twenty-one <pause dur="0.5"/> two <pause dur="1.5"/> nine <pause dur="3.3"/> ten <pause dur="0.7"/> zero <pause dur="0.4"/> six <pause dur="1.7"/> four <pause dur="1.0"/> zero <pause dur="0.3"/> four <pause dur="0.8"/> probably <trunc>sh</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> gone up to age <pause dur="1.4"/> to year <pause dur="0.3"/> six <pause dur="12.6"/> and the kinds of questions you typically <pause dur="0.5"/> find people interested 
in this <pause dur="0.2"/> are <pause dur="5.4"/> <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="6"/> well one thing that's very widely used in cancer <pause dur="0.5"/> # is one and five year survival rates so <pause dur="2.4"/> <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="29"/> what is <pause dur="0.3"/> the <pause dur="0.4"/> let's just say five year <pause dur="1.2"/> survival rate <pause dur="11.1"/> <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="14"/> you might think about medians <pause dur="0.6"/> what is <pause dur="1.7"/> the median survival <pause dur="10.8"/> and what is the life expectancy <pause dur="12.5"/> <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="17"/> and take that to be the formal <pause dur="1.5"/> mean <pause dur="5.3"/> okay just so you can focus on the kinds of problems <pause dur="0.7"/> have a quick look at this data and <pause dur="0.5"/> discuss with the person <pause dur="0.3"/> next to you <pause dur="0.6"/> perhaps that first question how are you going to estimate the five year survival rate <pause dur="1.5"/> and can you think of anything <pause dur="0.6"/> that looks obvious but that's going to be wrong <pause dur="2.5"/> and i'll give you about half a minute on that <pause dur="1.4"/> then i might ask somebody to answer the question </u><event desc="discussing task" iterated="y" n="ss" dur="unknown"/><gap reason="break in recording" extent="uncertain"/> <u who="nf0951" trans="pause"> 
anybody willing to <trunc>o</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> volunteer an obviously wrong answer <pause dur="1.7"/> simple answer but that <pause dur="0.2"/> is likely to be wrong <pause dur="0.6"/> for the five year survival rate <pause dur="5.6"/> is ten out of one-twenty-six likely to be a good <trunc>i</trunc> estimate <pause dur="2.1"/> <kinesic desc="shake heads" iterated="n" n="ss"/> okay you agree it isn't a good estimate <pause dur="0.6"/> why <pause dur="0.3"/> broadly speaking </u><pause dur="3.0"/> <u who="sf0952" trans="pause"> <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> don't know why </u><pause dur="0.7"/> <u who="nf0951" trans="pause"> 'cause of all the people you've lost to follow-up <pause dur="1.1"/> so that's basically why <pause dur="0.7"/> all of <kinesic desc="indicates point on board" iterated="n"/> these questions although they're quite <pause dur="0.4"/> reasonable questions <pause dur="0.5"/> that's why they're going to need <pause dur="2.1"/> some sensible <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.9"/> methods that allows for all those people who get lost <pause dur="1.1"/> so <pause dur="0.2"/> in order to define <trunc>s</trunc> survival times <pause dur="1.3"/> there are three critical elements so <pause dur="6.2"/> <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="22"/> for the definitions <pause dur="2.5"/> of <pause dur="0.6"/> i'm going to carry on calling them survival times <pause dur="0.8"/> every now and again 
i'll make reference to these other things that aren't <pause dur="0.6"/> necessarily survival <pause dur="11.6"/> very first thing we need to know for a survival time <pause dur="1.3"/> is <pause dur="1.4"/> <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="16"/> the start point <pause dur="0.7"/> start point <pause dur="3.9"/> for <pause dur="2.4"/> each individual <pause dur="13.3"/> and the first examples we can think of <pause dur="0.9"/> might make you wonder why we need to discuss this <pause dur="0.6"/> 'cause the kinds of examples you might like to think of are <pause dur="0.3"/> date of birth for cerebral palsy <pause dur="1.1"/> or date of entry to a randomized control trial <pause dur="2.2"/> fairly obvious that that's the date you should use randomized trials <pause dur="0.4"/> accrue people over time <pause dur="0.2"/> just as people come in to <pause dur="0.8"/> cancer registries over time or anything else <pause dur="2.0"/> where it starts <pause dur="0.2"/> <vocal desc="cough" iterated="n"/> to be slightly more complicated is if you think of epilepsy which i've mentioned before <pause dur="1.8"/> and <pause dur="1.3"/> by the time somebody who has epilepsy is randomized into a trial <pause dur="0.4"/> they've got to have shown symptoms of the disease <pause dur="0.9"/> so you might well think <pause dur="0.5"/> shouldn't we <pause dur="0.4"/> start from when they first showed symptoms of the disease <pause dur="0.7"/> rather 
than just from <pause dur="0.5"/> entry to the trial <pause dur="1.6"/> the advantage of starting at entry to the trial is it's going to be unbiased because of the randomization mechanism <pause dur="0.7"/> you should have equal lengths of time <pause dur="0.3"/> before in both arms <pause dur="1.4"/> because recall of first events is going to be quite poor <pause dur="0.5"/> and so in fact with epilepsy what you do is you do start from <pause dur="0.3"/> date of randomization <pause dur="0.8"/> you also take into account <pause dur="0.4"/> when the first symptoms were and how bad things have been <pause dur="0.4"/> but as a covariate <pause dur="0.2"/> not as the start point <pause dur="1.1"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> so if you want to put a <trunc>n</trunc> you know an aside <pause dur="0.6"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="1"/> <trunc>s</trunc> some sort of remarks on that it's not compulsory but <pause dur="0.4"/> things like randomized control trials are quite easy <pause dur="1.4"/> something where it becomes much more critical to define the start time <pause dur="0.4"/> is something like screening for disease <pause dur="0.6"/> there's still quite a big debate about the value of screening <pause dur="0.2"/> for breast cancer <pause dur="1.6"/> # it's been in the media a couple of <trunc>t</trunc> in the last couple of years a fair bit because <pause dur="0.3"/> Scandinavians have said <pause dur="1.1"/> not only is this a waste of money 
it actually kills more people than it benefits <pause dur="0.8"/> and the head of the U-K breast screening has said <pause dur="0.5"/> no no no we are wonderful <pause dur="1.4"/> well what's the problem <pause dur="0.4"/> the thing about screening for a disease is the whole point is you want to pick the disease up early <pause dur="0.5"/> before there are symptoms <pause dur="0.9"/> so you can intervene <pause dur="1.5"/> now what that means is if you think about it <pause dur="0.2"/> even if you did nothing <pause dur="0.4"/> the time from first saying somebody's got breast cancer to death <pause dur="1.0"/> is going to be longer in a screening programme than if you wait for symptoms <pause dur="0.5"/> if you want to think of it as a line again <pause dur="0.6"/> <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="1"/> you think of somebody ambling along <pause dur="0.8"/> and <pause dur="0.6"/> <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="1"/><kinesic desc="indicates point on board" iterated="n"/> at this point <pause dur="0.3"/> they have symptoms and they go along to see their <pause dur="0.3"/> G-P and <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="1"/> at <kinesic desc="indicates point on board" iterated="n"/> this point they die <pause dur="1.0"/> and what a screening programme tries to do is to say <pause dur="0.7"/> <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="2"/> 
let's see if we can <pause dur="0.7"/> leap in here <pause dur="0.7"/><kinesic desc="indicates point on board" iterated="n"/> with some kind of tests and pick them up <pause dur="1.0"/> so if you measure from <pause dur="0.5"/> the time of screening <pause dur="2.3"/> <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="1"/> it's always going to be longer than from symptoms <pause dur="1.7"/> so the mere increase in length of time doesn't tell you anything at all about the benefit of the screening programme <pause dur="1.0"/> fact the only real way you can tell about the benefits of screening programmes is <pause dur="1.7"/> <trunc>i</trunc> well ideally randomized control trials but otherwise <pause dur="0.4"/> you've got to have two populations one screened one not <pause dur="0.6"/> that's what all the debate is about <pause dur="0.2"/> what does the evidence from those kinds of trials show do they show a benefit to screening or not <pause dur="1.9"/> and the other occasion where <pause dur="0.5"/> you would get <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> slightly <pause dur="1.1"/> have to think carefully about your defined point would be exposure to disease so the <pause dur="0.3"/> case control cohort studies we've talked about <pause dur="1.1"/> if you're thinking of something like asbestosis or <pause dur="0.2"/> even <trunc>s</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> exposure to cigarette smoking <pause dur="1.8"/> you want to <pause dur="0.2"/> do it from the 
start of the exposure <pause dur="0.5"/> it may well be confounded with age <pause dur="0.3"/> <trunc>i</trunc> you may want to know whether <pause dur="0.4"/> starting to smoke at age ten has a different effect from starting to smoke at age twenty <pause dur="1.5"/> but you need to think about the exposure so if you like briefly <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="20"/> the the kinds of issues here would be <pause dur="0.6"/> comparing a randomized control trial <pause dur="0.2"/> versus screening <pause dur="1.7"/> and <pause dur="0.6"/> exposures <pause dur="1.0"/> so in <trunc>ec</trunc> exposure <pause dur="0.2"/> to risk factors <pause dur="5.5"/> and it's those latter two that <pause dur="0.3"/> that <pause dur="0.4"/> warn you why this is <pause dur="0.9"/> such an important point <pause dur="1.6"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="1"/> and then the <trunc>thir</trunc> second thing to think about is the <pause dur="0.7"/> <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="4"/> time scale <pause dur="5.4"/> <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="10"/> or <pause dur="1.6"/> we might change that to 
saying the measurement scale <pause dur="9.5"/> and again that's <pause dur="1.0"/> essentially because if we're thinking about the generality of survival analysis <pause dur="1.4"/> typically when we're thinking in medical terms we are just thinking of <pause dur="0.2"/> days months years that kind of thing <pause dur="0.8"/> we could be thinking in engineering <pause dur="1.2"/> about the load on a spring <pause dur="1.2"/> # that's what you do in stress testing <pause dur="0.4"/> load on a spring load on a bridge load on an aircraft wing to see when the rivets pop out <pause dur="0.9"/> # <pause dur="1.1"/> that sort of thing what kind of impact <pause dur="0.9"/> # concrete can sustain <pause dur="0.8"/> if you're dropping loads on it <pause dur="1.4"/> and as i said things like yarn you might have thickness you might have length before things break down <pause dur="2.0"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> and so you just <pause dur="0.5"/> need to agree on that <pause dur="0.4"/><kinesic desc="indicates point on board" iterated="n"/> this is also incidentally one point where one of the statistical <pause dur="0.8"/> # groups of models come in <pause dur="0.5"/> is whether you're going to transform the time scale <pause dur="0.7"/> so should you be modelling on actual time scale or on log of time scale <pause dur="4.2"/> so we've got a beginning we've got a time scale <pause dur="1.3"/> clearly the thing we need 
is an end <pause dur="0.5"/> so we need <pause dur="1.8"/> <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="13"/> a well defined <pause dur="4.2"/> unique <pause dur="2.2"/> event <pause dur="5.1"/> death being the most common one that we'll be dealing with <pause dur="3.8"/> but in fact one of my <pause dur="0.2"/> colleagues when i was doing a PhD <pause dur="0.6"/> the # <pause dur="0.6"/> <vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/> <pause dur="0.3"/> failure point they were looking at was the birth of a baby they were measuring length of labour <pause dur="0.5"/> so rather ironically # <pause dur="1.0"/> <vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/> <pause dur="0.3"/> the <pause dur="0.2"/><kinesic desc="makes quotation mark gesture" iterated="n"/> failures at that stage was a successful <pause dur="1.3"/> live birth <pause dur="2.3"/> # <pause dur="6.7"/> where does this get complicated <pause dur="1.0"/> just as i point out a <trunc>s</trunc> a few issues <kinesic desc="indicates point on board" iterated="n"/> here where you might need to think carefully <pause dur="0.6"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="2"/> well as i say if it's death it's not <pause dur="1.1"/> too tricky <pause dur="0.4"/> but quite often we're going to be looking at things like a recurrence of cancer <pause dur="0.5"/> or you could look at that <pause dur="0.9"/> and <pause dur="2.2"/> there you could have multiple events so you'd want to say first recurrence <pause dur="0.8"/> if you're going over to something like epilepsy or asthma where you have repeated <pause dur="0.2"/> # attacks <pause dur="0.6"/> quite often you won't 
be using survival analysis you'll be using <pause dur="0.4"/> methods for modelling <pause dur="0.6"/> stochastic processes <pause dur="0.2"/> which some of you will have studied <pause dur="2.0"/> <vocal desc="cough" iterated="n"/> <pause dur="0.8"/> and you may or may not want death from a particular cause you may only want deaths from lung cancers <pause dur="0.6"/> so any deaths from <pause dur="1.1"/> heart attacks <pause dur="0.2"/> might not be of interest <pause dur="4.3"/> well that's fine <pause dur="1.9"/> the most the one that's going to <pause dur="0.2"/> mean that we've got complications in life is that <pause dur="1.4"/> defined end point <pause dur="0.5"/> <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="10"/> death <pause dur="0.2"/> or <pause dur="1.1"/> a recurrent <pause dur="2.2"/> a recurrence of the tumour or <pause dur="0.6"/> as i said in the case of labour statistics birth can be your end point <pause dur="2.0"/> all studies of premature children and and delaying <pause dur="1.1"/> # the birth of the child birth will be an end point <pause dur="0.7"/> # study that <pause dur="0.2"/> biological sciences was hoping to do <pause dur="0.6"/> but of course the 
whole point is lost to follow-up <pause dur="0.5"/> and what do we do about loss to follow-up <pause dur="2.0"/> well that brings us into the major <pause dur="0.5"/> definition that we <pause dur="0.7"/> have in <pause dur="2.2"/> survival analysis of censoring <pause dur="2.1"/> and <pause dur="4.5"/> so <pause dur="0.9"/> i'll <trunc>ca</trunc> <pause dur="0.5"/> <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="1"/> call this four <pause dur="0.2"/> it's the one first one two three that are the essential things <pause dur="1.3"/> to have survival analysis four is required to make sense of <pause dur="0.2"/> some of the rest of this <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="3"/> which is <pause dur="1.5"/> censoring <pause dur="2.2"/> okay most of you might have thought of censoring in terms of <pause dur="0.9"/> governments telling you what films you can't can or can't watch or extracting <pause dur="1.5"/> parts of newspapers some of some of most of you won't have but some of us have been in countries where the newspapers appear with blank sections <pause dur="0.7"/> 'cause it's been written out <pause dur="0.9"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> and that's <pause dur="0.4"/> the same <pause dur="0.3"/> <vocal desc="cough" iterated="n"/> 
same meaning <pause dur="0.4"/> the reason the word's choosed in this <pause dur="0.3"/> chosen in this context <pause dur="0.5"/> censoring is just saying we have no more information <pause dur="2.3"/> so censoring <pause dur="0.8"/> <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="3"/> of <pause dur="0.5"/> times <pause dur="2.0"/> and the <trunc>w</trunc> mechanism in which this <pause dur="0.2"/> is viewed <pause dur="0.4"/> is to say that <pause dur="2.2"/> <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="13"/> we have <pause dur="0.8"/> for each individual <pause dur="7.9"/> # where am i going <pause dur="0.4"/> oops up here i think <pause dur="1.5"/> <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="1"/> for each individual <pause dur="2.0"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="12"/> a time <pause dur="1.7"/> C-I <pause dur="2.9"/> <trunc>m</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> beyond which we don't observe them <pause dur="14.9"/> do not <pause dur="4.0"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="6"/> observe them <pause dur="2.2"/> okay <pause dur="0.6"/> so this means in fact that # <pause dur="1.4"/> time <pause dur="2.8"/> that we're actually going to observe is made up of <pause dur="0.6"/> two parts so <pause dur="0.6"/> if we <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="34"/> let <pause dur="2.9"/> the <pause dur="0.3"/> 
or an individual's <pause dur="6.0"/> actual lifetime <pause dur="0.5"/> what would we we would see if we were able to follow them up <pause dur="0.3"/> indefinitely <pause dur="4.1"/> be <pause dur="1.7"/> X-I <pause dur="5.0"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="18"/> then <pause dur="2.0"/> we <pause dur="4.8"/> observe <pause dur="0.7"/> the survival time <pause dur="8.9"/> so we're going to observe the survival time <pause dur="2.3"/> <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="1"/> which we're going to call T-I <pause dur="2.7"/> and T-I is a function of <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="4"/> two things <pause dur="0.8"/> X-I <pause dur="1.7"/> and C-I <pause dur="3.0"/> so can you write down what that function must be <pause dur="2.9"/> the observed survival time is what function of the <pause dur="0.5"/> actual survival time and censoring <pause dur="11.3"/> <event desc="drinks" iterated="n"/> simple function <pause dur="11.9"/> if you think of that top left board <pause dur="2.7"/> where we've got crosses and then we've got the lines that go into circles or keep going on right <pause dur="1.3"/> and if we were to censor at two-thousand <pause dur="3.2"/> what do we do <pause dur="0.5"/> with any line that goes through that two-thousand mark <pause dur="4.5"/> we take the first line <pause dur="1.5"/> are we going to <trunc>s</trunc> observe the censoring 
time or the death time <pause dur="6.6"/> right we're always going to observe the <pause dur="1.2"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> i'm going to regret this aren't i <pause dur="4.6"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="5"/> this person had a notional <pause dur="1.3"/> censoring time <pause dur="3.5"/> we've got notional censoring times for these people <pause dur="0.2"/> and we'll <trunc>al</trunc> always observe the minimum <pause dur="1.3"/> of <pause dur="1.7"/> the death time <pause dur="1.1"/> and the censoring time because that individual <pause dur="0.4"/> we'd stopped watching at two-thousand so we wouldn't have seen them <pause dur="0.4"/> so the <pause dur="4.3"/> the function we want here <pause dur="0.3"/> is <pause dur="1.6"/> <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="2"/> min <pause dur="5.3"/> ah <pause dur="5.4"/> but we don't only observe the minimum <pause dur="0.4"/> 'cause that wouldn't be much use to us <pause dur="0.9"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="14"/> we also need <pause dur="0.2"/> and <pause dur="1.4"/> an indicator function <pause dur="10.4"/> and this'll sometimes be <pause dur="0.5"/> given as a death and sometimes be given as censoring <pause dur="0.6"/> we'll call it <pause dur="1.1"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="12"/> delta-I <pause dur="1.1"/> which is going to equal one <pause dur="1.2"/> if <pause dur="2.8"/> X-I <pause dur="0.2"/> is less than or equal to <pause dur="0.4"/> C-I <pause dur="1.3"/> in that case you can think of it as indicating that the death has occurred <pause dur="0.8"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="4"/> and it's going to equal zero <pause dur="0.3"/> if <pause dur="1.9"/> X-I is greater than C-I <pause dur="0.7"/> 
in other words we haven't actually observed the event <pause dur="15.5"/> in all the analysis that we do <pause dur="0.3"/> we're going to be assuming <pause dur="0.4"/> that censoring is <pause dur="1.6"/> non-informative that we're not going to learn anything from the censoring <pause dur="2.0"/> the ways in which censoring <pause dur="0.7"/> turn up they actually are given the names type one and type two <pause dur="0.6"/> as i quite often find it difficult to remember which one is which i'm not going to <pause dur="0.3"/> ask you to do that <pause dur="1.1"/> type one censoring <pause dur="0.6"/> is the kind of thing you most often get in medical statistics <pause dur="0.9"/> <vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/> you have a study <pause dur="0.7"/> it has to finish at some point <pause dur="1.5"/> so if it finishes at two-thousand or if it finishes <pause dur="0.6"/> <vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/> <pause dur="0.7"/> at a series of dates so it finishes in two-thousand <pause dur="0.8"/> in <pause dur="0.2"/> the Walsgrave Hospital but we carry out data collection in one or two other hospitals at a later date <pause dur="0.8"/> but we're still finishing at fixed times <pause dur="0.7"/> then that's called type one censoring <pause dur="0.4"/> the reason you don't observe people <pause dur="1.0"/> isn't because <pause dur="0.4"/> <vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/> <pause dur="0.3"/> you've decided i'm going to ignore that person it's for a fixed time <pause dur="0.2"/> you've 
stopped the study <pause dur="1.1"/> type two censoring <pause dur="0.3"/> is <pause dur="0.3"/> much less common in medical statistics but it's very common in engineering <pause dur="0.6"/> which is to say <pause dur="0.7"/> i'm going to observe this cohort of individuals <pause dur="0.4"/> until a certain number or certain percentage of them have died <pause dur="0.6"/> or <kinesic desc="makes quotation mark gesture" iterated="n"/> failed <pause dur="0.5"/> so i'm putting <pause dur="0.3"/> twenty <pause dur="0.3"/> items on test <pause dur="0.7"/> at different loadings <pause dur="0.8"/> and <pause dur="0.3"/> once we've <pause dur="0.2"/> put the loads up to the point at which <pause dur="1.1"/> ten of them have failed <pause dur="0.4"/> i'm going to stop the study <pause dur="0.7"/> so type two censoring <pause dur="1.0"/> is dependent on the number of failures so it actually does depend on the whole <pause dur="0.4"/> time process up to that point <pause dur="1.3"/> the way in which it determines when the tenth failure will occur <pause dur="0.6"/> but what it doesn't do is depend on anything in the future <pause dur="2.1"/> and then you can get <pause dur="0.3"/> other kinds of <pause dur="0.2"/> censoring <trunc>mecha</trunc> mechanisms <pause dur="2.3"/> but <pause dur="1.4"/> what's a <trunc>s</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> crucial is that you want your <pause dur="2.4"/> so <pause dur="0.3"/> <trunc>i</trunc> in this course <pause dur="0.3"/> well there is research in other things <pause dur="0.4"/> <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="15"/> but <pause dur="0.9"/> in this 
course and in most <pause dur="0.6"/> of the work that you'll look at <pause dur="2.9"/> we <pause dur="0.5"/> assume <pause dur="4.5"/> that <pause dur="0.9"/> # <pause dur="9.0"/> right <pause dur="0.9"/> assume that <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="18"/> censoring <pause dur="4.0"/> is <pause dur="2.2"/> independent <pause dur="3.4"/> in a fairly general sense of <pause dur="3.1"/> survival <pause dur="11.6"/> what we want <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="19"/> more formally is that the probability that <pause dur="1.1"/> T is greater than <pause dur="0.6"/> some value T <pause dur="1.4"/> given that <pause dur="0.9"/> this was censored <pause dur="1.6"/> at <pause dur="0.6"/> time <pause dur="1.2"/> C <pause dur="2.2"/> well that shouldn't depend on C <pause dur="2.4"/> as in that that <pause dur="0.3"/> particular point <pause dur="0.5"/> the times have been <pause dur="0.4"/> censored <pause dur="1.2"/> so we just <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="8"/> want that to be equal to the probability that T is greater than T <pause dur="0.7"/> given that we already know that the time <pause dur="0.8"/> is greater than C <pause dur="2.4"/> not the fact of censoring just <pause dur="0.2"/> the sheer time so <pause dur="1.5"/><kinesic desc="indicates point on board" iterated="n"/> this would hold true <pause dur="0.8"/> true for all times before that actual censoring time <pause dur="4.4"/> so having got the <pause dur="0.2"/> definition of the survival time <pause dur="2.7"/> the thing that we <pause dur="0.2"/> the main <pause dur="0.5"/> variable that we use within survival is <pause dur="1.2"/> 
<kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="22"/> the survival function <pause dur="0.4"/> is the focus <pause dur="3.6"/> sorry survival function <pause dur="2.4"/> almost invariably called <pause dur="0.8"/> S for survival S-T-of-T <pause dur="1.1"/> is the probability of <pause dur="0.5"/> the random variable T <pause dur="0.8"/> being greater than time T <pause dur="0.2"/> probability of surviving beyond time T <pause dur="0.9"/> so what <pause dur="0.4"/> how does that relate to the functions you're used to dealing with with random variables <pause dur="0.8"/> tell the person <pause dur="0.2"/> next to you <pause dur="0.2"/> how you'd write that in terms of a familiar function <pause dur="1.4"/> and what the function is <pause dur="24.3"/> any volunteers <pause dur="2.3"/> apart from the usual suspects <pause dur="2.0"/> does it look like anything you recollect meeting before <pause dur="4.5"/> yes <pause dur="2.6"/> puzzled looks <pause dur="0.2"/> <vocal desc="laugh" iterated="n"/> <pause dur="3.0"/> someone be kind to me <pause dur="0.2"/> where have you seen a function like this before <pause dur="1.9"/> but what was the function <pause dur="6.0"/> you've all seen it <vocal desc="laugh" iterated="n"/><pause dur="10.7"/> some volunteer <pause dur="2.8"/> no <pause dur="0.3"/> no idea <pause dur="4.2"/> probabilities <pause dur="0.2"/> what's one of the
