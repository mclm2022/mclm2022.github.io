<u who="nm0690"> okay looking <pause dur="1.5"/> at the <pause dur="0.3"/> thermodynamic stability of organometallic compounds <pause dur="0.9"/> # what i'd like to do now is turn to <pause dur="0.4"/> how you actually make <pause dur="0.2"/> the things <pause dur="0.8"/> in other words the <trunc>f</trunc> synthesis <pause dur="1.2"/> now the first thing <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="1.0"/> to observe before we start actually on methods of synthesis <pause dur="0.8"/> is that some of these compounds are extremely sensitive <pause dur="0.5"/> to air and water <pause dur="1.4"/> and the origin <pause dur="0.4"/> of that sensitivity <pause dur="0.9"/> is the metal-carbon bond <pause dur="1.1"/> or <pause dur="0.5"/> if they're very ionic of course the carbanion if you have a metal <pause dur="1.5"/> directly bonded <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="1"/> to carbon <pause dur="1.1"/> which is <trunc>w</trunc> our definition of an organometallic compound <pause dur="0.5"/> you either have a covalent bond <pause dur="0.3"/> which must be the source of reactivity <pause dur="0.7"/> or you have something approaching <pause dur="0.7"/> M-plus <pause dur="1.0"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="2"/> C-minus <pause dur="0.4"/> which of course <pause dur="0.8"/> is an ionic <pause dur="0.5"/> # arrangement <pause dur="0.2"/> now <pause dur="1.4"/> i suppose it's true to say that no organometallic compound <pause dur="0.7"/> is totally ionic i mean there's no organometallic equivalent should we say of caesium fluoride <pause dur="0.9"/> but some organometallics let's say <pause dur="1.0"/> # alkyls of <pause dur="0.2"/> you know caesium and ribidium the very electropositive metals <pause dur="0.8"/> and even of 
sodium and lithium <pause dur="0.5"/> are very substantially <pause dur="1.0"/> polar <pause dur="0.4"/> they have a large polar <pause dur="0.4"/> component <pause dur="0.5"/> so if you regard them as ionic of course <pause dur="1.5"/> the carbanion <pause dur="0.2"/> is the source of reactivity <pause dur="0.7"/> carbanions <pause dur="0.4"/> if even if you have them in organic chemistry are incredibly reactive they would react with oxygen with water with all sorts of things <pause dur="0.9"/> if they're covalent <pause dur="0.3"/> then it's the metal-carbon bond which is the source of the reactivity <pause dur="1.4"/> now it makes it much simpler when discussing the synthesis if we just consider <pause dur="0.4"/> what precautions are necessary <pause dur="0.6"/> so if materials are sensitive <pause dur="2.9"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="7"/> to let's say air <pause dur="1.3"/> and it's really by that we mean oxygen of course because <pause dur="0.5"/> in the air <pause dur="0.5"/> there's <pause dur="0.2"/> one-fifth oxygen roughly <pause dur="0.8"/> the remainder is mainly nitrogen which of course hardly reacts with anything but i'll come to the one thing it does react with <pause dur="1.0"/> a little bit of C-O-two which will react with very reactive ones <pause dur="0.5"/> and water <pause dur="3.3"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="3"/> so if they're sensitive to air and water <pause dur="0.8"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> let's remember by the way that <pause dur="1.1"/> the air <pause dur="0.7"/> is always wet <pause dur="0.5"/> when you may think on a 
bright sunny warm summer's day it's pretty dry <pause dur="0.6"/> but the air <pause dur="0.2"/> certainly in this climate always contains substantial amounts of water <pause dur="0.5"/> so if something is sensitive to water <pause dur="1.3"/> you've got to keep out air <pause dur="0.2"/> because otherwise it's just going to go off <pause dur="0.5"/> now how do you do that what does that mean it means <pause dur="0.7"/> that you must have an atmosphere <pause dur="0.9"/> above your apparatus <pause dur="1.4"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="4"/> of dry <pause dur="1.7"/> nitrogen is the common one <pause dur="0.2"/> it's cheap <pause dur="0.5"/> it's available fairly pure <pause dur="1.1"/> and sometimes much easier to use but much more expensive <pause dur="0.7"/> you can use argon <pause dur="1.3"/> experimentally argon is much easier to use for the very simple reason <pause dur="0.4"/> it's much heavier <pause dur="0.4"/> than air <pause dur="0.5"/> nitrogen of course is roughly the same density as air <pause dur="1.5"/> and so <pause dur="0.5"/> if you want to keep something <pause dur="0.2"/> in a <pause dur="0.2"/> in a flask <pause dur="0.6"/> that contains nitrogen <pause dur="0.6"/> you have a problem you must keep it stoppered <pause dur="0.5"/> or under vacuum or under a flow of nitrogen at all times <pause dur="0.9"/> if you've got something that's air-sensitive and you've got a <pause dur="0.8"/> covered with argon of course <pause dur="0.3"/> for quite some minutes argon <pause dur="0.4"/> will stay <pause dur="0.7"/> in the flask <pause dur="0.4"/> 
because it's much heavier than air <pause dur="0.2"/> so it's much easier to work with argon <pause dur="0.5"/> but as i say it's much dearer <pause dur="0.4"/> and so experimentally you know you <pause dur="0.2"/> generally only use argon for very <pause dur="0.2"/> precious compounds <pause dur="0.4"/> or extremely sensitive material <pause dur="2.7"/> # and this also means then that all your solvents <pause dur="1.5"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="6"/> must be degassed <pause dur="2.4"/> the air removed which is normally done under vacuum <pause dur="0.7"/> and of course <pause dur="0.8"/> because of the water <pause dur="0.6"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="1"/> they must be dry <pause dur="0.7"/> and normally <pause dur="0.5"/> if you're working with organometallic compounds <pause dur="0.7"/> for their own sake and you're not using them just as tests or as reagents but you want to study them <pause dur="0.7"/> they're normally <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="6"/> dried over sodium <pause dur="0.6"/> potassium alloy <pause dur="1.7"/> and the reason for that <pause dur="0.4"/> is that it's much more reactive <pause dur="0.4"/> than just using sodium and it's much more efficient at drying them <pause dur="2.2"/> and <pause dur="0.9"/> so <pause dur="0.2"/> the other thing is it's so that's your <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="27"/> atmosphere <pause dur="0.5"/> those are your solvents and three the apparatus <pause dur="3.1"/> must be either <pause dur="1.4"/> under vacuum <pause dur="4.1"/> or if that's not <pause dur="0.4"/> possible <pause dur="0.6"/> it must be under <pause dur="2.0"/> a flow <pause dur="1.5"/> of inert gas that's to say nitrogen or argon <pause dur="2.4"/> so when i say for 
example <pause dur="0.3"/> that a particular <pause dur="0.3"/> kind of compound <pause dur="0.5"/> is sensitive to air and water or is sensitive to one of them <pause dur="0.6"/> those are the conditions that you need to use <pause dur="2.1"/> okay <pause dur="0.7"/> so how what methods do we use <pause dur="0.5"/> now <trunc>th</trunc> obviously if you want to make a metal derivative <pause dur="0.6"/> of an organic compound <pause dur="0.8"/> the easiest way in principle by far <pause dur="0.5"/> is to take metal <pause dur="1.3"/> and some organic derivative of the compound that you want and that's normally <pause dur="0.5"/> a halogen <pause dur="0.6"/> so for example <pause dur="0.3"/> let's <pause dur="0.2"/> let's just take <pause dur="0.2"/> one <pause dur="0.3"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="13"/> the first method <pause dur="0.5"/> from the metal <pause dur="0.9"/> plus an organic compound <pause dur="9.6"/> the classic metals for which this works are lithium and magnesium those are the <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="10"/> best known <pause dur="2.1"/> but of course it will work for the heavier alkali metals sodium potassium <pause dur="0.4"/> <trunc>s</trunc> rubidium and caesium and so on <pause dur="0.5"/> and i'll give you <pause dur="0.7"/> details of which metals are useful <pause dur="0.3"/> later on but those are the classic examples <pause dur="0.8"/> so for example you could take <pause dur="0.3"/> lithium metal <pause dur="0.8"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="1"/>  plus <pause dur="0.9"/> what should we say you could take # <pause dur="0.2"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="4"/> ethyl bromide <pause dur="1.8"/> and what you would get out of that <pause dur="1.1"/> assuming <pause dur="0.3"/> that you <pause dur="1.4"/> used the conditions above you had a 
dry atmosphere dry solvents and all the rest of it <pause dur="0.7"/> you would get <pause dur="0.8"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="7"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> lithium bromide <pause dur="1.3"/> plus <pause dur="0.6"/> lithium ethyl <pause dur="0.9"/> and i'm just using E-T as an abbreviation <pause dur="0.4"/> for C-two-H-five the ethyl group <pause dur="4.7"/> lithium ethyl <pause dur="0.7"/> is very sensitive to oxygen <pause dur="0.6"/> and to water <pause dur="1.7"/> and i should explain one other thing which perhaps i should have mentioned earlier but just let me come to it now <pause dur="1.3"/> what is it <pause dur="0.7"/> that lithium <pause dur="0.2"/> ethyl <pause dur="0.5"/> reacts with in water <pause dur="0.6"/> it is of course the proton <pause dur="0.4"/> if you take lithium ethyl <pause dur="3.0"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="12"/> with water <pause dur="1.3"/> what you will get <pause dur="0.2"/> is lithium hydroxide <pause dur="0.6"/> and ethane <pause dur="2.4"/> that's what happens that's the decomposition reaction with water <pause dur="1.0"/> and how does it work of course it works because <pause dur="0.5"/> the water <pause dur="0.2"/> gives you a very low concentration of protons <pause dur="0.6"/> those protons cleave <pause dur="0.4"/> the lithium to carbon bond in lithium ethyl <pause dur="2.2"/> now <pause dur="1.8"/> that means <pause dur="0.7"/> that in general <pause dur="0.9"/> any solvent which will give you a concentration of protons <pause dur="0.4"/> is going to be bad news <pause dur="0.8"/> for these organometallic compounds <pause dur="0.3"/> and so <pause dur="0.7"/> when you do this reaction <pause dur="0.2"/> in a solvent the solvent <pause dur="0.7"/> must not provide <pause dur="0.5"/> 
any concentration of protons otherwise you'll simply decompose the product as it's formed <pause dur="0.7"/> so <pause dur="0.4"/> we must use what we call an <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="6"/> aprotic <pause dur="1.0"/> solvent just one <pause dur="3.5"/> aprotic without protons okay <pause dur="0.2"/> of course it doesn't mean that there isn't hydrogen in the solvent it just means <pause dur="0.4"/> that this solvent does not produce any appreciable concentration <pause dur="0.6"/> of the proton in solution <pause dur="0.6"/> so for example <pause dur="0.4"/> you could use <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="2"/> diethyl ether <pause dur="1.0"/> you can use T-H-F <pause dur="1.4"/> <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="1"/> ethers are quite common <pause dur="0.5"/> and they're <trunc>v</trunc> they're very good <pause dur="1.4"/> in principle you could use an alkane you could use hexane <pause dur="0.2"/> but i'm going to put that in brackets because <pause dur="0.8"/> although you can get the reactions to go in hexane under industrial conditions with high temperatures <pause dur="1.2"/> it's extremely difficult <pause dur="0.6"/> to get that reaction to work in the laboratory at normal sort of temperatures <pause dur="0.3"/> so in principle you can use hexane <pause dur="0.7"/> but you <pause dur="0.8"/> in the lab you'd be better off sticking with some kind of ethereal solvent <pause dur="0.9"/> # <pause dur="0.9"/> a protic solvent <pause dur="3.7"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="9"/> which i should emphasize is no use here at all <pause dur="1.4"/> so i'll put them in 
brackets but protic solvents would be things you know like <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="12"/> ethanol <pause dur="1.0"/> # methanol <pause dur="1.4"/> any acid of course is highly protic by these standards and any amine <pause dur="2.3"/> would be useless <pause dur="0.3"/> we normally think of amines as being basic <pause dur="0.3"/> because of the lone pair of electrons on the nitrogen <pause dur="1.1"/> but an amine can produce a very low concentration of protons it's also acidic <pause dur="0.9"/> in terms of <pause dur="0.7"/> these highly sensitive <pause dur="0.5"/> metal to carbon bonds <pause dur="0.3"/> so you wouldn't <pause dur="0.5"/> you couldn't use an amine <pause dur="0.5"/> and of course equally <pause dur="0.7"/> you couldn't use a thiol <pause dur="0.5"/> <trunc>no</trunc> you probably wouldn't want to <pause dur="0.3"/> but all of those that i've put in the square brackets there <pause dur="0.7"/> provide tiny concentrations of protons in solution and they will simply decompose <pause dur="0.4"/> your compounds so you cannot use <pause dur="0.5"/> those <pause dur="1.1"/> # materials <pause dur="6.3"/> the other classic reaction which you may have done in the lab i don't know but you will certainly know about <pause dur="0.6"/> where you can use a metal <pause dur="0.2"/> is magnesium where you get a Grignard reagent <pause dur="0.5"/> it's a slightly different reaction of course <pause dur="0.6"/> because normally with a Grignard 
reagent <pause dur="0.5"/> you simply start with ordinary magnesium and the halide <pause dur="0.3"/> and you don't of course get the formation <pause dur="0.2"/> of magnesium halide <pause dur="0.3"/> it's an insertion reaction <pause dur="0.3"/> of the metal <pause dur="0.6"/> into <pause dur="0.3"/> the carbon-halogen bond <pause dur="0.4"/> so for example let's take just a very well known example <pause dur="0.4"/> if you <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="9"/> take magnesium <pause dur="0.7"/> plus methyl iodide <pause dur="1.7"/> you do this let's say under nitrogen <pause dur="0.4"/> and you will do it <pause dur="0.2"/> we'll say just to give you an example in diethyl ether as a typical aprotic solvent <pause dur="0.6"/> you will produce methyl <pause dur="0.2"/> magnesium iodide <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="3"/><pause dur="4.7"/> you don't get any magnesium iodide you just get <pause dur="0.3"/> the <pause dur="0.5"/> if you like the addition reaction the insertion of magnesium the metal <pause dur="0.5"/> between carbon and halogen <pause dur="2.1"/> and i write it of course with the lines here <pause dur="0.3"/> just to emphasize that this is a genuine organometallic compound <pause dur="0.3"/> it contains a bond <pause dur="0.4"/> between carbon and magnesium <pause dur="0.6"/> later on <pause dur="0.5"/> we'll <pause dur="0.4"/> discuss <pause dur="0.7"/> what the actual structures <pause dur="0.2"/> of these compounds are <pause dur="0.2"/> because although i've written lithium ethyl up there as though it was simply <pause dur="0.5"/> one lithium metal <pause dur="0.3"/> bonded to one ethyl group <pause dur="0.9"/> 
its structure actually turns out to be more complicated than that <pause dur="0.3"/> for reasons that i will explain <pause dur="0.5"/> in a few <pause dur="0.4"/> minutes later on <pause dur="0.5"/> but <pause dur="1.8"/> the point about it is they contain direct bonds between lithium and carbon <pause dur="0.2"/> and so <pause dur="0.3"/> they are organometallic compounds <pause dur="2.9"/> now <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="4.2"/> oh no that's all right <pause dur="0.2"/> that's okay <pause dur="20.5"/> we will find that both of these reagents that's to say <pause dur="0.7"/> oh we've lost them but both the Grignard reagents <pause dur="0.7"/> and the lithium reagents are themselves <pause dur="0.5"/> incredibly useful <pause dur="0.5"/> for generating other organometallic compounds so just bear them in mind we'll come back to them many times <pause dur="2.7"/> all right <pause dur="1.4"/> now <pause dur="1.5"/> so that brings us up to the next kind of general reaction for making organometallic compounds <pause dur="0.5"/> and these we can call <pause dur="0.7"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="11"/> exchange reactions <pause dur="9.3"/> now what do i mean by exchange reactions # <pause dur="0.5"/> the first kind <pause dur="0.2"/> i'll talk about is where you exchange between two <pause dur="0.6"/> different metals <pause dur="0.6"/> so we'll call <pause dur="1.1"/> this <pause dur="0.7"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="8"/> metal-metal exchange <pause dur="5.9"/> and i think you'll see <pause dur="0.2"/> why it's so called in a minute <pause dur="2.1"/> let's just imagine <pause dur="0.2"/> for a moment <pause dur="0.7"/> that you want to make vinyl 
lithium <pause dur="0.2"/> the compound <pause dur="0.6"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="4"/> C-H-two <pause dur="0.5"/> double-bond <pause dur="0.6"/> C-H <pause dur="0.8"/> lithium <pause dur="1.0"/> let's assume that you want to make that <pause dur="1.7"/> from what we've said so far what you might well try <pause dur="0.2"/> would be <pause dur="0.4"/> to take <pause dur="0.3"/> vinyl <pause dur="0.4"/> chloride or vinyl bromide <pause dur="0.4"/> and metallic lithium <pause dur="0.4"/> it sounds like <pause dur="0.5"/> a good bet <pause dur="1.3"/> there is a problem with that though <pause dur="0.7"/> and the problem is simply it doesn't work <pause dur="0.5"/> lithium does not react with vinyl <shift feature="voice" new="laugh"/>chloride<shift feature="voice" new="normal"/> or vinyl bromide <pause dur="0.4"/> there's a second problem of course <pause dur="0.5"/> which in the laboratory you normally overcome which is that vinyl chloride and vinyl bromide are both highly carcinogenic <pause dur="0.5"/> but assuming that you've got the <trunc>c</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> proper apparatus for handling <pause dur="0.2"/> dangerous compounds <pause dur="0.5"/> even then <pause dur="0.4"/> the thing the <pause dur="0.2"/> the chemistry doesn't work if you had C-H-two-double-bond-C-H-B-R <pause dur="0.5"/> you find there's no reaction with lithium <pause dur="0.6"/> and that's of course because you're trying <pause dur="0.5"/> if you like <pause dur="0.4"/> you've got an S-P-two carbon here <pause dur="0.4"/> and you're trying effectively <pause dur="0.6"/> to do a substitution <pause dur="0.6"/> of the halogen <pause dur="0.3"/> by the metal and as you know <pause dur="0.3"/> it's not easy to do substitutions at S-P-two 
carbon so you've got to have another method <pause dur="0.7"/> and the method that works very well <pause dur="0.5"/> is to take <pause dur="0.8"/> the vinyl derivative <pause dur="1.0"/> of another <pause dur="1.1"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> metal <pause dur="0.6"/> so in this case <pause dur="0.3"/> you could take <pause dur="0.4"/> tetravinyl tin <pause dur="0.4"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="4"/> C-H-two-C-H <pause dur="0.9"/> four times <pause dur="0.4"/> tin <pause dur="0.6"/> i'll tell you how you make that later <pause dur="0.2"/> but you can make that <pause dur="0.3"/> without too much trouble <pause dur="0.8"/> there are four vinyl groups of course 'cause tin is in group fourteen it's four valence electrons so this is a perfectly normal tin four <pause dur="0.4"/> compound <pause dur="0.9"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="6"/> and if you treat that with four molecules of phenyl lithium <pause dur="1.2"/> just write P-H to <pause dur="0.3"/> abbreviate again for C-six-H-five the phenyl ring <pause dur="1.0"/> then the reaction works very nicely <pause dur="0.6"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="9"/> you get four <pause dur="0.7"/> molecules of vinyl lithium <pause dur="2.6"/> and the other product <pause dur="0.3"/> is tin <pause dur="0.8"/> tetraphenyl <pause dur="0.4"/> so you've exchanged organic groups <pause dur="0.2"/> between two metals <pause dur="0.6"/> the metal lithium and the metal tin <pause dur="0.3"/> hence the name metal-metal exchange <pause dur="2.4"/> of course you still have to <pause dur="0.5"/> carry this reaction out <pause dur="0.4"/> under all these <pause dur="0.3"/> conditions of an aprotic solvent <pause dur="0.9"/> and in the absence of air <pause dur="0.2"/> and with dry <pause dur="0.3"/> solvent <pause dur="0.4"/> because now <pause dur="0.8"/> the lithium starting material and the lithium product <pause dur="0.6"/> are both <pause dur="0.2"/> sensitive <pause dur="0.2"/> to water and oxygen so you have a double problem there <pause dur="0.9"/> 
it turns out that <pause dur="0.2"/> <trunc>t</trunc> organo-tin compounds are not sensitive either to oxygen or to water <pause dur="0.4"/> but the lithium <pause dur="0.2"/> derivative's what you're interested in <pause dur="0.4"/> and if you don't take the precautions <pause dur="0.3"/> you're going to be in trouble <pause dur="2.4"/> why do i choose incidentally phenyl lithium i mean why don't i choose butyl lithium <pause dur="0.8"/> the answer is <pause dur="0.4"/> it's purely experimental <pause dur="0.4"/> butyl lithium would work quite well <pause dur="1.0"/> the problem then would be <pause dur="0.5"/> i would be left <pause dur="0.6"/> with butyl tin <pause dur="0.5"/> which is a nice <pause dur="0.2"/> soluble <pause dur="0.3"/> organometallic reagent <pause dur="0.5"/> just like vinyl lithium <pause dur="0.9"/> but <pause dur="0.4"/> tetraphenyl tin <pause dur="0.6"/> is <pause dur="0.4"/> almost totally insoluble in all the solvents that you can choose certainly in ethers <pause dur="0.5"/> so it just precipitates out <pause dur="0.5"/> and it leaves you <pause dur="0.3"/> with a clean product you don't have to worry too much <pause dur="0.4"/> about purifying the material <pause dur="2.4"/> now there are many examples of this kind of exchange and we'll come across some of these <pause dur="0.3"/> later on <pause dur="0.4"/> but if i <pause dur="0.4"/> 
say that a compound is made by metal-metal exchange <pause dur="0.4"/> that is the kind of <pause dur="0.5"/> # reaction we're talking about <pause dur="2.4"/> okay <pause dur="0.2"/> so <pause dur="1.1"/> the next kind of exchange reaction <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="5"/> is metal-hydrogen </u><pause dur="8.1"/><event desc="woman enters room, gives the lecturer an attendance sheet to be passed around" iterated="n" n="nf1340"/> <u who="nf1340" trans="pause"> here's the attendance list </u><pause dur="0.4"/><u who="nm0690" trans="pause"> oh <pause dur="0.2"/> right thanks <pause dur="1.4"/> <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> <pause dur="2.7"/> okay <pause dur="0.7"/> i've been presented with the usual attendance list <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="0.9"/> could you oblige the powers that be by signing it and passing it on for me <pause dur="0.2"/> thanks <pause dur="2.1"/><event desc="passes around attendance sheet" iterated="n"/> okay <pause dur="0.3"/> now then so we have metal-hydrogen <pause dur="2.2"/> metal-hydrogen <pause dur="0.9"/> is a very important reaction <pause dur="1.8"/> and it's really based on the fact <pause dur="1.9"/> that the organometallic compounds <pause dur="0.2"/> let's say of lithium <pause dur="1.4"/> are very sensitive as we've already seen <pause dur="0.7"/> to anything that can give you protons <pause dur="1.3"/> so <pause dur="0.2"/> you can use that <pause dur="2.0"/> to make <pause dur="0.3"/> organometallic derivatives <pause dur="2.8"/> if the hydrogen that you want to replace <pause dur="1.7"/> has got some <pause dur="0.4"/> little bit of acidity about it <pause dur="0.9"/> so <pause dur="0.3"/> let's take a very typical example <pause dur="0.2"/> let's take <pause dur="0.3"/> let's take a classic example first and then i'll go on and show you that it's actually quite extensive <pause dur="1.1"/> # first of all <pause dur="1.0"/><event desc="breaks board" iterated="n"/> oh i've broken the board here but <pause dur="1.1"/> oh well <pause dur="2.3"/> let's take an 
example where you've got a fairly strong <pause dur="0.2"/> carbon acid now <pause dur="1.7"/> carbon-hydrogen compounds are not generally acidic <pause dur="0.5"/> so you need some special kind of structural feature <pause dur="1.1"/> to make <pause dur="0.2"/> a carbon acid which is what you need <pause dur="0.4"/> one such <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="5"/> compound is cyclopentadiene <pause dur="0.6"/> which is <pause dur="0.7"/> a five-membered ring of course <pause dur="0.4"/> with <pause dur="0.2"/> two double bonds in it now cyclopentadiene <pause dur="1.0"/> is peculiar <pause dur="0.2"/> it has hydrogens of course all the way <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="1"/> round <pause dur="0.5"/> but two hydrogens <pause dur="0.4"/> here <pause dur="2.5"/> and <trunc>i</trunc> <pause dur="0.7"/> its <pause dur="1.0"/> unusual character is because <pause dur="1.8"/> it's rather acidic for a hydrogen compound <pause dur="0.6"/> it will give you <pause dur="7.9"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="15"/> the anion <pause dur="0.9"/> plus hydrogen <pause dur="2.1"/> and let me just write that as hydrogen <pause dur="0.4"/> S for solvated because as you know H-plus doesn't exist in solution <pause dur="0.5"/> but i can't write water obviously because we can't do this reaction <pause dur="0.6"/> <trunc>i</trunc> in water because cyclopentadiene isn't soluble in water <pause dur="0.3"/> and in any case the anion would be <pause dur="0.3"/> decomposed by water <pause dur="0.6"/> so this will be in some <pause dur="0.3"/> other solvent <pause dur="0.2"/> that can sustain the ionization <pause dur="0.2"/> maybe T-H-F <pause dur="0.9"/> now why does this happen <pause dur="1.1"/> well the answer is very simple <pause dur="0.8"/> in the double bond 
of course i've <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="3"/> got two pi electrons <pause dur="1.7"/> and i've got two of them so that is four pi electrons <pause dur="1.7"/> if i take <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="5"/> one of these hydrogen bonds <pause dur="0.9"/> to carbon <pause dur="0.4"/> it obviously contains two electrons <pause dur="0.7"/> if i remove the proton <pause dur="0.7"/> over here <pause dur="0.9"/> of course i take no electrons with me because the proton has no electrons <pause dur="0.5"/> i leave those two electrons behind <pause dur="0.6"/> so that gives me <pause dur="0.2"/> six electrons <pause dur="0.6"/> and of course as you know from benzene chemistry <pause dur="1.1"/> if i've got six <pause dur="0.2"/> pi electrons <pause dur="0.5"/> i have an aromatic sextet <pause dur="0.3"/> and just as with benzene that's very stabilizing <pause dur="0.5"/> so for cyclopentadiene <pause dur="0.5"/> the anion <pause dur="0.9"/> is stabilized <pause dur="0.4"/> by having <pause dur="0.4"/> six pi electrons just as you find in benzene <pause dur="0.5"/> and therefore <pause dur="0.2"/> the reaction <pause dur="0.8"/> goes <pause dur="0.7"/> much more than it would with a typical <pause dur="0.5"/> carbon-hydrogen compound with any alkane <pause dur="0.6"/> now <pause dur="0.2"/> when i say <pause dur="1.0"/> it goes much more <pause dur="0.4"/> i don't mean this is like you know acetic acid i mean <pause dur="0.8"/> that <trunc>th</trunc> this is a tiny tiny concentration <pause dur="1.3"/> but it's dynamic you you can look it up in the textbooks you can find the figures <pause dur="0.3"/> i think for example <pause dur="0.2"/> if i remember let me just 
give you a guess i think the P-K-A for this molecule <pause dur="0.3"/> is something like <pause dur="0.4"/> fifteen <pause dur="0.5"/> that means <pause dur="1.4"/> that the concentration the molar concentration of hydrogen ions <pause dur="0.6"/> will be ten-to-the-minus <pause dur="0.3"/> fifteen <pause dur="0.5"/> water is ten-to-the-minus-seven <pause dur="0.4"/> so you know <pause dur="0.3"/> this is another <pause dur="0.2"/> ten<pause dur="0.6"/>to-the-<pause dur="0.2"/>eight <pause dur="0.5"/> less acidic than water <pause dur="0.6"/> but you will find <pause dur="0.2"/> that that's useful enough <pause dur="0.5"/> if you take <pause dur="0.4"/> cyclopentadiene <pause dur="2.6"/> # i'll write it out in full <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="23"/> 'cause then you can see what's happening <pause dur="0.7"/> if you take cyclopentadiene with sodium <pause dur="1.5"/> what you get <pause dur="0.5"/> is <pause dur="0.6"/> # sodium cyclopentadienide <pause dur="2.1"/><vocal desc="cough" iterated="n"/><pause dur="4.8"/> and of course <pause dur="0.3"/> we've lost a hydrogen <pause dur="1.7"/> and i'll just write that as a half-H-two because you know otherwise you've got to double everything up <pause dur="0.6"/> so <pause dur="0.9"/> what i've done is i started with two hydrogens here <pause dur="1.3"/> and i've replaced one of them <pause dur="0.5"/> with sodium <pause dur="0.9"/> now of course <pause dur="0.2"/> this is <pause dur="0.5"/> an ionic compound substantially <pause dur="0.5"/> because the reason that it goes in the first place <pause dur="0.3"/> is the stability <pause dur="0.4"/> of the cyclopentadienide anion <pause dur="0.5"/> and so the product <pause dur="0.4"/> is <pause dur="1.2"/> # a salt if you like <pause dur="0.6"/> but it's in exchange of sodium 
for hydrogen because if you write it out in <pause dur="0.3"/> a formula terms we start out <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="11"/> with C-five-H-six <pause dur="0.6"/> we react it with sodium <pause dur="0.4"/> and the product is sodium <pause dur="0.6"/> C-five-H-five <pause dur="3.4"/> and so i've <trunc>e</trunc> substituted or exchanged <pause dur="0.4"/> one hydrogen <pause dur="0.5"/> for <pause dur="0.5"/> a sodium <pause dur="0.2"/> so it's a metal<pause dur="0.2"/>-hydrogen exchange <pause dur="0.3"/> that reaction in the textbooks is sometimes <pause dur="0.4"/> referred to <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="5"/> simply as metallation <pause dur="5.1"/> some textbooks call it metallation i think that's a confusing term because <pause dur="0.6"/> any reaction which puts a metal <pause dur="0.5"/> in place of any other group be it a halogen or another metal <pause dur="0.4"/> is if you like a metallation <pause dur="0.3"/> you're adding metal to the compound <pause dur="0.9"/> but you will find that some textbooks use the term metallation <pause dur="0.4"/> so if you want to look it up you might have to look it up under the term metallation <pause dur="2.3"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> let me give you <pause dur="0.4"/> an example where it's <pause dur="0.3"/> much more evidently an exchange <pause dur="0.9"/> suppose we take <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="10"/> phenyl sodium <pause dur="1.3"/> and we take toluene <pause dur="6.7"/> now toluene of course is an even weaker acid I-E <pause dur="0.4"/> it has <pause dur="0.5"/> an even lower concentration of protons <pause dur="0.5"/> than cyclopentadiene <pause dur="0.6"/> but still <pause dur="1.1"/> it is a <pause dur="0.4"/> slightly 
stabilized anion C-H-two-minus <pause dur="0.6"/> negative charge can again interact with the aromatic ring <pause dur="0.3"/> so this is a <pause dur="0.4"/> i don't know what the P-K-A for this is it must be minuscule <pause dur="0.7"/> but nevertheless it's enough <pause dur="0.2"/> in the presence <pause dur="0.3"/> of a sodium <pause dur="0.2"/> organometallic compound <pause dur="0.4"/> the reaction goes <pause dur="0.2"/> you get <pause dur="1.6"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="5"/> exchange <pause dur="0.2"/> of one of the acidic hydrogens <pause dur="1.2"/> so that's benzyle sodium <pause dur="0.7"/> and you exchange that hydrogen for the sodium <pause dur="0.3"/> so the other product of course is if you like P-H-H <pause dur="0.8"/> or <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="5"/> benzene <pause dur="4.5"/> so that's a typical metal-hydrogen exchange <pause dur="7.4"/> so those are the the main <pause dur="0.4"/> important type of exchange reactions <pause dur="2.9"/> let's <pause dur="0.7"/> # finish off by looking at another very important class <pause dur="0.7"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="11"/> which are insertion reactions <pause dur="9.9"/> now of course <pause dur="1.0"/> i suppose in the number of <pause dur="0.4"/> compounds made and the number of times it's been used <pause dur="0.9"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="4"/> the synthesis of a Grignard reagent is <pause dur="0.2"/> probably <pause dur="0.7"/> the most widely-used insertion reaction in chemistry <pause dur="0.7"/> so we'll put that down first <pause dur="1.2"/> but <pause dur="4.5"/> many textbooks <pause dur="0.3"/> don't actually include it as an insertion reaction but of course formally 
it is <pause dur="0.9"/> so if i just put down the general reaction R-X<pause dur="0.2"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="7"/> plus <pause dur="0.2"/> M-G <pause dur="1.0"/> gives you <pause dur="0.6"/> R-M-G-X <pause dur="1.2"/> that is obviously <pause dur="0.3"/> in a formal sense an insertion reaction so we should include it <pause dur="5.2"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="4"/> a much more typical kind of insertion reaction <pause dur="0.6"/> is a reaction <pause dur="0.5"/> which involves insertion into <pause dur="0.7"/> a metal<pause dur="1.5"/>carbon bond that's already been formed <pause dur="0.5"/> so let's take for example <pause dur="0.4"/> butyl lithium <pause dur="3.1"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="4"/> which i'll write like that because that's the bond <pause dur="0.5"/> into which <pause dur="0.5"/> we're going to insert something <pause dur="0.8"/> now if you insert something <pause dur="0.5"/> we can use the example above the magnesium to show <pause dur="1.1"/> the <pause dur="0.2"/> the # <pause dur="0.2"/> the idea <pause dur="0.5"/> if i insert magnesium <pause dur="0.5"/> into <pause dur="0.6"/> the carbon-halogen bond of this <pause dur="0.4"/> R-X group <pause dur="2.3"/> the magnesium has got to be able to form <pause dur="0.6"/> two bonds <pause dur="0.8"/> because i've pushed it in between two elements and if the whole thing is going to stay together <pause dur="0.3"/> the magnesium has got to bond to the R <pause dur="0.2"/> and it's got to bond to the X <pause dur="0.7"/> another way of looking at this of course if you want to <pause dur="0.4"/> is to say <pause dur="0.5"/> that <pause dur="0.3"/> in terms of the metal <pause dur="1.0"/> its oxidation state increases <pause dur="0.2"/> by two <pause dur="0.7"/> oxidation state of course 
simply tells you the number of electrons <pause dur="0.4"/> that the metal is using to form bonds <pause dur="0.6"/> in magnesium metal <pause dur="0.5"/> its oxidation state is zero <pause dur="0.2"/> it's not using any electrons to form <pause dur="0.4"/> any <pause dur="0.5"/> ordinary covalent bonds <pause dur="1.0"/> when it goes to the Grignard reagent it's forming two bonds <pause dur="0.3"/> so it goes from magnesium nought to magnesium two <pause dur="1.1"/> and that shows you that the the thing that's inserted has got to be able to provide two electrons <pause dur="0.3"/> so that you can form two bonds <pause dur="0.5"/> in general <pause dur="0.4"/> that means <pause dur="0.3"/> that you've got to have some kind of unsaturated species <pause dur="0.3"/> so for example suppose <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="2"/> i was to take <pause dur="1.2"/> let's say <pause dur="0.5"/> an acetylene or an alkyne if you prefer <pause dur="0.4"/> so we'll take R-<pause dur="0.5"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="4"/>C<pause dur="0.4"/>-triple-bond-C-<pause dur="0.3"/>R <pause dur="0.8"/> and it's the <pause dur="0.3"/> pi bonds of the triple bond <pause dur="0.4"/> that can give rise to the new <pause dur="0.3"/> bonds <pause dur="1.5"/> this <kinesic desc="indicates point on board" iterated="n"/> can insert into the <pause dur="0.4"/> carbon lithium bond here and what you would get would be <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="8"/> R-<pause dur="0.3"/>C-<pause dur="0.7"/>C-<pause dur="0.4"/>R <pause dur="1.5"/> butyl <pause dur="0.7"/> and lithium <pause dur="1.9"/> and the insertion <pause dur="0.7"/> you will notice <pause dur="0.6"/> i chose a triple bond for a very <trunc>s</trunc> particular reason <pause dur="0.8"/> and that is simply that <pause dur="0.4"/> i can show with a triple bond <pause dur="0.8"/> the 
geometry of <pause dur="0.2"/> of the insertion <pause dur="0.5"/> if i'd started with a double bond <pause dur="0.4"/> i would get an alkane here <pause dur="0.3"/> and we'd have free rotation and we couldn't tell anything about it <pause dur="0.6"/> but starting with a triple bond i'm left with a double bond <pause dur="0.3"/> and so of course <pause dur="0.8"/> i can have <pause dur="0.2"/> the butyl and the lithium going cis about the double bond which is one <pause dur="0.2"/> isomer <pause dur="0.3"/> or i could have butyl here and lithium up here <pause dur="0.3"/> the trans arrangement <pause dur="0.3"/> which would also be stable <pause dur="0.3"/> different isomer <pause dur="0.5"/> but in fact they both go on the same side <pause dur="0.3"/> and so the <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="1"/> mechanism of that insertion <pause dur="0.3"/> is always a cis one <pause dur="10.2"/> so that is an insertion <pause dur="0.9"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="9"/> that's <pause dur="0.2"/> insertion into <pause dur="0.5"/> a metal <pause dur="0.7"/> to carbon bond <pause dur="4.4"/> <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="8"/> it's also possible to have insertion <pause dur="0.6"/> into a metal <pause dur="0.3"/> to hydrogen bond <pause dur="2.8"/> have you in organic chemistry <pause dur="0.5"/> done anything about hydroboration <pause dur="2.4"/> you've heard of it have you <pause dur="0.6"/> okay <pause dur="0.6"/> <trunc>hydroboro</trunc> <trunc>m</trunc> boron isn't really a metal so in a sense it's not <pause dur="0.3"/> relevant to organometallic chemistry <pause dur="0.4"/> but this is exactly the same kind of reaction <pause dur="0.8"/> 
so <trunc>f</trunc> let me just go over some familiar ground first and then <pause dur="0.5"/> i'll show you how it can be used <pause dur="0.7"/> to form <pause dur="0.5"/> # metal-carbon bonds <pause dur="2.6"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="5"/> if we start out with an olefin in this case <pause dur="0.8"/> doesn't matter what olefin <pause dur="0.7"/> i'll just <trunc>ha</trunc> we'll just have some general olefin <pause dur="0.9"/> here <pause dur="1.3"/> <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="6"/> and i've got let's say borane <pause dur="0.8"/> now <pause dur="1.5"/> you know of course that we can't actually start with borane itself because <pause dur="0.5"/> borane exists as a dimer B-two-H-six <pause dur="0.7"/> and that's rather inconvenient <pause dur="0.4"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="1"/> # so let's say <pause dur="0.2"/> we we'll <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="3"/> start out <pause dur="0.8"/> with the complex with T-H-F because <pause dur="0.2"/> the T-H-F complex is stable <pause dur="0.5"/> it doesn't dimerize <pause dur="0.5"/> because you donate a pair of electrons from the oxygen <pause dur="0.4"/> of the T-H-F <pause dur="0.3"/> to the boron <pause dur="0.3"/> and then the monomer is stable and that simplifies the <trunc>r</trunc> stoichiometry of the reaction <pause dur="0.7"/> now <pause dur="0.2"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="8"/> what happens here is <pause dur="0.8"/> we're going to insert into <pause dur="1.2"/> the B-H <pause dur="0.5"/> bond <pause dur="1.2"/> so the first thing of course you will get <pause dur="0.4"/> will be <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> well 
we'll <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="8"/> keep the T-H-F initially you'll get T-H-F <pause dur="0.7"/> H-two<pause dur="0.6"/>B <pause dur="0.3"/> now <pause dur="0.5"/> into the boron-hydrogen bond we're going to insert our olefin <pause dur="0.3"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="7"/> so we will have <pause dur="0.5"/> C<pause dur="1.3"/>C<pause dur="1.0"/>H <pause dur="2.5"/> that's hydroboration <pause dur="0.3"/> of course <pause dur="1.6"/> you still have in this molecule here two other boron-hydrogen bonds <pause dur="0.2"/> and so <pause dur="0.2"/> if you've got enough olefin <pause dur="0.5"/> the reaction will proceed <pause dur="1.8"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="4"/> in the presence of excess olefin <pause dur="0.5"/> the reaction will proceed <pause dur="0.4"/> until you get <pause dur="0.4"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="10"/> boron <pause dur="1.1"/> C-C depends what these groups are <pause dur="1.8"/> H <pause dur="1.6"/> three times <pause dur="1.9"/> perhaps to be mathematically accurate i <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="5"/> should put the hydrogen i guess inside the <pause dur="2.1"/> the bracket <pause dur="4.2"/> okay <pause dur="0.3"/> so <pause dur="0.5"/> that's an example you've come across before <pause dur="0.2"/> an unsaturated species is inserted into the boron-hydrogen bond <pause dur="0.4"/> and it's almost an organometallic example <pause dur="0.5"/> but there are many other <pause dur="5.7"/> there are many other metals well there are many metals <pause dur="2.9"/> which <pause dur="5.4"/> which undergo similar reactions <pause dur="0.6"/> and <pause dur="0.5"/> perhaps the most important of those is aluminium <pause dur="0.9"/> because <pause dur="1.2"/> the reaction between aluminium-hydrogen compounds <pause dur="0.5"/> and unsaturated species <pause dur="0.6"/> is used in industry a great deal <pause dur="0.5"/> to 
make aluminium alkyls <pause dur="4.6"/> so for example if we just take <pause dur="0.6"/> a typical example <pause dur="1.2"/> # let's say we start out with <pause dur="0.2"/> dibutyl <pause dur="1.3"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="2"/> aluminium <pause dur="0.4"/> hydride <pause dur="0.8"/> so that's a metal now aluminium <pause dur="0.4"/> hydrogen bond <pause dur="0.5"/> and we'll take ethene <pause dur="0.5"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="5"/> just to make a nice simple example <pause dur="2.8"/> the ethene inserts into the aluminium-hydrogen bond <pause dur="0.5"/> and the product that <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="7"/> you get is dibutyl <pause dur="0.5"/> aluminium ethyl <pause dur="6.8"/> i give you that example as i say it's used to make <trunc>alu</trunc> organo-aluminium compounds <pause dur="0.5"/> and you probably know that <pause dur="0.2"/> the chemical industry <pause dur="0.7"/> makes <pause dur="0.2"/> thousands of tons of aluminium alkyls <pause dur="0.9"/> every year because they're used in the catalysts that <pause dur="0.2"/> produce <pause dur="0.4"/> polythene <pause dur="0.5"/> polypropylene <pause dur="0.6"/> and a whole range of polyolefin catalysts <pause dur="0.9"/> # # <pause dur="0.7"/> are derived <pause dur="0.2"/> from organo-aluminium compounds <pause dur="0.4"/> and it's quite <pause dur="0.2"/> interesting that until you've had a bit of practice <pause dur="0.8"/> it would be extremely <pause dur="0.7"/> # difficult <pause dur="0.5"/> to carry out this reaction in the laboratory <pause dur="0.4"/> because a material like this <pause dur="0.6"/> not only reacts with oxygen <pause dur="0.5"/> if i was to have a bottle with this and take <trunc>th</trunc> <pause dur="0.4"/> the stopper out of it <pause dur="0.5"/> it 
simply bursts into flames it reacts with oxygen incredibly <pause dur="0.9"/> readily <pause dur="0.8"/> they're pyrophoric materials <pause dur="0.8"/> take the stopper out and i'd just have a sheet of flame <pause dur="0.4"/> from here <pause dur="0.4"/> to the ceiling i have actually <pause dur="0.3"/> not in one of these lectures but i have actually done it in a demonstration lecture <pause dur="0.6"/> and by <pause dur="0.7"/> gosh it i mean it <pause dur="0.2"/> it certainly frightens the lecturer if it doesn't frighten the audience <pause dur="0.5"/> they stand here you know you just take the stopper out and the next thing is you're hidden behind a sheet of flame they're very violent <pause dur="0.7"/> # materials <pause dur="0.6"/> but as i say industry <pause dur="0.2"/> has found ways i mean of course they <trunc>ha</trunc> they don't handle them in glass of course they handle them in stainless steel apparatus <pause dur="0.4"/> but you know thousands of tons of these things are made every year for industrial use <pause dur="1.6"/> okay <pause dur="0.4"/> # the other metals just so that you have a note of it i don't expect you to learn this list <pause dur="0.5"/> but the other metals that undergo this kind of reaction if i think about them <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> # tin <pause dur="0.5"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="2"/> does it very readily <pause dur="0.4"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="3"/> 
silicon does it <pause dur="1.0"/> silicon is important because that reaction is used in the production of silicones <pause dur="0.6"/> for floor polishes waterproofings and so on <pause dur="0.3"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="5"/> germanium does it <pause dur="0.7"/> zirconium does it <pause dur="1.3"/> don't know if i <pause dur="0.6"/> think of anything else # <pause dur="3.3"/> well that i think that those are the most important ones <pause dur="3.9"/> okay <pause dur="1.1"/> and finally <pause dur="3.3"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="4"/> this is really <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> another example of insertion into metal-hydrogen bonds <pause dur="2.0"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="13"/> but <trunc>usi</trunc> this particular case of using <pause dur="0.5"/> # diazomethane <pause dur="8.8"/> and it's just to show you that you <trunc>c</trunc> if you want to make methyls this is one very easy way you can do it <pause dur="0.7"/> if we were to take for example <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="4"/> triphenyl<pause dur="1.7"/>silane <pause dur="2.1"/> again silicon isn't a true metal but you <trunc>cou</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> you can put tin if you like it works just as well in fact i'll put tin because <pause dur="0.9"/> it's meant to be a metal <pause dur="1.3"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="2"/> so we've got tin <pause dur="1.9"/> and if i treat that with diazomethane <pause dur="1.3"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="6"/> which i'm sure you will have come across <pause dur="0.2"/> in organic chemistry but you can shout out if <pause dur="0.3"/> i'm wrong about that <pause dur="1.1"/> diazomethane is a very useful reagent <pause dur="0.3"/> because of course <pause dur="0.2"/> it behaves as a source 
of methylene <pause dur="1.2"/> because nitrogen is <pause dur="0.4"/> eliminated and nitrogen is thermodynamically so stable <pause dur="0.4"/> so the product from this <pause dur="0.5"/> is <pause dur="0.2"/> <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="10"/> P-H-three<pause dur="0.5"/>S-N well i can write it if you like as C-H-two-H but i mean it's just tin methyl of course <pause dur="0.7"/> and nitrogen <pause dur="0.8"/> and really it's the formation of nitrogen <pause dur="0.4"/> which is the driving force for that reaction <pause dur="8.1"/> okay so let me just <pause dur="0.7"/> since we the board has come full circle <pause dur="1.9"/> let me just emphasize for you <pause dur="2.7"/> the reactions where we'd have to be very careful to give you some feeling for this <pause dur="1.6"/> a Grignard reagent <pause dur="0.4"/> is decomposed <pause dur="0.2"/> by <pause dur="0.9"/> catalytic amounts of oxygen <pause dur="0.7"/> so you <trunc>ha</trunc> if you're making this Grignard reagent <pause dur="0.4"/> you'll have to work with pure dry nitrogen <pause dur="0.4"/> pure dry ether and get everything spot on <pause dur="3.2"/> lithium is the same <pause dur="2.8"/> sodium is even more so and there's a lesson there <pause dur="0.5"/> what what are we <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> actually <pause dur="0.2"/> learning from this well <pause dur="0.2"/> amongst other things <pause dur="1.1"/> sodium of course is one element lower in the periodic table than lithium <pause dur="0.7"/> so sodium is more electropositive <pause dur="0.2"/> than lithium <pause dur="0.6"/> makes the bond more 
polar <pause dur="0.5"/> the species more reactive <pause dur="0.2"/> and so <pause dur="0.5"/> if you if you have to take precautions with lithium you have to take them <pause dur="0.6"/> # doubled in spades <pause dur="0.2"/> for sodium <pause dur="0.3"/> so the same thing here if you want to make benzyl sodium <pause dur="0.6"/> you must work with <pause dur="0.2"/> pure dry nitrogen <pause dur="0.3"/> dry solvent dry gases no air no water <pause dur="1.6"/> same thing here this is lithium <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="1.9"/> well <pause dur="0.2"/> here <pause dur="0.6"/> borane actually is not sensitive to water oddly enough <pause dur="0.5"/> and the reason for that <pause dur="0.6"/> is quite simply <pause dur="0.6"/> that boron and hydrogen have <trunc>r</trunc> roughly the same electronegativity <pause dur="0.6"/> and so <pause dur="0.4"/> the boron-hydrogen bond <pause dur="1.0"/> is not very polar <pause dur="0.8"/> and so it is not attacked by water but it is attacked by oxygen <pause dur="0.5"/> so all of this would have to be done you could do it wet if you wanted <pause dur="0.2"/> <unclear>i mean it'd</unclear> be a bit <pause dur="0.5"/> peculiar but you could do it wet if you wanted <pause dur="0.4"/> as long <pause dur="0.3"/> as you excluded all <pause dur="0.6"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="1"/> oxygen <pause dur="0.2"/> from the reaction <pause dur="1.4"/> aluminium of course is heavier <pause dur="0.3"/> more electropositive <pause dur="0.7"/> aluminium reagents as i've said catch fire spontaneously in air <pause dur="0.5"/> they virtually explode with water <pause dur="0.2"/> so you want to be careful about wetness 
there <pause dur="1.9"/> # <pause dur="2.9"/> tin <pause dur="0.5"/> is group fourteen <pause dur="0.9"/> and so <pause dur="1.1"/> for reasons that i'll explain later <pause dur="0.2"/> it <pause dur="0.3"/> the organic compounds of tin <pause dur="0.4"/> not sensitive to water <pause dur="0.2"/> and they're not <pause dur="0.2"/> sensitive <pause dur="0.3"/> to oxygen <pause dur="0.6"/> so <pause dur="0.2"/> we can summarize the sensitivity <pause dur="0.2"/> in the following way <pause dur="5.1"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="5"/> # <pause dur="2.0"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="28"/> oxygen and water <pause dur="3.4"/> is all <pause dur="0.7"/> group one <pause dur="3.4"/> all <pause dur="0.8"/> group two <pause dur="3.6"/> and group <pause dur="2.1"/> thirteen <pause dur="1.2"/> # <pause dur="1.2"/> from aluminium down <pause dur="14.2"/> # oxygen alone <pause dur="2.0"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="23"/> would be <pause dur="0.4"/> # boron compounds generally <pause dur="3.5"/> and in general hydrides <pause dur="2.5"/> E-G <pause dur="1.5"/> S-I-H <pause dur="1.0"/> S-N-H <pause dur="4.6"/> now we've got one minute left so i'll finish up with just explaining <pause dur="2.2"/> the rationalization for that but we'll go on and discuss it in much greater detail next time <pause dur="0.6"/> but just <pause dur="2.4"/> to encapsulate these differences <pause dur="1.8"/> all these that we're talking about are main group <pause dur="0.5"/> metals <pause dur="1.3"/> so they all want <pause dur="0.2"/> or they all tend <pause dur="0.4"/> for reasons that we can describe in detail <pause dur="0.4"/> they all tend to have a complete octet of electrons <pause dur="0.2"/> you know the stability is associated with a complete octet <pause dur="1.9"/> now of 
course <pause dur="0.8"/> group one only have one electron so a <trunc>l</trunc> a lithium methyl monomer only has two electrons not an octet <pause dur="0.8"/> magnesium <pause dur="0.6"/> Grignard reagent only have four electrons no octet <pause dur="0.3"/> group thirteen only have six electrons <pause dur="0.4"/> so these things are all <pause dur="0.3"/> highly <pause dur="0.7"/> reactive and unstable and their structures we shall see reflect those <pause dur="0.9"/> if you go <pause dur="0.5"/> boron is curious with water because it's non-polar <pause dur="1.3"/> silicon and tin of course are in group fourteen <pause dur="0.4"/> they have four electrons <pause dur="0.2"/> they can form four covalent bonds which is an octet <pause dur="0.3"/> so in general <pause dur="0.2"/> their organometallic compounds are not sensitive to water or air <pause dur="0.5"/> it's only that the hydrogen compounds <pause dur="0.5"/> because it's hydrogen <pause dur="0.5"/> are very <pause dur="1.0"/> easily oxidized so they're sensitive to oxygen <pause dur="0.5"/> okay <pause dur="0.3"/> we'll <pause dur="0.7"/> stop there
