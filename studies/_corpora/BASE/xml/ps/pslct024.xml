i'll pass that on to <pause dur="0.5"/> the relevant # <pause dur="0.9"/> department in the faculty <pause dur="1.1"/> okay <pause dur="0.5"/> where we got to <pause dur="0.3"/> last week <pause dur="0.6"/> # was saying that <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> although the evidence is very conflicting very strongly conflicting <pause dur="0.5"/> there are apparently characteristic <pause dur="0.2"/> rhythmical differences <pause dur="0.4"/> between different languages <pause dur="2.9"/> and i said that although <pause dur="0.3"/> we're still very much in the dark about this <pause dur="0.5"/> there clearly would not be this rhythmical <pause dur="0.3"/> regularity <pause dur="0.3"/> unless it was fulfilling some function <pause dur="0.8"/> okay <pause dur="0.3"/> if it's true that every <pause dur="0.4"/> speaker of every language <pause dur="0.2"/> speaks with some kind of rhythm <pause dur="0.5"/> there must be some kind of function <pause dur="0.2"/> to that rhythm <pause dur="0.4"/> # because <pause dur="0.2"/> # on the whole we don't do things just for the fun of it <pause dur="0.4"/> # when we're speaking <pause dur="0.8"/> and # <pause dur="0.3"/> one of the major <pause dur="0.7"/> functions of rhythm <pause dur="0.3"/> that we suspect <pause dur="0.6"/><event desc="student enters room" iterated="n" n="sm0861"/> is that it helps us to divide speech up into units <pause dur="4.4"/> <unclear>hello</unclear> it's phonetics </u><pause dur="0.2"/> <u who="sm0861" trans="pause"> oh sorry <pause dur="0.2"/> wrong room <event desc="student leaves room" iterated="n" n="sm0861"/></u> <u who="nm0858" trans="latching"> okay <pause dur="1.9"/> <shift feature="voice" new="laugh"/><gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/><shift feature="voice" new="normal"/><pause dur="2.3"/> okay so <pause dur="2.0"/> we're looking at <pause dur="0.3"/> the possible functions of rhythm and timing <pause dur="0.4"/> in dividing speech 
up into units that we need for perceiving speech <pause dur="4.3"/> now of course one of the questions is what sort of units are we dividing up into but first of all just consider <pause dur="0.5"/> if we had no help <pause dur="0.5"/> in dividing speech up <pause dur="0.5"/> into units that is if we had no help <pause dur="0.4"/> from any kind of phonetic information <pause dur="1.2"/> what we would have to imagine is <pause dur="0.4"/> bearing in mind that we don't usually pause between words <pause dur="0.4"/> we'd have to imagine that speech is coming at us as a continuous <pause dur="0.2"/> stream <pause dur="0.4"/> of phonemes and syllables <pause dur="0.9"/> and <pause dur="0.4"/> we would have the very difficult decision <pause dur="0.6"/> # as to where one <pause dur="0.2"/> word ends and another one begins or where a phrase ends another one begins <pause dur="0.4"/> # or where we reach a a sentence boundary and so on <pause dur="1.9"/> and i was going to give you an example of this because somebody once wrote an article <pause dur="0.7"/> in phonetic transcription <pause dur="0.4"/> leaving no spaces at all <pause dur="1.2"/> # this was a a slightly nutty paper <pause dur="0.4"/> # that appeared in a rather <pause dur="0.2"/> bizarre journal in which all the papers had to be written in in phonemic transcription <pause dur="0.6"/> and this guy was saying <pause dur="0.2"/> that i 
mean he was actually a very eminent phonetician John Trim <pause dur="0.4"/> he was saying <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> if we're going to be realistic with phonemic transcription <pause dur="0.2"/> we shouldn't put spaces in our transcription unless there is phonetically a space there <pause dur="0.4"/> and if you can't hear one you shouldn't write one <pause dur="0.8"/> and so he then wrote out this paper as though he was saying it out loud <pause dur="0.4"/> # only putting a space where he would pause for breath <pause dur="0.4"/> and of course <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> even if you can read phonemic transcription <pause dur="0.3"/> the actual paper is almost completely illegible <pause dur="0.4"/> because it's just a continuous string of phonemes <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> and # i will <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> let you have a copy of that paper if you're interested <pause dur="0.4"/> # unfortunately the volume on my shelves which has got it in is <pause dur="0.3"/> out on loan to # one of my research students # <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> who's not <pause dur="0.2"/> who's not brought it back but i will get this to you it's an <pause dur="0.2"/> interesting experience to read it <pause dur="0.3"/> in fact it's a very interesting experience to read the journal itself the <pause dur="0.4"/> it used to be called Le Mètre Phonétique <pause dur="0.5"/> 
and # # it was the main publication of the International Phonetic Association <pause dur="0.4"/> and until nineteen-seventy-four <pause dur="0.5"/> you would not be <trunc>h</trunc> you would not have a paper accepted for that journal <pause dur="0.3"/> unless it was written in phonemic transcription <pause dur="1.3"/> anyway one of the big debates in <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.8"/> the early # well around the middle period of this journal Le Mètre Phonétique <pause dur="0.4"/> was a big dispute between two of the great giants of <pause dur="0.3"/> # phonetics in the early part of the twentieth century <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> that was Paul Passy <pause dur="0.2"/> who was the great French phonetician <pause dur="0.3"/> and Daniel Jones the <pause dur="0.2"/> his British equivalent <kinesic desc="turns on overhead projector showing transparency" iterated="n"/><pause dur="1.3"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> here's a quote from Passy <pause dur="0.5"/> <reading><distinct lang="fr">il est bien entendu n'est ce pas que l'espace blanc laissé entre des mots n'a pas de valeur phonétique</distinct></reading> <pause dur="0.6"/> basically saying <pause dur="0.2"/> we leave spaces between the words when we write transcription <pause dur="0.2"/> but it doesn't mean anything phonetically <pause dur="0.6"/> okay it's just there <pause dur="0.3"/> to help us <pause dur="0.3"/> understand <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> more easily what is written <pause dur="2.1"/> and <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.9"/> this <pause dur="0.2"/> # stirred Jones to write a reply <pause dur="0.3"/> by the way # i'll be 
giving you a handout which gives you these <kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="6"/> quotes so you don't need to write these down verbatim <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> just take in the general gist <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="1.1"/> Jones's reply was i would say that a word is a phonetic entity <pause dur="0.3"/> that the blank spaces between written words do have phonetic significance <pause dur="0.5"/> Passy himself has given instance of <trunc>th</trunc> <trunc>in</trunc> instances of this <pause dur="0.5"/> # <reading><distinct lang="fr">dans un parler tant soit peu langue on distinguera</distinct> <pause dur="0.4"/> <distinct lang="fr">trois petites roues</distinct></reading> <pause dur="0.2"/> that's # three little wheels <pause dur="0.4"/> and <distinct lang="fr">trois petits trous</distinct> <pause dur="0.3"/> # three little holes <pause dur="0.5"/> okay so # <pause dur="0.7"/> # this has been disputed by French phoneticians <pause dur="0.3"/> # quite a lot <pause dur="0.3"/> because some French people say you can't hear the difference between those two <pause dur="0.6"/> # three little wheels and three little holes <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> but the word boundary is in a different place in these two cases <pause dur="0.3"/> and # <pause dur="0.2"/> Passy on another occasion <pause dur="0.3"/> had said that you can actually hear the difference between them <pause dur="0.3"/> i'm not enough of a French speaker to know if it's true that you can hear the difference <pause dur="0.3"/> but if any of you have French speaking 
friends you might like to try it out on them <pause dur="0.3"/> and see if there is a perceptible difference <pause dur="1.8"/> okay <pause dur="0.2"/> <event desc="takes off transparency" iterated="n"/> so there's # there's a a basic dispute # certainly as far as English and French are concerned <pause dur="0.3"/> about whether we can actually hear <pause dur="0.3"/> where one word ends and one <pause dur="0.2"/> begins <pause dur="0.6"/> and it is when you think about it one of the most <pause dur="0.3"/> vital functions <pause dur="0.3"/> in <pause dur="0.3"/> speech perception <pause dur="0.8"/> if speech comes at us as one continuous stream <pause dur="0.9"/> and yet <pause dur="0.5"/> mentally <pause dur="0.5"/> we're able to divide that up <pause dur="0.4"/> into in a very sophisticated way <pause dur="0.4"/> into a whole <pause dur="0.4"/> series of units <pause dur="0.5"/> going down to very small units like words <pause dur="0.3"/> and going right up to big units like sentences <pause dur="0.5"/> if we're able to do that <pause dur="0.8"/> the <pause dur="0.4"/> question is are we getting any help in that from the phonetic information <pause dur="0.6"/> is <trunc>th</trunc> is there stuff there in the speech signal <pause dur="0.4"/> that tells us where these boundaries are <pause dur="0.5"/> or are we just figuring it out on some kind of statistical basis <pause dur="11.5"/> i've been doing some research <pause dur="0.2"/> on <pause dur="0.4"/> one particular problem that arises out of this <pause dur="0.4"/> and i'd like to use that as a kind of 
peg to hang this <pause dur="0.2"/> issue on <pause dur="0.4"/> to tell you a little bit about what we've been doing <pause dur="0.4"/> # and where we've been getting with this <pause dur="0.8"/> it's the problem <pause dur="0.2"/> it's sometimes called the problem of embedded words <pause dur="4.3"/><kinesic desc="puts on transparency" iterated="n"/> when we hear a word of several syllables like responsibility <pause dur="1.1"/> okay <pause dur="1.0"/> that word will almost inevitably contain some other English words which are smaller <pause dur="1.0"/> so in the case of responsibility <pause dur="0.2"/> we find within that the word response <pause dur="1.4"/> the word sponsor <pause dur="0.8"/> that bit there <pause dur="0.7"/> <kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> the word <pause dur="0.3"/> ability <pause dur="0.9"/> that last bit there <pause dur="0.6"/><kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> the word bill <pause dur="0.4"/> which is that one there <pause dur="0.2"/> <kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> and you'd find a few others as well if you looked hard enough <pause dur="0.5"/> almost any <pause dur="0.2"/> word <pause dur="0.2"/> in English <pause dur="0.3"/> of more than two syllables <pause dur="0.2"/> will actually contain <pause dur="0.3"/> within it <pause dur="0.3"/> packaged up inside it <pause dur="0.3"/> a smaller English word <pause dur="3.2"/> now consider what the brain is faced with <pause dur="0.3"/> if somebody produces a sentence containing the word responsibility <pause dur="2.1"/> if the brain wrongly <pause dur="0.2"/> segments responsibility into response <pause dur="1.4"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> ability <pause dur="1.3"/> the <pause dur="0.3"/> parsing <pause dur="0.3"/> # the decoding of that sentence <pause dur="0.2"/> is going to go catastrophically wrong <pause dur="5.5"/> see the <pause dur="0.3"/> 
point i'm making <pause dur="1.4"/> somehow we know <pause dur="0.4"/> that when we hear responsibility <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> it is that word <pause dur="0.2"/> not a combination of response and <pause dur="0.4"/> ability <pause dur="1.0"/> nor is it <pause dur="0.3"/> in some sense <pause dur="0.2"/> re<pause dur="0.2"/> and sponsor <pause dur="0.3"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> bility <pause dur="0.4"/> <trunc>whi</trunc> # <pause dur="0.2"/> that of course contains two English <pause dur="0.3"/> non-words <pause dur="0.3"/> so that's a <trunc>com</trunc> comparatively easy task <pause dur="2.0"/> now the fact is <pause dur="0.4"/> that we don't go <pause dur="0.2"/> <trunc>cata</trunc> catastrophically wrong <pause dur="0.3"/> we don't make mistakes all the time <pause dur="0.4"/> about <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> polysyllabic words <pause dur="3.4"/> and the research that i've been <pause dur="0.3"/> involved in <pause dur="0.4"/> has been looking at factors responsible for <pause dur="0.4"/> our being able to cope successfully <pause dur="0.5"/> with <pause dur="0.2"/> this problem of embedded words <pause dur="0.3"/> the fact that we're not constantly going off in the wrong direction <pause dur="0.2"/> being fooled by <pause dur="0.3"/> the sounds into hearing something <pause dur="0.3"/> that isn't there <pause dur="3.1"/> let's just <pause dur="0.3"/> try to think about <pause dur="0.7"/> what <pause dur="0.3"/><kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="6"/> factors might be <pause dur="0.8"/> helping us <pause dur="0.3"/> not to go wrong <pause dur="1.4"/> i've got <pause dur="0.3"/> three possible <pause dur="0.3"/> hypotheses here <pause dur="2.1"/> and again these are in the handout that i'll be giving you <pause dur="0.4"/> and <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> you don't need to write these down <pause dur="0.3"/> you you'll get this text <pause dur="0.4"/> later on <pause dur="5.0"/> okay the 
question is then how are we <pause dur="0.3"/> successful how comes how come that we are successful <pause dur="0.4"/> <trunc>mo</trunc> most of the time <pause dur="0.3"/> in deciding where word boundaries come <pause dur="1.9"/> one possibility <pause dur="0.6"/> is that there is some phonetic information <pause dur="0.4"/> just at the point where the boundary comes <pause dur="0.4"/> which helps us to say ah <pause dur="0.3"/> that's a boundary <pause dur="0.3"/> so i know <pause dur="0.2"/> that one word ends and another one begins at that point <pause dur="0.3"/> now we'll look at that in a bit more detail in a moment that's <pause dur="0.2"/> certainly a possible and a plausible <pause dur="0.6"/> # explanation <pause dur="2.8"/> okay <pause dur="0.2"/> another possibility <pause dur="1.1"/> is that <pause dur="0.3"/> although we don't <pause dur="0.2"/> find <pause dur="0.6"/> all that much information <pause dur="0.6"/> in the actual segments <pause dur="0.2"/> at the boundary the actual phonemes <pause dur="0.5"/> at the beginning and end of a word <pause dur="0.4"/> there is something about the overall shape of a word <pause dur="0.4"/> that enables us to say <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> i can hear <pause dur="0.4"/> a word starting <pause dur="0.3"/> and now i can hear the word ending there's something about the overall shape of it <pause dur="0.7"/> for example <pause dur="0.2"/> # this is a completely wrong statement but imagine <pause dur="0.3"/> that there was something like <pause dur="0.3"/> that a word always started very quietly <pause dur="0.2"/> 
and built up to a a crescendo <pause dur="0.2"/> and then faded away into silence <pause dur="0.4"/> the overall shape of the loudness pattern there <pause dur="0.3"/> would help you to know <pause dur="0.3"/> the where the beginning and end of the word <pause dur="0.2"/> came <pause dur="0.2"/> that actually doesn't happen of course <pause dur="0.3"/> # that that's just an imaginary <pause dur="0.2"/> example <pause dur="1.6"/> and the third possibility <pause dur="0.2"/> which i suspect a lot of linguists would rather prefer <pause dur="0.2"/> is that there is absolutely nothing worth listening to <pause dur="0.2"/> in the speech signal <pause dur="0.5"/> when it comes to deciding on boundaries <pause dur="0.3"/> we simply do it <pause dur="0.2"/> on the basis of linguistic knowledge <pause dur="0.8"/> that's the sort of top-down <pause dur="0.5"/> theory <pause dur="0.6"/> and we'll look at that one a bit more as well so <pause dur="0.2"/> what i've actually said <trunc>th</trunc> is # <pause dur="0.2"/> instead of using phonetic or phonological information <pause dur="0.4"/> we match segment strings against our lexicon <pause dur="0.3"/> and choose the match that gives the most plausible sequence of words <pause dur="4.7"/> let's just go back to the <pause dur="0.3"/> # example <kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="5"/> i had on the previous slide the word responsibility <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.9"/> if you get that <trunc>str</trunc> that <trunc>s</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> sequence of phonemes that make up <pause dur="0.3"/> 
responsibility <pause dur="0.3"/> and i put to you the problem <pause dur="0.2"/> why <pause dur="0.2"/> in a sentence like it's your responsibility to get there on time <pause dur="0.4"/> why don't we <pause dur="0.4"/> interpret that as it's your response <pause dur="0.5"/> ability <pause dur="0.3"/> to get there in time <pause dur="0.3"/> why don't we interpret it that way <pause dur="0.5"/> it's because we know <pause dur="0.3"/> the structure of that sentence <pause dur="0.2"/> we know its lexical content <pause dur="0.2"/> we know the sort of situation in which that's uttered <pause dur="0.5"/> and we simply wouldn't make a daft <pause dur="0.3"/> interpretation like <pause dur="0.3"/> response <pause dur="0.3"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> ability <pause dur="0.2"/> as two separate words <pause dur="0.2"/> because it wouldn't fit <pause dur="0.2"/> with the syntax <pause dur="0.2"/> and it wouldn't fit with the semantics of what we were saying <pause dur="0.8"/> 
end of problem <pause dur="0.3"/> you don't need <pause dur="0.2"/> phonetic <pause dur="0.2"/> or phonological information <pause dur="0.7"/> okay that would <pause dur="0.2"/> # almost certainly be <pause dur="0.5"/> # so the well anyway the computational linguists' answer to the problem <pause dur="0.5"/> there is <pause dur="0.2"/> enough contextual linguistic information to solve the problem <pause dur="0.3"/> without relying on what's there in the sounds <pause dur="0.8"/> now of course <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> that's not <pause dur="0.5"/> my <pause dur="0.2"/> approach to <shift feature="voice" new="laugh"/> the subject so i'm <shift feature="voice" new="normal"/> not going to buy that <pause dur="0.3"/> explanation <pause dur="0.4"/> to me <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> # there must be something in point one <pause dur="0.3"/> that word boundaries are marked by allophonic information in the segments adjacent to the boundary <pause dur="0.7"/> and or <pause dur="0.6"/> prosodic factors can <trunc>ter</trunc> can characterize the overall form of a word <pause dur="0.7"/> now remember that last week i was talking about differences between different languages <pause dur="0.4"/> what i suspect is <pause dur="0.6"/> that in some languages <pause dur="0.4"/> we find a preponderance of the <pause dur="0.4"/> # # <pause dur="0.9"/> # the function <pause dur="0.4"/> in word boundary divisions <pause dur="0.4"/> <trunc>b</trunc> <pause dur="0.6"/> here based on this first <pause dur="0.4"/> possibility <pause dur="0.4"/> that word boundaries <pause dur="0.2"/> are marked <pause dur="0.2"/> segmentally <pause dur="0.2"/> at 
the edges <pause dur="0.3"/> and in other languages you find that the main <pause dur="0.2"/> contributing <pause dur="0.3"/> factor to our being able to divide into words <pause dur="0.3"/> is the second one the prosodic information <pause dur="0.7"/> let's let's look at this second one <pause dur="0.2"/> to begin with <pause dur="0.7"/> prosodic factors <trunc>character</trunc> <vocal desc="cough" iterated="n"/> characterizing the overall <trunc>fir</trunc> form of the word <pause dur="0.6"/> <vocal desc="cough" iterated="n"/> <pause dur="0.2"/> if it's true that in French <pause dur="1.0"/> every word <pause dur="0.4"/> ends with a <kinesic desc="writes on board" dur="4" iterated="y"/> <pause dur="1.8"/> stressed <pause dur="0.2"/> syllable <pause dur="2.7"/> which is usually <pause dur="0.2"/> the claim made in introductory phonetics books <pause dur="0.6"/> then dividing French up <pause dur="0.4"/> dividing continuous French up <pause dur="0.2"/> into words <pause dur="0.3"/> is simply not a problem <pause dur="0.6"/> you just listen for a stressed syllable <pause dur="0.5"/> and you say <pause dur="0.2"/> ha <pause dur="0.2"/> stressed syllable <pause dur="0.3"/> end of word <pause dur="0.7"/> word boundary <pause dur="0.5"/> listen for the next one and then you might have <pause dur="0.6"/> a few syllables <pause dur="0.3"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="n"/> and a strong one like that strongly stressed one <pause dur="0.4"/> so you automatically <pause dur="0.3"/> then <pause dur="0.2"/> place a word boundary <pause dur="0.2"/> it's about as simple <pause dur="0.2"/> a procedure <pause dur="0.3"/> as simple an algorithm <pause dur="0.3"/> as you could find <pause dur="0.3"/> in <pause dur="0.3"/> decoding speech <pause dur="0.2"/> just listen for a stressed syllable <pause dur="0.4"/> and place a word boundary 
immediately after it <pause dur="2.5"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> and there are other languages as i've said before which have other stressed patterns <pause dur="0.2"/> so for example in Polish <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> most words <pause dur="0.2"/> have <pause dur="0.2"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="4"/> a strong <pause dur="0.3"/> syllable <pause dur="0.3"/> and then a weak one and then a word boundary <pause dur="0.4"/> in other words the stress in Polish <pause dur="0.2"/> normally comes on the penultimate syllable <pause dur="0.7"/> so if you're a Polish listener listening to Polish <pause dur="0.4"/> you <pause dur="0.2"/> <trunc>l</trunc> <pause dur="0.3"/> # let the stream of speech come in through your ears <pause dur="0.3"/> and you simply <pause dur="0.3"/> # have <pause dur="0.2"/> # some bit of your <pause dur="0.4"/> processing <pause dur="0.5"/> capability in your brain <pause dur="0.2"/> listening out for stressed syllables <pause dur="0.3"/> you let one more syllable go by <pause dur="0.3"/> and then <pause dur="0.2"/> you place the word boundary <pause dur="0.9"/> it's <pause dur="0.5"/> just as with French <trunc>w</trunc> one has to be a bit sceptical about this <pause dur="0.2"/> there are <pause dur="0.3"/> actually if you listen to spoken French there are plenty of cases where French speakers put the stress <pause dur="0.4"/> # earlier than the final syllable <pause dur="0.4"/> there are exceptions to the rule in Polish <pause dur="0.3"/> if you take a a word <pause dur="0.5"/> the <trunc>wor</trunc> Polish word for university for example is <distinct lang="pl">uniwersytet</distinct> <pause dur="0.4"/> # which is <pause dur="0.3"/> pro-penultimate it's the it's 
it's not on <pause dur="0.3"/> # it's not they don't say <distinct lang="pl" type="sampa">[unIvEr"sItEt]</distinct> <pause dur="0.2"/> they say <distinct lang="pl" type="sampa"> [unI"vErsItEt]</distinct> which is <pause dur="0.3"/> # which leaves two unstressed syllables at the end <pause dur="0.2"/> but most Polish words are are <trunc>str</trunc> are are structured like that <pause dur="0.7"/> so in those cases there are prosodic factors characterizing the overall form of the word <pause dur="0.3"/> under those circumstances <pause dur="0.2"/> you've got lots of help <pause dur="0.2"/> for dividing up speech into words <pause dur="5.5"/> now as we know English is a much more difficult customer <pause dur="0.2"/> in that respect <pause dur="0.3"/> because <pause dur="1.2"/> we know that in polysyllabic English words <pause dur="0.3"/> we find some <pause dur="0.2"/> where the stress is on the first syllable <pause dur="0.5"/> some where the stress is on the last syllable <pause dur="0.3"/> and some <pause dur="0.2"/> # in other places in the middle <pause dur="1.0"/> and therefore <pause dur="0.2"/> we can't rely at least not in such an easy way <pause dur="0.3"/> on that overall prosodic shape of the word <pause dur="1.0"/> <vocal desc="cough" iterated="n"/> <pause dur="1.7"/> on the other hand what we do have in English in a fairly powerful way <pause dur="0.5"/> is the <pause dur="0.4"/> # ability to distinguish words or pairs of words <pause dur="0.3"/> # on the basis of phonetic information <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> the example that everybody's heard

involved here <pause dur="0.3"/> but that's the way we work <pause dur="2.4"/> once this effect had been observed <pause dur="0.3"/> # it arose well # various <pause dur="0.2"/> various follow up studies were done <pause dur="1.6"/> the best known of these i'll give you the reference # to this was work done in the nineteen-sixties by O'Connor and Tooley <pause dur="0.6"/> where they got unsuspecting readers <pause dur="0.4"/> to read <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> rather weird sentences containing pairs like this <pause dur="0.3"/> so <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> things like # <pause dur="0.5"/> # i saw the grey tape out of the window and i saw the great ape <pause dur="0.2"/> out of the window <pause dur="0.5"/> people would read these they then went <pause dur="0.3"/> through the recordings with a pair of scissors <pause dur="0.3"/> and cut out just the pairs of words <pause dur="0.3"/> and played them to listeners <pause dur="0.3"/> and said can you say <pause dur="0.2"/> whether you're hearing <kinesic desc="indicates point on screen" iterated="n"/> this one grey tape <pause dur="0.4"/> or this one great ape <pause dur="0.7"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> # what they found was # <pause dur="0.5"/> # fairly surprising <pause dur="0.5"/> when there were plosives involved particularly voiceless plosives <pause dur="0.3"/> people were very very successful <pause dur="0.4"/> in <pause dur="0.2"/> successfully <trunc>plac</trunc> very successful <pause dur="0.3"/> in placing <pause dur="0.2"/> the word boundary <pause dur="0.3"/> in the in the right place <pause dur="1.7"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> there were <pause dur="0.5"/> many other examples that they 
constructed with different types of consonants <pause dur="0.4"/> that were much less successful <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> and # they were # eventually forced to conclude <pause dur="0.2"/> that this <pause dur="0.6"/> business of allophonic marking of word boundaries <pause dur="0.3"/> only works in a limited number of cases <pause dur="0.7"/> but in the meantime they had a lot of fun inventing <pause dur="0.4"/> these pairs of words <pause dur="0.2"/> they're sometimes called <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="3"/> juncture pairs <pause dur="0.6"/> because this <pause dur="0.8"/> word juncture is used to refer to the joining between two words <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="2"/> so juncture pairs <pause dur="0.5"/> became a kind of <pause dur="0.3"/> # phoneticians' hobby <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> when i first started going to phonetics conferences in this country <pause dur="0.4"/> # you would often get people sitting around <pause dur="0.3"/> # over a beer in the bar after the <pause dur="0.2"/> papers were over for the day <pause dur="0.3"/> inventing things like this and seeing if they <pause dur="0.3"/> could get people to hear the difference <pause dur="0.3"/> and you get things like <pause dur="0.3"/> <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="10"/> # <pause dur="1.6"/> to choose <pause dur="0.5"/> ink <pause dur="1.2"/> as opposed to <pause dur="0.3"/> to chew <pause dur="1.5"/> zinc <pause dur="1.1"/> and # what were some of the other crazy ones <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> yes <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="7"/> more <pause dur="1.5"/> ice <pause dur="0.8"/> and more <pause dur="1.7"/> rice <pause dur="0.7"/> okay <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> lots of things like this <pause dur="0.3"/> 
constantly <pause dur="0.2"/> thinking up <pause dur="0.4"/> pairs like that <pause dur="0.3"/> and then trying them out on listeners to see if they can hear the difference <pause dur="0.9"/> the answer is if people are deliberately trying <pause dur="0.2"/> to make it clear which of these they're intending <pause dur="0.4"/> then it can be made unambiguous <pause dur="0.3"/> but in normal speech <pause dur="0.2"/> you just can't hear the difference <pause dur="0.3"/> unless it's something which has got whacking great <pause dur="0.4"/> allophonic variations <pause dur="0.3"/> that help you <pause dur="0.3"/> like the aspiration <kinesic desc="indicates point on board" iterated="n"/> here <pause dur="0.3"/> and the prefortis <pause dur="0.3"/> shortening <pause dur="0.5"/> in that particular case <pause dur="0.6"/> so <pause dur="0.2"/> looking back at these possibilities <pause dur="0.3"/> what i'd say is that <pause dur="0.3"/> okay <pause dur="0.3"/> there are certain circumstances in which we get allophonic information at word boundaries <pause dur="0.2"/> which helps us to discriminate <pause dur="0.9"/> but not all the time <pause dur="0.3"/> and not in all languages <pause dur="2.1"/> 
secondly there are prosodic factors <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> in <trunc>th</trunc> terms of overall shapes of words <pause dur="0.3"/> which help <pause dur="0.4"/> in some languages <pause dur="0.3"/> but that help is not very great in English <pause dur="0.8"/> and in fact until <pause dur="0.3"/> fairly recently it was believed <pause dur="0.3"/> that there was no help at all <pause dur="0.6"/> in English <pause dur="0.6"/> for <pause dur="0.3"/> # word identification <pause dur="0.3"/> based on overall prosodic shape <pause dur="2.3"/> but i mentioned briefly <pause dur="0.3"/> # a couple of weeks ago <pause dur="0.3"/> that research by Anne Cutler <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="1.1"/> <trunc>o</trunc> <trunc>o</trunc> by <trunc>look</trunc> who has looked at a very very large number of English words <pause dur="0.3"/> research by Anne Cutler and her colleagues has shown <pause dur="0.2"/> that statistically <pause dur="1.5"/> it is more likely than not <pause dur="0.5"/> that an English word of <pause dur="0.2"/> several syllables <pause dur="0.3"/> will begin <pause dur="0.2"/> with a stressed syllable <pause dur="0.8"/> statistically <pause dur="0.4"/> initial stressed syllables <pause dur="0.2"/> are the most likely in English <pause dur="3.4"/> and if you think about it you can come up with <pause dur="0.2"/> hundreds of words just off the top of your head <pause dur="0.3"/> which don't have <pause dur="0.2"/> the initial syllable stressed <pause dur="5.5"/> but even so <pause dur="0.3"/> the <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> figure is something like sixty-five per cent to seventy per cent in a given <pause dur="0.3"/> text <pause dur="0.3"/> the <pause dur="0.9"/> 
the # <pause dur="0.9"/> the number of <pause dur="0.2"/> initial stressed words of <trunc>mor</trunc> that is of polysyllabic words <pause dur="0.4"/> the number of initial stressed words in <pause dur="0.3"/> English <pause dur="0.3"/> on average is around sixty-five per cent <pause dur="0.4"/> to even sometimes as much as seventy per cent <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> initial stressed <pause dur="1.4"/> and so Cutler's theory is that although it's only a weak tendency compared with <pause dur="0.3"/> languages like French and Polish and so on <pause dur="1.0"/> English speakers do <pause dur="0.3"/> to some extent rely on this as a guideline <pause dur="0.4"/> if you hear a stressed syllable <pause dur="0.5"/> your brain says <pause dur="0.2"/> this is probably the beginning of a word <pause dur="1.5"/> and of course <pause dur="0.3"/> # following on from that <pause dur="0.2"/> the <trunc>sy</trunc> the syllable before that therefore was the last syllable of the preceding word <pause dur="1.8"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> we are at times proved wrong on that <pause dur="1.1"/> but if we stick to that simple rule <pause dur="0.3"/> we are correct <pause dur="0.2"/> more often than not <pause dur="1.0"/> # i have my doubts <pause dur="0.6"/> still about this <pause dur="0.4"/> # but # this is something which she and her <pause dur="0.3"/> coworkers <pause dur="0.3"/> # have held to for a very long time <pause dur="10.3"/><event desc="takes off transparency" iterated="n"/> let me just <event desc="turns off overhead projector" iterated="n"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> for a moment look at that last possibility the one that we don't make use of # <pause dur="0.2"/> that we don't need to make use of <pause dur="0.2"/> phonetic information at all <pause dur="1.6"/> and i i said that this appeals to 
computational linguists because if you're designing a computer to recognize words probably <pause dur="0.3"/> # you would find it a tedious <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> superimposition <pause dur="0.3"/> to have prosodic information to worry about <pause dur="2.3"/> you have to assume that all the words that you know <pause dur="0.3"/> are coded in some kind of dictionary in your head <pause dur="0.8"/> that is we all have a mental lexicon <pause dur="0.5"/> opinions vary about the size of it <pause dur="0.5"/> # partly depends how <pause dur="0.4"/> # how highly educated you are <pause dur="0.3"/> and how good you are at remembering words <pause dur="0.3"/> but it can easily be somewhere around say eighty-thousand words <pause dur="0.3"/> that's quite a big dictionary <pause dur="1.0"/> we have to assume <pause dur="0.4"/> that that dictionary is coded <pause dur="0.2"/> in some kind of phonological <pause dur="0.2"/> form <pause dur="1.1"/> # that is it's <pause dur="0.3"/> <trunc>a</trunc> although we know as literate people we know the spelling of the words that we've got stored in our heads <pause dur="0.5"/> what's more important is that we know <pause dur="0.3"/> the sounds <pause dur="0.2"/> that make up <pause dur="0.3"/> the words that we have in our head <pause dur="0.4"/> you've got the word <pause dur="0.2"/> cat <pause dur="0.3"/> <trunc>e</trunc> everybody <pause dur="0.3"/> in this room has got the word cat <pause dur="0.3"/> in their mental vocabulary <pause dur="0.3"/> and that is stored <pause dur="0.3"/> in a

something in your mental <pause dur="0.3"/> lexicon <pause dur="0.8"/> and if it does <pause dur="0.4"/> you mark that down and say i think that's a whole word <pause dur="0.3"/> let's now move on <pause dur="0.3"/> and try the next one so you think well if that's a word <pause dur="0.3"/> then this should be the beginning <pause dur="0.2"/> this next dot along <pause dur="0.2"/> should be the beginning of the next word <pause dur="0.3"/> let's see if that matches any words in my mental vocabulary <pause dur="3.0"/> if you were using a a <trunc>b</trunc> a big computer and you had unlimited computer time <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> doing that <trunc>k</trunc> that kind of manipulation is fairly straightforward <pause dur="0.4"/> and all you need is some fairly clever mechanism which will keep cycling back every time you fail <pause dur="0.9"/> now if we go back to the example of responsibility <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/><event desc="puts on transparency" iterated="n"/> if <pause dur="1.1"/> you had wrongly identified <pause dur="1.0"/><kinesic desc="turns on overhead projector showing transparency" iterated="n"/> # <pause dur="1.1"/> responsibility <pause dur="0.6"/> # as re <pause dur="0.5"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> sponsor <pause dur="0.4"/> and bility <pause dur="0.6"/> sponsor would match up <pause dur="0.3"/> to one of the words in your mental lexicon <pause dur="1.0"/> but re <pause dur="0.2"/> wouldn't <pause dur="0.5"/> and <pause dur="0.3"/> bility wouldn't <pause dur="0.2"/> because re is not an English word <pause dur="0.2"/> and bility is not an English word at least not as far as i know <pause dur="0.6"/> and therefore <pause dur="0.2"/> that hypothesis <pause dur="0.2"/> 
would have to be trashed <pause dur="0.4"/> you would have to <trunc>s</trunc> <pause dur="0.3"/> you would simply have to say <pause dur="0.3"/> that was a non-starter i will go back to the beginning <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> to the last place where i was fairly sure <pause dur="0.3"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> start over <pause dur="0.2"/> and see if i can make a different interpretation and you might this time say <pause dur="0.3"/> maybe it's response and <pause dur="0.3"/> ability <pause dur="0.2"/> let's see if that works <pause dur="0.4"/> but then <pause dur="0.2"/> later on the syntactic information that you had <pause dur="0.3"/> would rule that out as a reasonable hypothesis <pause dur="0.2"/> so again you would trash that and say <pause dur="0.2"/> okay perhaps it's the whole word <pause dur="0.3"/> responsibility <pause dur="0.4"/> and you would match that up <pause dur="0.2"/> yep that matches up with the word in the mental lexicon <pause dur="0.3"/> and it fits the syntax <pause dur="0.2"/> and it fits the meaning <pause dur="0.3"/> that's it <pause dur="0.2"/> i'll <pause dur="0.3"/> # i'll go for that hypothesis <pause dur="1.4"/> so <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> a a computational linguist would like this idea of <pause dur="0.2"/> shuffling <pause dur="0.3"/> the possibilities <pause dur="0.2"/> matching patterns <pause dur="0.2"/> from the input that is the sounds that you hear <pause dur="0.4"/> to <pause dur="0.2"/> stored patterns in your brain <pause dur="0.3"/> which are the words <pause dur="0.3"/> # that you actually have stored <pause dur="0.7"/> now our brains are stupendously fast <pause dur="0.3"/> at finding 
words <pause dur="0.3"/> but even so <pause dur="0.3"/> the idea <pause dur="0.2"/> that we would leave it <pause dur="0.5"/> to our brains just to work on a a a a phoneme <pause dur="0.2"/> pattern matching <pause dur="0.7"/> ignoring all this wonderfully rich information about prosody <pause dur="0.5"/> and the allophonic information <pause dur="0.3"/> is just crazy <pause dur="0.4"/> the brain <pause dur="0.2"/> would not simply ignore <pause dur="0.2"/> such a valuable source of information <pause dur="0.8"/> so it seems to me that i i would want to reject the idea <pause dur="0.3"/> that we don't use phonetic and phonological information <pause dur="0.3"/> in deciding on word boundaries <pause dur="4.8"/><event desc="takes off transparency" iterated="n"/> okay well <pause dur="0.9"/> what i want to do to finish up with is just describe an experiment <pause dur="0.6"/> # that i was working on last year <pause dur="0.4"/> # on this particular question of embedded words <pause dur="2.5"/> now embedded words are difficult things to work with <pause dur="0.5"/> because <pause dur="0.6"/> the only way we can really <pause dur="0.2"/> test peoples' ability to hear them <pause dur="0.5"/> is to cut them out of their context <pause dur="0.4"/> and when you cut a word out of context <pause dur="0.4"/> it suddenly stops <pause dur="0.4"/> sounding <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> recognizable and familiar <pause dur="0.9"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> i've done lots of this and i've got a couple of examples on tape <pause dur="0.2"/> there's one that i use a lot <pause dur="0.3"/> this is an example where you

out in the tapes <pause dur="0.5"/> so that sometimes people were listening <pause dur="0.2"/> # i mean we heard the word just on that tape <pause dur="0.4"/> in some cases people heard the word just <pause dur="0.5"/> out of a sentence that <trunc>sa</trunc> said things like <pause dur="0.2"/> i was just going down the road <pause dur="0.3"/> or <pause dur="0.3"/> he was a just man <pause dur="0.7"/> but in some other cases <pause dur="0.2"/> from the same speaker <pause dur="0.4"/> we had the word just <pause dur="0.4"/> from <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> a a word like adjustment <pause dur="0.5"/> okay <pause dur="0.3"/> that's an embedded word <pause dur="0.4"/> the word just <pause dur="0.3"/> sits inside the word adjustment <pause dur="0.3"/> and we cut it out <pause dur="0.5"/> and the idea was to find <pause dur="0.3"/> by testing listeners' perception <pause dur="0.4"/> whether <pause dur="0.3"/> our <pause dur="0.2"/> listeners were more successful at hearing <pause dur="0.3"/> the embedded words <pause dur="0.3"/> or <pause dur="0.3"/> the <pause dur="0.4"/> # what we call the real words the words which genuinely had <pause dur="0.3"/> a word boundary at either <pause dur="0.2"/> side <pause dur="3.3"/> # and so we went through and we <pause dur="1.0"/> # this is work # done jointly with the <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> with Anne Cutler's group in the Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics in <pause dur="0.3"/> in Nijmegen in Holland <pause dur="0.7"/> # and we spent <pause dur="0.2"/> very very large amount of time <pause dur="0.4"/> going through extracting these pairs of examples <pause dur="0.3"/> and then recording them in random 
order <pause dur="0.5"/> for for listening tests <pause dur="4.1"/><event desc="takes off transparency" iterated="n"/> now the first thing when we'd done all this <pause dur="0.3"/> was we the experimenters listened to tapes to see if we could hear the difference <pause dur="0.5"/> and we could of course we'd been working on this for years <pause dur="0.2"/> so it's not surprising <pause dur="0.3"/> that we could tell the difference between real words and embedded words <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> we actually did <trunc>t</trunc> a <pause dur="0.2"/> test on this <pause dur="0.4"/> # <kinesic desc="puts on transparency" iterated="n"/> as # experts <pause dur="0.4"/> # these are the <pause dur="0.4"/> statistical results and the main thing is that the <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> # probability value is point-zero-zero-seven-six <pause dur="0.3"/> which means that the <pause dur="0.3"/> difference between real embedded <trunc>wor</trunc> and embedded words <pause dur="0.3"/> in terms of us recognizing which was which <pause dur="0.3"/> was highly significant <pause dur="0.5"/> so <pause dur="0.3"/> we were able as the experts running the experiment <pause dur="0.3"/> we were able to distinguish between real and embedded words <pause dur="1.8"/><event desc="takes off transparency" iterated="n"/> there's nothing very surprising about that <pause dur="0.6"/> then we played <pause dur="0.4"/> these words to naive listeners <pause dur="0.4"/> who had had no previous experience of working <pause dur="0.3"/> with this kind of problem <pause dur="0.6"/> and <vocal desc="cough" iterated="n"/> we worked out scores <pause dur="0.5"/> for <pause dur="0.2"/> how many words <pause dur="0.4"/> they got <pause dur="0.5"/> correct <pause dur="6.1"/><kinesic desc="puts on transparency" iterated="n"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> the 
i won't i won't it would take too long to explain what these # success <pause dur="0.2"/> scores # <pause dur="0.4"/> were actually calculated on <pause dur="0.3"/> but we get <pause dur="0.2"/> a much higher success rate <pause dur="0.2"/> here six-point-one-five <pause dur="0.3"/> on real words <pause dur="0.2"/> compared with four-point-three-three on the embedded words <pause dur="0.3"/> and that difference there is very highly significant with a probability value <pause dur="0.3"/> of point-zero-zero-zero-four <pause dur="0.9"/> so <pause dur="0.3"/> there was no doubt at all that our <pause dur="0.3"/> listeners <pause dur="0.5"/> did better <pause dur="0.5"/> on <pause dur="0.2"/> real words <pause dur="0.2"/> rather than embedded words <pause dur="5.7"/> remember that these words were presented completely out of context <pause dur="0.3"/> and therefore our listeners had nothing to go on <pause dur="0.3"/> except what they could hear from the tape <pause dur="0.8"/> and the only conclusion you can make from that <pause dur="0.3"/> is <pause dur="0.2"/> that there is something there phonetically <pause dur="0.4"/> that enables you <pause dur="0.3"/> to <pause dur="0.2"/> tell <pause dur="0.6"/> what is a word and what is part of a word <pause dur="0.6"/> to enable you to distinguish between <pause dur="0.4"/> bits of words <pause dur="0.3"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> whole words <pause dur="8.9"/> so we went back to the tapes and we spent a lot of time listening to them and i spent <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> quite a lot of time <pause dur="0.3"/> # over in Nijmegen <pause dur="0.2"/> working 
through every single word <pause dur="0.4"/> doing a very detailed phonetic examination of each word <pause dur="0.5"/> and the thing that was coming out more and more clearly was <pause dur="0.2"/> that the embedded words <pause dur="0.2"/> were shorter <pause dur="0.3"/> than the corresponding real words <pause dur="2.4"/> if we look at that in <kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="1"/> graphical form <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> what we find <pause dur="0.3"/> here <trunc>the</trunc> these these are box plots <pause dur="0.3"/> that's the scale of duration on the left hand side going from <pause dur="0.3"/> a hundred to five-hundred milliseconds <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> # this box covers most of the data <pause dur="0.4"/> and in the case of embedded words <pause dur="0.5"/> the <pause dur="0.3"/> # duration was <pause dur="0.4"/> <trunc>f</trunc> rather shorter <pause dur="0.4"/> than <pause dur="0.3"/> the duration of the real words it's it's not a big difference but it's enough to be <pause dur="0.3"/> statistically significant <pause dur="0.4"/> embedded words tend to be a bit shorter <pause dur="0.6"/> than <pause dur="0.2"/> the real word <pause dur="0.6"/> probably # <pause dur="0.2"/> the difference is <pause dur="0.3"/> # enough to be over the threshold of our <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> ability to perceive differences <pause dur="0.4"/> in durations of <pause dur="0.2"/> words and syllables <pause dur="1.4"/> there was just one final question to answer <pause dur="0.3"/> is it that just the entire body of embedded words is shorter <pause dur="0.4"/> than <pause dur="0.2"/> the whole <pause dur="0.3"/> collection of real words <pause dur="0.2"/> or 
is this a genuine relationship that each individual pair of words <pause dur="0.4"/> will exhibit <pause dur="0.3"/> a greater duration for the real word <pause dur="0.3"/> and a shorter duration <pause dur="0.4"/> for <pause dur="0.3"/> the embedded word <pause dur="0.7"/><kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="1"/> # so # this is # <pause dur="0.8"/> if this this is a rather messy graph but <pause dur="0.3"/> it just shows the relationship <pause dur="0.3"/> between the durations of embedded words <pause dur="0.3"/> and the durations of <pause dur="0.2"/> real words <pause dur="0.2"/> and you can see that centre line there <pause dur="0.4"/> # represents a trend <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> which is that the <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> the longer <pause dur="0.2"/> a real word is <pause dur="0.3"/> the longer <pause dur="0.2"/> an embedded word is that is they are <pause dur="0.4"/> closely related <pause dur="0.5"/> however <pause dur="0.3"/> for any given value of a real word like three-hundred here <pause dur="0.4"/> the corresponding duration of an embedded word is shorter <pause dur="0.9"/> so in # the case of all virtually all the words in our data <pause dur="0.3"/> and <pause dur="0.5"/> i mean i had to admit if you look at some of these dots they're way off that <pause dur="0.2"/> centre line <pause dur="0.3"/> there's a lot of variation <pause dur="0.4"/> but the overall trend is that <pause dur="0.3"/> for any given pair of words the embedded word <pause dur="0.2"/> will be shorter <pause dur="0.3"/> than the <pause dur="0.2"/> real word <pause dur="0.4"/> and that must be giving us the information that we need <pause dur="0.3"/> to 
identify whether we're hearing a part of a word <pause dur="0.4"/> or <pause dur="0.3"/> the word as a whole <pause dur="1.9"/> that work is still <event desc="takes off transparency" iterated="n"/> going on i'm still writing it up <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> but recently i had to give a talk on this at a conference <pause dur="0.4"/> and # <pause dur="0.4"/> as conference organizers do they asked me to write it up <pause dur="0.4"/> to go # in a collection of papers <pause dur="0.4"/> # and since it's a very <trunc>sh</trunc> # a short paper reporting on work in progress <pause dur="0.4"/> # what i'd like to do is give you each a copy <pause dur="0.3"/> so that you can go over this at <pause dur="0.2"/> # at at more <pause dur="0.2"/> leisure <pause dur="0.6"/> so there i was # <pause dur="0.2"/> quarter of an hour before the lecture began <pause dur="0.3"/> ready to go on the photocopier <pause dur="0.3"/> when i looked at it and realized that it was an early draft which didn't have the diagrams and the statistics in <pause dur="0.5"/> # when i went back i realized it's on my computer at home not on my computer at work <pause dur="0.5"/> so i'm afraid you don't get it this morning <pause dur="0.4"/> but i will put copies in <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/>'s office <pause dur="0.4"/> and those will be available tomorrow onwards <pause dur="0.4"/> so if you'd like a copy of the <pause dur="0.4"/> most recent paper i've written based on this research <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> # # and the 
bibliography that goes with it <pause dur="0.3"/> # there will be enough for one each <pause dur="0.6"/> # on the other hand # if you're not interested just leave it there and i'll give it to somebody else <pause dur="1.2"/> that gets us to the end of that <pause dur="0.2"/> and also to the end of <pause dur="0.4"/> the study of <pause dur="0.4"/> the relationship between temporal factors and speech perception <pause dur="0.5"/> and <pause dur="0.3"/> i hope that the <pause dur="0.4"/> the general impression that you've got on this <pause dur="0.4"/> is that we are not simple <pause dur="0.4"/> phoneme crunchers when it comes to <pause dur="0.3"/> perceiving speech <pause dur="0.3"/> we are not simply taking in a stream of phonemes <pause dur="0.3"/> looking them up in a mental dictionary <pause dur="0.3"/> and <pause dur="0.5"/> churning out a kind of transcript <pause dur="0.5"/> what we're doing is <pause dur="0.2"/> at the same time monitoring <pause dur="0.3"/> a very rich <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> stream of prosodic information <pause dur="0.4"/> and in some cases 
also of allophonic variation <pause dur="0.5"/> but it's the prosodic side i really want to emphasize <pause dur="0.2"/> there is so much going on in the prosody of spoken language <pause dur="0.6"/> it's giving us so much information about <pause dur="0.2"/> how to divide the speech up into units <pause dur="0.3"/> and how to interpret it <pause dur="0.4"/> and it just has to be <pause dur="0.4"/> # something of great importance <pause dur="0.4"/> # it's something which we only understand in a very dim <pause dur="0.4"/> and partial way at the moment but <pause dur="0.3"/> a lot more research will be <pause dur="0.3"/> # going on <pause dur="0.3"/> in future years <pause dur="0.2"/> and we should discover more and more about it <pause dur="0.3"/> and ultimately we can teach computers that recognize speech <pause dur="0.3"/> how to make intelligent use of that information <pause dur="1.3"/> is that okay are there any <pause dur="0.3"/> questions <pause dur="4.0"/> okay <pause dur="1.8"/> right then
