<u who="nm0089"><kinesic desc="overhead projector is on showing transparency" iterated="n"/> well good morning everybody <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="1.4"/> last year i volunteered or was volunteered to give this lecture because somebody was on leave that somebody's come back and apparently i'm still giving the lecture i don't know how that happened but <pause dur="0.5"/> here i am <pause dur="0.6"/> and what i'm going to talk about is Marxism <pause dur="0.2"/> # and Marxist historiography since Marx <pause dur="0.6"/> linking up with what <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> said last week <pause dur="0.7"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> i think one of the points that <pause dur="0.6"/> # is very important about Marx is that Marx's ideas and i i think <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> mentioned this last week <pause dur="0.8"/> are a sort of unique fusion of <pause dur="0.3"/> two separate categories of thinking <pause dur="0.6"/> first of all <pause dur="0.2"/> there is a strongly philosophical element to Marx <pause dur="0.5"/> Marx's ideas <pause dur="0.2"/> developed # <pause dur="0.3"/> as philosophical ideas in the first place <pause dur="0.8"/> and <pause dur="0.3"/> it was <pause dur="0.5"/> once he'd kind of developed a # a philosophical view of the world based on Hegel and other # thinkers of early nineteenth century Germany <pause dur="0.6"/> he then <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> began to observe the realities of capitalist society around him and this 
led to the second layer of his thought <pause dur="0.4"/> the kind of empirical <pause dur="0.3"/> practical <pause dur="0.3"/> pragmatic <pause dur="0.2"/> understanding of the society in which he lived <pause dur="0.8"/> now any aspect of Marxist thought has got these two things <pause dur="0.4"/> closely infused together <pause dur="0.8"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> this makes it rather exceptional <pause dur="0.7"/> if you go back before Marx <pause dur="0.5"/> you had philosophers i mentioned Hegel Kant and others who were not social analysts <pause dur="0.6"/> and you had people who were social analysts Montesquieu <pause dur="0.3"/> # Adam Smith <pause dur="0.5"/> who were not in the true sense philosophers i'm not saying they didn't have ideas but they didn't have this fusion <pause dur="0.6"/> and many people have argued that <pause dur="0.2"/> # Marx came to his conclusions philosophically <pause dur="0.4"/> and then used the world around him to justify them <pause dur="0.5"/> and there's a very # the linkage between them i think is brought out by this perhaps the most famous quotation of from Marx from eighteen-forty-eight from his thesis on Feuerbach <pause dur="0.8"/> where he argues that philosophers have only interpreted the world <pause dur="0.4"/> the point is to change it <pause dur="1.2"/> so <pause dur="0.2"/> for Marx <pause dur="0.6"/> # understanding was simply <pause dur="0.3"/> a 
preliminary step <pause dur="0.5"/> to action and to changing things <pause dur="0.7"/> and <pause dur="0.3"/> it follows from this that for a Marxist history is as i've said at the bottom <pause dur="0.4"/> it's about analysing the present as well as the past <pause dur="0.5"/> with a view <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> to changing the future not necessarily foretelling the future <pause dur="0.4"/> but changing the future <pause dur="1.0"/> now <pause dur="0.2"/> it's with this background in mind that i want to talk particularly <pause dur="0.4"/> about <pause dur="0.2"/> two aspects really following from this <pause dur="0.4"/> the way that Marxist ideas developed <pause dur="0.5"/> and to jump in from time to time to talk about the way <pause dur="0.4"/> that development of Marxist philosophy <pause dur="0.4"/> began <pause dur="0.2"/> to affect the way they looked at history because that's our main concern here is the historiography of all this <pause dur="1.4"/> now <pause dur="0.8"/> the <pause dur="2.2"/> question <pause dur="0.4"/> which arose <pause dur="0.3"/> almost <pause dur="0.3"/> <trunc>p</trunc> # <pause dur="0.5"/> permanently <pause dur="0.7"/><kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="8"/> in people's minds after Marx <pause dur="0.7"/> was the question of <pause dur="0.3"/> why <pause dur="0.2"/> was it <pause dur="1.0"/> that the revolution that he'd predicted <pause dur="0.4"/> had not come about <pause dur="2.8"/> and <pause dur="0.5"/> in many ways the philosophical responses and the other responses to Marx <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> in the late nineteenth century are answers to this question and <trunc>stro</trunc> and on into the <pause dur="0.3"/> 
twentieth century as well <pause dur="1.1"/> and <pause dur="0.5"/> the first stage in this process really <pause dur="0.5"/> was one which began <pause dur="0.6"/> with <pause dur="0.2"/> not Marx himself so much but Engels <pause dur="0.7"/> and the person who became the leading figure <pause dur="0.5"/> in Marxist philosophy after <pause dur="0.7"/> # after Marx <pause dur="0.3"/> Karl Kautsky the leader of the <trunc>s</trunc> German Social Democratic Party <pause dur="1.0"/> it's famous <pause dur="0.2"/> famously <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> quoted everywhere that Marx said <pause dur="0.7"/> in the latter part of his life as for me <pause dur="0.5"/> i am not a Marxist <pause dur="0.7"/> # and if that phrase meant anything it meant that the kind of <pause dur="0.5"/> processes which were going on with Marx's ideas towards the end of his life <pause dur="0.5"/> and certainly after his death in eighteen-eighty-one <pause dur="0.4"/> were ones which # <pause dur="0.2"/> <trunc>w</trunc> which <pause dur="1.0"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> were <pause dur="1.3"/> not <pause dur="0.4"/> # in his view <pause dur="0.2"/> following up <pause dur="0.2"/> the main <trunc>i</trunc> the main # essence of his ideas in particular <pause dur="0.7"/> there were attempts to turn his ideas into systems into rules into laws <pause dur="0.4"/> they were becoming in the context of the time much more positivistic <pause dur="0.5"/> # and they turned into what some people have called <pause dur="0.2"/> vulgar Marxism <pause dur="0.4"/> # a very crude form of historical materialism <pause dur="0.5"/> and Kautsky <pause dur="0.2"/> 
very much # <pause dur="0.3"/> <trunc>f</trunc> pushes forward this <pause dur="0.4"/> # concept of vulgar Marxism and of scientific Marxism <pause dur="0.8"/> if we look at some of the major features <pause dur="0.3"/> of that sort <pause dur="0.3"/><kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="5"/> # of vulgar Marxism or <trunc>s</trunc> or or or <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="1.0"/> this attempt to turn into a set of dogmas essentially <pause dur="1.0"/> the <pause dur="0.5"/> starting point for most versions of it was the economic # interpretation of history <pause dur="0.6"/> economics is the fundamental <pause dur="0.3"/> aspect of history <pause dur="0.5"/> everything arises <pause dur="0.2"/> # or can be explained in terms of economic conjunctures economic development <pause dur="0.5"/> # and and economic base <pause dur="0.8"/> # and that <pause dur="0.2"/> there is <pause dur="0.2"/> # in this interpretation i'll come on to that in a moment <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> # a model of base and superstructure but the economic interpretation argued the fundamental factor on which all other <trunc>fac</trunc> social factors depended <pause dur="0.4"/> was <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> economy particularly the means of production <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> and ownership of it the means of production in different societies being land <pause dur="0.6"/> in feudal society machines and industrial society <pause dur="0.4"/> capital and labour <pause dur="0.4"/> # capital in capitalist society labour in in a number of other societies as well <pause dur="0.4"/> and 
the way in which those means of production were organized and particularly who owned them hence the basis <pause dur="0.3"/> of class because classes were divided into those people who owned these means of production <pause dur="0.5"/> and those people who were employed to work these means of production <pause dur="0.4"/> # in Marx's terminology in in a capitalist society <pause dur="0.4"/> # the bourgeoisie and the proletariat <pause dur="1.0"/> so <pause dur="0.2"/> vulgar <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> Marxists <pause dur="0.5"/> argued very strongly for the economic <pause dur="0.3"/> # determination of society and this led <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/><kinesic desc="reveals covered part of transparency" iterated="n"/> some and many of the tendencies continued in the twentieth century in fact in some ways Stalin is one of the <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> leading exponents of this particular version and crude <pause dur="0.4"/> Marxism as it was developed in the Soviet Union in the nineteen late twenties and thirties <pause dur="0.6"/> that <pause dur="0.4"/> society has a kind of basis and a superstructure <pause dur="0.6"/> the economy is the basis <pause dur="0.3"/> the superstructure is everything that's built on it social forms <pause dur="0.4"/> but not just social forms <pause dur="0.3"/> also ideas cultural phenomena <pause dur="0.5"/> # law <pause dur="0.4"/> # religion <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> what we're doing today <pause dur="0.2"/> # higher education whatever it happens 
to be <pause dur="0.3"/> all these things arise in this very crude interpretation <pause dur="0.4"/> from economic # economic # <pause dur="0.3"/> economic # origins <pause dur="0.7"/> and associated with this <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> is <pause dur="0.2"/> a stress <pause dur="0.2"/> on <pause dur="0.5"/> the on <pause dur="0.2"/> class interest <pause dur="0.2"/> and class struggle <pause dur="3.3"/> and the idea of historical laws and historical inevitability <pause dur="0.5"/> # in other words # <pause dur="0.3"/> the <pause dur="0.2"/> version of Marxism which is most often criticized by people who don't know much about Marx himself <pause dur="0.4"/> is often this particular version of Marxism this <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> version of Marxism which possibly Marx had in mind when he said he wasn't himself a Marxist <pause dur="0.4"/> but the first stage of development of Marxist ideas <pause dur="0.5"/> brings it into this rather <pause dur="0.2"/> # schematic <pause dur="0.4"/> positivist influenced <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> rule based idea of <pause dur="0.2"/> controlling history <pause dur="0.3"/> history working directly through laws <pause dur="0.3"/> and those laws being readily <pause dur="0.3"/> perceptible <pause dur="0.2"/> # and readily # understandable <pause dur="1.0"/> now <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.8"/> that <pause dur="0.9"/> interpretation <pause dur="0.8"/><kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="8"/> doesn't satisfy everybody on a number of grounds <pause dur="0.7"/> and as i've said the key question in people's minds was why had there not been <pause dur="0.3"/> a revolution of the Marxist kind <pause dur="0.6"/> and the first <pause dur="0.3"/> 
bold effort <pause dur="0.3"/> to try to <pause dur="0.4"/> answer this question # was put was was one <pause dur="0.3"/> associated with <pause dur="0.2"/> # the name Eduard Bernstein <pause dur="0.4"/> in late <pause dur="0.3"/> # nineteenth # he developed these ideas in late nineteenth # <pause dur="0.4"/> early twentieth century <pause dur="0.4"/> # Britain actually although he was German <trunc>h</trunc> # # his British experiences <pause dur="0.4"/> meant a great deal to him <pause dur="0.5"/> and he began to argue that there were some fundamental flaws he didn't actually challenge the <pause dur="0.2"/> positivistic element so much he challenged <pause dur="0.4"/> the working out of some of those rules that we were looking at <pause dur="0.4"/> and he argued that <pause dur="0.2"/> in actual fact the the laws as they were understood by Kautsky and orthodox Marxists <pause dur="0.5"/> the laws of capitalist development <pause dur="0.3"/> were mistaken <pause dur="0.9"/><kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="16"/> hence his ideas are often referred to as revisionism <pause dur="0.6"/> instead he argued <pause dur="0.5"/> that <pause dur="0.7"/> first of all <pause dur="0.3"/> the class <pause dur="0.4"/> idea that Marx had and i think that <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> that <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="1.0"/> <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> emphasized last week let me just take that it's probably easier if i just take that completely off there <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> that <pause dur="0.3"/> all that <pause dur="0.3"/> classes will polarize <pause dur="0.4"/> the middle class will disappear the 
proletariat will sink into penury <pause dur="0.3"/> the peasantry will <trunc>th</trunc> will disappear the petit bourgeoisie will disappear under capitalism <pause dur="0.3"/> and everything will move out into <pause dur="0.3"/> a wide range of of of polarized classes <pause dur="0.3"/> according to Bernstein this was not happening <pause dur="0.5"/> and he argued that the middle class doesn't disappear in fact the middle class is the <trunc>s</trunc> is the class which is expanding most rapidly <pause dur="0.5"/> in Britain in the late <trunc>n</trunc> nineteenth and early twentieth century <pause dur="0.3"/> so far from polarizing and disappearing into a a class struggle <pause dur="0.3"/> between the impoverished <pause dur="0.2"/> and the super rich which is the crude interpretation of Marx <pause dur="0.5"/> # the <pause dur="0.6"/> development of capitalism <pause dur="0.2"/> was moving in a different direction <pause dur="0.4"/> and # the # <pause dur="0.6"/> lower classes were not disappearing <pause dur="0.4"/> and the reason for this was that ownership of capital ownership of the means of production was not as Marx thought polarizing <pause dur="0.4"/> through competition driving <pause dur="0.3"/> poor # # <trunc>sec</trunc> # <pause dur="0.6"/> # failed producers out of the market <pause dur="0.4"/> and creating a smaller and smaller number of big <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> successful producers <pause dur="0.6"/> # whether it be in 
agriculture or in industry <pause dur="0.9"/> so instead <pause dur="0.5"/> # Bernstein argued the middle class was getting broader <pause dur="0.6"/> the working class was actually getting richer <pause dur="0.7"/> its wages were improving <pause dur="0.3"/> it was owning more <pause dur="0.4"/> the petit bourgeoisie <pause dur="0.4"/> small land owners in particular market gardeners that kind of person were becoming more rather than less numerous <pause dur="0.4"/> and even shareholding was becoming dispersed through society <pause dur="0.6"/> so that <pause dur="0.4"/> from Bernstein's point of view <pause dur="0.5"/> # capitalism itself was beginning to evolve <pause dur="0.5"/> # a kind <pause dur="0.2"/> <trunc>o</trunc> <pause dur="0.3"/> would hopefully evolve into a kind of socialism <pause dur="0.4"/> which could be developed through <pause dur="0.3"/> pursuit of reformism <pause dur="0.3"/> through <pause dur="0.2"/> pursuing democracy <pause dur="0.4"/> through pursuing <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> the <pause dur="0.2"/> # current paths of capitalist development without revolution <pause dur="0.7"/> in other words he saw in an optimistic way that capitalism itself was dispersing ownership through society and once the ownership was dispersed through society was effectively <pause dur="0.4"/> almost a socialist society <pause dur="0.6"/> and that's i think behind that other rather mysterious quotation there <pause dur="0.3"/> <reading>the 
ultimate goal of socialism is nothing to me <pause dur="0.2"/> the movement is everything</reading> in other words <pause dur="0.4"/> for him <pause dur="0.2"/> the idea of <pause dur="0.3"/> future communism or whatever # <trunc>i</trunc> utopian society you had <pause dur="0.3"/> was not the crucial thing <pause dur="0.2"/> the crucial thing was the movement towards it <pause dur="0.4"/> # and the ideas that # <pause dur="0.7"/> the the the <pause dur="0.6"/> the the workers movement for reform for change bringing people together <pause dur="0.3"/> # things like trade unions eventually the Labour Party these were all things which were developing <pause dur="0.3"/> in a big way in the eighteen-nineties and around nineteen-hundred in the in Britain <pause dur="0.2"/> and he saw that as the way forward for the labour movement <pause dur="0.8"/> of course you'll realize that that is exactly the split which has occurred in <pause dur="0.2"/> the socialist movement in the twentieth century <pause dur="0.8"/> between those who follow the revolutionary path <pause dur="0.4"/> and those who follow this reformist path <pause dur="0.3"/> if you like Bernstein is the founder of New Labour <pause dur="0.5"/> maybe they don't even talk about socialism but the <pause dur="0.3"/> ultimate goal is nothing to me could certainly be said by # Tony Blair <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> but the movement is 
everything # <pause dur="0.4"/> and the idea that that # <trunc>th</trunc> i mean the the problem that arises from this that socialism is split <pause dur="0.4"/> of course has helped <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.8"/> to maintain <pause dur="0.3"/> socialism as a as as as a <pause dur="0.7"/> # an unsuccessful movement in most respects in the twentieth century in terms of # <pause dur="0.2"/> # in terms of what was expected in the late nineteenth century <pause dur="0.6"/> however not all Marxists were as pessimistic about the future although <pause dur="0.4"/> Bernstein i wouldn't say is pessimistic <pause dur="0.5"/> but they were they were less pessimistic than he was about the potential for <pause dur="0.4"/> # revolution <pause dur="0.7"/> and <pause dur="0.8"/><kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="10"/> the revolutionary side of Marxism <pause dur="0.5"/> was given <pause dur="0.7"/> a <pause dur="0.2"/> new lease of life naturally by the Russian Revolution <pause dur="0.6"/> # but also by <pause dur="1.5"/> some ideas which preceded it <pause dur="0.6"/> and <pause dur="0.3"/> the <pause dur="0.4"/> # person <pause dur="0.4"/> # who <pause dur="0.2"/> engendered a number of these ideas <pause dur="0.5"/> is <pause dur="0.2"/> # Rudolf Hilferding <pause dur="0.2"/> a an Austrian economist and socialist <pause dur="0.6"/> # who himself ended up more of a Bernsteinian than a revolutionary <pause dur="0.8"/> but <pause dur="0.9"/> Hilferding <pause dur="0.2"/> as i've said like many others was interested in the question why hasn't there been a proletarian revolution <pause dur="0.9"/> and he argued that in fact what was 
happening under capitalism <pause dur="0.6"/> was a massive development <pause dur="0.2"/> of <pause dur="0.7"/> # what he called finance capital that capitalism itself was beginning to change <pause dur="0.7"/> there were i mean today <pause dur="0.2"/> we see a capitalism of giant corporations bestriding the globe larger than nation states holding nation states to ransom <pause dur="0.8"/> hence # the need or the drive to do things like put <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> # the European Union together to try to combat this by uniting nation states to try to control some of these big corporations <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> but <pause dur="0.2"/> he <pause dur="0.3"/> # argued that what had happened was that # <pause dur="0.5"/> capitalism had changed its nature in that in Marx's day <pause dur="0.5"/> the owners of capital were usually the direct investors of capital <pause dur="0.5"/> you invested your own money in what seemed to be profitable <pause dur="0.2"/> potential businesses <pause dur="0.7"/> by the end of the century according to Hilferding <pause dur="0.3"/> capitalism was now based not on individuals but on banks <pause dur="0.5"/> and other financial institutions which became gigantic pools <pause dur="0.3"/> lakes <pause dur="0.5"/> of anonymous capital <pause dur="0.7"/> # as they are today <pause dur="0.8"/> # you put your <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> you put your 
money into the bank or i suppose <pause dur="0.3"/> probably your overdraft in most cases <pause dur="0.4"/> but your money goes into the bank <pause dur="0.5"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> # what happens to it where does it go <pause dur="0.9"/> the bank lends people money whose money is it lending nobody knows it's a great anonymous pool of capital <pause dur="0.5"/> which is not controlled by individuals you don't control where that money goes still less if you <pause dur="0.5"/> have pension funds or <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> # other <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> financial <pause dur="0.2"/> # services and so on and so forth <pause dur="0.6"/> and that money is <pause dur="0.5"/> is allocated by professionals who don't own the money <pause dur="0.9"/> # by <pause dur="0.4"/> professional financial advisers <trunc>fina</trunc> financial managers for these institutions investment managers and so on and so forth <pause dur="0.7"/> and he argued that this growth of monopoly capitalism was changing the nature of capitalism that it wasn't this was one of the reasons why there were super profits being made <pause dur="0.5"/> # and so on and so forth <pause dur="0.5"/> but this was taken up by some of the revolutionaries because he also argued <pause dur="0.4"/> perhaps here <pause dur="0.6"/> echoing a bit of Bernstein that <trunc>capitalis</trunc> this meant capitalism itself was 
becoming more organized this was a second concept he had organized capitalism <pause dur="0.7"/> for Marx capitalism was based on the anarchy of the market the in the <trunc>inpr</trunc> unpredictability of the market <pause dur="0.5"/> the market was a kind of <pause dur="0.2"/> # tempestuous ocean <pause dur="0.4"/> on which capitalist enterprises had to sink <pause dur="0.2"/> or swim <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> in order to protect themselves from this tempestuous sea <pause dur="0.4"/> capitalism is becoming more and more organized # <pause dur="0.2"/> finance capitalism is one way it's becoming more organized because this meant that there were links <pause dur="0.5"/> between big companies <pause dur="0.3"/> # and banks and heavy investors <pause dur="0.6"/> but also <pause dur="0.2"/> companies themselves were coming together into monopolies and cartels and and doing deals with each other to control the market <pause dur="0.7"/> the idea that capitalists like markets is laughable capitalists hate markets they like to control markets or don't like free markets they like to control markets <pause dur="0.7"/> and he was pointing to this as a way in which big capital had survived <pause dur="0.3"/> the predictions of Marx that it was changing its nature <pause dur="0.3"/> it was 
turning into what we think of as monopoly capitalism <pause dur="0.5"/> now the points from the revolutionary's <trunc>poi</trunc> # view <pause dur="0.4"/> is that certain revolutionaries Lenin in the forefront <pause dur="0.3"/> seized on Hilferding's ideas <pause dur="0.5"/> as a justification for the potential for revolution <pause dur="0.3"/> in the face of Bernstein's criticism <pause dur="0.4"/> # and Bernstein's revisionism because <pause dur="0.5"/> the conclusion which <pause dur="0.3"/> Lenin drew from Hilferding's ideas <pause dur="0.4"/> of <trunc>organ</trunc> organized capitalism was that here was capitalism <pause dur="0.4"/> itself developing institutions <pause dur="0.4"/> which <pause dur="0.2"/> could be taken over <pause dur="0.7"/> by a future revolutionary state <pause dur="0.7"/> because instead of having a whole inchoate class of capital owners <pause dur="0.4"/> running the capitalist economy <pause dur="0.6"/> you now had these key <pause dur="0.3"/> financial managers <pause dur="0.4"/> who were working for banks for salaries <pause dur="0.6"/> if you decapitated capitalism <pause dur="0.6"/> # and that in a <trunc>se</trunc> # in in Lenin's view meant nationalizing the banks <pause dur="0.6"/> you'd be able to control capitalist society this was the this was Lenin's assumption at the turn of the century from these ideas <pause dur="0.5"/> so by nationalizing the banks <pause dur="0.3"/> you could then control <pause dur="0.4"/> # you could then 
control <pause dur="0.9"/> # <pause dur="1.0"/> the evolution of capitalism control where investment went and you could control <pause dur="0.3"/> where <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> the priorities for society were <pause dur="0.5"/> and the fundamental problems of exploitation hopefully could be avoided by the state intervening and controlling this process and moving towards socialism so Lenin <pause dur="0.4"/> saw this as as <trunc>a</trunc> <trunc>a</trunc> as # monopoly capitalism as a step towards <pause dur="0.3"/> potential socialism because <trunc>sen</trunc> socialism is supposed to be a rational controlled organized society <pause dur="0.9"/> # one which was # in which <pause dur="0.6"/> human beings <pause dur="0.2"/> # called the tune and <pause dur="0.2"/> organized society the way they wanted it <pause dur="0.4"/> not one in which society called the tune <pause dur="0.3"/> and organized human beings in whatever was appropriate to the given <pause dur="0.3"/> economic # <pause dur="0.2"/> conditions of the day <pause dur="1.6"/> secondarily Lenin also looked at another phenomenon of the late nineteenth century as did Rosa Luxemburg and Nikolai Bukharin <pause dur="0.6"/> to argue that one of the reasons for the growth of these big monopolies and the expansion of capitalism was imperialism <pause dur="0.9"/> that <pause dur="0.3"/> # where Marx might have thought

global system with Russia as one of its weakest links <pause dur="0.4"/> so while Russia was not a capitalist society at the time of the Russian Revolution <pause dur="0.4"/> Lenin thought he was breaking <pause dur="0.2"/> the world system of capitalism <pause dur="0.3"/> by # attacking it at this <pause dur="0.2"/> at this weak link <pause dur="0.3"/> and from there it would spread to where it should take place <pause dur="0.3"/> in Germany <pause dur="0.3"/> # in France in Britain in western Europe <pause dur="0.4"/> and eventually who knows even in North America <pause dur="1.0"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> <trunc>s</trunc> but Lenin <pause dur="0.3"/> # and these thinkers were still <pause dur="0.4"/> fairly much <pause dur="0.2"/> in the tradition of the semi-positivistic # <pause dur="0.3"/> interpretation of Marx <pause dur="0.6"/> since the Russian Revolution particularly since many people <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> on the left criticized the Russian Revolution and the way it was developing from very early on inclusing including Rosa Luxemburg who was <pause dur="0.5"/> very worried about the dictatorial and anti-democractic tendencies of Lenin and the Russian Revolution in nineteen-seventeen and nineteen-eighteen very early on <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> many <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> thinkers began to look in different directions <pause dur="0.4"/> for <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> new inspiration about Marxist ideas and these are ones

people <pause dur="0.2"/> drew attention to <pause dur="0.3"/> a whole new areas of historical subject matter <pause dur="0.7"/> obviously implicit in what i've been saying the development of capitalism itself <pause dur="0.6"/> # Marx analysed the capitalism of his day <pause dur="0.5"/> # the analysis of contemporary society and its evolution over the previous decades and centuries <pause dur="0.3"/> was absolutely crucial to this level of historical understanding <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> industrialization came into the picture <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> the <pause dur="0.2"/> # agitations of the oppressed classes <pause dur="1.0"/> # the ideas <pause dur="0.4"/> of peasants workers <pause dur="0.3"/> peasants and workers were almost entirely absent from historiography <pause dur="0.4"/> except as occasional intruders in peasant revolts or <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> # <trunc>un</trunc> # untidy uprisings of various kinds in the past <pause dur="0.3"/> there was very little interest <pause dur="0.2"/> in these groupings <pause dur="0.5"/> # and there was very little interest in in in # in revolutions <pause dur="0.3"/> it was thought rather crudely <pause dur="0.5"/> that it wasn't going to be possible <pause dur="0.3"/> to write the history of ordinary people because they didn't leave any traces behind <pause dur="0.5"/> but essentially this is the kind of argument which has been levelled <pause dur="0.4"/> 
at any # at many of the new phases of <pause dur="0.2"/> # historical interpretation <pause dur="0.6"/> it's not my job to bring this up to date but i can remember when gender history began to evolve <pause dur="0.6"/> # conservative historians again with a small C argued <pause dur="0.4"/> well there can't be any gender history we can't write the history of women because there can't be any evidence for it because if there had been we would have done it <pause dur="0.7"/> this idea that history is evidentially based and emerges <pause dur="0.3"/> # full blown out of the archives <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> in fact of course once people started asking questions about the history of women they went and found there was a whole new way of looking <pause dur="0.3"/> at <trunc>e</trunc> at at at at archives which already existed or material which already existed <pause dur="0.3"/> and whole <pause dur="0.2"/> swathes of material which had never been looked at the same had been done for peasants the same had been done for workers <pause dur="0.5"/> classes who had been <pause dur="0.4"/> # in the phrase hidden from history <pause dur="0.4"/> # it's a <trunc>ques</trunc> and and this points to the to the to to the <pause dur="0.9"/> # <pause dur="0.9"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> this points to the # fact that <pause dur="0.9"/> historians no longer <pause dur="0.2"/> saw themselves as 
the subjects of historical enquiry <pause dur="0.5"/> # as or as outside it <pause dur="0.4"/> it led to the whole <pause dur="0.2"/><kinesic desc="reveals covered part of transparency" iterated="n"/> question of the role of the historian themself <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> <trunc>i</trunc> if in the nineteenth century traditional idea <pause dur="0.3"/> the historian was above history <pause dur="0.5"/> # and simply <pause dur="1.3"/> related what had happened <pause dur="0.9"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> these ideas led to historians becoming part <pause dur="0.5"/> of the <trunc>hi</trunc> of the social process <pause dur="0.5"/> historians themselves <pause dur="0.2"/> are <pause dur="0.4"/> organic or traditional intellectuals <pause dur="0.4"/> they are part of the intellectual struggle <pause dur="0.4"/> they are part of hegemony <pause dur="0.8"/> if conservative or dominant ideas suggest that <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> women should not be emancipated historians over the past hadn't even noticed that they were <pause dur="0.6"/> unemancipated <pause dur="0.4"/> and then suddenly when the <trunc>r</trunc> issue of women's emancipation arises <pause dur="0.3"/> historians begin to turn towards it as a new question a new <trunc>hish</trunc> issue <pause dur="0.6"/> similarly in the nineteenth century <pause dur="0.4"/> national historians turn towards the history of their own nationalities <pause dur="0.7"/> historians in other words <pause dur="0.2"/> increasingly become part of the intellectual struggle <pause dur="0.5"/> # and see themselves as part of the 
intellectual struggle <pause dur="0.4"/> and in fact come to the conclusion that they cannot separate themselves <pause dur="0.2"/> from the society in which they exist <pause dur="0.5"/> this has led to <pause dur="0.2"/> # and again it's a territory that i don't want to jump into at this particular moment <pause dur="0.5"/> the sort of post-modernist extremes of this that <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> you go to so far that the <trunc>histor</trunc> that history <pause dur="0.4"/> at the end of the day doesn't tell you anything about the past because it's a construction of the historian <pause dur="0.7"/> # herself or himself <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> while most <pause dur="0.3"/> Marxist historians wouldn't go as far as that <pause dur="0.4"/> the the objectivity of history <pause dur="0.3"/> was undermined by this and the subjectivity of history <pause dur="0.4"/> was stressed <pause dur="0.5"/> that doesn't mean to <trunc>s</trunc> that doesn't mean to say one can necessarily conclude <pause dur="0.4"/> that one will need that that <trunc>w</trunc> one can go as far <pause dur="0.9"/> # as the post-modernists in saying that there's no such thing <pause dur="0.4"/> as <pause dur="0.3"/> history or we cannot know anything worth knowing about the past <pause dur="0.4"/> most historians would tend to disagree with that <pause dur="0.7"/><kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="4"/> so <pause dur="0.3"/> if just to summarize at the end <pause dur="0.5"/> # if we look at <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> a <pause dur="1.6"/> number of points 
made by the Italian historian Momigliano <pause dur="0.7"/> quoted by Hobsbawm <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> arguing what had happened to history in the hundred years after Ranke <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> he stressed in particular two or three of the points that we've been looking at here <pause dur="0.6"/> a decline in political and religious history <pause dur="0.7"/> # national histories begin to look old-fashioned according to this <pause dur="0.5"/> # and instead of <pause dur="0.3"/> national and religious history history of the state <pause dur="0.5"/> # there's a major turn towards social and economic history <pause dur="0.6"/> # and the twentieth century has seen of course massive development in the late twentieth century massive development of social <pause dur="0.4"/> and economic history <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.9"/><kinesic desc="reveals covered part of transparency" iterated="n"/> it's no longer easy <pause dur="0.8"/> to use ideas as an explanation of history <pause dur="0.9"/> although ideas as i've been stressing have a role in history <pause dur="0.5"/> the concept that everything in history arises from <pause dur="0.4"/> ideas which had been prevalent <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> in certain schools of nineteenth century historiography <pause dur="0.4"/> # is much more difficult to sustain these days <pause dur="0.5"/> that ideas <pause dur="0.2"/> themselves are seen as <pause dur="0.2"/> socially <pause dur="0.9"/> i don't know whether to 
say conditioned or determined perhaps the best word is to say socially shaped <pause dur="0.6"/> # they don't arise full-blown unobjectively <pause dur="0.4"/> # in people's heads they are themselves partly constructed socially <pause dur="0.6"/> # and ideas themselves are related to the society in which they evolve <pause dur="1.0"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> and <pause dur="4.4"/> although we can then <pause dur="0.5"/> # move on from that <pause dur="0.5"/> and say that one can look at explanations in term of social forces <pause dur="0.5"/> it still doesn't necessarily solve that thorny issue <pause dur="0.3"/> of the precise relationship <pause dur="0.5"/> between <pause dur="0.2"/> # the explanation of historical events <pause dur="0.3"/> and the explanation of individual actions <pause dur="0.9"/> what is the relationship between these two this is something which constantly puzzles historians and constantly puzzles <pause dur="0.4"/> philosophers of history <pause dur="0.8"/> can we go totally structural and say individual actions mean nothing <pause dur="1.2"/> probably not <pause dur="0.6"/> because at certain stages individual actions can weigh very heavily <pause dur="1.1"/> if Stalin had not been Stalin there may not have been a terror <pause dur="0.4"/> if Lenin had not been Lenin there might not have been a Russian 
revolution if Napoleon had not been Napoleon # the French Revolution might have turned out differently <pause dur="0.4"/> individual actions individuals may <trunc>un</trunc> certain under certain conditions be very effective <pause dur="0.8"/> but we can't go to the other extreme and say history is nothing but <pause dur="0.6"/> the accumulation of the action of individuals <pause dur="0.2"/> or dominated by the action of individuals <pause dur="0.6"/> because those individuals work in contradictory and sometimes complementary ways and it's what they do it's a resultant of what they all do together <pause dur="0.9"/> which in a sense changes history rather than what they do as individuals it's the <pause dur="0.3"/> resultant of of of of the collective actions of individuals very often which <pause dur="0.4"/> # which leads to social <trunc>pri</trunc> # issues so it hasn't actually solved this problem <pause dur="0.8"/> and finally as i've already mentioned <reading>it had become very much more difficult <pause dur="0.3"/> to speak of progress <pause dur="0.3"/> or of the meaningful development of events in a certain direction</reading> <pause dur="0.5"/> what is poshly known as a teleological view of history the idea that <pause dur="0.4"/> things are always moving towards some sort of 
goal <pause dur="0.6"/> # usually for the better <pause dur="0.5"/> # progress in the liberal historiography in the mid-nineteenth century <pause dur="0.5"/> future socialist society and perhaps communism <pause dur="0.4"/> in the Marxist interpretation of history <pause dur="0.4"/> # Marxism is seen <pause dur="0.3"/> as a kind of teleological history <trunc>i</trunc> itself is a kind of teleological history <pause dur="0.5"/> because it does see <pause dur="0.2"/> society rising through different stages <pause dur="0.4"/> towards <pause dur="0.3"/> # some sort of <pause dur="0.4"/> ideal <pause dur="0.2"/> # utopian <pause dur="0.3"/> # future <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> and <pause dur="0.4"/> this # vision <pause dur="0.2"/> # is is one which is shares # <trunc>i</trunc> well not the same vision but the # notion of that kind of progress is something which <pause dur="0.5"/> Marx shared with # many of his contemporaries who were liberals <pause dur="0.5"/> and one which is much more sceptically # looked upon today <pause dur="1.0"/> okay i want to stop there <pause dur="0.2"/> and # <pause dur="0.6"/> you should have a copy of a few items of bibliography which has been circulated <pause dur="0.5"/> # to add to what you've already got because <pause dur="0.3"/> these are quite interesting articles focused specifically on the issues i've been talking about <pause dur="0.5"/> Marxist interpretation of history <pause dur="0.4"/> and # Marxist interpretation of society <pause dur="0.5"/> okay
