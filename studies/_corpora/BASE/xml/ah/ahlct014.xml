<u who="nm0063"> as far as the history of the medical drama goes on T-V <pause dur="0.8"/> # i'm going to be showing a documentary <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> after the lecture <pause dur="0.9"/> # called <pause dur="1.4"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> i think it's called Docs on the Box <pause dur="0.2"/> it's part of the Docs on the Box # <pause dur="0.4"/> theme <pause dur="0.4"/> evening on B-B-C-two <pause dur="0.5"/> couple of # <pause dur="0.8"/> it was about three years ago now <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="1.4"/> and in in that theme night there was a documentary <pause dur="0.5"/> # called Playing Doctor and it's it's interviews with it consists of interviews with <pause dur="1.0"/> # <pause dur="3.0"/> well the programme makers <pause dur="0.3"/> medical dramas <pause dur="0.2"/> and that gives quite a good history anyway it's very good actually <pause dur="0.4"/> gives <trunc>g</trunc> quite a good history of the # <pause dur="0.4"/> # development of the medical drama in in the U-K and in the U-S <pause dur="0.8"/> so we'll be seeing that <pause dur="0.2"/> anyway <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> after <pause dur="0.3"/> after this lecture <pause dur="0.7"/> so what i want to concentrate on is Cardiac Arrest mostly <pause dur="0.6"/> # although some of the things i'll be saying obviously one can extrapolate and generalize to other medical dramas and other programmes as well <pause dur="1.4"/> okay so i'm going to start <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="1.0"/> hot docs <pause dur="0.5"/> hot docs <pause dur="0.6"/> this is the cover of 
the Radio Times <kinesic desc="holds up magazine" iterated="n"/> can you see that <pause dur="1.8"/> it's got Helen Baxendale <pause dur="0.7"/><vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" n="ss" dur="1"/> and # <pause dur="2.2"/> Mandy Patinkin <pause dur="0.5"/> yeah it's <pause dur="0.3"/> hot docs why we're addicted to medical dramas why we're addicted <pause dur="0.4"/> to medical dramas <pause dur="2.6"/> # <pause dur="2.9"/> and the <pause dur="0.4"/> and the date of that is ninety-five June ninety-five and that's really the high point of the medical drama in Britain it's <pause dur="0.6"/> at that point the medical drama was the <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> the power genre <pause dur="0.4"/> of the nineteen-nineties <pause dur="0.4"/> today <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.9"/> the power genre is obviously something different <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> you might call it makeover <pause dur="0.2"/> television <pause dur="0.6"/> tune in on a <pause dur="0.2"/> on prime time on a Friday night <pause dur="0.4"/> # there's a succession of makeover programmes rooms being <pause dur="0.8"/> madeover people <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> gardens <pause dur="0.2"/> so on and so on <pause dur="0.3"/> so <trunc>i</trunc> <pause dur="0.5"/> it's a different power genre but certainly the mid-nineteen-nineties nineteen-ninety-five <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> think there were about three covers of the Radio Times that had references to medical dramas <pause dur="0.9"/> on it <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="1.1"/> so the Radio Times was quick to cash in on <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.8"/> what had become this power genre of the mid-nineteen-nineties the medical dramas they were <pause dur="0.3"/> seen by the Radio Times as 
sexy and post-modern <pause dur="1.2"/> and of course they give a strong visual hint on the cover about the answer <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="1.1"/> ah <pause dur="2.3"/><event desc="student enters room" iterated="n" n="sm0064"/> only a couple of minutes in <pause dur="4.9"/> are there roadblocks <unclear>up</unclear> in Leamington or something </u><u who="sm0064" trans="overlap"> <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> </u><u who="nm0063" trans="latching"> mm <pause dur="4.8"/> okay so why we're addicted to medical dramas <pause dur="0.6"/> answer Helen Baxendale Mandy Patinkin <pause dur="0.8"/> should have it should have been George Clooney obviously but # <pause dur="0.3"/> B-B-C were showing Chicago Hope <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> so they can be <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> they were seen as sexy and post-modern medical dramas yeah sexy and post-modern <pause dur="1.7"/> and of course there's that playful use of the word addicted <pause dur="0.7"/> yeah <pause dur="1.2"/> so <pause dur="0.2"/> <trunc>a</trunc> at once we get the glamorous address of those programmes in terms of star <pause dur="0.2"/> appeal <pause dur="1.0"/> and in terms of the seductive visualization <pause dur="0.3"/> of medical <pause dur="0.4"/> procedure <pause dur="3.9"/> now with reference to Cardiac Arrest i want to argue that this series is is transitional <pause dur="1.8"/> hi there <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> <pause dur="2.6"/> a transitional series one that revises the concerns of earlier <pause dur="0.3"/> British medical dramas <pause dur="1.6"/> # within a generically aware <pause dur="0.3"/> context <pause dur="0.4"/> and this generically aware context is kind of in 
dialogue with other British and U-S medical dramas <pause dur="1.1"/> what Cardiac <pause dur="0.2"/> Arrest does specifically <pause dur="0.3"/> is is to enact a shift of attention <pause dur="0.4"/> from a concern with the patient <pause dur="0.3"/> and nation <pause dur="0.5"/> as victims of welfare cuts <pause dur="0.5"/> # to a concern with <pause dur="0.3"/> junior doctors <pause dur="0.4"/> # as victims of a pernicious <pause dur="0.3"/> system <pause dur="2.2"/> and in addition to that <pause dur="0.5"/> a sense of the junior doctors themselves <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> # being situated as victims <pause dur="0.3"/> there's another sense that they they have to <trunc>en</trunc> <pause dur="0.5"/> <trunc>e</trunc> endure and suffer the weight <pause dur="0.3"/> of their generation <pause dur="0.3"/> of a kind of depoliticized <pause dur="0.5"/> # generation that doesn't have <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> # direction <pause dur="0.9"/> as i said much of what i'll say about Cardiac Arrest can be extrapolated <pause dur="0.6"/> # and applied to other <pause dur="0.4"/> # nineties medical dramas <pause dur="0.7"/> and indeed instances of the <pause dur="0.3"/> # professional <pause dur="0.4"/> genre <pause dur="2.1"/> what interests me about this programme is the way that it self-consciously adopts # a radical <pause dur="0.4"/> formal a narrative rhetoric <pause dur="0.5"/> while abandoning <pause dur="0.3"/> our previous <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="1.0"/> # we might call <trunc>ol</trunc> old-fashioned # political <pause dur="0.2"/> commitments <pause dur="0.3"/> so in a sense i think it's <pause dur="0.2"/> # not so <trunc>n</trunc> so much conservative or 
reactionary but it doesn't really have an alternative <pause dur="0.3"/> to its # <pause dur="0.9"/> # to its <trunc>n</trunc> # cynicism and and in some ways # # nihilism <pause dur="3.2"/> okay i'm going to give you some discursive contexts <pause dur="0.4"/> for <pause dur="0.2"/> # the medical drama in the nineteen-nineties <pause dur="0.6"/> # in other words ways of <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> these were ways of thinking about # <pause dur="1.3"/> # health care <pause dur="0.3"/> and the politics of health care in the world in general not just in the <trunc>t</trunc> in the television medical drama but in the world <pause dur="0.7"/> now clearly the <trunc>n</trunc> <pause dur="0.8"/> the biggest <pause dur="0.2"/> or the most <trunc>im</trunc> significant <trunc>di</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> discursive context is <pause dur="0.3"/> that of privatization <pause dur="0.6"/> okay so in the nineteen-eighties there was <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> considerable anxiety <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="1.4"/> about the # <pause dur="1.6"/> well the anxiety and and fear about the possible privatization <pause dur="0.4"/> # the creeping by the back door privatization <pause dur="0.4"/> of # <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> that may have been put in place by the Conservative Party <pause dur="0.7"/> indeed privatization was indicative and <pause dur="0.5"/> # closely connected to Margaret Thatcher's <pause dur="0.4"/> Conservative Party <pause dur="0.4"/> # rhetoric <pause dur="1.4"/> now this <pause dur="0.9"/> sense that <pause dur="0.5"/> this idea that the the N-H-S the National Health Service could would be <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> 
interfered with <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> by # the ideology of business and the market <pause dur="0.5"/> was particularly offensive <pause dur="0.4"/> for some on the political left <pause dur="0.6"/> and this was because they saw the N-H-S as strongly indicative <pause dur="0.4"/> of the potential for reforming <pause dur="0.4"/> capitalism <pause dur="1.2"/> so there's a section <pause dur="0.4"/> and and it wasn't just confined to the political left this this was also a popular perception that the <pause dur="0.3"/> N-H-S was really a symbol <pause dur="0.2"/> of the way in which capitalism could be reformed <pause dur="0.4"/> and # <pause dur="0.7"/> made into something that was caring <pause dur="0.3"/> yes that even though that that it was possible through state reform through state intervention <pause dur="0.3"/> to limit <pause dur="0.3"/> # the pernicious <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> penetration <pause dur="0.2"/> of the market <pause dur="0.5"/> and and around health care <pause dur="0.3"/> that was particularly <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> # potent <pause dur="0.3"/> because <pause dur="0.3"/> # the idea of universal provision <pause dur="0.4"/> # free health care <trunc>f</trunc> # for all <pause dur="0.4"/> was # a very potent symbol <pause dur="0.3"/> of # <pause dur="0.6"/> a kind of caring state if you like <pause dur="0.6"/> so the idea that this could be tampered with <pause dur="0.3"/> # # # # # <pause dur="0.6"/> # by the Conservative Party was particularly # offensive to some <pause dur="0.4"/> # # # people <pause dur="1.2"/> and it was also this idea of interfering <pause dur="0.4"/> with # the N-H-S <pause dur="1.0"/> 
# <pause dur="1.7"/> was also indicative of of the <trunc>f</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> of the idea that <pause dur="0.5"/> or the sense there that some on the right on the new right at least did not care <pause dur="0.6"/> yes one of the key metaphors in in in the medical drama and <pause dur="0.2"/> in these discursive contexts is the idea of caring <pause dur="0.6"/> yeah so there's a sense that the Conservative Party did not care enough <pause dur="0.5"/> about <pause dur="0.5"/> <shift feature="voice" new="laugh"/>about <shift feature="voice" new="normal"/><pause dur="0.3"/> the people or about <pause dur="0.3"/> the N-H-S <pause dur="0.3"/> particularly <pause dur="0.4"/> # in regard to those who couldn't afford private treatment and one of the recurring <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="1.1"/> # sequences in medical dramas in the nineteen-eighties at least is <pause dur="0.5"/> is <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> the question of <pause dur="0.3"/> the waiting lists of <pause dur="0.3"/> those who can't afford <pause dur="0.2"/> you know there would be characters this particularly strong in Casualty always had this <pause dur="0.3"/> Casualty in particular had a very strong <pause dur="0.4"/> # # kind of <pause dur="0.4"/> moral sense to it i wouldn't i wouldn't say it's so much political very strong moral sense that <pause dur="0.3"/> if <pause dur="0.3"/> you know you'd you'd have characters coming along and <pause dur="0.3"/> they couldn't afford <pause dur="0.4"/> # # # private health care <pause dur="0.3"/> but then there were other characters in a 
similar situation who were jumping ahead <pause dur="0.4"/> of the queue <pause dur="1.0"/> yes queue jumping <pause dur="0.2"/> because they could pay for it <pause dur="0.3"/> okay so this was seen as particularly <pause dur="0.3"/> # offensive <pause dur="0.4"/> now <pause dur="0.2"/> i'm going to be quite <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> controversial and say that <pause dur="0.7"/> to be really fair to the Conservative Party <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> # # which most people aren't these days <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> the <pause dur="0.3"/> the left had always romanticized the N-H-S <pause dur="0.5"/> and this is partly because they had a strong very potent symbolic potential <pause dur="0.4"/> as a state institution <pause dur="0.3"/> as i've said reining back <pause dur="0.3"/> the iniquitous <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> stretch and reach of capitalism <pause dur="0.3"/> and this is despite the fact that fees for medical prescriptions <pause dur="0.5"/> and other fees for for dental and optical care <pause dur="0.5"/> # were in fact introduced by the Labour government pretty soon after <pause dur="0.3"/> <trunc>he</trunc> # <pause dur="0.2"/> # the N-H-S was # founded <pause dur="2.1"/> it was also the case i think that the Conservative Party realized that it would be political suicide <pause dur="0.3"/> to privatize the N-H-S <pause dur="0.6"/> and far from deregulating and privatizing it <pause dur="0.5"/> # if that the in fact the Conservative Party did not do that <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> what we got is a <trunc>r</trunc> is a <pause dur="0.5"/> a <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> quite 
a a strong <pause dur="0.2"/> # and repeated <trunc>re</trunc> system of reregulation <pause dur="0.9"/> # and centralization of the N-H-S <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> so a lot of <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.8"/> the rhetoric of kind of # N-H-S trusts and budgets and so on and so forth this idea that one can introduce a market system was <pause dur="0.4"/> really <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> # simply <pause dur="0.4"/> about face value # on the face of it yes there was one would use the words like budget but in fact a lot of the <pause dur="0.3"/> the money was was controlled centrally <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.8"/> and and some people have said what you actually got is a kind of Soviet style <pause dur="0.5"/> # system of N-H trust that really mimicked <pause dur="0.4"/> # free market rhetoric <pause dur="1.2"/> now it's also the case that the medical industrial complex in <pause dur="0.2"/> # in <pause dur="0.4"/> well in the world and in <pause dur="0.2"/> in Britain <pause dur="0.3"/> is heavily dependant on state subsidy <pause dur="0.6"/> heavily dependant on state subsidy <pause dur="0.6"/> and that's provided through the N-H-S <pause dur="1.1"/> so any moves to privatize totally privatize the N-H-S would be economically problematic for those # multinational # companies <pause dur="1.0"/> # <pause dur="1.1"/> okay so that's one discursive contact <pause dur="0.2"/> # context <pause dur="0.9"/> it's not to deny the reality of 
shortage in the N-H-S <pause dur="0.7"/> that was reflected in various ways by medical dramas in the nineteen-eighties and Casualty as i've said regularly showcased <pause dur="0.4"/> # such issues <pause dur="0.5"/> # Casualty is very much issue <pause dur="0.4"/> led and as i've said it it it tries to encase issues in a moral rather than a political <pause dur="0.4"/> context <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="1.3"/> # although i say that # Norman Tebbit # wanted <pause dur="0.3"/> Casualty to be <pause dur="0.6"/> or <pause dur="0.2"/> or saw Casualty as indicative of the B-B-C's <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="1.8"/> <shift feature="voice" new="laugh"/>Trotskyite tendencies <shift feature="voice" new="normal"/>yes <vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" n="ss" dur="1"/> and he he was very very concerned about <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> # the sorts of <pause dur="0.2"/> images and <pause dur="0.2"/> and scenes and narrative stories that were being <pause dur="0.4"/> shown on Casualty <pause dur="2.0"/> so it's not to deny the reality of difficultive cuts and shortage in the N-H-S <pause dur="0.4"/> but to know that the political reality was more complex <pause dur="0.3"/> than was dramatized in even the most overtly critical dramas <pause dur="1.1"/> instead these dramas and Casualty is <trunc>m</trunc> a sort of main example <pause dur="0.6"/> # redirected their critical energy to aspects of medical culture <pause dur="4.5"/> because these aspects of medical culture were indicative <pause dur="0.5"/> of # the momentum for 
privatization <pause dur="0.8"/> what i mean by medical culture <pause dur="0.6"/> is <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="1.2"/> and it's very similar in the in the cop show genre as well <pause dur="0.4"/> # the question of <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> the macho <pause dur="0.3"/> yes <pause dur="0.3"/> the quest the issue of # <pause dur="1.4"/> consultants and doctors <pause dur="0.2"/> not treating their patients as human beings yes <pause dur="0.9"/> as <pause dur="0.2"/> # treating them as vehicles for disease and vehicles for treatment rather than as <pause dur="0.2"/> <trunc>a</trunc> as <trunc>a</trunc> as as people rather than caring for them <pause dur="0.3"/> and this has become quite a big issue certainly toward the end of the nineteen-eighties <pause dur="0.5"/> and in <pause dur="0.2"/> # the nineteen-nineties so that <pause dur="0.3"/> a lot of # health policy <pause dur="0.3"/><vocal desc="sniff" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> even the most recent # Frank Dobson's # <pause dur="0.8"/> # paper <pause dur="0.4"/> # talks about <pause dur="0.2"/> you know we should stop the consultants being so snobbish towards their <pause dur="0.4"/> # patients we should make them <pause dur="0.4"/> # # treat treatment should be about manners in a way and the courtesy that should be extended to the <pause dur="0.3"/> consumer or to the customer or to the patient <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> so <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="1.2"/> in a way it's easier to dramatize and visualize those <trunc>a</trunc> aspects of culture <pause dur="0.2"/> than it is to go into <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> kind of the <pause dur="0.2"/> # quite 
complicated economic reality whereby the N-H-S subsidizes <pause dur="0.3"/> # a medical industrial complex it's rather difficult to imagine how that could be visualized yeah <pause dur="0.6"/> whereas it's rather easy to <pause dur="0.2"/> to visualize <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> # a kind of a consultant surgeon <pause dur="0.6"/> # being a bit <pause dur="0.4"/> # superior to <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> the mother of a of of an ill child or something like that that's <trunc>gr</trunc> reasonably easy <pause dur="0.3"/> to put on the screen <pause dur="0.6"/> # <trunc>o</trunc> <pause dur="1.2"/> okay <pause dur="0.6"/> now one example of this <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="1.0"/> of television's <pause dur="0.8"/> interest and concern with medical culture <pause dur="0.6"/> is a programme called The Nation's Health <pause dur="1.2"/> this was a series of four documentaries <pause dur="0.6"/> # written by G F Newman <pause dur="0.6"/> and shown on Channel Four in nineteen-eighty-two <pause dur="1.8"/> and <trunc>th</trunc> this The Nation's Health was seen as <pause dur="0.6"/> as very very critical <pause dur="0.4"/> of # the medical establishment <pause dur="0.5"/> Anne Karpf <pause dur="0.3"/> in her book # Doctoring the Media <pause dur="0.5"/> says that The Nation's Health <pause dur="0.3"/> was a watershed in medical television <pause dur="0.4"/> because it directly subverted <pause dur="0.4"/> the address of all that went before <pause dur="0.9"/> this is a quote from <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> <trunc>ne</trunc> # # Anne Karpf <pause dur="0.9"/> and she says <reading>Newman delivered an almost

and she manages to do it <pause dur="1.2"/> okay <pause dur="0.2"/> so there's <pause dur="0.8"/> Cardiac Arrest repeats the example from <pause dur="0.4"/> # The Nation's Health but within another context and the context is the supervision and training of junior doctors <pause dur="0.3"/> so this change from a wider interest <pause dur="0.5"/> # from interest in the wider implications for society <pause dur="0.5"/> # for patients <pause dur="0.8"/> and for doctors of of privatization <pause dur="0.5"/> is refocused in Cardiac Arrest to an exclusive more or less exclusive concern <pause dur="0.4"/> with the treatment and well-being <pause dur="0.4"/> of the next generation <pause dur="0.3"/> of doctors <pause dur="3.5"/> now when it began in nineteen-ninety-three Cardiac Arrest self-consciously situated itself in relation to <pause dur="0.4"/> <trunc>s</trunc> # G F Newman's # The Nation's Health <pause dur="0.5"/> and the writer Jed Mercurio <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> he uses the # pseudonym # <pause dur="0.2"/> John MacUre <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> in <pause dur="0.2"/> just before the first episode explicitly situated # # his <pause dur="0.3"/> his programme Cardiac Arrest in relation to <pause dur="0.3"/> # The Nation's Health <pause dur="0.3"/> and said Newman's The Nation's Health you know did very well in eighty-two but it needs updating <pause dur="0.4"/> you know more than ten years later it needs updating for the 
nineteen-nineties <pause dur="2.5"/> so <pause dur="0.5"/> the most similar concerns in Cardiac Arrest are unsatisfactory medical culture <pause dur="0.9"/> still remains central concern <pause dur="0.4"/> but other discursive contexts <pause dur="0.2"/> updated <pause dur="0.4"/> # discursive contexts are now regularly <pause dur="0.3"/> # offered <pause dur="1.1"/> now some of these contexts can be detected in other genres such as the crime genre <pause dur="0.4"/> so # and i'll talk about that in a minute <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="1.1"/> well i'll talk about it now <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="1.6"/> so other <trunc>th</trunc> things that you'd see in other professional genres # <pause dur="0.2"/> # # and you you see in the medical drama as well things about equal opportunities yes <pause dur="0.6"/> in Cardiac Arrest <pause dur="0.5"/> # you'll see Claire Maitland and her immediate superior arguing about <pause dur="0.4"/> you know what it is to be a woman <pause dur="0.3"/> in # in the N-H-S in the nineties and how <pause dur="0.4"/> you know they have to behave # very very strictly in a very strict professional manner <pause dur="0.5"/> # so equal <trunc>opportunit</trunc> and you see that also of course in the crime genre if you look at things like <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.9"/> well Prime Suspect being the obvious one <pause dur="0.5"/> # Between the Lines things like that <pause dur="0.6"/> also # <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> questions of 
race <pause dur="0.2"/> are are returned to <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> in <trunc>i</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> in Cardiac Arrest <pause dur="1.0"/> but there are others <pause dur="0.3"/> that are really specific <pause dur="0.3"/> # to the medical drama and to Cardiac Arrest <pause dur="0.5"/> okay first of all is the way that privatization issues of privatization <pause dur="0.4"/> and the kind of culture of the N-H-S <pause dur="0.8"/> is # <pause dur="0.2"/> understood through ideas of new management <pause dur="1.1"/> the hospital manager <pause dur="0.4"/> is a kind of new figure <pause dur="0.4"/> # who arrives # # in the nineteen-nineties <pause dur="0.3"/> now hospital managers <pause dur="0.3"/> are generally are <pause dur="0.2"/> generally speaking are presented as a pernicious <pause dur="0.7"/> presence <pause dur="0.3"/> in the hospital <pause dur="1.2"/> they are interfering without any professional knowledge of medicine <pause dur="0.6"/> they're fuelled by the ideology <pause dur="0.4"/> and management speak of private business from which they were recruited <pause dur="1.5"/> and their attempts to import that business culture <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.9"/> into the running of the hospital <pause dur="0.4"/> is <pause dur="0.6"/> shown as directly hostile to the requirements of adequate and professional medical care <pause dur="2.1"/> now <pause dur="0.7"/> interestingly Cardiac Arrest takes this development a stage further <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="3.9"/> and says well it's not just it's not just inappropriate people 
from business who are being recruited to run the hospital but it's sort of anyone but doctors <pause dur="0.6"/> yes <pause dur="0.5"/> so in a sequence that was used to trail an episode in the second series the older consultant Ernest Docherty <pause dur="1.0"/> # the old chap <pause dur="0.8"/> recognizes the new <pause dur="0.2"/> and very young manager in the corridor the manager's about eighteen years old <pause dur="0.8"/> okay <pause dur="0.9"/> # to no one in particular but really sort of to the camera he says <pause dur="0.2"/> yesterday he was on the checkout in the canteen <pause dur="0.2"/> today he's running the hospital <pause dur="0.8"/> yes so the inference is <pause dur="0.2"/> is kind of clear <pause dur="0.3"/> from that <pause dur="0.3"/> # # # exchange that <pause dur="0.6"/> kind <pause dur="0.4"/> # professional paternal experience exemplified by Docherty <pause dur="0.3"/> counts for nothing <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> but youth in a suit <pause dur="0.4"/> you know that's the future that's the future of <pause dur="0.3"/> # hospital management <pause dur="2.1"/> okay so that's one <pause dur="0.3"/> discursive context <pause dur="1.8"/> # now clearly that goes out of control a little bit in Cardiac Arrest toward the end <pause dur="0.2"/> # where the hospital manager himself gets suspended and there's this kind of Foucaultian sense that you don't know where power is <pause dur="0.3"/> yeah so they 
have to bring in some lord <pause dur="0.3"/> governor from that we've never seen before <pause dur="0.2"/> in order to sort out the <pause dur="0.3"/> the power conflicts in the hospital <pause dur="0.2"/> so even the managers themselves <pause dur="0.3"/> are getting <pause dur="0.3"/> are kind of # accountable to some unseen force <pause dur="0.5"/> yes that comes from outside the hospital <pause dur="1.5"/> # now the other discursive context is public relations P-R <pause dur="0.2"/> in the hospital <pause dur="2.9"/> the importance of P-R for the hospital is also indicative of its transition to a business culture <pause dur="1.1"/> so Cardiac Arrest staff are regularly suspended <pause dur="0.3"/> for going to the newspapers to tell stories <pause dur="0.3"/> of mistreatment <pause dur="1.7"/> there's # an anxiety about the prospect of medical incompetence being leaked to the press <pause dur="0.5"/> and that kind of looms over nearly every medical decision <pause dur="1.4"/> there's also the issue of H-I-V <pause dur="0.3"/> the revelation that some medical staff <pause dur="0.4"/> have # # H-I-V <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> and there were kind of regular dramatizations of parents <pause dur="0.2"/> # # sorry of patients finding this out that they've been treated by someone <pause dur="0.5"/> # with # H-I-V and then <pause dur="0.4"/> # # kind of complaining about it <pause dur="0.4"/> so for 
British medical dramas and that sort of indicates the way that British medical dramas <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> are starting to pick up on that danger and anxiety about litigation <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> relatively recent in Chicago Hope it's more or less the norm <pause dur="0.5"/> that patients are expected to sue <pause dur="0.4"/> # their doctors <pause dur="0.3"/> # it's relatively recent in the British # # medical drama <pause dur="1.0"/> so this prospect of litigation <pause dur="0.2"/> further <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> enhances and intensifies that conflict between doctor and patient <pause dur="0.4"/> yes <pause dur="0.2"/> we saw the conflict being <pause dur="0.2"/> described in <pause dur="0.3"/> The Nation's Health in terms of <pause dur="0.4"/> kind of a macho culture and a and a disdain for the patient <pause dur="0.6"/> but now it's it's # more professionalized it's almost it's about <pause dur="0.4"/> you know can i sue you if you do something wrong so every decision <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="1.0"/> every medical decision has a kind of that kind of anxiety hanging over its shoulder <pause dur="0.2"/> and of course there's a relation <pause dur="0.4"/> i mean these programmes use news stories as plot stimulants so <pause dur="0.8"/> there is a relation to <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> more recent cases and we're getting a lot more of these cases of <trunc>d</trunc> of <pause dur="0.2"/> surgeons 
for examples in Bristol <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> not # <pause dur="0.5"/> meeting their quality targets <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="1.2"/> and clearly that's going to # continue <pause dur="3.1"/> so all of these matters <trunc>pe</trunc> # and the final discursive context i'll return to that a bit more in the seminars is rationing N-H-S rationing <pause dur="0.6"/> okay <pause dur="0.4"/> so <pause dur="0.3"/> this is about the question about <pause dur="0.3"/> who deserves treatment first <pause dur="0.5"/> yes if one has to prioritize <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> health care and medical attention <pause dur="0.6"/> which patient deserves treatment <pause dur="0.4"/> and which patient doesn't <pause dur="0.2"/> now clearly in the outside world <pause dur="0.3"/> there are issues about <pause dur="0.4"/> for example sex change operations and cosmetic surgery <pause dur="0.3"/> and <pause dur="0.7"/> further down you know do you operate on a smoker or someone who's eaten fresh fruit and vegetables all their life <pause dur="0.4"/> all this kind of <pause dur="0.3"/> issue about <pause dur="0.2"/> choices <pause dur="0.3"/> yes <pause dur="0.2"/> in the N-H-S <pause dur="0.2"/> and this feeds in <pause dur="0.5"/> to # medical dramas <pause dur="0.3"/> and into Cardiac Arrest <pause dur="4.5"/> okay so those are the discursive contexts <pause dur="2.2"/> now i want to talk a bit more about <pause dur="0.2"/> # Cardiac Arrest and genre <pause dur="0.8"/> because i think the change in Cardiac Arrest from attention to # <pause dur="0.9"/> issues 
around welfare cuts in the welfare state <pause dur="0.3"/> to <trunc>m</trunc> <pause dur="0.5"/> to something that's more focused on the welfare of junior doctors <pause dur="0.9"/> that shift of attention <pause dur="0.9"/> is also in <trunc>ta</trunc> in parallel with a a another shift of attention that happens in other genres <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> and that's toward an interest in the details of professionalism <pause dur="0.5"/> to the details of professional <pause dur="0.3"/> life <pause dur="0.9"/> or more specifically <pause dur="0.3"/> the way in which professional procedure <pause dur="0.4"/> the rules <pause dur="0.2"/> the laws the manners <pause dur="0.4"/> # the conduct of <pause dur="0.4"/> # professionals <pause dur="0.3"/> becomes central to the content <pause dur="0.3"/> of many television programmes <pause dur="0.9"/> in other words the interest of these programmes is in the way that these professional codes of conduct <pause dur="0.4"/> are mediated through individual <pause dur="0.2"/> characters <pause dur="1.5"/> and examples of the sort of professional genre would be The Bill <pause dur="1.2"/> a lot of The Bill is spent lot of characters in time in The Bill is spent with characters discussing the <pause dur="0.2"/> the what they can and can't do <pause dur="0.5"/> yes the rules of conduct yes what's appropriate to do Casualty clearly <pause dur="0.6"/> # London's Burning <pause dur="0.5"/> # the professional genres <trunc>ge</trunc> genres about <pause dur="0.4"/> 
professional <pause dur="0.5"/> # # people <pause dur="0.2"/> and in general that <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> in the earlier nineties that's concerned with the emergency services <pause dur="0.2"/> clearly now it's being <pause dur="0.3"/> # # opened up a bit and and <trunc>g</trunc> and generalized <pause dur="2.9"/> so this and in other words the turn toward the spectacularization of professional discourse takes place in the early nineties <pause dur="0.9"/> and is # as i've said initially concerned with the <pause dur="0.7"/> emergency services in in drama <pause dur="0.4"/> and later on in the documentary genres <pause dur="0.9"/> now <pause dur="0.8"/> this is # <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> in the medical drama <pause dur="1.7"/> this spectacularization of # professionalism <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> is <pause dur="1.2"/> # part of one mode <pause dur="0.3"/> of <pause dur="0.2"/> # # # <pause dur="0.5"/> of the narrative <pause dur="0.3"/> the other mode <pause dur="0.2"/> is is something that's more action based <pause dur="0.3"/> okay <pause dur="0.3"/> so what i want to think about is <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="1.1"/> if you like different modes of <distinct lang="fr">mise en scène</distinct> <pause dur="1.8"/> <trunc>diffe</trunc> it's almost different styles <pause dur="1.4"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> on the one hand there's the style <pause dur="0.2"/> # there's the mode which i call reflection <pause dur="0.2"/> which is more concerned with the <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> spectacle of <pause dur="0.2"/> # # professional discourse mediated through characters <pause dur="0.4"/> on the other hand there's the mode of action <pause dur="0.3"/> 
which generally speaking is the <pause dur="0.3"/> immediate and intense delivery of of health care to casualty <pause dur="0.4"/> # patients <pause dur="3.4"/> and these modes are attached to setting they're generally specific to one place the hospital <pause dur="0.3"/> or less frequently the character sometimes <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> characters <pause dur="0.2"/> it's quite rare in <pause dur="0.2"/> in <pause dur="0.3"/> in <pause dur="0.3"/> ward based medical dramas like <pause dur="0.5"/> # E-R and Chicago Hope and Cardiac Arrest <pause dur="0.5"/> but sometimes the characters <pause dur="0.4"/> you know <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> Doctor Greene will <pause dur="0.4"/> will <pause dur="0.4"/> go shopping or something and <pause dur="0.5"/> and <pause dur="0.3"/> and sort of take the two modes with him so there'll be modes of action and reflection but they've taken outside the hospital and that's quite rare <pause dur="1.8"/> # <pause dur="1.1"/> indeed <trunc>w</trunc> <pause dur="0.4"/> <trunc>w</trunc> <pause dur="0.3"/> the space where <pause dur="0.2"/> the two modes <pause dur="0.2"/> kind of the transition from one mode to the other <pause dur="0.3"/> where that takes place is the hospital corridor <pause dur="1.0"/> and Anne Karpf in the late eighties in her book # Doctoring the Media <pause dur="0.4"/> argues that the <pause dur="0.4"/> the corridor <pause dur="0.4"/> it becomes a central place in the # in the in the television medical drama where <pause dur="0.2"/> anything could happen there's a kind of unexpected <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> things # happening in the 
periphery or in the background of a shot could suddenly become important <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="2.0"/> and clearly one of the <trunc>ke</trunc> you know the <trunc>k</trunc> the the <pause dur="0.2"/> # the sort of classic <pause dur="0.4"/> # icons of the genre is the is the <pause dur="0.3"/> is the the stretcher on a trolley bursting through swing doors <pause dur="0.4"/> yes that's one of the key ways <pause dur="0.3"/> in which we see the transition from reflection <pause dur="0.4"/> to an action mode <pause dur="0.5"/> okay <pause dur="3.1"/> so just to recap by reflection i'm referring i'm concerned with sequences where medical staff are discussing <pause dur="0.3"/> whatever is of narrative importance either between themselves or with the patients <pause dur="0.8"/> so this mode is therefore evident <pause dur="0.4"/> by heavy reliance on dialogue <pause dur="0.9"/> and it's often stylistically nondescript <pause dur="0.7"/> concerned as it is with relaying standard delivered performances <pause dur="0.9"/> the action mode re-energizes style <pause dur="0.4"/> and depicts the urgent treatment of medical cases <pause dur="1.7"/> and various <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> styles are recruited to emphasize the contingency <pause dur="0.4"/> the immediacy and the urgency of those cases <pause dur="1.9"/> in fact in that transition to action mode <pause dur="0.4"/> # the ward based medical dramas delight <pause dur="0.3"/> in foregrounding

kind of a limit to those special effects <pause dur="0.9"/> i guess limits of taste <pause dur="1.1"/> # <pause dur="0.8"/> so well the sense of <pause dur="0.2"/> of that # <pause dur="1.2"/> action mode is <pause dur="0.4"/> is not really of an ordered procedure but more one of confusion <pause dur="0.9"/> and there's also the sense that the patients are resisting <pause dur="0.4"/> there's there's <pause dur="1.0"/> a <pause dur="0.3"/> a kind of # <pause dur="0.2"/> a frequently used <pause dur="0.6"/> # shot of patient attached to lots of lines and then moving around <pause dur="0.7"/> yeah sort of struggling against it <pause dur="0.5"/> sort of <pause dur="0.8"/> you know it's quite a potent image because it signals a sense of needles moving around in the skin the possibility of yes attachment to <pause dur="0.5"/> # # kind of <pause dur="0.2"/> # # # drugs and things <pause dur="2.5"/> and of course the outcome of those scenes of action scenes <pause dur="0.8"/> has a greater impact on the doctor and the hospital rather than the patient generally speaking we don't follow up <pause dur="0.5"/> # what happens to the patient in any real detail the exception of course in Cardiac Arrest <pause dur="0.4"/> is the boy who's waiting for <pause dur="0.4"/> # dialysis # # for a <trunc>k</trunc> a kidney # donation <pause dur="0.3"/> # that's rather unusual <pause dur="0.4"/> to keep returning to one patient again and again <pause dur="0.3"/> clearly

kind of <pause dur="0.2"/> more radical than that <pause dur="0.5"/> it could be when the junior member catches out the senior member breaking the rules <pause dur="0.4"/> or bending them <pause dur="0.3"/> to their own liking <pause dur="0.3"/> and that often happens in that privatization <trunc>con</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> context <pause dur="0.3"/> so you get a competent junior <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="4.1"/> talking to a <pause dur="0.5"/> a competent <pause dur="0.5"/> # # senior saying <pause dur="0.2"/> in fact you're bending the rules around here <pause dur="0.8"/> yes you're not doing things as you should and that happens a lot in Cardiac Arrest obviously <pause dur="0.6"/><vocal desc="sniff" iterated="n"/><pause dur="2.5"/> so what's crucial is is the discrepancy in that exchange is the discrepancy between how things should be done the real this is how we do things around here <pause dur="0.4"/> and the <trunc>offi</trunc> <pause dur="0.3"/> if you like the official version <pause dur="0.2"/> and the actual practice <pause dur="2.6"/> okay <pause dur="1.1"/><vocal desc="sniff" iterated="n"/><pause dur="5.0"/> obviously the other one is equal <pause dur="0.4"/> equal rank to equal rank <pause dur="0.2"/> i've got handouts of this so you can <pause dur="0.8"/><kinesic desc="writes on transparency" iterated="y" dur="4"/> so junior to junior <pause dur="1.4"/> to finish it up <pause dur="0.2"/> senior <pause dur="0.2"/> to senior <pause dur="1.3"/> 'cause these people are ranked equally and this is often a source of disagreement and conflict yes <pause dur="0.4"/> this is the way we do things around here no it 
isn't we do it this way <pause dur="0.4"/> they're both of the same rank <pause dur="0.2"/> yes <pause dur="0.9"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> but the disagreements are likely to be caused by personal conflict <pause dur="0.7"/> so <pause dur="0.4"/> this equal to equal <pause dur="0.4"/> <trunc>e</trunc> exchange <pause dur="0.2"/> is likely to be particularly <pause dur="0.3"/> potent # # <pause dur="0.3"/> if the equals are sleeping together <pause dur="0.5"/> yeah which they often are <pause dur="0.2"/> in those sorts of exchanges <pause dur="0.3"/> and in fact <pause dur="0.3"/> personal relationships start disrupting <pause dur="0.3"/> all of these exchanges <pause dur="0.3"/> so senior to junior where the senior is <pause dur="0.3"/> having a relationship with a junior <pause dur="0.2"/> has that kind of second level <pause dur="0.3"/> second order level <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> beneath it <pause dur="0.4"/> i'll show you an example of it <pause dur="0.5"/> this is an example of a senior <pause dur="0.3"/> to junior <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="2.1"/> address <pause dur="0.3"/> but clearly it also has this other second order <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> structure to it <pause dur="0.3"/> because <pause dur="0.6"/> they're lovers as well <pause dur="0.9"/> okay <pause dur="3.4"/> and again it starts off <pause dur="0.2"/> this is how we do things around here <pause dur="0.5"/> yeah <event desc="starts video" iterated="n"/></u><gap reason="break in recording" extent="uncertain"/><kinesic desc="video plays" iterated="y" dur="51"/><event desc="stops video" iterated="n" n="nm0063"/> <u who="nm0063" trans="pause"> so <pause dur="0.2"/> clearly the relationship changes <pause dur="0.4"/> the point when he says masterful it changes from that senior to junior level to <trunc>v</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> one of equal to equal yeah they're equal in the bed in the sack as it were <pause dur="1.2"/> 
okay <pause dur="1.2"/> now <pause dur="0.2"/> this relationship is further complicated by another <pause dur="1.3"/><kinesic desc="turns on overhead projector showing transparency" iterated="n"/> factor <pause dur="0.5"/> and that is that each of their as i've as i've mentioned at the bottom each of <pause dur="0.3"/> the senior and juniors can be good or bad <pause dur="0.2"/> very very schematic i know <pause dur="0.3"/> but can have <pause dur="0.4"/> positive or negative <pause dur="0.5"/> # characteristics <pause dur="1.7"/> so it's entirely possible for a competent senior <pause dur="0.2"/> doctor for example like Adrian <trunc>devre</trunc> DeVries to be a bad character <pause dur="0.4"/> generally speaking bad characters went to public school <pause dur="1.0"/> <shift feature="voice" new="laugh"/>yes <pause dur="0.7"/> <shift feature="voice" new="normal"/>they # belong to that older <trunc>ma</trunc> machismo culture <pause dur="0.6"/> that doesn't care <pause dur="0.3"/> about <pause dur="0.4"/> # the patients <pause dur="0.5"/> yes <pause dur="0.7"/> # it's again it's this level of care if there's a low level of personal investment in the patient <pause dur="0.8"/> the lower that level is <pause dur="0.3"/> the more the the <pause dur="0.2"/> the the particular doctor will be seen as <pause dur="0.4"/> a as a bad doctor however competent <pause dur="0.3"/> and clearly the Baxendale character's very very interesting in this respect <pause dur="0.2"/> 'cause she's very competent <pause dur="0.5"/> yes in what she does <pause dur="0.4"/> but her level of care of personal investment <pause dur="0.4"/> is quite <pause dur="0.5"/> quite low <pause dur="0.2"/> on the other hand she's a recurring <pause dur="0.5"/>

often senior like Graham Turner and Adrian DeVries <pause dur="1.0"/> and as i said the bad aspects of their characters generally come from that public school education and also their interest in private practice <pause dur="0.4"/> the result <pause dur="0.3"/> no human concern with the patient's welfare <pause dur="1.4"/> what you tend to get <pause dur="0.2"/> throughout the series is a move from <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.8"/> # from different positions yes <pause dur="0.2"/> both as we saw there within <pause dur="0.2"/> particular scenes and also the long term of the series <pause dur="0.9"/> # <pause dur="0.9"/> so as i've said Helen Baxendale's character moves from being competent and bad to competent and good <pause dur="0.4"/> Scissors for example is <trunc>comp</trunc> is good and good yeah he's competent and he's good <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> # the <pause dur="0.2"/> the <pause dur="0.5"/> the younger character Andrew yeah <pause dur="0.3"/> is sometimes incompetent but always <pause dur="0.5"/> yeah always a good character <pause dur="6.8"/> so these <trunc>ref</trunc> moments of reflection modes of reflection stage the tension between maintaining the stability of professional procedure <pause dur="0.4"/> and a satisfactory personal life <pause dur="1.8"/> the second the satisfactory personal life is always prioritized over <pause dur="0.4"/> 
the stability of professional procedure <pause dur="1.2"/> so doctors who can only relate to patients on a procedural level <pause dur="0.2"/> are bad <pause dur="0.3"/> doctors <pause dur="0.6"/> those who offer authentic personal investment in what they're doing <pause dur="0.3"/> are good <pause dur="2.0"/> what happens in Cardiac Arrest is that a new generation of doctors <pause dur="0.2"/> are prevented from being good <pause dur="0.3"/> by the system <pause dur="0.6"/> so they lose faith in their own ability <pause dur="0.5"/> what Cardiac and this is why the importance of training <pause dur="0.7"/> they can't be good <pause dur="0.3"/> because <pause dur="0.2"/> they're not supervised or trained to be <pause dur="0.5"/> yes <pause dur="1.1"/> they can't be competent i mean they're always good </u><gap reason="break in recording" extent="uncertain"/> <u who="nm0063" trans="pause"> i think the second tendency is generation specific there's been a lot on the news <pause dur="0.6"/> # recently about # <pause dur="0.3"/> Generation Y is it <pause dur="0.6"/> there's Generation X a sort of a new <trunc>n</trunc> study of sixteen to twenty-one year olds saying that their <pause dur="0.3"/> their aspirations are different they're supposedly ambitious <pause dur="0.6"/> # seventy-two per cent of them think that <pause dur="0.4"/> whatever they do in <pause dur="0.5"/> # <trunc>w</trunc> however they vote they'll make no impact on political life seventy-two per cent think they <trunc>c</trunc> they <trunc>c</trunc> they will make no 
impact <pause dur="1.2"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> but i think <pause dur="0.5"/> the one of the innovative things about Cardiac Arrest was the youth <pause dur="0.2"/> of the actors yes they were all in their early to mid-twenties when <pause dur="0.4"/> when it started <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> this is a quote from an interview i did with the writer with <pause dur="0.2"/> from Jed Mercurio <pause dur="1.9"/> i asked him about why the the # # <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> the <trunc>c</trunc> doctors were so young was it just realism <pause dur="1.2"/> # he said <reading>that was really apparent when we came to casting it first <pause dur="0.5"/> they</reading> <pause dur="0.2"/> meaning the production company <pause dur="0.5"/> <reading>they were thinking of people in their thirties i said no <pause dur="0.4"/> they've got to be younger for realism <pause dur="1.7"/> it was really about a twenty-something bloke <pause dur="0.3"/> where everything he'd do is life-threatening and all the women are nuts <pause dur="0.8"/> i wanted it to be really grungey <pause dur="0.7"/> Kurt Cobain killing himself</reading> and he references this as a kind of key <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="1.4"/> # event while he was writing the series <pause dur="0.6"/> <reading>really grungey about people in their mid-twenties with no sense of belonging <pause dur="0.6"/> that's what i thought the series was about but the producers didn't get it</reading> <pause dur="0.4"/> and the producer's # <pause dur="0.3"/> is Tony Garnett <pause dur="0.4"/> 
yes <pause dur="0.6"/> there's this kind of rather interesting <pause dur="0.4"/> disagreement <pause dur="0.2"/> # between Mercurio the writer and Tony Garnett <pause dur="0.5"/> now <pause dur="0.4"/> you probably know that Cardiac Arrest began <pause dur="0.4"/> as an advertisement i think in the British Medical Journal or the Lancet asking for <pause dur="0.2"/> a junior doctor <pause dur="0.6"/> who would want who would <pause dur="0.5"/> does anyone want to write for television for a T-V sitcom a T-V comedy about <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> hospitals <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> # Mercurio applied and got the job <pause dur="0.5"/> # but wanted it to be <pause dur="0.4"/> something different something <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> more realistic <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="2.4"/> in in particular # i'll show you he's in the in in the documentary i'm going to show you <pause dur="0.3"/> but in particular he's very influenced by the Hill Street Blues <pause dur="0.3"/> idea of a kind of grainy <pause dur="0.4"/> # # # realism <pause dur="1.4"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> so <pause dur="0.3"/> in a way <pause dur="0.9"/><vocal desc="laugh" iterated="n"/> you know Mercurio was a junior doctor <pause dur="0.3"/><shift feature="voice" new="laugh"/> yes <shift feature="voice" new="normal"/><pause dur="0.3"/> he <pause dur="0.3"/> # part of the way the programme is sold is through the fact that it's authentic because he's lived it
