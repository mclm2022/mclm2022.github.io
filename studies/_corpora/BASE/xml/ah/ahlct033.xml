it hooks up with <pause dur="1.1"/> and we finished off last week by looking at three <pause dur="0.3"/> worries <pause dur="0.2"/> with that kind of <pause dur="0.4"/> Millian theory of names <pause dur="0.6"/> anyone want to remind me <pause dur="0.9"/> what the problems were </u><pause dur="3.5"/> <u who="sm0100" trans="pause"> i don't know fake names like <pause dur="0.5"/> <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/></u><pause dur="0.3"/> <u who="nf0098" trans="pause"> exactly right <pause dur="0.2"/> not <pause dur="0.4"/> tend to call them empty names </u><u who="sm0100" trans="overlap"> empty names </u><u who="nf0098" trans="pause"> names that don't have anything relating to them in the world exactly right <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> <pause dur="0.7"/> problem with empty names <pause dur="3.6"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="4"/> # there was a problem with <pause dur="0.6"/> how we decide on the <pause dur="0.4"/> denotation remember <pause dur="0.2"/> the Millian difference between denotation and connotation <pause dur="0.4"/> denotation being the object in the world <pause dur="0.4"/> connotation being a kind of a property <pause dur="0.6"/> # and if we think that names are things which just have denotation and don't have connotation <pause dur="0.4"/> we've got a trouble <pause dur="0.5"/> on <pause dur="0.9"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="11"/> settling or determining <pause dur="1.0"/> the referent <pause dur="2.8"/> how do we find out what thing it is in the world that the name is supposed to hook up with anyway <pause dur="0.9"/> and one more problem <pause dur="0.4"/> anyone remind me of a last problem </u><pause dur="0.4"/> <u who="sm0102" trans="pause"> the Hesperus and Phosphorus <pause dur="0.2"/> problem </u><u who="nf0098" trans="overlap"> Hesperus and Phosphorus exactly right there's a 
problem <pause dur="1.0"/> with what i called cognitive difference <pause dur="4.0"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="6"/> okay <pause dur="1.2"/> and that was the worry about <pause dur="0.5"/> think if <pause dur="0.2"/> all there is to the meaning of a name is <pause dur="0.2"/> just the thing in the world that it hooks up with <pause dur="0.4"/> how do we explain the fact that sometimes <vocal desc="sniff" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.4"/> # you can not realize that fact <pause dur="1.0"/> sometimes you can think things like <pause dur="0.3"/> Hesperus is not Phosphorus <pause dur="0.8"/> even though in fact those two names pick out exactly the same object in the world <pause dur="1.7"/> okay and it's this problem <pause dur="0.2"/> the problem of so-called cognitive difference <pause dur="0.3"/> that we're going to concentrate on <pause dur="0.3"/> for the next sort of week and a half <pause dur="0.8"/><vocal desc="sniff" iterated="n"/> and we're going to concentrate on it because <pause dur="1.8"/> this <pause dur="0.2"/> kind of problem <pause dur="0.4"/> was first brought to the fore <pause dur="0.2"/> and made most of by <pause dur="0.4"/> Frege <pause dur="0.8"/> so we're going to see <pause dur="0.3"/> how Frege <pause dur="0.2"/> established this problem <pause dur="0.5"/> and what sort of theory <pause dur="0.2"/> it led him <pause dur="0.3"/> to develop for names <pause dur="0.2"/> it's going to be a non-Millian theory of names that Frege developed <pause dur="0.3"/> in response <pause dur="0.3"/> to this kind of worry <pause dur="1.9"/> okay then so what exactly is the problem <pause dur="0.2"/> of cognitive difference 
then what is the worry <pause dur="0.2"/> here <pause dur="1.1"/> well i've said on the handout <pause dur="1.0"/> some sentences which state sameness of referent <pause dur="0.3"/> like <pause dur="0.2"/> Cicero is Cicero <pause dur="0.4"/> or the first postmaster general was the first postmaster general <pause dur="0.4"/> seem very uninformative <pause dur="0.3"/><vocal desc="sniff" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.3"/> you know if i stand up here and lecture to you and tell you <pause dur="0.4"/> hey Cicero was Cicero <pause dur="0.8"/> you're going to think you're being <pause dur="0.3"/> sold short <pause dur="0.2"/> you know that's not particularly informative or useful thing <pause dur="0.6"/> # for a university education to equip you with <pause dur="0.4"/> but <pause dur="0.2"/> on the other hand <pause dur="0.4"/> if i stand up here and tell you <pause dur="0.8"/> Cicero <pause dur="0.2"/> was Tully <pause dur="1.0"/> or <pause dur="0.4"/> the first postmaster general <pause dur="0.4"/> was <pause dur="0.2"/> the inventor of bifocals <pause dur="0.6"/> or even <pause dur="0.3"/> Abraham Lincoln <pause dur="0.5"/> was the first postmaster general <pause dur="0.4"/> or <pause dur="0.3"/> the first <pause dur="0.2"/> # the inventor of bifocals <pause dur="0.5"/> you've learned something useful <pause dur="0.6"/> right <pause dur="1.9"/> fairly useful anyway <pause dur="0.2"/> seems like taxpayers' money is not going to waste here you've learned something <pause dur="0.4"/> got a useful fact to take away with you <pause dur="0.3"/> but how can the Millian explain something like that <pause dur="2.6"/> because according to the Millian <pause dur="0.2"/> the meaning of the name is 
entirely given by its referent <event desc="student enters room" iterated="n" n="sm0103"/> hello <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> <pause dur="1.1"/> recovered from your hangover leaving the union at two o'clock in the morning <vocal desc="laughter" n="sl" iterated="y" dur="1"/> </u><pause dur="0.4"/> <u who="sm0103" trans="pause"> yes </u><pause dur="0.3"/> <u who="nf0098" trans="pause"> yes <vocal desc="laughter" n="ss" iterated="y" dur="1"/> very good and it's only taken you till two o'clock the next day that's fantastic <vocal desc="laughter" n="sl" iterated="y" dur="1"/> <pause dur="0.9"/> # <pause dur="1.1"/> so if the Millian is going to tell you <pause dur="0.3"/> that the meaning of the name <pause dur="0.6"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="n"/> oh <pause dur="1.0"/> can't believe it i got a new pen the other day and it's run out already <pause dur="1.0"/> # the meaning of the name <pause dur="0.5"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="21"/> Cicero <pause dur="0.2"/> is just given <pause dur="5.6"/> by your little <pause dur="0.9"/> Greek orator <pause dur="1.2"/> there he is <pause dur="0.5"/> meaning of the name Cicero given by your Greek orator <pause dur="1.0"/> how does he <pause dur="0.2"/> explain the fact <pause dur="0.7"/> that it can be useful then to learn <pause dur="0.3"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="4"/> that Cicero <pause dur="0.9"/> is Tully <pause dur="2.2"/> because if the meaning of those two names is entirely given <pause dur="0.5"/> by the object they pick out in the world <pause dur="0.4"/> then <pause dur="0.4"/> you know how is one any more informative <pause dur="0.2"/> than the other <pause dur="0.5"/> how would Cicero is Tully <pause dur="0.2"/> be any more informative <pause dur="0.2"/> than Cicero is Cicero <pause dur="4.2"/> okay <pause dur="2.7"/> so i say on the handout <reading>this difference would seem inexplicable if all there was 
to the meaning of a name is the object <pause dur="0.2"/> it refers to</reading> <pause dur="1.0"/> and i say <reading>this is sometimes known as Frege's problem <pause dur="0.3"/> or the problem of cognitive difference</reading> <pause dur="1.4"/> well we might perhaps note here that i'm being just <pause dur="0.2"/> slightly <pause dur="0.2"/> disingenuous <pause dur="0.3"/> i guess <pause dur="0.6"/> because i'm saying the problem as if there's a single kind of problem we can identify here <pause dur="0.4"/> when actually it's more like a kind of bundle <pause dur="0.2"/> of worries <pause dur="0.6"/> because if you read any of the literature here you'll find that this problem is sometimes stated in slightly different ways <pause dur="1.1"/> okay so i've said that it's <pause dur="0.5"/> you know what we're going to call Frege's problem <pause dur="0.3"/> is the difference between <pause dur="0.2"/> identity statements <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="3"/> of the form A-equals-A <pause dur="1.0"/> and identity statements of the form A-equals-B <pause dur="1.0"/> and that's one way of stating the problem <pause dur="1.4"/> but in other areas you might find the problem stated as # <pause dur="1.1"/> see <pause dur="1.9"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> the fact that it might be rational for someone to believe <pause dur="6.2"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="4"/> okay <pause dur="1.6"/> say that the object <pause dur="0.3"/> named by the label A <pause dur="0.2"/> is the object <pause dur="0.2"/> named by the label B <pause dur="1.6"/> would it be 
rational <pause dur="0.3"/> could it be rational to believe that A is not B <pause dur="2.9"/> yes <pause dur="0.3"/> even after <pause dur="0.2"/> nineteen pints <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> can see that <vocal desc="laughter" n="ss" iterated="y" dur="1"/> it would be rational to believe that kind of thing <pause dur="0.7"/> would it be rational to believe that A is not A <pause dur="3.0"/> do you think <pause dur="0.6"/> no very good <pause dur="0.4"/> wouldn't be rational doesn't seem <pause dur="0.2"/> to matter how confused you are about your environment <pause dur="0.8"/> it never seems to be rational to believe <pause dur="1.4"/> something of this form <pause dur="0.2"/> that an identity sign <pause dur="0.5"/> using the same label on both sides for the same object <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> that those two objects are non-identical <pause dur="0.6"/> so sometimes Frege's problem <pause dur="0.3"/> is stated as the fact that it would be irrational <pause dur="0.3"/> to believe <pause dur="0.2"/> something in form A is A <pause dur="0.3"/> A is not A <pause dur="0.4"/> but irrational to believe something in form A is not B <pause dur="1.9"/> sorry did i give that the wrong way round <vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" dur="1"/> </u><pause dur="0.2"/> <u who="sf0104" trans="pause"> we understood </u><u who="nf0098" trans="overlap"> other way round you know what i'm saying <pause dur="1.9"/> # and a third way that you might find <pause dur="0.4"/> this problem stated <pause dur="0.2"/> is to do with <pause dur="1.5"/> exchange in certain contexts <pause dur="1.6"/> okay <pause dur="0.4"/> so in certain contexts it looks as if you can always exchange <pause dur="0.5"/> coreferential terms <pause dur="0.4"/> 
what's called <pause dur="0.2"/> <distinct lang="la">salva veritate</distinct> <pause dur="0.8"/> get all classical on you there <pause dur="1.3"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="6"/> did we do this last term did we do the term <distinct lang="la">salva veritate</distinct> </u><pause dur="0.5"/> <u who="sm0105" trans="pause"> # </u><pause dur="0.8"/> <u who="sf0106" trans="pause"> # <pause dur="0.3"/> it was mentioned </u><pause dur="1.1"/> <u who="nf0098" trans="pause"> that was a quick statement for no <vocal desc="laughter" n="sl" iterated="y" dur="1"/> no certainly didn't do that what the hell is it <vocal desc="laugh" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.4"/> <distinct lang="la">salve veritate</distinct> means exchange <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="1.7"/> without alteration in truth value <pause dur="2.0"/> if you can exchange something <distinct lang="la">salva veritate</distinct> that means that you can exchange two things without <pause dur="0.2"/> altering the truth <pause dur="0.5"/> value <pause dur="0.3"/> of the sentence in which they occur <pause dur="2.3"/> so do you remember all the stuff you did in <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> logic in the second year <pause dur="0.7"/> you did stuff about truth functional connectives like and <pause dur="1.5"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="7"/> and or <pause dur="0.8"/> and not <pause dur="2.2"/> things of that form you can <pause dur="0.2"/> always exchange coreferring terms <distinct lang="la">salva veritate</distinct> <pause dur="0.5"/> if you've got a sentence <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="12"/> like <pause dur="1.9"/> Cicero <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="3.7"/> went to the market <vocal desc="sniff" iterated="n"/><pause dur="3.0"/> or <pause dur="0.6"/> i don't know <pause dur="0.4"/> # <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="4"/> Cicero went to the market or Caesar did <pause dur="1.6"/> you can <pause dur="0.2"/> always exchange coreferential terms in this kind of context without altering the 
truth value <pause dur="0.6"/> if this whole sentence is true <pause dur="0.7"/> then the sentence <pause dur="2.6"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="2"/> Tully went to the market or Caesar did <pause dur="0.2"/> has to be true as well <pause dur="0.6"/> if Cicero is Tully <pause dur="2.3"/> yeah <pause dur="1.1"/> 'cause these guys <pause dur="0.5"/> like or <pause dur="0.4"/> that's truth functional all they worry about is the truth value <pause dur="0.5"/> of the sentences they're connecting <pause dur="0.2"/> and if it's true that Cicero went to the market then it has to be true that Tully went to the market <pause dur="0.3"/> if Cicero is Tully <pause dur="1.2"/> so in some contexts then you're guaranteed to be able to exchange coreferring terms <distinct lang="la">salva veritate</distinct> <pause dur="0.9"/> but in some contexts <pause dur="0.7"/> you're not <pause dur="1.4"/> anyone <pause dur="0.5"/> think of a context in which <pause dur="1.1"/> you might not be able to do that </u><pause dur="2.5"/> <u who="sf0107" trans="pause"> John believes that Cicero <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> </u><u who="nf0098" trans="overlap"> yeah classic example <pause dur="1.9"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="16"/> if you've got something like John believes <pause dur="1.8"/> that <pause dur="1.4"/> Cicero went to the market <pause dur="7.0"/><vocal desc="sniff" iterated="n"/><pause dur="3.6"/> something like this <pause dur="0.2"/> a so-called intentional context <pause dur="0.7"/> using a term like believes or hopes or desires <pause dur="0.4"/> a term picking out a mental <pause dur="0.4"/> state <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> a propositional attitude <pause dur="2.0"/> in contexts like these <pause dur="0.2"/> you pretty obviously can't go around exchanging 
coreferential terms <pause dur="0.3"/> <distinct lang="la">salva veritate</distinct> <pause dur="0.9"/> John believes that Cicero went to the market <pause dur="0.2"/> so this whole sentence is true <pause dur="1.8"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="9"/> okay <pause dur="0.2"/> this whole thing is true <pause dur="1.0"/> am i guaranteed <pause dur="2.3"/> that the sentence John believes that Tully <pause dur="0.3"/> went to the market <pause dur="0.4"/> is also true </u><pause dur="6.6"/> <u who="sm0108" trans="pause"> no </u><pause dur="0.4"/> <u who="nf0098" trans="pause"> no <pause dur="0.3"/> exactly right <pause dur="0.2"/> not guaranteed that at all <pause dur="0.4"/> John could easily believe that Cicero went to the market and disbelieve <pause dur="0.5"/> that Tully went to the market <pause dur="0.2"/> precisely if he doesn't know <pause dur="0.3"/> that Cicero is Tully <pause dur="2.6"/> so in contexts like these <pause dur="0.5"/> believes contexts hopes contexts desires contexts things like that <pause dur="0.8"/> it doesn't look as if we can exchange coreferring terms <pause dur="0.4"/> <distinct lang="la">salva veritate</distinct> <pause dur="0.6"/> we can change the truth value of the whole sentence <pause dur="0.4"/> by swapping <pause dur="0.7"/> two terms <pause dur="0.3"/> which pick out the same object <pause dur="2.3"/> so this is another way that you'll find <pause dur="0.3"/> Frege's <pause dur="0.9"/> point made Frege's argument made <pause dur="0.5"/> because obviously there would be nothing to explain <pause dur="0.8"/> this difference <pause dur="0.8"/> in <pause dur="0.9"/> the kind of context where you can exchange <pause dur="0.3"/> coreferring terms <pause dur="0.3"/> if all there is to 
the meaning <pause dur="0.5"/> of a proper name <pause dur="0.4"/> is its referent <pause dur="2.6"/> the meaning of Cicero is completely exhausted <pause dur="2.9"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="2"/> by <pause dur="0.3"/> our Roman orator <pause dur="3.9"/> how are we going to explain the fact that you can <trunc>expla</trunc> you can exchange <pause dur="0.4"/> the terms Cicero and Tully in this context <pause dur="0.3"/> but you can't exchange them <pause dur="0.2"/> in this context <pause dur="3.1"/> 
it looks as if you're going to have to <pause dur="1.9"/> introduce some <pause dur="0.2"/> other element into the meaning of the name <pause dur="0.5"/> to explain <pause dur="0.3"/> this variation <pause dur="2.3"/> okay do people see that <pause dur="0.8"/> <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> <pause dur="0.7"/> mm <pause dur="1.0"/> vaguely <pause dur="0.7"/> <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> you're looking kind of dazed <vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" dur="1"/> <pause dur="0.4"/> is that just because it's </u><u who="sm0100" trans="overlap"> that's just me usually </u><u who="nf0098" trans="overlap"> week three of term just the usual okay okay cool <pause dur="1.5"/> right so those are three different ways that we might find Frege's <pause dur="0.4"/> problem stated there's the idea of informative identity statements that it's better to learn something of the form A-equals-B than it is to learn something of the form A-equals-A <pause dur="1.1"/> # <pause dur="0.8"/> there's the fact that it's sometimes irrational to believe something of the form <pause dur="0.7"/> A-does-not-equal-A <pause dur="0.2"/> even though it's rational to believe that A-does-not-equal-B <pause dur="0.7"/> and we've got the fact that in some contexts you can exchange two coreferential terms you can exchange A and B <pause dur="0.3"/> but in other contexts <pause dur="0.3"/> it looks like you can't <pause dur="1.3"/> so this this whole kind of cluster of worries <pause dur="0.7"/> that often get referred to as Frege's problem <pause dur="0.7"/> or as the 
problem of cognitive difference <pause dur="8.1"/> so that's a whole kind of cluster of worries <pause dur="0.9"/> but <pause dur="0.3"/> i put it to you <pause dur="0.6"/> if we're going to be driven from our nice simple intuitive <pause dur="0.2"/> clear <pause dur="0.5"/> # Millian position on names <pause dur="0.3"/> we want more than just a kind of cluster of <pause dur="0.4"/> you know <pause dur="0.2"/> general slight worries about what's going on here <pause dur="0.4"/> we want an argument <pause dur="0.4"/> goddamn it we're philosophers we want a nice clear argument that shows us why we can't be Millians given all these <pause dur="0.2"/> states of affairs <pause dur="1.6"/> and actually <pause dur="0.2"/> i think it's harder <pause dur="0.3"/> to get an argument <pause dur="1.0"/> in this case <pause dur="0.2"/> than we might initially expect <pause dur="1.4"/> devil's in the detail like it always is you know <pause dur="1.0"/> so how might we formalize the kind of argument that's going on <pause dur="0.2"/> in cases like the ones we just looked at <pause dur="1.1"/> well i've given you <pause dur="0.2"/> a kind of example on the handout <pause dur="0.3"/> or <pause dur="0.3"/> a way we might try it on the handout <pause dur="1.2"/> we start off <pause dur="0.2"/> with a piece of data <pause dur="0.4"/> right <pause dur="1.4"/> the data is say that <trunc>senten</trunc> the sentence <pause dur="0.2"/> Hesperus is cold <pause dur="0.4"/> and the sentence Phosphorus in cold <pause dur="0.5"/> is cold <pause dur="0.2"/> differ in cognitive value <pause dur="0.6"/> because a rational 
agent can know both and assent to one <pause dur="0.2"/> while dissenting <pause dur="0.3"/> to the other <pause dur="1.8"/> so there's a piece of data <pause dur="0.2"/> for you <pause dur="1.1"/> and that seems <pause dur="0.4"/> # incontrovertible right that's just <pause dur="0.7"/> clearly right <pause dur="2.5"/> now secondly <pause dur="1.0"/> if that's our premise so if that's our piece of data we need some kind <pause dur="0.2"/> of second <pause dur="0.2"/> premise <pause dur="0.4"/> connecting <pause dur="0.4"/> the objects of knowledge <pause dur="0.2"/> and the expressions of our language <pause dur="0.7"/> because look <pause dur="0.6"/> what premise one tells us <pause dur="0.7"/> is that an agent can know both of these things <pause dur="0.5"/> and can assent to one and dissent to the other <pause dur="0.5"/> the first premise is one about epistemology <pause dur="0.2"/> right <pause dur="0.4"/> it's one about what people know <pause dur="0.9"/> but what we're trying to get at is a conclusion about <pause dur="0.5"/> the meaning of linguistic items <pause dur="1.9"/> so we need a premise connecting <pause dur="0.4"/> the things that people know about bits of language to the meaning <pause dur="0.2"/> of bits of language <pause dur="2.0"/> and we could just do that in some very general way by saying there is some kind of connection between the objects of knowledge and expressions in the language <pause dur="2.0"/> now if we can establish that if we can establish that 
there is this connection then we do seem able to draw a conclusion that <pause dur="0.6"/> Hesperus <pause dur="0.2"/> the term Hesperus and the term Phosphorus <pause dur="0.5"/> differ <pause dur="0.4"/> in something other than <pause dur="0.3"/> and i've put in here <pause dur="0.2"/> <distinct lang="de">bedeutung</distinct> <pause dur="1.0"/> that's the German phrase <pause dur="0.3"/> that <pause dur="0.3"/> Frege uses <pause dur="0.3"/> sometimes translated as reference <pause dur="0.7"/> sometimes as <distinct lang="la">nominatum</distinct> <pause dur="0.6"/> sometimes as designation i'll almost always say reference but <pause dur="0.4"/> you should just be aware that that's <pause dur="0.9"/> # an issue about exactly how that term should be translated <pause dur="1.9"/> okay we can obviously get that conclusion because if you've got the two sentences Hesperus is cold and Phosphorus is cold <pause dur="0.4"/> the only bit they differ in <pause dur="0.5"/> is <pause dur="0.3"/> the names they contain <pause dur="1.2"/> yeah <pause dur="0.6"/> so we can trace <pause dur="0.4"/> if there is going to be a difference <pause dur="0.8"/> # between the meaning of those two whole sentences <pause dur="0.3"/> we know it's got to come <pause dur="0.3"/> in the meaning of those two <pause dur="0.3"/> bits of sentences <pause dur="1.1"/> so we do get the conclusion that Hesperus and Phosphorus differ in something other than reference <pause dur="1.4"/> that would seem to be a good conclusion 'cause that's what Frege wants to conclude 
because he's going to say that the meaning of name isn't just <pause dur="0.5"/> its reference <pause dur="2.8"/> but <pause dur="0.7"/> i think you should know that as it stands <pause dur="0.2"/> the conclusion in three <pause dur="0.2"/> isn't particularly interesting <pause dur="0.6"/> oops <pause dur="0.4"/><vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" dur="1"/><pause dur="0.4"/> you can't get that back now either 'cause that's stuck in the middle <vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" dur="1"/><pause dur="0.5"/> going to have to go under the table Andrew <pause dur="2.6"/> very good <pause dur="1.0"/> okay so the conclusion in three isn't an interesting conclusion <pause dur="1.0"/> why not <pause dur="0.7"/> why isn't it interesting to be <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="20"/> told that <pause dur="1.7"/> Hesperus and <pause dur="0.4"/> Phosphorus <pause dur="4.8"/> differ in something other than reference <pause dur="9.9"/> well the answer is <pause dur="0.3"/> clearly <pause dur="0.2"/> why it's not interesting to be told that Hesperus and Phosphorus differ in something other than reference <pause dur="0.5"/> it's 'cause that they clearly <shift feature="voice" new="laugh"/>differ in something <shift feature="voice" new="normal"/><pause dur="1.5"/> they're not the same thing are they <pause dur="0.6"/> this isn't like saying Hesperus and Hesperus differ in something other than reference <pause dur="0.6"/> these are two different syntactic items <pause dur="1.6"/> they've got different orthographic properties 
they've got different phonetic properties <pause dur="0.4"/> they've got different properties about occasions of use <pause dur="1.5"/> there are lots of different properties that these have <pause dur="1.5"/> regardless of the fact <pause dur="0.2"/> that they don't differ in reference <pause dur="2.2"/> so what Frege needs to make this conclusion of his argument an interesting conclusion <pause dur="0.5"/> is not the claim just that they differ in something other than reference <pause dur="0.5"/> but that they differ <pause dur="1.0"/> in meaning <pause dur="5.4"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="4"/> that's the interesting conclusion <pause dur="1.3"/> that Hesperus and Phosphorus differ in meaning <pause dur="1.9"/> because if that's the case <pause dur="0.3"/> then we know that meaning can't just be reference <pause dur="0.8"/> it can't be the Millian position <pause dur="0.6"/> because we know that Hesperus and Phosphorus <pause dur="0.5"/> both pick out <pause dur="1.9"/> Venus <pause dur="1.7"/> yet again this week looks a bit like Mercury <pause dur="0.2"/> but anyway <pause dur="1.3"/> we know they both have the same reference <pause dur="0.3"/> if we know that they both have the same reference <pause dur="0.5"/> # but yet they differ in meaning <pause dur="0.2"/> then we know that meaning and reference aren't synonymous <pause dur="0.4"/> aren't the same thing <pause dur="2.3"/> so that's 
the conclusion that Frege needs to get <pause dur="0.8"/> whoops <pause dur="0.9"/> he needs to get <pause dur="0.2"/> that Hesperus <pause dur="0.3"/> and Phosphorus <pause dur="0.2"/> differ in meaning <pause dur="1.9"/> and that's a claim <pause dur="0.3"/> that's been <pause dur="0.2"/> disputed <pause dur="0.2"/> by some people <pause dur="1.6"/> some philosophers want to accept <pause dur="0.4"/> the initial <pause dur="1.4"/> kind of uninteresting claim that i put up to begin with that Hesper and <pause dur="0.2"/> Hesperus and Phosphorus differ in something other than reference <pause dur="0.4"/> and yet not accept <pause dur="0.2"/> that they differ <pause dur="0.8"/> in <pause dur="0.4"/> meaning <pause dur="0.7"/> I-E not accept that there is a semantic level difference between these two guys <pause dur="2.3"/> how might you do that <pause dur="0.4"/> well you might do that by appealing say to the syntactic properties <pause dur="0.3"/> of each expression <pause dur="0.5"/> or <pause dur="0.9"/> i guess a probably more popular <pause dur="0.2"/> move <pause dur="0.4"/> is to appeal to the kind of pragmatic properties <pause dur="0.4"/> that these expressions have <pause dur="1.8"/> the fact that on some occasions of use <pause dur="0.2"/> it's fitting <pause dur="0.2"/> to use the term Hesperus <pause dur="0.5"/> and on some occasions of use it's fitting <pause dur="0.4"/> to use the word <pause dur="0.4"/> Phosphorus <pause dur="1.9"/> so what these kind of people like <pause dur="0.2"/> # Nathan Salmon <pause dur="0.3"/> wrote a whole book <pause dur="1.4"/> Nathan Salmon one of the great fish philosophers <pause dur="0.2"/> of the century 
did we look at him last term <pause dur="1.1"/> no <pause dur="0.9"/> # Nathan Salmon wrote a whole book called Frege's Puzzle <pause dur="0.2"/> in which he argues that <pause dur="0.4"/> the only difference <pause dur="0.4"/> that's relevant here between Hesperus and Phosphorus is a pragmatic difference <pause dur="1.6"/> why don't you say <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="15"/> something like <pause dur="6.8"/> the ancient astronomers believed <pause dur="5.1"/> Hesperus was Phosphorus <pause dur="1.6"/> okay it was the ancient astronomers that introduced the two different terms Hesperus and Phosphorus <pause dur="0.4"/> one for the star that you could see in the morning <pause dur="0.3"/> one for the star that you could see in the evening <pause dur="1.8"/> so <pause dur="1.4"/> they introduced these two terms they didn't realize that they were naming the same planet <pause dur="0.4"/> 'cause obviously that wouldn't have been very helpful to have used two different words for something they realized was the same planet <pause dur="0.9"/> they introduced two different words for it <pause dur="0.3"/> called one Hesperus and one Phosphorus <pause dur="1.7"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> so it doesn't sound right to say that the ancient astronomers believed that Hesperus was Hesperus <pause dur="0.3"/> even though it does seem right <pause dur="0.6"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="6"/> to 
say that the ancient astronomers believed that Hesperus <pause dur="0.4"/> was Hesperus <pause dur="2.3"/> that's the kind of failure of exchange <pause dur="0.3"/> that <trunc>w</trunc> <pause dur="0.4"/> Frege's Puzzle is interested in <pause dur="1.0"/> but people like Nathan Salmon want to say well look <pause dur="0.2"/> actually you can say both those things <pause dur="1.2"/> both of those sentences are perfectly <pause dur="0.9"/> <trunc>r</trunc> <pause dur="0.5"/> right they're perfectly true <pause dur="0.7"/> because <pause dur="0.9"/> semantics is just to do with reference <pause dur="0.4"/> it's just that this one <pause dur="0.2"/> this first sentence <pause dur="0.3"/> is not very acceptable <pause dur="0.8"/> there are pragmatic reasons that you don't want to # <pause dur="0.2"/> attribute this kind of thing <pause dur="0.4"/> primarily because this isn't something <pause dur="0.3"/> that the ancient astronomers themselves <pause dur="0.7"/> would have assented to <pause dur="0.7"/> even though when they were believing that Hesperus was Hesperus they were really believing that Hesperus was Phosphorus <pause dur="0.5"/> that's not the way they would have chosen to phrase their beliefs <pause dur="2.0"/> now i can see certain people <pause dur="0.2"/> like <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> <pause dur="0.2"/><vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" dur="1"/><pause dur="0.3"/> and <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> not looking totally convinced by this manoeuvre here <pause dur="0.4"/> and i <pause dur="0.5"/> i'm in sympathy with you really it doesn't sound 
like an intuitively very compelling manoeuvre <pause dur="0.3"/> although you know Salmon's book's <pause dur="0.3"/> worth having a look at because he gives this kind of line a really <pause dur="0.9"/> good go you know it's a big book <pause dur="1.2"/> lots of arguments for his position <pause dur="0.9"/> but <pause dur="0.9"/> if you're feeling a bit <pause dur="0.2"/> kind of sceptical about this sort of worry then i think that's fair enough <pause dur="0.4"/> really <pause dur="2.2"/> and maybe if that's the way you are feeling <pause dur="0.3"/> then <pause dur="1.8"/> we can kind of let Frege off the hook <pause dur="1.0"/> even if we can't find a really strong way to kind of <pause dur="0.2"/> codify his argument <pause dur="0.4"/> perhaps it is the case that the worries he raises <pause dur="0.4"/> are <pause dur="0.2"/> good enough <pause dur="1.2"/> that if he can get to the conclusion that Hesperus and Phosphorus differ in something other than referent <pause dur="1.2"/> we just kind of feel that has to be something to do with the meaning <pause dur="0.3"/> of the expressions involved even if he can't actually get you to that conclusion <pause dur="1.1"/> deductively <pause dur="0.4"/> perhaps it just seems reasonable that the thing that they differ in <pause dur="0.2"/> has to be a thing to do with the meaning <pause dur="0.3"/> it can't be something to do just with the pragmatics <pause dur="0.7"/> as Salmon 
tries to argue <pause dur="3.1"/> okay how are we doing people clear on the <pause dur="0.2"/> kind of argument <pause dur="1.3"/> yeah </u><pause dur="2.1"/> <u who="sf0109" trans="pause"> can i just ask is the </u><u who="nf0098" trans="overlap"> yeah </u><pause dur="0.6"/> <u who="sf0109" trans="pause"> is the Salmon position something we really need to sort of know about in detail <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> </u><u who="nf0098" trans="overlap"> no <pause dur="0.7"/> no </u><pause dur="0.5"/> <u who="sf0109" trans="pause"> if you # # </u><u who="nf0098" trans="overlap"> it's if you're interested you should have a look at it </u><u who="sf0109" trans="overlap"> mm </u><u who="nf0098" trans="overlap"> but it's not </u><pause dur="0.2"/> <u who="sf0109" trans="pause"> it's not going to be an exam question or anything <vocal desc="laughter" n="ss" iterated="y" dur="1"/> </u><u who="nf0098" trans="overlap"> oh <pause dur="0.7"/> God what sort of question is that i'm not answering questions like that <vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" dur="2"/><pause dur="0.9"/> okay then so that's Frege's argument <pause dur="0.4"/> this kind of cluster of worries that seem to show us that the Millian position which tells us that the meaning of a proper name is just given by the object it refers to <pause dur="0.3"/> that that position is somehow <pause dur="0.4"/> unsatisfactory <pause dur="3.5"/> so clearly we know that position is unsatisfactory <pause dur="1.1"/> and we've got a good argument against it <pause dur="0.8"/> what we need to do next <pause dur="0.3"/> is to come up with a better position <pause dur="1.3"/> we need to find a positive suggestion <pause dur="0.6"/> as to what the meaning <pause dur="0.2"/> of a proper name is which is going to 
allow us to avoid <pause dur="0.2"/> these kinds of difficulties <pause dur="1.5"/> and Frege's <pause dur="0.7"/> got a solution <pause dur="0.8"/> and being a great philosopher he's got two solutions <pause dur="0.7"/> one of which he made in an early stage of his career went on to reject <pause dur="0.4"/> and the second one which has become a kind of standard of philosophy of language <pause dur="1.2"/> so his first suggestion which he made in <distinct lang="de">Begriffsschrift</distinct> <pause dur="0.8"/> one of his earlier works <pause dur="0.9"/> was that a sentence like Hesperus is Phosphorus <pause dur="0.3"/> should be read <pause dur="0.2"/> as saying something like <pause dur="0.5"/> the object denoted by the expression <pause dur="0.3"/> Hesperus <pause dur="1.2"/> is the same as the object <pause dur="0.2"/> denoted <pause dur="0.2"/> by the expression <pause dur="0.8"/> Phosphorus <pause dur="2.0"/> okay you all remember from last term <pause dur="4.0"/> notice the way that's not a question that's a statement you do all remember from last term <pause dur="0.3"/> i know you do <pause dur="1.0"/> the difference between <pause dur="1.8"/> using and mentioning <pause dur="1.8"/> anyone want to remind me what the difference between using an expression and mentioning an expression is <pause dur="1.1"/> we did it in the

that when you have <pause dur="0.2"/> a sentence like Hesperus is Phosphorus <pause dur="0.4"/> you're really not saying something about the world <pause dur="0.6"/> you're saying something about your language <pause dur="1.0"/> what you're saying is that <pause dur="4.7"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="18"/> the object referred to <pause dur="4.8"/> by that <pause dur="2.9"/> is <pause dur="0.9"/> the object referred to <pause dur="0.9"/> by that <pause dur="3.6"/> okay <pause dur="0.5"/> put your name Hesperus and your name Phosphorus <pause dur="0.4"/> you've enclosed them in quote marks <pause dur="0.3"/> so you're mentioning them you're not using them <pause dur="0.5"/> and you're saying that the thing <pause dur="0.2"/> which is picked out by this linguistic item <pause dur="0.3"/> is the same as the thing picked out by this linguistic item <pause dur="3.6"/> now this was Frege's first proposal <pause dur="0.8"/> but he rejected it pretty quickly <pause dur="0.3"/> oh we might talk about this as a metalinguistic <pause dur="0.2"/> proposal <pause dur="0.4"/> okay <pause dur="0.9"/> because it's explaining a linguistic fact <pause dur="0.3"/> by using <pause dur="1.0"/> items <pause dur="0.2"/> from the language <pause dur="0.7"/> in the explanation <vocal desc="sniff" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.3"/> it's kind of going one level higher than language right it's metalinguistic because it's <pause dur="0.4"/> mentioning <pause dur="0.4"/> bits <pause dur="0.7"/> of the linguistic system <pause dur="1.9"/> so this was his first proposal <pause dur="0.3"/> but he rejected it pretty quickly <pause dur="0.4"/> because he just thought 
that actually <pause dur="0.2"/> on reflection <pause dur="0.6"/> this whole claim here <pause dur="0.6"/> just isn't <pause dur="0.4"/> what's meant <pause dur="0.4"/> by a claim like <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="3"/> Hesperus is Phosphorus <pause dur="3.1"/> he just decided that this <pause dur="0.8"/> equivalence claim to do with bits of your language <pause dur="0.5"/> isn't what's meant by a claim <pause dur="0.5"/> like this without the quote marks <pause dur="1.6"/> and he thought that <pause dur="0.3"/> because <pause dur="2.1"/> if you look at a sentence like Hesperus is Phosphorus <pause dur="0.2"/> or a sentence like <pause dur="0.7"/> # Abraham Lincoln was the first postmaster general <pause dur="1.0"/> or Cicero was Tully <pause dur="1.6"/> those claims don't <pause dur="0.2"/> seem to be telling you something about your language <pause dur="3.0"/> i'm guessing <pause dur="0.2"/> that none of you knew that Abraham Lincoln <pause dur="0.3"/> was the inventor of the bifocals when you came in here </u><u who="sf0112" trans="latching"> Benjamin Franklin </u><pause dur="0.2"/> <u who="nf0098" trans="pause"> was it was wasn't it </u><u who="sf0112" trans="overlap"> <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/></u><u who="nf0098" trans="overlap"> you're absolutely <vocal desc="laughter" n="ss" iterated="y" dur="1"/> right oh my goodness <vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" dur="1"/> </u><u who="sm0113" trans="latching"> that's why none of us knew it i think </u><u who="nf0098" trans="overlap"> <vocal desc="laughter" n="sl" iterated="y" dur="1"/> that's very true <pause dur="0.3"/> or i could have bluffed my whole way through here <vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" dur="1"/> and you could have got a degree from a university and gone out with a completely false piece of knowledge <vocal desc="laughter" n="ss" iterated="y" dur="1"/> 
couldn't i <pause dur="1.0"/> absolutely right Benjamin Franklin <pause dur="0.3"/> this is the this is the example gets used in all the books as well so it shows how carefully i've been reading things <vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" dur="1"/><pause dur="0.6"/> Benjamin Franklin indeed was the inventor of the bifocals <pause dur="1.3"/> so <pause dur="1.3"/> <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> block your ears now but i'm assuming some people <pause dur="0.4"/> in fact nobody knew that Abraham Lincoln was <vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" dur="1"/><shift feature="voice" new="laugh"/> the inventor of <shift feature="voice" new="normal"/> bifocals when you came in here so that's a good example <vocal desc="laugh" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="1.2"/> but when you learn something of that form <pause dur="0.4"/> it doesn't seem like you learn something about your language <pause dur="0.8"/> it looks like you learn something about the world <pause dur="1.2"/> you learn a genuine useful fact to go out and apply <pause dur="0.2"/> in the world <pause dur="0.9"/> and not just something <pause dur="0.3"/> to do with your language <pause dur="1.6"/> and because of that <pause dur="0.4"/> Frege thought that this kind of <pause dur="1.0"/> restating of the problem <pause dur="1.0"/> in terms <pause dur="0.4"/> of a <pause dur="0.7"/> comment about the language <pause dur="1.4"/> wasn't <pause dur="0.2"/> a good way to go <pause dur="0.9"/> so even though this sort of approach might solve the problem <pause dur="0.4"/> he just thought it was getting things wrong <pause dur="5.1"/> okay <pause dur="0.6"/> so once he'd rejected this sort of 
proposal <pause dur="0.5"/> what's he going to do <pause dur="1.1"/> well being a very smart guy he's going to come up with a whole new theory <pause dur="0.2"/> of the meaning of proper names <pause dur="1.6"/> according to Frege <pause dur="3.5"/> in his classic paper <pause dur="0.2"/> <distinct lang="de">Sinn und Bedeutung</distinct> <pause dur="1.3"/> he's going to tell you <pause dur="0.6"/> that there are <pause dur="0.2"/> two <pause dur="0.2"/> elements <pause dur="0.4"/> to the meaning <pause dur="0.2"/> of a proper name <pause dur="1.7"/> Mill tried to tell you that there was just one <pause dur="0.8"/> there was just this guy <pause dur="0.2"/> in the world <pause dur="2.1"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="12"/> the denotation <pause dur="0.2"/> or the referent <pause dur="9.0"/> but what Frege's going to tell you <pause dur="1.4"/> is that although <pause dur="0.2"/> this is right although this forms one element <pause dur="0.2"/> of the meaning of the name <pause dur="0.4"/> there's another element <pause dur="1.6"/> and that element is the <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="12"/> sense <pause dur="1.8"/> sometimes also called the mode of presentation <pause dur="4.7"/> whoops <pause dur="4.7"/> so for Frege <pause dur="0.4"/> the meaning of a proper name is a kind of <pause dur="0.3"/> bifurcated <pause dur="0.3"/> thing it's got two elements to it a <pause dur="0.2"/> dual <pause dur="1.0"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> feature <pause dur="0.2"/> two features <pause dur="1.9"/> on the one hand <pause dur="0.3"/> you've got the object referred to in the world <pause dur="0.8"/> the referent <pause dur="1.2"/> or the denotation <pause dur="0.7"/> and on the other hand <pause dur="0.4"/> you've got the way in which that object <pause dur="0.5"/> is presented <pause dur="2.9"/> so think 
about Hesperus and Phosphorus again <pause dur="0.2"/> you might think that <pause dur="0.4"/> the sense <pause dur="0.2"/> of Hesperus <pause dur="0.5"/> is <pause dur="0.8"/> the bright star seen in the morning <pause dur="0.3"/> and you might think the sense <pause dur="0.2"/> of Phosphorus <pause dur="0.3"/> is the bright star <pause dur="0.3"/> seen in the evening <pause dur="1.2"/> even though <pause dur="0.4"/> the referent is the same for both of those expressions <pause dur="1.8"/> or here <pause dur="0.2"/> you might think that <pause dur="0.3"/> the referent of Cicero <pause dur="0.6"/> is <pause dur="0.2"/> our Greek orator <pause dur="1.2"/> but the sense is <pause dur="1.9"/> not entirely sure what the sense of Cicero would be <pause dur="0.4"/> # the author of <pause dur="0.2"/> certain works <pause dur="4.1"/> and it's going to be this element <pause dur="0.4"/> that's going to explain <pause dur="0.3"/> why it is <pause dur="0.5"/> that we get <pause dur="0.3"/> cognitive difference <pause dur="1.6"/> okay and why is it <pause dur="0.5"/> that you can believe <pause dur="0.4"/> Superman can fly <pause dur="1.3"/> when you don't believe that Clark Kent can fly <pause dur="0.4"/> well that's because <pause dur="0.6"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="30"/> even though <pause dur="0.2"/> you've got the same referent in the world <pause dur="3.5"/> for Clark Kent <pause dur="2.8"/> you've got a sense to do with <pause dur="2.1"/> wearing glasses <pause dur="2.5"/> being a bit of a <pause dur="0.4"/> skinny wimp <pause dur="1.6"/> working for a newspaper <pause dur="2.6"/> whereas for Superman <pause dur="1.9"/> you've got a sense to do with <pause dur="1.4"/> wearing a cape <pause dur="1.4"/> wearing his underwear outside his trousers <pause dur="0.3"/> flying 
around <pause dur="0.5"/> flying that's pretty good you don't get flying with Clark Kent <pause dur="2.4"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="2"/> so even though you've got the same object being presented in both these cases <pause dur="0.6"/> you've got radically different <pause dur="0.9"/> kind of modes of presentation of that object <pause dur="0.3"/> <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> <pause dur="0.2"/> you're looking </u><pause dur="0.4"/> <u who="sf0112" trans="pause"> so <pause dur="0.6"/> are things like definite descriptions like the first postmaster general or <pause dur="0.2"/> something like that are they senses or are they names </u><u who="nf0098" trans="latching"> well <pause dur="0.7"/> we're going to need to look more carefully at exactly what a sense is here </u><u who="sf0112" trans="overlap"> mm </u><u who="nf0098" trans="overlap"> i'm trying to give you a kind of <pause dur="0.3"/> rough idea to start with <pause dur="0.2"/> and then we're going to try and spell out what the technical notion of a sense is <pause dur="2.2"/> the question about definite descriptions # <pause dur="1.0"/> we need to remember we're talking about proper names <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="1.2"/> in a kind of non-technical sense at the moment <pause dur="1.1"/> it was quite clear when we looked at Mill that he had a fairly restricted notion of proper names <pause dur="0.3"/> but Frege has a much more liberal notion </u><pause dur="0.3"/> <u who="sf0112" trans="pause"> mm </u><u who="nf0098" trans="latching"> okay Frege's going to tell you <pause dur="0.4"/> that something like Cicero is a proper name something like Clark Kent is a proper name <pause dur="0.3"/> something like Superman is a proper name <pause dur="0.5"/> he's also going to tell you though that something 
like the first postmaster general </u><u who="sf0112" trans="overlap"> mm </u><u who="nf0098" trans="latching"> is a proper name <pause dur="0.9"/> because he's got a class of what <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="4"/> he calls <pause dur="1.1"/> <distinct lang="de">eigename</distinct> <pause dur="0.6"/> <distinct lang="de">eigenamen</distinct> <pause dur="1.5"/> which contains both ordinary proper names and definite descriptions </u><pause dur="0.5"/> <u who="sf0112" trans="pause"> does that mean then when we're trying to sort of work out how to express the sense of Cicero we couldn't use something which is like unique to Cicero <pause dur="0.3"/> because if we did </u><u who="nf0098" trans="overlap"> well </u><u who="sf0112" trans="overlap"> wouldn't it be a proper name <gap reason="inaudible" extent="2 secs"/> </u><pause dur="0.8"/> <u who="nf0098" trans="pause"> # </u><u who="sf0112" trans="overlap"> <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> <pause dur="0.2"/> as the sense </u><pause dur="0.5"/> <u who="nf0098" trans="pause"> there's going to be a question about whether senses are just forms of definite description </u><pause dur="0.7"/> <u who="sf0112" trans="pause"> right </u><u who="nf0098" trans="latching"> some people read them as just being <pause dur="0.5"/> forms of definite description <pause dur="0.4"/> although even then <pause dur="2.4"/> you might want to be careful because # talking about replacing a name like Cicero with a definite description <pause dur="2.0"/> there might be distinctions when we come to look at Kripke we'll see there are distinctions between saying that the meaning of this is given by a description <pause dur="0.3"/> as opposed to saying that the reference is fixed by a description </u><u who="sf0112" trans="overlap"> mm </u><pause dur="0.3"/> <u who="nf0098" trans="pause"> so there might be questions about exactly what it means 
to say that this can be replaced by a description <pause dur="0.8"/> but <pause dur="1.1"/> to get ahead of ourselves a little bit as well <pause dur="0.5"/> it's not clear that a sense has to be <pause dur="0.2"/> a definite description </u><pause dur="0.2"/> <u who="sf0112" trans="pause"> right </u><pause dur="0.7"/> <u who="nf0098" trans="pause"> people like Evans kind of <pause dur="0.3"/> modern-day <pause dur="0.2"/> neo-Fregeans as they get called <pause dur="0.4"/> want to tell you that there's a notion of sense <pause dur="0.3"/> which isn't <pause dur="0.3"/> akin to being a definite description <pause dur="0.2"/> which isn't akin to say <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> the guy who i believe can fly and loves <pause dur="0.2"/> Lois Lane and <pause dur="1.2"/> wears a cape and all that kind of thing <pause dur="1.3"/> there's a notion of sense which is more akin to a sort of <pause dur="0.8"/> # a visual presentation <pause dur="0.3"/> or <pause dur="1.0"/> something which is kind of dependent on the object <pause dur="0.5"/> so <pause dur="0.2"/> i think it's on your handouts a bit later actually we'll see Evans has got a nice quote about <pause dur="0.6"/> just because you say that there's a way of giving an object if i give you a present there's a way in which i give you the present <pause dur="1.3"/> but that's not to say that the giving of the present is kind of indirect <pause dur="0.4"/> or that <pause dur="0.2"/> the way of giving it is something independent of the giving of the present <pause dur="0.6"/> or the 
present itself <pause dur="1.0"/> so he's going to want to have senses which are what he calls object-dependent <pause dur="1.1"/> they're going to be <pause dur="0.6"/> modes of presentation of an object which can't be separated from the object <pause dur="0.6"/> # that they <pause dur="0.4"/> as a sense of <pause dur="0.5"/> good sentence <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="2.4"/> but you're right to think <pause dur="0.4"/> that we might understand a sense as a definite description <pause dur="0.7"/> # and if we do then we'll see that Frege's position <pause dur="0.4"/> is going to be what's called being a descriptivist about names <pause dur="1.2"/> so we'll come on to that <pause dur="1.1"/> any other questions so far </u><u who="sm0113" trans="latching"> # </u><u who="nf0098" trans="overlap"> <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> </u><pause dur="0.5"/> <u who="sm0113" trans="pause"> # <pause dur="0.3"/> does the is the problem <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> <pause dur="0.2"/> if you see it from a use theory because then you only have pragmatic <pause dur="0.3"/> like so if you went back to the <pause dur="0.5"/> assignment of </u><u who="nf0098" trans="latching"> mm </u><u who="sm0113" trans="overlap"> then it it seems a bit more <pause dur="0.7"/> plausible doesn't it </u><u who="nf0098" trans="overlap"> if you're not coming from a formal perspective </u><u who="sm0113" trans="overlap"> mm </u><u who="nf0098" trans="overlap"> yeah i think that's probably right <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="3.5"/> yeah i <trunc>m</trunc> this whole sort of problem is probably premised more on having a kind of referentialist semantics going on definitely <pause dur="0.2"/> so yeah think that's right <pause dur="5.7"/> 
okay <pause dur="1.0"/> # so there's a quote on the handout <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="1.1"/> i've told you that <pause dur="1.8"/> the object referred to <pause dur="0.3"/> there's two elements to the meaning of name both the object referred to <pause dur="0.3"/> and the sense <pause dur="0.4"/> sense being the way in which the name selects the object <pause dur="1.4"/> and Frege tells us in <distinct lang="de">Sinn und Bedeutung</distinct> that <pause dur="0.4"/> it is plausible to connect with a sign <pause dur="0.5"/> a name a word combination an expression <pause dur="0.5"/> not only the designated object which may also be called the reference of the sign <pause dur="0.5"/> but also <pause dur="0.2"/> the sense <pause dur="0.5"/> and he puts in brackets connotation meaning <pause dur="0.5"/> of 
the sign <pause dur="0.5"/> in which is contained the manner <pause dur="0.2"/> and context of presentation <pause dur="1.6"/> so for those guys who were paying attention when we were doing Mill <pause dur="0.4"/> last week <pause dur="0.4"/> you'll see that really what Frege's doing here is extending <pause dur="0.7"/> the notion of meaning <pause dur="0.2"/> that Mill gave us for all <pause dur="0.2"/> words for objects <pause dur="1.2"/> bar proper names <pause dur="0.3"/> Frege is extending that picture <pause dur="0.2"/> to proper names <pause dur="0.5"/> he thinks that Mill's idea <pause dur="0.3"/> that we could have names having denotation but no connotation <pause dur="0.3"/> is just wrong <pause dur="1.6"/> names have to have both sense and reference they have to have both denotation and connotation <pause dur="4.1"/> okay then <pause dur="0.2"/> well before we go on perhaps we should take a break <pause dur="1.0"/> any other questions before we go on about <pause dur="0.3"/> Frege's argument <pause dur="2.7"/> okay let's take <pause dur="0.3"/> five minutes then
