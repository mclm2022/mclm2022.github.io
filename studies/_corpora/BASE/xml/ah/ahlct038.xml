<u who="nm0182"> # last time as you know that # <pause dur="0.4"/> # tape recorder broke down <pause dur="0.2"/> i've in fact done a rerecording rather swiftly last night for anyone who did miss the lecture <pause dur="0.3"/> and needs to make use of that material <pause dur="0.6"/> # but it # <pause dur="0.3"/> it is now in S-R-C <pause dur="0.9"/> # somebody said could i put in a box available <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.8"/> the # O-H-Ps that i've been using well i've put # # # copies from which i've copied O-H-Ps <pause dur="0.4"/> in the box in the philosophy common room <pause dur="0.7"/> and somebody else was saying what about our essays <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> to which the answer is yes <pause dur="0.2"/> what about your essays indeed <pause dur="0.4"/> # i'll hope to be able to let you have them <pause dur="0.2"/> # next week <pause dur="1.7"/> # right <pause dur="1.0"/> now we said today that we'd talk <pause dur="0.2"/> about Kant <pause dur="1.4"/> in considering the three <pause dur="0.3"/> dominant strands of ethical thinking <pause dur="0.2"/> that emerged out of the break-up of the medieval synthesis <pause dur="0.9"/> i've sketched the appeal to pleasure <pause dur="1.1"/> with particular reference to utilitarianism <pause dur="1.4"/> # from # from Bentham onwards <pause dur="0.7"/> and last time i was talking about the appeal to moral insight <pause dur="0.3"/> from Butler's <pause dur="0.3"/> conscience <pause dur="0.4"/> to twentieth century <pause dur="0.2"/> intuitionism <pause dur="0.9"/> and there 
remains <pause dur="0.4"/> the appeal <pause dur="0.2"/> to law <pause dur="1.8"/> now first let's get some <pause dur="0.5"/> quite proper objections out of the way <pause dur="1.7"/> there are well known objections to conceiving of morality in terms of law <pause dur="1.5"/> it's misleading <pause dur="0.2"/> to compare <pause dur="1.7"/> # morality <pause dur="0.2"/> or moral laws with laws of nature <pause dur="0.9"/> because we no longer believe <pause dur="0.4"/> that the stars and <pause dur="0.3"/> other such bodies being subject to the laws of nature <pause dur="0.3"/> we no longer believe they're animate <pause dur="0.5"/> bodies <pause dur="0.9"/> # or animate beings who consent <pause dur="0.2"/> to obey <pause dur="1.2"/> their instructions <pause dur="2.3"/> it's also misleading <pause dur="0.8"/> to compare <pause dur="0.3"/> morality with <pause dur="0.2"/> the product of legislation <pause dur="0.4"/> since as we saw in an earlier lecture <pause dur="0.8"/> an act can be immoral <pause dur="0.2"/> without being illegal <pause dur="0.7"/> or may of course require <pause dur="0.2"/> what our conscience condemns <pause dur="1.6"/> and perhaps more important <pause dur="0.3"/> than all these <pause dur="0.7"/> legalisms it's sometimes called <pause dur="0.6"/> is a term for a recognized moral failing <pause dur="1.4"/> the scrupulous legalist <pause dur="0.4"/> will <pause dur="0.2"/> go to absurd lengths <pause dur="0.4"/> in fulfilling commandments to the letter <pause dur="1.2"/> # and the lax one <pause dur="0.6"/> will take advantage of every possible <pause dur="0.2"/> loophole <pause dur="0.5"/> and indeed <pause dur="0.2"/> the legalist may show both traits together <pause dur="1.2"/> and 
the fault of course lies precisely <pause dur="0.7"/> in the fact that duties are interpreted as if <pause dur="0.7"/> they consisted in obedience <pause dur="0.4"/> to a fixed <pause dur="0.2"/> and all sufficient <pause dur="0.2"/> code <pause dur="0.6"/> and as many of you will know the New Testament <pause dur="0.3"/> is <trunc>no</trunc> <pause dur="0.4"/> # notably severe <pause dur="0.6"/> on this sort of approach <pause dur="2.7"/> and <pause dur="0.3"/> another objection <pause dur="0.6"/> moral rules can conflict in particular situations <pause dur="0.4"/> we've already seen that <pause dur="1.4"/> and then of course one has to look if one's # <pause dur="0.4"/> thinking of morality in terms of rules or laws <pause dur="0.3"/> one needs to look for further rules to decide which to set aside <pause dur="1.1"/> and the resultant <trunc>elib</trunc> elaboration can get <pause dur="0.4"/> # very unrealistic <pause dur="0.7"/> and that incidentally is part of the attraction of something we've come across before and i'll raise again with you <pause dur="0.2"/> particularism <pause dur="0.6"/> sometimes called situation ethics where you don't look for rules or laws at all you say let's look to each particular case <pause dur="1.7"/> and the final objection that i'm just going to touch on <pause dur="0.6"/> if morality is wholly dependent <pause dur="0.2"/> upon a set of <pause dur="0.2"/> rules <pause dur="1.1"/> or laws <pause dur="0.7"/> it becomes difficult to describe those who live by very 
different codes from our own <pause dur="0.3"/> as <pause dur="0.2"/> moral <pause dur="0.2"/> or morally good <pause dur="0.6"/> but of course <pause dur="0.5"/> right from the beginning people are seen as the sophists saw <pause dur="0.5"/> that even quite alien and by our <pause dur="0.2"/> # light misguided codes <pause dur="0.5"/> may foster <pause dur="0.2"/> distinctive forms of virtue <pause dur="0.6"/> which perhaps are worthy of respect <pause dur="0.8"/> and certainly not just to be dismissed as moral errors committed in good faith <pause dur="1.8"/> so there are all those objections <pause dur="0.3"/> to thinking of morality in terms of law <pause dur="0.8"/> and for present purposes <pause dur="0.3"/> i'll accept them all <pause dur="1.0"/> right <pause dur="1.1"/> but <pause dur="0.4"/> even if we accept all this <pause dur="0.8"/> there is <pause dur="0.2"/> something i've left out there's one very important feature of moral judgements <pause dur="0.6"/> that thinking of morality in terms of law <pause dur="0.6"/> helps to bring out <pause dur="1.2"/> and this very general feature <pause dur="0.2"/> makes difficulties for what i've called moral <pause dur="0.2"/> particularism <pause dur="1.3"/> and the point is this <pause dur="1.1"/> just as laws <pause dur="0.2"/> are of universal <pause dur="0.4"/> application <pause dur="2.1"/> they enjoin <pause dur="0.3"/> conduct of a certain type in all circumstances of a certain type <pause dur="1.2"/> so <pause dur="0.4"/> moral judgements appear <pause dur="0.3"/> to have a universalist <pause dur="0.3"/> element <pause dur="2.1"/> and i think i can present the 
argument like this <pause dur="1.5"/> whenever we make <pause dur="0.5"/> whenever we make a moral judgement <pause dur="0.8"/> about <pause dur="0.3"/> for example <pause dur="0.4"/><kinesic desc="turns on overhead projector showing transparency" iterated="n"/> an act <pause dur="4.8"/><event desc="covers part of transparency" iterated="n"/> whenever we make <pause dur="0.2"/> a moral judgement <pause dur="0.3"/> # about something an act for example <pause dur="1.0"/> and this differentiated from just telling someone what to do <pause dur="0.3"/> issuing an imperative <pause dur="0.7"/> whenever we make a moral judgement about something call it an act <pause dur="0.4"/> we must make it <pause dur="0.4"/> because of something <pause dur="0.2"/> about <pause dur="0.4"/> the act <pause dur="0.7"/> the focus isn't right is it <pause dur="2.2"/><event desc="adjusts overhead projector" iterated="n"/> that's better <pause dur="1.8"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> <vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/><pause dur="1.8"/> and then it always makes sense to ask <pause dur="0.2"/> what this something is what is it about it <pause dur="0.9"/> that <pause dur="0.7"/> justifies that moral judgement <pause dur="1.0"/> now it may be difficult to put into words <pause dur="0.3"/> but <pause dur="0.3"/> in making a moral judgement <pause dur="0.2"/> rather than just saying do this <pause dur="0.5"/> you're saying that there's a reason <pause dur="1.6"/> now this feature of moral judgement as i say differentiates it just from simple <pause dur="0.2"/> commands simple imperatives <pause dur="1.1"/> so to every particular moral judgement <pause dur="0.8"/> it would appear <pause dur="0.6"/> there corresponds a universal judgement <pause dur="0.5"/> to the effect <pause dur="0.2"/> that a certain feature of the thing judged is <pause dur="0.6"/> so far as it goes <pause dur="0.4"/> a reason for making <pause dur="1.3"/> a 
certain judgement <pause dur="0.2"/> about it <pause dur="1.7"/> now that's an argument and i've put it up there <kinesic desc="indicates screen" iterated="n"/> which <pause dur="0.3"/> <trunc>e</trunc>  what with i'm calling for the moment universalists accept or universalism in morals <pause dur="0.6"/> universalists accept <pause dur="0.4"/> and particularists reject <pause dur="0.3"/> this argument <pause dur="2.1"/> let's just take it a little further give you an example <pause dur="0.2"/><vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.9"/> if i say that a particular act is good <pause dur="0.7"/> because oh i don't know <pause dur="0.3"/> # suppose we say because it's the act of <pause dur="0.2"/> helping a blind person across a road <pause dur="2.0"/> then <pause dur="0.2"/> i seem to be adhering to the universal judgement <pause dur="0.7"/> that it's good <pause dur="0.8"/> to help blind people across roads <pause dur="0.4"/> # assuming they desire our assistance <pause dur="0.8"/> # assuming that # you know <pause dur="0.3"/> they're not horribly lost and in fact <pause dur="0.2"/> they their destination is this side of the road <pause dur="0.3"/> all those other things <pause dur="0.4"/> if <pause dur="0.2"/> they desire properly our assistance then it's good to help blind people across roads appears to be the universal judgement <pause dur="0.5"/> that <pause dur="0.2"/> lies behind <pause dur="0.4"/> that was a good act <pause dur="0.2"/> because it was helping him across the road <pause dur="1.6"/> and that <pause dur="0.7"/> that universal judgement <pause dur="0.2"/> appears to be there <pause dur="0.7"/> we're not just 
talking about this particular person across this particular road <pause dur="1.5"/> so i say the people who accept that sort of example <pause dur="0.7"/> i can call for the present purposes universalists <pause dur="0.5"/> and particularists <pause dur="0.5"/> will reject it <pause dur="1.6"/> now a universalist <pause dur="0.4"/> is not committed to the view <pause dur="0.2"/> that it's a good act to help blind people across roads <pause dur="0.2"/> on all occasions <pause dur="0.5"/> just because it is on this <pause dur="0.8"/> you can find all sorts of circumstances under which it would not be <pause dur="0.2"/> obviously <pause dur="1.1"/> the universalist is only committed to the view that it would be a good act <pause dur="0.4"/> in the absence of something to make a difference <pause dur="0.4"/> from this one <pause dur="1.4"/> something more than the mere fact <pause dur="0.4"/> that it is different <pause dur="2.5"/> now <pause dur="0.6"/> this <pause dur="0.5"/> if you accept that <pause dur="1.4"/> this general feature of moral judgements <pause dur="1.2"/> can be used for interesting purposes <pause dur="0.4"/> and Kant effectively did accept it <pause dur="2.7"/> Kant <pause dur="0.4"/> provided # used this general feature of moral judgements <pause dur="0.4"/> to provide a test <pause dur="0.8"/> for <pause dur="0.2"/> the validity <pause dur="0.4"/> of particular <pause dur="0.4"/> moral judgements <pause dur="1.1"/><kinesic desc="reveals covered part of transparency" iterated="n"/> and so as one might say <pause dur="0.9"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> Kant <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/><vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/> <pause dur="0.2"/> <trunc>pr</trunc> uses the general form of moral judgements as i've 
just sketched them up there <pause dur="0.5"/> to provide <pause dur="0.3"/> a test #<pause dur="0.6"/> for their proper <pause dur="0.6"/> content <pause dur="3.2"/> and from this ethical premise about the nature of moral judgements <pause dur="0.6"/> he drew <pause dur="1.1"/> a moral conclusion <pause dur="1.5"/> and the general form of that moral conclusion <pause dur="0.5"/> he laid out <pause dur="0.3"/> in what he called his categorical imperative <pause dur="0.4"/> which has various versions i'll just give you <pause dur="0.4"/><kinesic desc="reveals covered part of transparency" iterated="n"/> perhaps <pause dur="0.4"/> the <pause dur="0.3"/> most important one <pause dur="1.6"/> Kant's categorical imperative <pause dur="0.5"/> <reading>act only on that maxim <pause dur="0.8"/> through which you can at the same time will <pause dur="0.5"/> that it should become <pause dur="0.3"/> a universal <pause dur="0.2"/> law</reading> <pause dur="8.9"/> and of course <pause dur="0.7"/> as you will see it's a <pause dur="0.2"/> rather formal way of putting it <pause dur="0.6"/> but it has much in common with something that's not formal at all the famous golden rule <pause dur="1.0"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> do unto others <pause dur="0.2"/> as you would they did unto you <pause dur="4.9"/> now <pause dur="0.7"/> there seems to be at least <pause dur="0.4"/> a tolerable plausibility <pause dur="1.2"/> in terms of widespread intuitions <pause dur="1.0"/> # for it seems a reasonable plausibility for regarding this <pause dur="0.2"/> as the <pause dur="0.6"/> a anyhow <pause dur="0.2"/> foundation stone <pause dur="0.3"/> of morality <pause dur="1.5"/> it is a powerful argument in many cases <pause dur="0.7"/> if a person is contemplating some <pause dur="0.5"/> act <pause dur="1.3"/> to ask <pause dur="0.2"/> her 
or him <pause dur="0.2"/> what it is about the act <pause dur="0.2"/> which makes them call it <pause dur="0.4"/> right <pause dur="0.7"/> and whether if some other act <pause dur="0.2"/> possessed those same features <pause dur="0.7"/> but their own role in it <pause dur="0.2"/> were different <pause dur="1.4"/> would <pause dur="0.5"/> she or he judge <pause dur="0.2"/> in the same way <pause dur="3.6"/> of course <pause dur="0.2"/> whether or not they would still prefer to act in this way remains a matter about which <pause dur="0.2"/> they <pause dur="0.3"/> may still have to make up their minds <pause dur="1.2"/> though one might still distinguish between silly and sensible choices <pause dur="0.6"/> so there's still freedom of moral decision <pause dur="0.4"/> and action <pause dur="1.0"/> but it's not irrelevant <pause dur="0.9"/> to ask the question <pause dur="1.0"/> what if the roles <pause dur="0.3"/> were reversed <pause dur="5.3"/> now <pause dur="1.0"/> this <pause dur="0.3"/> universalist <pause dur="0.5"/> feature <pause dur="0.7"/> of moral judgements <pause dur="2.5"/> # # does though it does as i say embody a <pause dur="1.2"/> central feature <pause dur="0.6"/> of laws in general <pause dur="1.9"/> is not what <pause dur="0.2"/> is usually being pointed to when people talk about laws of nature <pause dur="0.3"/> so he's not talking about laws of nature <pause dur="0.2"/> for reasons i'll explain shortly he's talking about what he calls laws of freedom <pause dur="2.1"/> Kant didn't think of himself as working out laws of nature <pause dur="1.9"/> he <pause dur="0.3"/> sees these as a function not of the way that 
nature has to go <pause dur="0.4"/> but of what we are free <pause dur="0.7"/> to <pause dur="0.3"/> act on <pause dur="0.2"/> so he calls them laws of freedom <pause dur="0.8"/> obscure terminology and i'll explain it a bit <pause dur="4.9"/> now i think to explain it i just need to go back slightly <pause dur="1.3"/> one one of the criticisms that i <pause dur="0.7"/> raised <pause dur="0.2"/> a few minutes ago <pause dur="0.8"/> # to thinking of morality in terms of law <pause dur="1.4"/> is that it's misleading <pause dur="0.3"/> to compare morality <pause dur="0.5"/> to a law of nature in the scientific sense <pause dur="1.3"/> for we no longer suppose <pause dur="0.4"/> that <pause dur="0.7"/> various items stones stars various bodies <pause dur="0.3"/> we no longer think of them <pause dur="0.5"/> as in some sense animate beings <pause dur="0.6"/> who consent to obey their instructions <pause dur="0.5"/> and of course in days when people thought of the order of nature <pause dur="0.3"/> as following the orders of a divine lawgiver <pause dur="0.4"/> who was also the source of the moral law <pause dur="0.6"/> then that analogy made a lot of sense <pause dur="1.8"/> human beings on that traditional account <pause dur="0.6"/> were unlike the rest of the created order <pause dur="1.2"/> in that <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> we were given freedom to choose <pause dur="0.4"/> whether or not <pause dur="0.2"/> to obey <pause dur="0.2"/> the divine laws <pause dur="0.6"/> whereas the rest of creation <pause dur="0.6"/> has no choice <pause dur="2.0"/> in this freedom <pause dur="0.8"/> lies the 
possibility of morality <pause dur="0.2"/> and hence of virtue <pause dur="0.9"/> for virtue <pause dur="0.9"/> virtue lies in freely <pause dur="0.4"/> obeying <pause dur="0.4"/> the laws of God <pause dur="2.6"/> and so <pause dur="0.2"/> for men <pause dur="0.4"/> the law of God is seen <pause dur="0.3"/> under the aspect of a moral law <pause dur="0.9"/> whereas for the rest of creation <pause dur="0.2"/> law is a matter of necessity <pause dur="0.3"/> i take it that model is fairly familiar to you think of <pause dur="0.8"/> the whole universe is under the law of God <pause dur="0.5"/> what distinguishes human beings from the rest of creation we have some or do we have free will <pause dur="0.2"/> so we can decide <pause dur="0.3"/> in within a restricted range <pause dur="0.2"/> whether to set ourselves within or outside the law of God not completely <pause dur="0.2"/> we can't defy the law of gravity or if we do we'll end up with broken bones or death <pause dur="0.4"/> but there are certain <pause dur="0.2"/> moral laws <pause dur="0.2"/> that we can defy <pause dur="0.4"/> and if we do <pause dur="0.2"/> that's what's called sin <pause dur="0.6"/> and we have freedom to sin that that model is familiar <pause dur="0.3"/> talking about the moral law as giving <pause dur="0.3"/> the laws which are made possible by human freedom <pause dur="0.9"/> makes a form of sense <pause dur="0.2"/> in that framework <pause dur="2.0"/> # <pause dur="0.8"/> now <pause dur="0.8"/> since Newton <pause dur="1.5"/> # we've not <pause dur="0.5"/> really thought <pause dur="0.2"/> of laws of nature in 
this way <pause dur="2.8"/> science <pause dur="0.4"/> has become independent <pause dur="0.3"/> of religion and of theology <pause dur="1.9"/> we tend to think of scientific laws of nature now much more as a matter of statistical regularities <pause dur="1.4"/> and i think what we see in Kant <pause dur="0.9"/> is perhaps <pause dur="3.4"/> an attempt to salvage what can be salvaged of the general picture i've just sketched <pause dur="1.3"/> # that general picture of morality as embodying laws of freedom <pause dur="0.5"/> what can you salvage from that when the old prescientific notion of a law of nature <pause dur="0.5"/> in terms of obedience to orders <pause dur="0.3"/> has disappeared <pause dur="0.5"/> how can you do this <pause dur="0.6"/> how can you <trunc>s</trunc> how can you to what extent can you salvage this <pause dur="0.4"/> without theological <pause dur="0.5"/> premises <pause dur="1.2"/> and that's really what Kant's trying to do <pause dur="0.7"/> and <pause dur="0.4"/> i think the argument <pause dur="0.4"/> can be reasonably displayed like this <pause dur="3.1"/> there were two <pause dur="1.5"/> quite closely connected <pause dur="0.6"/> differences <pause dur="0.8"/> between <pause dur="0.3"/> moral laws <pause dur="0.5"/> and laws <pause dur="0.5"/> of nature <pause dur="1.7"/> one difference plainly is <pause dur="0.2"/> our subjectivity <pause dur="1.6"/> # we have a subjective sense of obligation to obey moral laws <pause dur="1.2"/> but none <pause dur="0.8"/> to obey <pause dur="0.3"/> laws <pause dur="0.2"/> of nature <pause dur="1.0"/> we don't feel any moral obligation <pause dur="0.4"/> to obey the law

categorical imperative <pause dur="1.0"/> a maxim <pause dur="0.3"/> which you can will <pause dur="0.4"/> that it should become <pause dur="0.5"/> universal <pause dur="5.1"/> let's explain this further <pause dur="4.1"/> Kant held <pause dur="0.6"/> and it seems on the face of it <pause dur="0.2"/> not unreasonable <pause dur="1.0"/> that the starting point <pause dur="0.4"/> of <pause dur="0.2"/> moral philosophy <pause dur="1.0"/> must be the ordinary deliverances of <pause dur="1.1"/> our moral understanding <pause dur="1.7"/> uncorrupted preferably by philosophy so far as that's possible <pause dur="1.9"/> otherwise the danger is <pause dur="0.3"/> that what will be studied won't be morality but something else <pause dur="0.9"/> probably a construction of the thinker's own invention start with what you actually recognize in your own experience <pause dur="1.4"/> well <pause dur="1.3"/> at a very <pause dur="0.2"/> commonsensical level how do we <pause dur="0.6"/> ordinarily distinguish <pause dur="0.6"/> moral <pause dur="0.5"/> precepts <pause dur="0.2"/> from other ones <pause dur="2.4"/> well according to Kant we normally distinguish them <pause dur="1.1"/> # from precepts <pause dur="0.3"/> which are designed to promote our pleasure or our advantage we say if that may bring me pleasure that may bring me advantage but is it right <pause dur="0.3"/> we say we can separate them out <pause dur="0.3"/> right <pause dur="3.7"/> just because <pause dur="0.3"/> an action brings about something we want <pause dur="0.8"/> doesn't show that it's moral 
again i'm talking at the level of common sense at the moment we distinguish between <pause dur="0.5"/> a moral considerations <pause dur="0.4"/> and these other ones <pause dur="0.8"/> associated with <pause dur="0.5"/> Watts <pause dur="0.5"/> and you can see that in making this move <pause dur="0.2"/> i'm already beginning to move away from certain forms of utilitarianism <pause dur="5.6"/> when <pause dur="0.8"/> we think of precepts which are designed to promote our pleasure or our advantage to bring about something we want <pause dur="1.6"/> we normally say well <pause dur="0.2"/> do this <pause dur="0.2"/> if <pause dur="0.2"/> you have that <pause dur="0.7"/> goal <pause dur="0.2"/> in mind <pause dur="1.2"/> yeah <pause dur="0.6"/> if you want <pause dur="0.2"/> to be rich <pause dur="1.3"/> then <pause dur="0.6"/> follow this <pause dur="0.3"/> regimen <pause dur="2.4"/> if you <pause dur="1.0"/> want that form of pleasure <pause dur="0.2"/> then <pause dur="0.2"/> do this <pause dur="0.3"/> and so on <pause dur="1.8"/> these are <pause dur="1.0"/> these do thises <pause dur="0.5"/> are imperatives but they're hypothetical imperatives <pause dur="0.2"/> i've touched on this earlier this term <pause dur="0.3"/> a hypothetical imperative is one that's governed by an if clause <pause dur="0.3"/> if you want to do something <pause dur="0.3"/> then <pause dur="0.7"/> do X <pause dur="0.5"/> right that's a hypothetical imperative <pause dur="0.9"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> where # the <trunc>hypo</trunc> where the hypothesis comes from relates to your desires or your wants or whatever <pause dur="0.3"/> and these may be given <pause dur="0.3"/> indeed by <pause dur="0.3"/> # your <trunc>s</trunc> # by by your # bodily <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> # pressures <pause dur="7.3"/> press the switch <pause dur="0.2"/> if you want the light to go on <pause dur="1.1"/> you ought to earn some money <pause dur="0.2"/> if you want to get on in life <pause dur="0.9"/> 
okay <pause dur="1.9"/> Kant's point is <pause dur="0.3"/> that whilst <pause dur="0.3"/> <trunc>a</trunc> as a matter of practical reason <pause dur="1.1"/> these are perfectly acceptable and we use them all the time of course <pause dur="0.3"/> they're not moral reasons <pause dur="2.4"/> not to say they're wrong but they're just not moral ones <pause dur="0.7"/> in distinctively moral situations these sorts of hypotheticals are out of place <pause dur="2.6"/> in a moral situation we say you or possibly i <pause dur="0.4"/> ought <pause dur="0.2"/> or ought not to do such and such <pause dur="1.0"/> and not <pause dur="1.3"/> if you want X or Y <pause dur="1.1"/> but rather <pause dur="0.2"/> there's no reason of that sort you just ought <pause dur="0.8"/> and this there's no reason <pause dur="0.3"/> is designed <pause dur="0.2"/> to <pause dur="0.2"/> exclude these sorts of appeals <pause dur="0.4"/> to consequences <pause dur="1.2"/> so <pause dur="0.3"/> common sense reflection <pause dur="0.9"/> uncorrupted by philosophy <pause dur="0.4"/> it is suggested <pause dur="0.7"/> indicates <pause dur="0.3"/> that duty <pause dur="0.4"/> is distinct <pause dur="0.2"/> from pleasure <pause dur="0.2"/> or indeed utility <pause dur="2.4"/> further Kant thinks <pause dur="0.5"/> that <pause dur="1.0"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> being prepared to follow the dictates of <pause dur="0.2"/> morality as so understood <pause dur="0.9"/> being prepared to do what you know you ought to do <pause dur="0.9"/> moral virtue <pause dur="0.4"/> or what he calls good will <pause dur="0.9"/> what's sometimes called <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> conscientiousness that is acting out of a recognition of duty <pause dur="1.0"/> according to Kant <pause dur="0.8"/> 
being prepared to do that having a good will <pause dur="0.3"/> being prepared to and actually acting <pause dur="0.5"/> out of a recognition of <pause dur="0.3"/> what is your duty <pause dur="0.8"/> is <pause dur="0.5"/> in a a very important sense <pause dur="0.2"/> for Kant <pause dur="0.2"/> the supreme good <pause dur="1.8"/> to which everything else <pause dur="1.2"/> is to be <pause dur="0.6"/><kinesic desc="reveals covered part of transparency" iterated="n"/> subordinated <pause dur="1.6"/> so on this account <pause dur="1.3"/> the highest good is that of the good will <pause dur="0.8"/> which seeks to act according to the dictates <pause dur="0.5"/> of the moral law <pause dur="1.2"/> that is not to say that doing that doesn't have consequences <pause dur="0.5"/> of course everything that you do has consequences <pause dur="0.9"/> but the sort of effect or the reward of virtue <pause dur="1.2"/> is not <pause dur="0.3"/> happiness <pause dur="1.3"/> as # <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> <vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/> <pause dur="0.3"/> Aristotle said a long time ago <pause dur="0.7"/> he who says <pause dur="0.2"/> that a man is happy if only he be good <pause dur="1.1"/> even when he's being tortured on the rack <pause dur="0.3"/> is talking nonsense whether he knows it or not <pause dur="0.8"/> it may be that someone resisting their torturers because they know they <pause dur="0.2"/> it is their duty to # keep faith with their comrades <pause dur="0.3"/> may be doing what they believe to be or even know to be the right thing <pause dur="0.8"/> is not to say that that's giving them happiness <pause dur="0.5"/> <shift feature="voice" new="laugh"/>it may not at 
all <pause dur="0.4"/> it may give them <shift feature="voice" new="normal"/><pause dur="0.3"/> the reverse of anything that could be plausibly called happiness <pause dur="0.4"/> but they are retaining <pause dur="0.9"/> their dignity <pause dur="0.8"/> and they are showing that degree of freedom <pause dur="0.6"/> of refusing <pause dur="0.5"/> to be <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="1.1"/> # forced to do what the torturers <pause dur="0.3"/> are wanting it may end in their death <pause dur="0.2"/> sure <pause dur="0.5"/> but that is a choice yet again <pause dur="0.8"/> of course <pause dur="0.8"/> it's said <pause dur="0.3"/> that everybody <pause dur="0.6"/> may be i don't know but with a skilled torturer <pause dur="0.5"/> forced to submit <pause dur="0.4"/> that may be true and if it is true that removes their freedom <pause dur="1.5"/> but the reward of virtue <pause dur="0.2"/> certainly <pause dur="0.2"/> is not going to be happiness in all circumstances we hope it will in many <pause dur="1.0"/> but <pause dur="0.6"/> we need to go right back to that distinction i mentioned to you between Plato and Aristotle <pause dur="0.4"/> Aristotle is indeed concerned with <pause dur="0.4"/> finding a form of society where in general happiness <pause dur="0.2"/> goes together with virtue <pause dur="1.0"/> Plato who remembers <pause dur="0.4"/> person <pause dur="0.4"/> that he respected most in all the whole world Socrates <pause dur="0.5"/> obeying his duty was <trunc>f</trunc> was executed <pause dur="0.6"/> says well <pause dur="0.9"/> one needs to give an account of <pause dur="1.0"/> how one should live which takes account of <pause dur="0.2"/> the situation <pause dur="0.2"/> in 
which the good person <pause dur="0.2"/> may be made <pause dur="0.5"/> to drink the hemlock <pause dur="1.3"/> if you're going to say that Socrates remains happy <pause dur="0.2"/> then you're going to redefine happiness in quite a significant way <pause dur="1.3"/><vocal desc="sniff" iterated="n"/> <pause dur="0.7"/> so <pause dur="0.7"/> this again is fairly common sense reflection <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> that <pause dur="0.6"/> the <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.9"/> # <pause dur="1.4"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> <trunc>th</trunc> <trunc>th</trunc> good will <pause dur="1.5"/> # in a certain sense <pause dur="0.3"/> is what <pause dur="0.3"/> we may quite reasonably subordinate <pause dur="0.2"/> the other values to and <pause dur="0.5"/> of course often we don't <pause dur="0.5"/> but we respect the person <pause dur="0.2"/> who stands up for what they believe to be right <pause dur="1.1"/> despite loss <pause dur="1.1"/> of <pause dur="1.1"/> all the normal goals we don't always reckon that we could do that but we can see the value in it <pause dur="3.4"/> other things that we ought and really and quite properly call good <pause dur="0.5"/> riches talents <pause dur="0.2"/> worldly wisdom <pause dur="0.3"/> comfort and so on <pause dur="0.7"/> they are only good as far as Kant's concerned on <trunc>concer</trunc> # <trunc>o</trunc> on condition that they are used compatibly <pause dur="0.2"/> with a good will <pause dur="1.0"/> when <pause dur="0.4"/> riches or talents worldly wisdom or anything else <pause dur="0.3"/> are used maliciously <pause dur="0.5"/> by a bad will <pause dur="1.0"/> the evil of the situation is greater <pause dur="0.5"/> than if the malicious person <pause dur="0.3"/> were less well <pause dur="0.7"/> endowed <pause dur="1.5"/> that after all is 
why in mythology <pause dur="0.3"/> the devil <pause dur="0.3"/> is a fallen <pause dur="0.2"/> angel <pause dur="2.7"/> so on this account then <pause dur="0.5"/> we are both <pause dur="0.6"/> animals plainly <pause dur="0.4"/> and also rational beings <pause dur="1.1"/> and in so far as we are rational because we are rational beings <pause dur="0.8"/> we can recognize ourselves as subject to the moral law <pause dur="1.7"/> the moral law <pause dur="0.4"/> expresses not <pause dur="0.2"/> hypothetical imperatives of prudence <pause dur="1.3"/> but categorical imperatives <pause dur="0.5"/> prescribing actions <pause dur="0.4"/> regardless of the informations <pause dur="0.2"/> of our animal nature <pause dur="1.9"/> the highest good <pause dur="0.2"/> is that of the good will <pause dur="0.8"/> if you like conscientiousness but i don't like that as a translation because the word's come down in the world <pause dur="0.8"/> and good will attempts to act according to the dictates of the moral law <pause dur="2.1"/> in so far as we are moral <pause dur="0.5"/> we can form our will to the moral law <pause dur="0.9"/> acting as reason tells us <pause dur="0.9"/> and to that extent free <pause dur="0.3"/> of our purely animal <pause dur="0.2"/> nature <pause dur="0.3"/> our animal nature plainly is subject to the regularities of the laws of nature <pause dur="1.8"/> in so far as we are <pause dur="0.2"/> immoral <pause dur="1.0"/> we are <pause dur="0.4"/> irrational <pause dur="0.3"/> slaves to our natural <pause dur="0.2"/> inclinations <pause dur="1.0"/> and that's why <pause dur="0.5"/> the capacity

articulates the laws of freedom <pause dur="1.2"/> which a rational being <pause dur="0.3"/> imposes <pause dur="0.2"/> on her or his <pause dur="0.2"/> own actions <pause dur="0.8"/> and expect other rational beings to recognize <pause dur="0.4"/> and obey <pause dur="2.7"/> and the justification for these rules <pause dur="0.8"/> lies in the fact that moral rules are those which can be followed consistently <pause dur="0.4"/> by all rational beings <pause dur="0.9"/> so <pause dur="0.4"/> to determine whether my action is right <pause dur="0.4"/> my proposed action perhaps is right <pause dur="0.8"/> i have only to consider <pause dur="0.5"/> whether the principal upon which it's based <pause dur="0.3"/> what Kant calls the maxim <pause dur="0.5"/> i need to consider whether the principal upon which my action is based <pause dur="1.2"/> is such <pause dur="0.4"/> that i could will that that maxim become a universal law <pause dur="0.5"/> governing not merely this particular action of mine <pause dur="0.7"/> but the action of all agents similarly <pause dur="0.5"/> circumstanced <pause dur="1.8"/> and an action is only <pause dur="0.2"/> permissible <pause dur="0.8"/> for me <pause dur="1.2"/> if it is permissible <pause dur="0.3"/> for anyone <pause dur="0.2"/> in my situation <pause dur="2.0"/> to put it <pause dur="0.8"/> in a very simple <pause dur="0.2"/> and commonsensical fashion <pause dur="1.1"/> moral rules hold <pause dur="0.5"/> without <pause dur="0.2"/> distinction <pause dur="0.4"/> of persons <pause dur="1.2"/> not without distinction of position <pause dur="0.2"/> of course <pause dur="0.3"/> people may have a certain 
role and therefore have certain responsibilities for them <pause dur="0.4"/> but <pause dur="0.9"/> that's the position <pause dur="0.3"/> if you were in that position rather than her <pause dur="0.3"/> then you would have that similar role <pause dur="0.9"/> now <pause dur="0.5"/> plainly some of these are physical impossibilities <pause dur="0.5"/> unless <pause dur="0.2"/> # <vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/> # unless science gets a move on pretty fast <pause dur="0.3"/> i'll never be able to be a mother <pause dur="0.5"/> but <pause dur="0.4"/> that's # that's a misfortune of mine no doubt <pause dur="0.6"/> but while rational being <pause dur="0.9"/> it is merely a contingency <pause dur="4.7"/> it'll probably help <pause dur="0.6"/> if i took <pause dur="0.2"/> one of Kant's own <pause dur="0.2"/> examples <pause dur="0.8"/> and i'll follow the summary <pause dur="0.4"/> which is a quite nice and elegant summary <pause dur="0.4"/> # provided by Alasdair MacIntyre <pause dur="0.2"/> in the book i recommended A Short History of Ethics <pause dur="1.7"/> # suppose i'm tempted <pause dur="0.2"/> to break a promise <pause dur="1.8"/> the maxim <pause dur="0.6"/> on which i'm considering action <pause dur="0.6"/> might be # formulated as <pause dur="0.5"/> i may always break a promise when it's in my interest to do so <pause dur="0.9"/> we all know people who seem to act on that <pause dur="1.7"/> now <pause dur="0.2"/> can i consistently will <pause dur="0.4"/> that this precept <pause dur="0.7"/> i may always break a promise when it's in my interest to do so <pause dur="0.7"/> can i consistently will that this

to do so <pause dur="0.7"/> to will <pause dur="0.4"/> # that this precept should be universalized <pause dur="0.3"/> is to will both that promise keeping as a practice should continue <pause dur="0.5"/> and also <pause dur="0.4"/> that it should not <pause dur="1.8"/> so <pause dur="0.5"/> i cannot universalize this precept consistently <pause dur="0.9"/> and so <pause dur="0.2"/> it cannot be a true moral rule <pause dur="1.7"/> think through the consequence of universalizability <pause dur="0.2"/> and in this particular instance you actually lodge yourself in a self-contradiction <pause dur="2.7"/> and that is indeed # i i'm quoting or citing MacIntyre but it is in fact # # one of Kant's leading examples and it's quite an interesting one <pause dur="4.4"/> so <pause dur="0.2"/> on this account i can't universalize <pause dur="0.2"/> that precept <pause dur="0.3"/> and so it cannot be a true moral rule <pause dur="0.2"/> in accordance with the categorical imperative <pause dur="0.8"/> on the other hand <pause dur="0.6"/> a rule such as do not make false promises <pause dur="0.8"/> can <pause dur="0.2"/> in principle be followed without exception <pause dur="1.5"/> can that is in the logical sense <pause dur="0.6"/> and thus <pause dur="0.6"/> may qualify <pause dur="0.3"/> as a moral <pause dur="0.3"/> duty <pause dur="1.4"/> okay so far <pause dur="3.0"/> so <pause dur="1.3"/> in <pause dur="0.2"/> determining <pause dur="0.5"/> what the moral law <pause dur="0.2"/> commands <pause dur="0.7"/> i have initially at my disposal <pause dur="0.4"/> no other resources <pause dur="0.3"/> than <pause dur="0.2"/> that it must be 
universalizable <pause dur="0.6"/> and that is <pause dur="0.2"/> applied <pause dur="0.4"/> impartially <pause dur="2.7"/> but of course in practice <pause dur="0.8"/> this criterion is held <pause dur="0.2"/> to carry others with it <pause dur="0.3"/> and Kant thinks it does <pause dur="1.5"/> if the moral law <pause dur="0.2"/> applies without distinction of persons <pause dur="0.9"/> it follows says Kant <pause dur="0.6"/> that i must treat <pause dur="0.2"/> all human beings <pause dur="0.3"/> as equally entitled to rights under it <pause dur="1.1"/> must treat them as persons <pause dur="0.4"/> too <pause dur="3.5"/> and therefore <pause dur="1.5"/> i must regard other people <pause dur="0.3"/> as ends <pause dur="0.2"/> in themselves <pause dur="0.8"/> not just means to my own ends if they are centres of moral agency <pause dur="0.5"/> as i am <pause dur="0.9"/> then we're in the same boat <pause dur="1.7"/> and so <pause dur="0.3"/> since # the moral law applies without distinction of persons <pause dur="0.4"/> all moral agents <pause dur="0.2"/> are ends in themselves so another version <pause dur="0.6"/> of the categorical imperative <pause dur="0.6"/> is # <pause dur="0.4"/> treat <pause dur="0.2"/> # other persons <pause dur="0.5"/> # never as means <pause dur="0.3"/> but only <pause dur="0.4"/> as ends <pause dur="2.8"/> there are about five different versions i'm not going to go through all of them you'll find them laid out <pause dur="0.2"/> in the material i circulated # <pause dur="0.3"/> last time <pause dur="2.4"/> at the moment i'm trying to get at the nerve of what's going on here <pause dur="4.1"/> further <pause dur="2.5"/> once i recognize <pause dur="1.4"/> that other people are morally <pause dur="0.7"/> in the 
same position as i am myself <pause dur="2.0"/> once i recognize that we all belong to the same moral community <pause dur="0.2"/> in virtue of our being rational agents <pause dur="1.1"/> and therefore under the aegis of the moral law <pause dur="0.3"/> and of course the criterion for being a moral agent is <pause dur="0.3"/> potential <trunc>pot</trunc> # # capacity <pause dur="0.4"/> to <pause dur="0.4"/> recognize <pause dur="0.5"/> # and act on maxims that we can universalize <pause dur="1.6"/> once we recognize that i'm in the same position <pause dur="0.4"/> as others <pause dur="1.1"/> i recognize both <pause dur="0.5"/> that i can <pause dur="0.2"/> legitimately <pause dur="0.8"/> pursue those of my purposes <pause dur="0.4"/> that do not conflict with the moral law <pause dur="2.1"/> okay if it doesn't conflict with the moral law i can follow those purposes <pause dur="0.3"/> and therefore <pause dur="0.4"/> i have a duty <pause dur="0.5"/> to facilitate the likely pursuit <pause dur="0.3"/> on the part <pause dur="0.3"/> of my fellows <pause dur="1.2"/> and so in another version of the categorical imperative <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> Kant speaks of what he calls the kingdom of ends the point about kingdom is it's a form of <pause dur="0.3"/> polity not there has to be a literal king <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> the notion of a community in which <pause dur="0.4"/> each sees a responsibility to facilitate each other's <pause dur="0.3"/> ends <pause dur="3.6"/> well <pause dur="0.6"/> so much <pause dur="0.2"/> for the moment <pause dur="0.6"/> for <pause dur="1.0"/> 
exposition <pause dur="3.9"/> and although it is <pause dur="0.6"/> more complicated as i say there are five different versions of the categorical imperative and i've only touched on three <pause dur="0.6"/> # so you can get the detail <pause dur="0.3"/> from that Paton summary <pause dur="1.8"/> the main line of thinking <pause dur="0.6"/> is as i've laid it out <pause dur="2.9"/> and i think there is a great deal <pause dur="0.2"/> to be learned from Kant's ethical thinking <pause dur="1.2"/> and indeed Kant is one of the great masters of modern philosophy <pause dur="0.4"/> and his moral thinking has provided the dominant image <pause dur="0.5"/> for most subsequent debate <pause dur="0.6"/> and # i should mention i mentioned right at the beginning of term that the words ethical and moral were used in a lot of different ways <pause dur="0.4"/> i told you the way i wanted to use it but i said there was another way <pause dur="0.3"/> where <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> morality is seen as a subclass of ethics and ethics is seen as the general # enquiry into how one should live <pause dur="0.8"/> <vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/> and the subclass some people have picked out as being # <pause dur="0.7"/> # morality <pause dur="0.2"/> is precisely that subclass picked out by Kant <pause dur="0.4"/> those considerations subject to <pause dur="1.0"/> universalizability <pause dur="0.6"/> in Kant's 
fashion <pause dur="0.3"/> that is # # those of you who've read # <pause dur="0.4"/> Bernard Williams' book Ethics and the Limits of Philosophy <pause dur="0.3"/> where he criticizes morality <pause dur="0.9"/> but defends ethics <pause dur="0.6"/> he's saying within the sphere of practical reasoning <pause dur="1.0"/> the Kantian model that i've been sketching is deeply flawed and we should move away from it <pause dur="0.4"/> yes he says Kant is dead right it does capture many of our central intuitions <pause dur="0.3"/> which have arisen out of a historical context <pause dur="0.3"/> and that historical context is damaging <pause dur="0.4"/> and those of you who are into Nietzsche in a big way <pause dur="0.2"/> who sees himself as an immoralist <pause dur="0.3"/> what does he mean by morality when he describes himself as an immoralist given that he clearly has his own views <pause dur="0.2"/> about how to live <pause dur="0.2"/> nobody and so on <pause dur="0.6"/> it's Kant he once again has in his sights <pause dur="0.3"/> Kant as providing <pause dur="0.2"/> the clearest model of what <pause dur="0.2"/> the intuitions of morality <pause dur="0.5"/> amount to <pause dur="0.3"/> and Nietzsche has a <pause dur="0.5"/> a slightly curious story <pause dur="0.6"/> where # he # relates this back to # the history of Christianity and the <trunc>christiani</trunc> and the history of <pause dur="0.6"/> classical Greece <pause dur="0.4"/> # 
which is <pause dur="0.5"/> flawed in a number of ways <pause dur="0.4"/> leave the history aside for the moment <pause dur="0.5"/> again <pause dur="0.2"/> # <trunc>h</trunc> <trunc>h</trunc> what <trunc>i</trunc> however it came about <pause dur="0.6"/> the model of morality <pause dur="0.5"/> with which <pause dur="0.4"/> Kant is operating <pause dur="0.2"/> provides a recognizable model today <pause dur="0.3"/> about which there is a good deal of debate <pause dur="0.3"/> and Kant as i say <pause dur="0.3"/> focuses that <pause dur="0.6"/> # supremely well <pause dur="2.1"/> # <pause dur="0.9"/> there are however <pause dur="1.3"/> many difficulties <pause dur="0.4"/> both external to the system people can criticize from outside and also internal to it <pause dur="1.0"/> and i'm just going to in the closing minutes of this lecture mention four <pause dur="1.6"/> first <pause dur="1.5"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> the insistence on the fundamental principle of morality being categorical <pause dur="1.8"/> not a hypothetical imperative <pause dur="0.7"/> you may well challenge <pause dur="1.9"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> and that's precisely what people who say morality is <pause dur="0.3"/> a defective subclass within ethics more generally will often say <pause dur="0.9"/> you may certainly the notion of duty <pause dur="0.3"/> detached from any particular role <pause dur="1.1"/> in the singular rather than the plural what is my duty not what are my duties as such and such the notion of duty <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> is <pause dur="0.5"/> one often found in popular thinking sure <pause dur="0.6"/> but 
historically it only emerged a century or so before Kant <pause dur="1.1"/> and it's  arguable <pause dur="0.2"/> that it only represents the ghost of a dead concept <pause dur="0.6"/> that only lived when embedded in particular social situations <pause dur="0.4"/> which was disintegrating by Kant's time <pause dur="0.3"/> and have disintegrated by now <pause dur="1.9"/> perhaps <pause dur="0.3"/> someone said <pause dur="0.4"/> Kant's duty is rather like that concept of decay justice <pause dur="0.7"/> in the sophist's time <pause dur="0.2"/> it at this stage remained a central moral notion <pause dur="0.5"/> everyone agreed that justice was a good thing <pause dur="0.6"/> but the descriptive content <pause dur="0.2"/> had been eroded by social change <pause dur="1.5"/> perhaps the notion of duty <pause dur="0.2"/> people say <pause dur="0.4"/> made good sense in a feudal set-up <pause dur="0.5"/> where everybody had their respective rights and duties <pause dur="1.1"/> and this provided the framework within which everyone lived their lives <pause dur="0.8"/> so it's clear what your duties are and it's best to fulfill them <pause dur="0.9"/> but the shift to thinking of duty in the singular <pause dur="0.5"/> out of any such social context <pause dur="0.5"/> empties that concept <pause dur="0.3"/> of all <pause dur="0.2"/> significance <pause dur="1.0"/> and the refusal to give any reason for the 
dictates of the moral law <pause dur="0.2"/> it's categorical you just ought <pause dur="1.2"/> reflects a collapse of the moral community <pause dur="0.6"/> not <pause dur="0.3"/> as Kant thinks the key to all moral thinking <pause dur="0.5"/> and that line of # <pause dur="0.2"/> argument you'll find in MacIntyre both in the book i've mentioned <pause dur="0.3"/> and in subsequent writings such as After Virtue <pause dur="1.9"/> that's the first objection the notion of duty <pause dur="0.2"/> is empty <pause dur="1.6"/> second <pause dur="0.3"/> it is possible to object to Kant's doctrine <pause dur="0.2"/> that it's my duty to act according to the imperative <pause dur="0.2"/> and not look to the consequences might say consequences matter <pause dur="1.7"/> Kant for example says <pause dur="0.2"/> it's categorically binding on us we ought not to tell lies <pause dur="1.4"/> and when i've discerned a categorical imperative i've discerned a rule with no exceptions <pause dur="1.3"/> so i ought not says Kant to tell a lie <pause dur="0.3"/> even from benevolent motives <pause dur="1.8"/> but what if i'm to save a potential victim from a murderer <pause dur="1.4"/> some might <pause dur="0.4"/> say no <pause dur="0.5"/> the insistence on keeping one's own soul pure <pause dur="0.2"/> at the expense of others <pause dur="0.2"/> is grossly <pause dur="0.2"/> immoral <pause dur="2.0"/> there's an old slogan <pause dur="0.9"/> <distinct lang="la">fiat justitia</distinct> <pause dur="0.4"/> <distinct lang="la">fiat justitia ruat caelum</distinct> <pause dur="0.8"/> 
approximately let justice be done <pause dur="0.5"/> though the heavens fall <pause dur="0.9"/> fits in with Kant beautifully <pause dur="1.5"/> there is however <pause dur="0.4"/> a well known and equally ancient <pause dur="0.2"/> retort <pause dur="1.3"/> if the heavens fall <pause dur="1.1"/> justice won't be done <pause dur="2.3"/> there is <pause dur="0.4"/> many would say a genuine <pause dur="0.2"/> dilemma here <pause dur="0.8"/> which Kant is <trunc>insensiv</trunc> to # is insensitive to <pause dur="0.3"/> sometimes consequences can override <pause dur="0.3"/> what Kant would see as the moral law <pause dur="0.2"/> and surely it is blind <pause dur="0.3"/> to ignore it <pause dur="1.1"/> third <pause dur="0.8"/> just giving four <pause dur="0.2"/> standard objections <pause dur="0.4"/> third <pause dur="0.3"/> although Kant interpreted his principles in this very rigorous manner <pause dur="1.4"/> it's often <trunc>agra</trunc> argued <pause dur="0.2"/> that his system doesn't really <pause dur="0.8"/> require that <pause dur="0.3"/> but <pause dur="0.4"/> in fact it's much too loose <pause dur="0.8"/> he doesn't really provide conclusive reasons for doing <pause dur="0.4"/> rigorous <pause dur="0.2"/> arguing on Kant's manner <pause dur="0.5"/> on the contrary can sanction almost anything <pause dur="0.9"/> for how am i to decide <pause dur="0.3"/> what is the correct description <pause dur="0.3"/> and hence maxim <pause dur="0.3"/> of any proposed act <pause dur="1.3"/> the Kantian test of a true moral precept <pause dur="0.4"/> is that it's one i can <trunc>s</trunc> consistently universalize <pause dur="0.8"/> but with sufficient ingenuity <pause dur="0.7"/> perhaps one can find <pause dur="0.3"/> a 
consistently universalizable maxim <pause dur="0.2"/> for almost any action just specified <pause dur="1.3"/> in enough detail <pause dur="1.1"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> just characterize the proposed action in such a way that the maxim will permit me to do what i want whilst prohibiting others from doing <pause dur="0.6"/> what would <pause dur="0.3"/> nullify the maxim if universalized <pause dur="7.0"/> however <pause dur="0.3"/> i don't think this is <pause dur="0.7"/> to say that nothing can be salvaged <pause dur="0.2"/> from Kant's approach <pause dur="0.3"/> or even from the notion of universalizability <pause dur="0.9"/> because <pause dur="0.2"/> what Kant is getting at or part of what Kant's getting at <pause dur="0.7"/> in his categorical imperative <pause dur="0.7"/> is that a person who says he or she ought to act in a certain way <pause dur="0.4"/> is guilty of an implicit contradiction <pause dur="0.6"/> and this may well be true <pause dur="1.1"/> once a maxim has been specified then <pause dur="0.3"/> if it's to be a moral maxim <pause dur="0.4"/> it must be universalizable <pause dur="4.5"/> now as i've mentioned to you the prescriptivists like Hare <pause dur="0.2"/> have taken up this approach and have argued that a person isn't genuinely making a moral <trunc>ju</trunc> # judgement <pause dur="0.4"/> unless he or she <pause dur="0.2"/> is prepared <pause dur="0.3"/> to universalize the maxim <pause dur="1.3"/> for to judge that something is 
right <pause dur="0.2"/> is to commit oneself to choosing that course <pause dur="0.2"/> of action <pause dur="0.5"/> even if it's open <pause dur="0.8"/> to one # # # if it is open to one and approving of others doing so <pause dur="0.3"/> when it's open to them <pause dur="1.7"/> so if the Nazi's judgement <pause dur="0.3"/> that gassing Jews is right is to be a genuinely evaluative judgement <pause dur="0.6"/> not just a descriptive one <pause dur="0.6"/> then he must be committed to the position <pause dur="0.2"/> it would be right for he himself to be gassed <pause dur="0.5"/> if it were unexpectedly discovered that he were of Jewish parentage <pause dur="1.7"/> if he's not prepared to <trunc>universali</trunc> # universalize his maxim in this way <pause dur="0.3"/> he is not genuinely accepting the imperative <pause dur="0.4"/> let Jews be gassed <pause dur="0.7"/> he's hence not making a moral judgement <pause dur="1.0"/> of course it's possible for him to change his mind <pause dur="0.5"/> and if his Jewish ancestry <pause dur="0.2"/> were discovered he might well do so <pause dur="0.6"/> the point is <pause dur="0.3"/> you cannot genuinely hold <pause dur="0.4"/> that gassing Jews is right unless you accept <pause dur="0.8"/> the <pause dur="0.2"/> # # maxim <pause dur="0.5"/> # is in principle universalizable <pause dur="0.3"/> and of course more generally <pause dur="0.3"/> bringing home to a person <pause dur="0.6"/> what <pause dur="0.4"/> might be involved in certain circumstances in 
universalizing a maxim may be a way of bringing people <pause dur="0.2"/> and often is <pause dur="0.2"/> to change <pause dur="0.2"/> their minds <pause dur="2.0"/> now as you know <pause dur="0.2"/> there are well known objections to prescriptivism <pause dur="0.8"/> but <pause dur="0.2"/> and this is the note i'm going to end on <pause dur="1.7"/> the type of argument i've sketched doesn't stand or fall either with Kant <pause dur="0.2"/> or with prescriptivism <pause dur="1.0"/> if you take the line that what a person commits themselves to <pause dur="0.4"/> in saying X is right <pause dur="0.4"/> is not <pause dur="0.2"/> just the imperative <pause dur="0.3"/> let me do X <pause dur="0.2"/> but <pause dur="0.4"/> there are sufficient reasons of a moral kind for doing X <pause dur="1.3"/> then you could still argue <pause dur="1.0"/> that <pause dur="0.5"/> to the extent the two situations are of the same type <pause dur="0.5"/> what are sufficient moral reasons for doing X in one situation <pause dur="0.6"/> are sufficient <pause dur="0.2"/> in another <pause dur="0.9"/> if there are sufficient moral reasons <pause dur="0.4"/> for gassing Jews when i happen to be the executioner <pause dur="0.8"/> then there are sufficient moral <pause dur="0.4"/> reasons for doing so <pause dur="0.3"/> when i happen <pause dur="0.2"/> to be a victim <pause dur="1.1"/> and with this we come back to the heart of the Kantian enterprise and what i want to leave you with <pause dur="1.3"/> Kant is concerned <pause dur="0.5"/> to 
establish ultimate moral <pause dur="0.2"/> principles <pause dur="2.2"/> which are at once autonomous that is determined by the agent's own rational will not by anything external to that will <pause dur="0.6"/> whether the will of another <pause dur="0.2"/> or even one's own desires <pause dur="1.3"/> establish moral principles once autonomous <pause dur="0.3"/> and objective <pause dur="0.3"/> not depending on the desires <pause dur="0.3"/> or even the nature <pause dur="0.4"/> of the agent <pause dur="0.3"/> moral principles <pause dur="0.2"/> bottom of this <kinesic desc="indicates screen" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.3"/> are at once <pause dur="0.3"/> autonomous <pause dur="0.7"/> and <pause dur="0.4"/> objective <pause dur="1.9"/> and this meets the dual sense we have of morality that in facing moral decisions it's important <pause dur="0.2"/> to get it right <pause dur="1.0"/> and yet no one has the right to tell us what we ought to do <pause dur="0.7"/> the point at which McNaughton starts his book <pause dur="1.8"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/><vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/> <pause dur="0.6"/> we are autonomous beings <pause dur="0.4"/> but these two requirements <pause dur="0.2"/> it would seem <pause dur="0.5"/> of objectivity and autonomy <pause dur="0.5"/> can only be met if certain moral principles are demanded <pause dur="0.4"/> by the formal character of morality itself <pause dur="0.6"/> a morally good action must be rationally chosen <pause dur="0.3"/> in accord with a law <pause dur="0.3"/> rational # <trunc>v</trunc> valid for all rational beings universally <pause dur="0.6"/> and determined by nothing <pause dur="0.2"/> beyond <pause dur="0.2"/> itself <pause dur="1.4"/> so given 
that <pause dur="1.0"/> a correct moral judgement <pause dur="0.5"/> is one that could in principle be reached <pause dur="0.2"/> by anybody <pause dur="1.5"/> so such judgements must be made in terms of features <pause dur="0.2"/> which the actions or situations possess <pause dur="1.0"/> so any feature picked out as relevant <pause dur="0.6"/> must be one that's always relevant <pause dur="0.4"/> unless there's some special explanation why not <pause dur="1.1"/> so <pause dur="0.8"/> what anyone ought to do in a given set of circumstances <pause dur="0.2"/> is what anyone else ought to do <pause dur="0.2"/> so long as the case isn't relevantly <pause dur="0.2"/> different <pause dur="0.6"/> and this gives us <pause dur="0.3"/> Kant's <pause dur="0.3"/> insistence <pause dur="0.2"/> on <pause dur="0.4"/> universalizability <pause dur="2.3"/> and of course <pause dur="0.5"/> the principle that one ought to treat similar cases similarly <pause dur="0.7"/> is a general formulation <pause dur="0.2"/> of the particular requirement of justice <pause dur="0.8"/> that any form of treatment <pause dur="0.2"/> thought right for one person <pause dur="0.4"/> must be right <pause dur="0.2"/> for all others <pause dur="0.7"/> unless the others are significantly different <pause dur="1.1"/> and this thesis <pause dur="0.3"/> about justice <pause dur="0.6"/> is what i shall begin to consider <pause dur="0.9"/> next time <pause dur="1.0"/> thank you very much
