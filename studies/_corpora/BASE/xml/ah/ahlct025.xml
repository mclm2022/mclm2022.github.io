# we used to have a lecture at this stage in the course on either Comte or Durkheim both of these <shift feature="voice" new="laugh"/>have <shift feature="voice" new="normal"/><pause dur="0.2"/> been cast into the rubbish bin of history <pause dur="0.3"/> but you will fairly soon be doing the Annales who are in a sense the twentieth century heirs of this <pause dur="0.2"/> French positivist tradition <pause dur="1.2"/> and the key figure <pause dur="0.3"/> in the nineteenth century in this who is virtually a contemporary <pause dur="0.3"/> # of Ranke <pause dur="0.4"/> is a man called Auguste Comte the founder of the <trunc>discip</trunc> of the word and the discipline of sociology <pause dur="0.9"/> Ranke as you <pause dur="0.2"/> found out was a Prussian a Lutheran a monarchist a conservative hostile to the Enlightenment <pause dur="0.7"/> Comte <pause dur="0.4"/> is in a sense a reverse of Ranke he's a claddic classic product of the <pause dur="0.2"/> world of the French Revolution <pause dur="0.3"/> educated in the <distinct lang="fr">grande école</distinct> set up by <pause dur="0.2"/> Napoleon after the French Revolution <pause dur="0.2"/> to train the post-revolutionary elite <pause dur="0.4"/> in France <pause dur="0.6"/> Comte viewed the Enlightenment <pause dur="0.3"/> as a stage on the path of humanity <pause dur="0.3"/> from the age of religion <pause dur="0.4"/> through the age of 
philosophy <pause dur="0.4"/> finally to the age of science the age of positivism <pause dur="0.3"/> # which he saw as emerging in the nineteenth century <pause dur="1.0"/> he therefore shared the Enlightenment French Revolution emphasis on progress which Ranke rejected <pause dur="0.5"/> but he was worried that the French Revolution <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> because of the <pause dur="0.3"/> social <trunc>un</trunc> # upheaval which was created <pause dur="0.3"/> would create instability therefore <pause dur="0.2"/> what the post-revolution world needed <pause dur="0.3"/> was <pause dur="0.4"/> Comte said a science of mankind <pause dur="0.2"/> I-E sociology <trunc>in</trunc> he <trunc>in</trunc> invented the term <pause dur="0.6"/> which would <pause dur="0.2"/> diagnose social problems <pause dur="0.2"/> and <trunc>su</trunc> suggest solutions <pause dur="0.7"/> Comte saw society <pause dur="0.4"/> as an entity it was a reality it was a thing <pause dur="0.5"/> and society could be studied <pause dur="0.2"/> using the methodology of natural sciences <pause dur="0.2"/> something which Ranke rejected <pause dur="0.5"/> and one could <pause dur="1.1"/> discern its laws there were laws of motion as it were of society which could be <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> worked out <pause dur="0.8"/> and Comte envisaged a world where <pause dur="0.3"/> experts <pause dur="1.0"/> economists sociologists demographers scientists technologists and so forth <pause dur="0.3"/> would <pause dur="0.8"/> uncover these social laws <pause dur="0.4"/> and utilize 
their knowledge of society to run society in a more efficient productive <pause dur="0.4"/> # way for for as it were a more productive <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> more prosperous future <pause dur="0.4"/> and the masses would not really understand this science but they would be taught to accept <pause dur="0.2"/> and welcome the rule of this technocratic elite <pause dur="1.9"/> now Marx is the figure clearly of a a third paradigm <pause dur="0.4"/> Marxism differs from Comtean positivism because <pause dur="0.5"/> positivists' approach <pause dur="0.6"/> emphasized understanding deep structures and the laws of motion in society <pause dur="0.4"/> in order <pause dur="0.4"/> that modern a sort of modern technocratic elite <pause dur="0.3"/> could manage and stabilize society and achieve social integration and harmony <pause dur="0.7"/> the positivists in sort # in short sought to control and eliminate social conflict <pause dur="0.9"/> Marxism was clearly <pause dur="0.6"/> more revolutionary in it it saw previous <pause dur="0.2"/> <trunc>m</trunc> <trunc>mar</trunc> Marx famously said that previous philosophers <pause dur="0.4"/> had sought to interpret the world <pause dur="0.3"/> that his task <pause dur="0.2"/> was to change it <pause dur="0.6"/> and he saw revolution as a sort of locomotive of history class conflict <pause dur="0.3"/> as what drove history forward <pause dur="1.0"/> 
subsequent Marxists # have often criticized the positivists <trunc>ce</trunc> Comte and his disciples <pause dur="0.2"/> for their <pause dur="0.2"/> overemphasis on social structures and laws <pause dur="0.5"/> saying this this was too deterministic <pause dur="0.3"/> # it undermined man's capacity to have an agency as it were <trunc>i</trunc> an input <pause dur="0.2"/> into how history moved <pause dur="1.1"/> but what it i think is important here to register is that for <pause dur="0.3"/> much of the late nineteenth and early twentieth century <pause dur="0.5"/> Marxism <pause dur="0.2"/> certainly shared or <trunc>ki</trunc> appeared to share many of the features <pause dur="0.3"/> of this positivist sociological approach <pause dur="0.8"/> indeed Karl Popper in another book that we used to do in historiography which has again been cast into the dustbin of history <pause dur="0.2"/> a book called the Poverty of Historicism <pause dur="1.1"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> argued that <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="1.5"/> both Comte and Marx should be lumped together <pause dur="0.4"/> as believers in deterministic laws of history they both in a sense shared <pause dur="0.3"/> many features in common he asked <pause dur="1.1"/> and why was this confusion possible well first of all because Marxists and positivists <pause dur="0.2"/> both <pause dur="0.4"/> unlike Ranke <pause dur="0.4"/> appeared to share a common interest 
in <pause dur="0.2"/> society they weren't so concerned with <pause dur="0.2"/> individuals getting inside the heads of individual great people <pause dur="0.6"/> but they were concerned with society social structures <trunc>econ</trunc> economics <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="1.3"/> secondly Marx was clearly influenced <pause dur="0.5"/> if less directly by Comte himself <pause dur="0.3"/> certainly by Comte's great <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> teacher was a who's a <pause dur="0.2"/> rather eccentric French <pause dur="0.3"/> # aristocrat who actually <unclear>espoused</unclear> the the <trunc>re</trunc> French Revolution a man called Saint-Simon <pause dur="0.6"/> Saint-Simon was <pause dur="0.8"/> an eccentric genius he dreamed he in he in his <trunc>m</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> multitude of writings round about the turn of the century in the early eighteen # early early eighteen-hundreds <pause dur="0.4"/> he dreamed of for example the Panama and Suez canals it was actually one of his disciples de Lesseps who built the Suez Canal <pause dur="0.3"/> sixty years later but <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> # Saint-Simon dreamed of a single global market in order to have one one needed <pause dur="0.2"/> # these canals to link the oceans of the world <pause dur="0.2"/> he dreamed of the <pause dur="0.5"/> he said <pause dur="0.2"/> it was <trunc>l</trunc> logical that Europe should form a single <vocal desc="laugh" iterated="n"/> <pause dur="0.5"/> 
European market <vocal desc="laugh" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.2"/> and should have a single currency and all the <pause dur="0.3"/> # for those of you who are Europhobes and don't want want us to get out of Europe <pause dur="0.2"/> can blame Saint-Simon as being well as it were well the founder of the <pause dur="0.3"/> of the European idea <pause dur="0.8"/> and Saint-Simon divided history into economic stages from him Marx derived the idea of a sort of teleology <pause dur="0.4"/> of history progressing from slavery to feudalism to capitalism and so forth <pause dur="0.8"/> and also Saint-Simon was responsible in a sense for the <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> notion which is <pause dur="0.3"/> kind of central to sort of <pause dur="0.3"/> # subsequent labour movements of the distinction as it were between productive <pause dur="0.3"/> and parasitic <pause dur="0.3"/> # social groups <pause dur="0.2"/> there's a famous parable <pause dur="0.3"/> # by Saint-Simon in which he says <pause dur="0.3"/> imagine <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> a Europe in which <pause dur="0.2"/> all the crowned heads <pause dur="0.3"/> all the princes and princesses and bishops and so forth and aristocrats <pause dur="0.3"/> are <trunc>s</trunc> are called to a <pause dur="0.3"/> a wedding in Lisbon of a of a royal princess <pause dur="0.3"/> and they happen to be walking across a bridge one day <pause dur="0.3"/> # to go to the cathedral and the bridge

production <pause dur="0.2"/> both in industry and with artisan producers <pause dur="0.2"/> and in the countryside with peasant farming <pause dur="0.3"/> are still there therefore <pause dur="0.5"/> one does have industrialists and one does have industrial workers but there is a much more <pause dur="0.3"/> diverse economy <pause dur="0.4"/> # with # <trunc>m</trunc> many more sort of different sort of <trunc>s</trunc> <trunc>u</trunc> subordinate social groups <pause dur="1.2"/> there is a class war that goes on in Paris and Lyon and Berlin and Cologne and so forth in Europe in eighteen-forty-eight between <pause dur="0.3"/> capitalists and workers <pause dur="0.3"/> but there are lots of other conflicts going on in Europe as well between other sort of <pause dur="0.3"/> social <trunc>s</trunc> social groups <pause dur="0.8"/> and because the <trunc>co</trunc> there is a very complex <pause dur="0.4"/> class structure and an unevenly developed economy <pause dur="0.9"/> # the <pause dur="0.5"/> social and political divisions of Europe <pause dur="0.4"/> in eighteen-forty-eight are much more complicated than Marx suggested in the Communist Manifesto <pause dur="0.7"/> at the level of elite politics it's difficult to form a single coherent <pause dur="0.4"/> conservative party because <pause dur="0.7"/> on the one hand one still has remnants of the old 
aristocracy # who still survive and are still yearning for some sort of return to the Ancien Régime <pause dur="0.6"/> still imperfectly assimilated into the new <pause dur="0.4"/> bourgeois world <pause dur="0.6"/> and the bourgeoisie itself Marx says is fragmented on all sorts of grounds between <pause dur="0.5"/> finance industry trade land <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> <trunc>th</trunc> <trunc>th</trunc> the professions <pause dur="0.2"/> politically between royalists Bonapartists republicans <pause dur="0.2"/> culturally between Catholics Jews Protestants <pause dur="0.3"/> Freemasons and <pause dur="0.2"/> Voltaireans and so forth <pause dur="0.4"/> in other words the <pause dur="0.3"/> the world of the elites is much more fragmented on all sorts in all sorts of grounds <pause dur="0.3"/> than Marx suggested in this notion of a sort of single capitalist ruling class <pause dur="1.3"/> and these intraclass divisions divisions as i say are within the leading classes <pause dur="0.4"/> make it difficult for the elites to achieve a united front <pause dur="0.4"/> even in the face of the threat of workers and peasants in the revolutions of eighteen-forty-eight <pause dur="0.7"/> and Marx concludes in the end <pause dur="0.3"/> these fragmented social elites in the # in the end need Bonapartism some sort

historians should be <pause dur="0.6"/> aware of what he called ascribed class consciousness I-E what a class <pause dur="0.3"/> would think if it could perceive its interests more clearly <pause dur="0.3"/> # perhaps it's something a bit like Rousseau's general will as it were <pause dur="0.4"/> and he <pause dur="0.2"/> Lukacs argued that Marxists should be aware of this third <pause dur="0.5"/> # # as it were sort of <pause dur="0.2"/> category <pause dur="0.2"/> because the contrast between <pause dur="0.4"/> people's actual and their rational behaviour <pause dur="0.3"/> affects the historical effectiveness of their actions </u><gap reason="break in recording" extent="uncertain"/> <u who="nm0088" trans="pause"> Marx sees the peasant electors <pause dur="0.9"/> as a sort of mass <pause dur="0.2"/> passive base <pause dur="0.2"/> of the Bonapartist state the <pause dur="0.3"/> Bonapartism is strong in part because it's able to attract the support <pause dur="0.3"/> of at least a sizable proportion <pause dur="0.3"/> of France's <pause dur="0.4"/> mass rural # peasant electorate <pause dur="0.9"/> but Marx argues there's no necessary correlation between <pause dur="0.3"/> the interests of the peasantry and the longer term interests of the Bonapartist regime <pause dur="0.4"/> just as there's no necessary correlation <pause dur="0.5"/> later Marxists will argue between the interests of the German petit bourgeoisie who voted for the 
Nazis <pause dur="0.4"/> and the actual <pause dur="0.4"/> # sort of <pause dur="1.0"/> programmes and policies of the Nazi regime <pause dur="0.2"/> in power which are often more favourable to <pause dur="0.3"/> to I G Farben and German big business <pause dur="1.2"/> Marx sees the bourgeois elites in France as turning to Bonapartism again <pause dur="0.6"/> later Marxists would say like the bourgeoisie in Italy in the nineteen-twenties or the bourgeoisie in Germany in the nineteen-thirties <pause dur="0.6"/> because they grow impatient of the divisions and squabbles <pause dur="0.3"/> within their own political class <pause dur="0.3"/> because in the face of economic depression and <trunc>p</trunc> possible <pause dur="0.5"/> working class socialism or revolution <pause dur="0.4"/> # the bourgeoisie bourgeois politicians are squabbling among themselves <pause dur="0.3"/> the bourgeoisie say to hell with that lot <vocal desc="laugh" iterated="n"/> <pause dur="0.3"/> we're fed up with parliamentary government we're fed up with elections it's all too <pause dur="0.3"/> messy it's all too dangerous <pause dur="0.2"/> what we need is a strong man <vocal desc="laugh" iterated="n"/> <pause dur="0.2"/> who can restore law and order and and so forth <pause dur="0.3"/> and # <pause dur="0.8"/> and in a sense # therefore the the the the there are 
certain parallels i think <unclear>#</unclear> between # <pause dur="0.4"/> between Bonapartism fascism there <pause dur="0.5"/> and then there is the question that is the resultant state the Bonapartist state the fascist state <pause dur="0.4"/> a capitalist bourgeois state <pause dur="0.6"/> well yes and no and yes it's not because it is not <pause dur="0.4"/> directly run by the capitalists it's not actually <pause dur="0.4"/> financiers and <pause dur="0.2"/> industrialists and so forth who <pause dur="0.2"/> run the state machine in the in France in the eighteen-fifties <pause dur="0.2"/> or in Germany in the nineteen-thirties <pause dur="0.5"/> and to some degree the bourgeoisie relies on protection from the police and the bureaucracy and the army <pause dur="0.5"/> # # to in order to <pause dur="0.2"/> to to to preserve it its its wealth and its power and its investments <pause dur="0.8"/> but Marx argues that <pause dur="0.4"/> yes it is a <unclear>you know</unclear> capitalist bourgeois state it's not a state he says <pause dur="0.2"/> not a state suspended in a void <pause dur="0.6"/> because by suppressing the left <pause dur="0.6"/> by dismantling the workers' movement after eighteen-fifty-one <pause dur="0.2"/> just as the 
Nazis dismantled the communists and the trade unions <pause dur="0.2"/> after nineteen-thirty-three <pause dur="0.6"/> # one <pause dur="0.2"/> allowed the capitalist <pause dur="0.3"/> regime to survive <pause dur="0.3"/> and to expand to make profits for the <trunc>b</trunc> for the bourgeoisie <pause dur="0.3"/> and that the state machine itself <pause dur="0.3"/> recruits from the elites the bureaucracy is actually recruited from the <pause dur="0.2"/> educated sons of the propertied elites <pause dur="0.2"/> and lives in a sense off the surplus value <pause dur="0.3"/> created by <pause dur="0.2"/> capitalism and by <pause dur="0.2"/> the taxation system <pause dur="0.6"/> and therefore <pause dur="1.2"/> what Marx is postulating is an idea of a state which is both <pause dur="0.5"/> on the one hand <pause dur="0.3"/> semi-autonomous is <pause dur="0.2"/> it's not directly controlled by <pause dur="0.2"/> the capitalists they've in sense abandoned that <pause dur="0.5"/> but yet it's functioning <pause dur="0.3"/> in the long term to protect their their interests <pause dur="0.3"/> and as i say <pause dur="0.2"/> in that sense the analysis of fascism <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> # in nineteen-twenties and thirties <pause dur="0.3"/> relied heavily on Marx's analysis of Bonapartism <pause dur="0.3"/> # in The Eighteenth Brumaire <pause dur="0.4"/> thank you very much
