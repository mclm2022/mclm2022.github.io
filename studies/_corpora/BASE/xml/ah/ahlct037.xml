<u who="nf0157"> # <pause dur="2.3"/> okay # <pause dur="1.9"/> i'll just say a few things about the book <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> <trunc>w</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> as you know we've spent <pause dur="0.2"/> last term and the first part of this term <pause dur="0.4"/> talking about Locke and Berkeley <pause dur="0.5"/> # we're now moving on to Hume so the next six lectures <pause dur="0.6"/> # the last six lectures of this course are on Hume <pause dur="0.3"/> this is a copy of Hume's Treatise <pause dur="0.4"/> # i'll say a little bit more about that in a minute so that hopefully <pause dur="0.4"/> it will reach a larger audience when a few more people have got here <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="1.5"/> so i'm just going to say i'm going to say a few things about Hume and a few things about the Treatise <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> and then <pause dur="0.2"/> we'll start by looking at <pause dur="0.4"/> Hume's sort of philosophical method you might call it <pause dur="2.8"/> okay so <pause dur="0.3"/> Hume <pause dur="0.6"/> out of the three philosophers we study on this course Hume is probably the most famous <pause dur="0.4"/> of the three <pause dur="0.3"/> and he's certainly he's famous for his <pause dur="0.4"/> very very famous theories of cause and effect <pause dur="0.4"/> which we'll look at in a couple of weeks' time <pause dur="0.3"/> and 
for his influence on later philosophers particularly Kant who of course you're looking at <pause dur="0.6"/> in <pause dur="0.2"/> Modern Phil Texts <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> that is unless you're joint honours <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> handout <pause dur="1.2"/> # <pause dur="0.9"/> Hume of course follows on from Locke and Berkeley he's an empiricist like Locke and Berkeley <pause dur="0.4"/> like <pause dur="0.3"/> Locke and Berkeley <pause dur="0.3"/> he thinks that all of our interest and knowledge <pause dur="0.4"/> is derived from experience and we'll be talking much more about that <pause dur="0.3"/> today what that actually comes down to for Hume <pause dur="0.5"/> and he's also following on from the arguments from the kind of from the challenges that were laid down by Locke and Berkeley <pause dur="0.3"/> so he takes on a lot of Locke's <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> a lot of the the <pause dur="0.2"/> terminology used by Locke and Berkeley <pause dur="0.3"/> and he looks at another lot of the same kind of problems <pause dur="0.3"/> i mean particularly he's interested in abstraction <pause dur="0.6"/> and <pause dur="1.1"/> scepticism <pause dur="0.3"/> whether Locke and <trunc>berk</trunc> whether Locke's account in particular <pause dur="0.5"/> <trunc>ap</trunc> implies <pause dur="0.4"/> # scepticism about the <trunc>ex</trunc> external world whether empiricism implies scepticism about the external world <pause dur="0.5"/> and <pause dur="0.3"/> # the most i mean 
one of the most <pause dur="0.4"/> famous <pause dur="0.2"/> things that he takes on from Locke and Berkeley is is the theory of personal identity <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> he looks at Locke's account he looks at Berkeley's account <pause dur="0.2"/> and then he proposes his own account and we'll be looking at personal identity <pause dur="0.3"/> the very last lecture of this term <pause dur="0.4"/> in week ten <pause dur="1.3"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> but i mean <pause dur="0.6"/> so those those are Hume's # some of Hume's <pause dur="0.4"/> philosophical antecedent why he's called an empiricist <pause dur="0.4"/> but i mean i think one of the <pause dur="0.5"/> another really huge influence on Hume which i talked about in the very first lecture of this course back at the beginning of last term <pause dur="0.3"/> with Newton <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> Hume's a scientist really <pause dur="0.2"/> he he's <pause dur="0.3"/> he's really taking a scientific method and applying it <pause dur="0.4"/> to philosophy <pause dur="0.3"/> so Newton offers us this this kind of mechanistic <pause dur="0.3"/> account of matter <pause dur="0.3"/> it's this <pause dur="0.2"/> this whole new science of matter <pause dur="0.3"/> in which all of the movements of of <pause dur="0.4"/> particles of bodies can be described in terms of equations <pause dur="0.2"/> so it's moving towards the kind of deterministic science that we really take for granted 
today <pause dur="0.4"/> the fact that if something happens in the world <pause dur="0.3"/> there will be a <shift feature="voice" new="laugh"/>reason <shift feature="voice" new="normal"/> for it there'll be an explanation for it <pause dur="0.5"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> Hume <pause dur="0.4"/> in <trunc>i</trunc> i mean this is really i suppose the <pause dur="0.6"/> the <pause dur="0.2"/> biggest <pause dur="0.2"/> shift in thinking in Hume <pause dur="0.5"/> is that Hume saw man as another part <pause dur="0.5"/> of the natural world <pause dur="0.7"/> i mean just another part of the natural world and and if you think <pause dur="0.3"/> well okay so what's so exciting about that <pause dur="0.4"/> i mean just think about how the rationalists say Descartes viewed <pause dur="0.6"/> viewed man <pause dur="0.6"/> in the rationalist picture of of human<pause dur="0.2"/>kind <pause dur="0.3"/> is of this sort of <pause dur="0.3"/> this being in the image of God <pause dur="0.5"/> someone who whose life is governed controlled purely by reason <pause dur="0.8"/> right <pause dur="0.2"/> so for the rationalists you know you're not a part of nature sort of <pause dur="0.4"/> swept along with everything else your reason governs your life you have control <pause dur="0.4"/> in virtue of being a rational animal <pause dur="0.3"/> right that's the rationalist picture <pause dur="0.6"/> but Hume <pause dur="0.4"/> completely <pause dur="0.7"/> turns that on its head i mean it's <trunc>te</trunc> in reason is the slave of the passions <pause dur="0.3"/> very famous  
quote from Hume <pause dur="0.4"/> reason is the slave of the passions so <pause dur="0.4"/> reason is is a sort of <pause dur="0.3"/> secondary thing the passions the emotions the feelings <pause dur="0.3"/> are what really govern us and not reason reason is something that comes in later <pause dur="0.6"/> and # <pause dur="0.4"/> i mean <pause dur="1.0"/> so <pause dur="0.7"/> basically what that means is that man humans <pause dur="0.3"/> are just another part of the natural world <pause dur="0.3"/> we can explain human behaviour <pause dur="0.3"/> in exactly the same kind of way as we explain <pause dur="0.3"/> things scientifically <pause dur="0.8"/> and then again i mean just as a sort of modern comparison i mean you might want to think about <pause dur="0.3"/> Searle that you did last year in part one i mean the sort of <pause dur="0.3"/> contrast between the kinds of <trunc>exan</trunc> explanations we offer of <pause dur="0.5"/> of human action and the kinds of explanations of <pause dur="0.9"/> scientific phenomena <pause dur="0.3"/> basically what Hume's saying is there's one kind of explanation that's applicable to all of these things i mean obviously the <pause dur="0.4"/> the things we're explaining are slightly different <pause dur="0.5"/> in in terms of humans in terms of of <pause dur="0.2"/> of human thought human action we're <pause dur="0.4"/> dealing with 
with maybe ideas or thoughts or whatever as opposed to physical objects <pause dur="0.4"/> but basically there's one kind of explanation and it's a naturalistic kind of explanation <pause dur="0.6"/> so that's the the <pause dur="0.4"/> the <pause dur="0.7"/> huge <pause dur="0.2"/> sort of shift in thinking that that we get in Hume <pause dur="0.6"/> and i mean Hume <pause dur="1.1"/> Hume sees this as a kind of an experimental enquiry <pause dur="0.6"/> so <pause dur="0.4"/> <trunc>h</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> he takes this <pause dur="0.3"/> empirical scientific method <pause dur="0.3"/> which Newton <pause dur="0.2"/> applied with such success but which goes right i mean you may remember the historical <pause dur="0.6"/> sort of picture i was giving you back at in at at the end of at the beginning of last term <pause dur="0.5"/> # <trunc>th</trunc> the sort of going right back to Bacon the sort of <trunc>empiri</trunc> the rise of empirical science <pause dur="0.3"/> and Hume's taken that picture and what he wants to derive <pause dur="0.4"/> is <pause dur="0.3"/> write some <pause dur="0.3"/> the <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="4"/> science of man <pause dur="2.4"/> okay <pause dur="0.3"/> so Newton gave us this # <pause dur="0.6"/> when somebody starts writing this down <unclear>you see</unclear><kinesic desc="indicates point on board" iterated="n"/>  <pause dur="0.3"/> this is Newton gave us the science of matter <pause dur="0.4"/> and Hume is giving us the science of man along <pause dur="0.3"/> exactly the same lines <pause dur="0.3"/> so he wants to come up with some kind of <pause dur="0.3"/> 
laws of association you know just like Newton has this equation you can <pause dur="0.5"/> draw the the fall of a billiard ball or whatever the the fall of a <pause dur="0.2"/> not a billiard ball <pause dur="0.7"/> things that you drop off towers and things you can measure <pause dur="0.5"/> their velocity in terms of the forces acting on it <pause dur="0.4"/> Hume thought a similar kind of account would be possible <pause dur="0.8"/> for <pause dur="0.2"/> the man the reason for <pause dur="0.9"/> what goes on in our <pause dur="0.6"/> our understanding <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> right okay <pause dur="0.2"/> how does he do this well how are we going to <pause dur="0.4"/> how are we going to empirically investigate <pause dur="0.3"/> the human mind <pause dur="0.9"/> well of course the methods of neuroscience the methods of <pause dur="0.5"/> of <pause dur="0.6"/> you know <pause dur="0.4"/> looking at medical methods looking at people's brains obviously weren't very far advanced <pause dur="0.3"/> and anyway maybe that's the wrong place to look i mean Hume's interested in thoughts and feelings and so on <pause dur="0.5"/> so really the method that we use is of course introspection <pause dur="0.8"/> we look into our own minds we see what's going on there <pause dur="0.3"/> and we can <pause dur="0.3"/> posit <pause dur="0.2"/> laws relations we can carry out this empirical <pause dur="0.4"/> investigation <pause dur="0.4"/> 
into <pause dur="1.3"/> all the whole nature of human <pause dur="0.3"/> understanding so this is the project <pause dur="4.1"/> well <pause dur="0.4"/> in the <pause dur="0.5"/> the next six lectures so today and <pause dur="0.2"/> and the rest of this course <pause dur="0.5"/> # we're going to look at various topics in Hume's philosophy <pause dur="0.4"/> and these taken from <pause dur="0.4"/> book one of Hume's Treatise of Human Nature so this is the Treatise <pause dur="1.1"/> it's a very fat book <pause dur="0.7"/> # however <pause dur="0.4"/> this this particular one is very fat because it contains <pause dur="0.4"/> a large amount of introductory material <pause dur="0.4"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="1.0"/> glossaries and notes and all this kind of stuff <pause dur="0.4"/> if you're going to buy the Treatise so this is a quick <pause dur="0.6"/> <trunc>st</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> step back from Hume for a second 'cause i wanted to say this at the beginning <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> if you want to buy a copy of this this is very very good value this is a tenner <pause dur="0.3"/> and it's quite <pause dur="0.2"/> can you see how thick it is that's quite a lot of book for a tenner <pause dur="0.5"/> if you given how expensive philosophy books are <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> this is edited by Norton and Norton <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> and it was on the reading list right at the start of term so you should <pause dur="0.5"/> have that already <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="1.0"/> there are <trunc>ve</trunc> # they 
should be available in the bookshop i haven't actually checked i did ask them to order some copies <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> there are lots of other editions of the Treatise so you don't have to get this one but this one's got a very big fat introduction so <pause dur="0.5"/> # it <pause dur="0.2"/> it might be useful <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> the Treatise in fact has has three <pause dur="0.6"/> books <pause dur="0.2"/> in it <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> and we're only going to be looking at book one <pause dur="0.7"/> book one <pause dur="0.2"/> is entitled Of the Understanding so this is Hume's <pause dur="0.5"/> the the beginning of <trunc>hu</trunc> Hume's science of man as it applies to <pause dur="0.5"/> to reason <pause dur="0.3"/> and to thought <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> we'll be <trunc>look</trunc> <trunc>i</trunc> it <pause dur="0.2"/> basically introduces this philosophical method and then it looks at applying that to a number of philosophical issues such as <pause dur="0.5"/> space and time causation knowledge and belief <pause dur="0.5"/> personal identity <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> the <pause dur="0.4"/> second book is is Of the Passions <pause dur="0.4"/> so that is an account of <trunc>o</trunc> <trunc>o</trunc> a a really <pause dur="0.5"/> i mean an account that was discredited for a while because of <pause dur="0.2"/> things like Freudian <pause dur="0.2"/> psychoanalysis and things like that but <pause dur="0.4"/> now is is is people looking at it more and it 
gives an account of the emotions <pause dur="0.4"/> the desires things like pride and lust and <pause dur="0.5"/> and <pause dur="0.3"/> and pity and <pause dur="0.2"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> and of course human freedom which is probably one of the most important things in a <pause dur="0.2"/> in book two <pause dur="0.5"/> and then book three is is Hume's moral philosophy and i'm not sure i meant to ask <pause dur="0.4"/> Philip whether you do any <trunc>hu</trunc> of Hume's moral philosophy do you do any of Hume's moral philosophy <pause dur="0.6"/> in your morals course <pause dur="0.6"/> well <pause dur="0.6"/> even if you don't it's certainly something that people will refer to so the <pause dur="0.2"/> the moral philosophy is in <pause dur="0.4"/> book three of the Treatise but as i said we're only going to be looking at book one <pause dur="0.4"/> and we're going to look at <pause dur="0.3"/> number of topics from book one <pause dur="0.3"/> we're going to start by looking at Hume's philosophical method <pause dur="0.4"/> and then next week we'll talk about belief <pause dur="0.5"/> then two weeks on his theory of causation <pause dur="0.4"/> his scepticism and then finally his theory of personal identity <pause dur="0.8"/> that's the plan <pause dur="1.6"/> any questions <pause dur="0.3"/> about Hume <pause dur="0.8"/> in general <pause dur="2.1"/> cool <pause dur="1.1"/> right <pause dur="0.2"/> okay <pause dur="0.3"/> so what i want to do today is just <pause dur="0.3"/> i mean having 
sort of given you a little tiny tiny bit of an overview of what <pause dur="0.5"/> Hume's about <pause dur="0.5"/> # is just look at <pause dur="0.6"/> that he's basically his his tennets of his empiricism what his empiricism means for Hume <pause dur="0.5"/> how he sets it out what the basic principles he's working with are <pause dur="0.4"/> and these basic principles are vital because these are the principles <pause dur="0.2"/> that he later applies <pause dur="0.3"/> when he comes to look at specific problems <pause dur="0.3"/> so when he looks at causation he uses the principles we're going to look at today <pause dur="0.3"/> in order to analyse the notion of <pause dur="0.2"/> of cause <pause dur="0.2"/> so this is basically the <pause dur="0.3"/> the most important <pause dur="0.2"/> ground work <pause dur="0.4"/> the basic foundations of of Hume's empiricism <pause dur="0.7"/> and # <pause dur="0.2"/> this <pause dur="0.9"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> basically comes down to his distinction between ideas and impressions and what he does with it <pause dur="1.1"/> so <pause dur="0.2"/> this is <pause dur="0.3"/> on the handout <pause dur="0.4"/> # <trunc>c</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> first talk about what the distinction is <pause dur="0.2"/> why it's important <pause dur="0.8"/> and what we might <pause dur="0.5"/> think about it <pause dur="0.7"/> okay <pause dur="0.9"/> right so # the very very very first thing Hume does in the Treatise after he's he's written the introduction <pause dur="0.8"/> is he starts <pause dur="0.4"/> 
talking about <pause dur="1.4"/> starts out this introspective enquiry by looking into the mind and seeing what he finds there <pause dur="0.4"/> and the first things he said is this is the first sentence of the Treatise <pause dur="0.7"/> <reading>all the perceptions of the human mind resolve themselves into two distinct kinds <pause dur="0.4"/> which i shall call impressions and ideas</reading> <pause dur="1.1"/> 
okay and then he talks about <pause dur="0.3"/> the difference between them <pause dur="0.4"/> and the first thing i want to draw your attention to is <pause dur="0.4"/> is his terminology <pause dur="0.5"/> now <pause dur="1.2"/> what did Locke call <pause dur="0.9"/> what was Locke's term for the contents of the human mind all the objects of perception </u><pause dur="0.8"/> <u who="sf0158" trans="pause"> idea </u><pause dur="0.4"/> <u who="nf0157" trans="pause"> idea <pause dur="0.2"/> right so Locke uses the term idea as this general term for the <pause dur="0.4"/> the objects of of the mind the things in the mind <pause dur="0.3"/> and Hume starts out by saying <reading>all the perceptions of the human mind <pause dur="0.4"/> resolve themselves into two distinct kinds which i'll call impressions and ideas</reading> <pause dur="0.3"/> and so <pause dur="0.2"/> Locke is <trunc>imme</trunc> # Hume's <pause dur="0.2"/> beg your pardon Hume is immediately laying down his terminology <pause dur="0.3"/> in a 
different way from Locke <pause dur="0.3"/> and in fact he has a footnote here <pause dur="0.5"/> and he says <reading>i here make use of these terms impression and idea <pause dur="0.5"/> in a sense different <pause dur="0.3"/> from what is usual <pause dur="0.2"/> and i hope this levity will be allowed me <pause dur="0.6"/> perhaps i rather restore the word idea to its original sense <pause dur="0.3"/> from which Mr Locke has perverted it <pause dur="0.5"/> in making it stand for all our perceptions</reading> so he's <trunc>s</trunc> started by having a go at Locke <pause dur="0.4"/> who's <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> used this term idea to stand for all of our perceptions <pause dur="0.3"/> but really <pause dur="0.4"/> perceptions is is <pause dur="0.3"/> Hume's term for idea so <pause dur="0.3"/> where's my pen <pause dur="0.5"/> so <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="9"/> Locke's <pause dur="0.8"/> idea <pause dur="0.8"/> is basically what Hume calls <pause dur="0.8"/> perceptions <pause dur="1.4"/> now you may not think that's very helpful because of course perceptions thereby are going to include things like <pause dur="0.3"/> you know when i sit here and i imagine myself on that <pause dur="0.5"/> beach with all those <pause dur="0.3"/> men with six packs or whatever <pause dur="0.3"/> that is <trunc>n</trunc> that is actually a perception in my mind although <pause dur="0.3"/> as you can see i'm clearly not <pause dur="0.2"/> perceiving it more's the pity <pause dur="0.4"/> so <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> that's <pause dur="0.3"/> that's what 
Hume calls perceptions <pause dur="0.4"/> this is what Locke calls ideas <pause dur="0.3"/> and Hume <trunc>defi</trunc> divides <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="6"/> perceptions into <pause dur="0.8"/> impressions and ideas <pause dur="1.1"/> and this distinction is extremely important and is the whole foundation for his empiricism which is why i'm banging on about it so much <pause dur="0.8"/> so what's <pause dur="0.2"/> the difference <pause dur="0.4"/> between impressions and ideas <pause dur="2.0"/> well <trunc>h</trunc> the next sentence says <reading>the difference betwixt these consist in the degrees <pause dur="0.4"/> of force and liveliness with which they strike upon the mind <pause dur="0.4"/> and make their way into thought and consciousness <pause dur="1.1"/> those perceptions which enter with most force and violence we may name impressions <pause dur="1.0"/> and under this name i comprehend all our sensations</reading> <pause dur="0.6"/> right so sensations things that we sense <pause dur="1.4"/> <reading>passions <pause dur="0.3"/> and emotions <pause dur="0.6"/> as they make their first appearance in the soul <pause dur="1.4"/> by ideas <pause dur="0.7"/> i mean the faint <pause dur="0.2"/> images of these <pause dur="0.4"/> in thinking <pause dur="0.2"/> and reasoning <pause dur="0.5"/> such as for instance are all the perceptions <pause dur="0.3"/> excited by the present discourse <pause dur="0.9"/> excepting only those which 
arise from the sight and touch <pause dur="0.9"/> et cetera</reading> <pause dur="0.3"/> so <pause dur="0.5"/> the distinction seems to be being made here in two ways <pause dur="0.5"/> on the one hand <pause dur="0.4"/> the distinction is is <trunc>bet</trunc> <trunc>i</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> <reading>with the degrees of force and liveliness with which they strike upon the soul</reading> so impressions <pause dur="0.3"/> are the more forceful and lively <pause dur="0.7"/> perceptions <pause dur="1.1"/> well we can talk about <trunc>f</trunc> what <pause dur="0.3"/> Hume exactly means by forceful and lively in a minute <pause dur="0.7"/> # but impressions are the more <trunc>f</trunc> forceful <pause dur="0.2"/> and lively ones and <pause dur="0.2"/> ideas are the faint copies <pause dur="0.6"/> of impressions so <pause dur="0.4"/> ideas are <trunc>fo</trunc> # impressions are <pause dur="0.6"/> forceful <pause dur="0.5"/> ideas are fainter <pause dur="1.1"/> and then <pause dur="1.6"/> Hume says <pause dur="0.8"/> <reading>under impressions i comprehend all our sensations passions and emotions</reading> <pause dur="0.4"/> so impressions <pause dur="0.5"/> are <pause dur="0.3"/> the ones that we get directly from the senses or directly from the emotions so there's an <pause dur="0.4"/> interesting <pause dur="0.7"/> sort of addition here that when we talk about <pause dur="0.5"/> mental objects we tend to be talking about <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.8"/> objects of perception or objects of propositional attitudes <pause dur="0.6"/> but in fact Hume's 
including here emotion so if you feel really angry <pause dur="0.6"/> you know someone <pause dur="0.5"/> pushes in front of you in the <pause dur="0.3"/> queue for the petrol station or something and you're sitting there going <pause dur="0.3"/> <vocal desc="growl" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.3"/> really angry <pause dur="0.3"/> and that is an impression <pause dur="0.4"/> right <pause dur="0.7"/> i mean there's <trunc>noth</trunc> there's not <pause dur="0.5"/> sort of an object of that in the sense there's not something angry that you're seeing <pause dur="0.6"/> that is an impression of angriness <pause dur="0.4"/> mean it's your anger <pause dur="0.2"/> is the impression so we enclose emotions in here as well as things you perceive <pause dur="1.2"/> ideas on the other hand <pause dur="0.5"/> are <pause dur="0.3"/> so what does Hume says <pause dur="0.4"/> # <reading>the faint image of these in thinking and reasoning</reading> <pause dur="0.4"/> so if <pause dur="0.4"/> you <pause dur="0.3"/> read a book <pause dur="0.9"/> and it's talking about Hume <pause dur="0.5"/> you may form an idea of Hume <pause dur="1.0"/> but <pause dur="0.4"/> # this is a a <trunc>f</trunc> a <trunc>f</trunc> this is not an impression you're not seeing Hume <pause dur="0.5"/> it's a it's a <pause dur="0.2"/> a <pause dur="0.5"/> fainter <pause dur="0.2"/> idea <pause dur="0.2"/> that's being used in thinking <pause dur="0.9"/> yeah <pause dur="0.2"/> <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> </u><u who="sf0159" trans="overlap"> is <pause dur="0.6"/> is it then <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> reflections on emotions <pause dur="0.2"/> # <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> </u><u who="nf0157" trans="overlap"> right exactly <pause dur="0.6"/> ideas are also going to include reflections on emotions so if 
you think back <pause dur="0.4"/> to a week ago <pause dur="0.4"/> when your friend said something really rude to you <pause dur="0.4"/> down the pub and you were really angry <pause dur="0.2"/> then you might remember that anger now <pause dur="0.4"/> okay you might think back to it <pause dur="0.4"/> and remember that you felt angry <pause dur="0.2"/> now it may be that you may also feel angry now <pause dur="0.8"/> but it may also be that you don't feel angry now you've you've got over it you've forgiven your friend <pause dur="0.3"/> but you remember the anger <pause dur="0.3"/> and so in that way the anger is <pause dur="0.4"/> is an idea it's a faint copy <pause dur="0.5"/> of the anger <pause dur="0.4"/> that you felt before <pause dur="1.6"/> but what i want to what i want to <pause dur="0.2"/> to draw out here is is <pause dur="0.4"/> i said there are two ways of making this distinction one is <pause dur="0.8"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="5"/> in terms of forcefulness <pause dur="3.4"/> okay so you've got the impressions of forceful and the ideas of the faint copies can everyone see the board sorry the lights are not on <pause dur="0.9"/> where is it <pause dur="2.9"/><event desc="turns on lights" iterated="n"/> okay <pause dur="0.5"/> that's better <pause dur="1.0"/> on the other hand impressions <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="17"/> are to do with sensing <pause dur="1.4"/> or <pause dur="1.1"/> immediate perception as it were <pause dur="2.8"/> and ideas are to do 
with <pause dur="0.5"/> thinking <pause dur="1.2"/> or reflecting <pause dur="1.8"/> or <pause dur="0.4"/> maybe remembering or whatever <pause dur="0.7"/> and <pause dur="0.4"/> and <trunc>th</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> Hume wants to have both of these <pause dur="1.5"/> so i'm going to come back to whether this actually <pause dur="0.5"/> cuts the distinction <pause dur="0.7"/> in a minute <pause dur="1.5"/> okay <trunc>th</trunc> there are there are so there are two things that are going on in these first sort of basically three or four sentences of the Treatise <pause dur="0.4"/> that impressions are forceful and ideas are faint <pause dur="0.3"/> that impressions are to do with sensing and perceiving and that ideas are to do with <pause dur="0.4"/> later thinking or reflecting on things <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> and i mean of course <pause dur="0.7"/> your ideas <pause dur="0.3"/> you can you can read a <shift feature="voice" new="laugh"/>book <shift feature="voice" new="normal"/><pause dur="0.6"/> about <pause dur="0.7"/> say <pause dur="0.6"/> i don't know some place you've never been some exotic island you can read a book about it <pause dur="0.4"/> and get lots of ideas of it <pause dur="0.3"/> those are nonetheless still only going to be ideas because they're <pause dur="0.4"/> created by thought rather than <pause dur="1.0"/> created by <pause dur="0.2"/> sensation the question is <pause dur="0.5"/> can Hume maintain this forcefulness distinction in that way so i'm getting ahead of myself now i'm going to come back to that in a 
minute <pause dur="0.4"/> but is that <pause dur="0.3"/> basically clear yeah <pause dur="1.1"/> good <pause dur="0.2"/> right <pause dur="0.3"/> okay <pause dur="0.6"/> the second thing that Hume does that's that's very important which is in <pause dur="0.3"/> the <trunc>n</trunc> second paragraph of of the Treatise <pause dur="0.4"/> and <pause dur="0.4"/> this is the <pause dur="0.2"/> division in simple and complex perceptions i don't want to say a huge amount about this 'cause it's fairly obvious <pause dur="0.3"/> and we've also come across it in Locke already <pause dur="0.4"/> so in roughly the same way that Locke does <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> Hume distinguishes between simple and complex ideas <pause dur="0.3"/> but <pause dur="0.3"/> this <pause dur="0.3"/> has <pause dur="0.5"/> a big significance for him <pause dur="1.4"/> and what does he say about this he says well <reading>we can divide our perceptions <pause dur="0.3"/> into simple and complex <pause dur="0.3"/> simple perceptions or impressions and ideas are such <pause dur="0.5"/> as admit of no distinction nor separation</reading> <pause dur="1.2"/> okay <pause dur="0.8"/> <reading>complex ideas are contrary to these and may be distinguished <pause dur="0.4"/> into <pause dur="0.2"/> parts</reading> # <pause dur="0.9"/> so <pause dur="0.5"/> what does he mean by this well if you have a sensation # an idea <pause dur="0.5"/> or a sensation or whatever and you can't break it down into smaller parts <pause dur="0.5"/> then it's simple <pause dur="0.6"/> if you can 
break it down into parts <pause dur="0.4"/> then it's complex so what kind of things are going to be <pause dur="0.5"/> simple <pause dur="0.3"/> perceptions <pause dur="0.3"/> example </u><pause dur="2.4"/> <u who="sf0160" trans="pause"> red </u><pause dur="0.2"/> <u who="nf0157" trans="pause"> red <pause dur="0.3"/> good yes okay <pause dur="0.4"/> any others <pause dur="0.6"/> anyone want to </u><pause dur="0.9"/> <u who="sm0161" trans="pause"> blue </u><pause dur="0.3"/> <u who="nf0157" trans="pause"> blue yeah okay all right </u><u who="sf0162" trans="overlap"> <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/></u><pause dur="0.4"/> <u who="nf0157" trans="pause"> colour ones colour ones are going to do </u><u who="sm0163" trans="latching"> rough </u><pause dur="0.4"/> <u who="nf0157" trans="pause"> rough yeah okay <pause dur="0.8"/> that <pause dur="0.5"/> that's probably <pause dur="0.3"/> pretty simple <pause dur="0.3"/> yeah </u><pause dur="0.9"/> <u who="sf0164" trans="pause"> secondary qualities </u><u who="nf0157" trans="latching"> yeah pretty much all secondary qualities are going to count as <pause dur="0.4"/> simple perceptions <pause dur="0.4"/> the immediate <pause dur="0.8"/> feel the immediate <pause dur="0.3"/> but again this is controversial so we're going to come back to this later <pause dur="0.9"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> complex perceptions <pause dur="2.1"/> what kind of complex perceptions are you having right now <pause dur="1.9"/> # actually no i don't want to know about some of them <vocal desc="laughter" n="ss" iterated="y" dur="3"/> but are there <trunc>a</trunc> <shift feature="voice" new="laugh"/>any you want to share <shift feature="voice" new="normal"/><pause dur="6.3"/> <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> <pause dur="0.2"/> come on keeping me </u><u who="sm0165" trans="overlap"> <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/></u><u who="nf0157" trans="overlap"> <pause dur="0.7"/> okay i mean look <pause dur="0.2"/> supposing i'm looking at </u><u who="sf0166" trans="overlap"> the table </u><pause dur="0.3"/> <u who="nf0157" trans="pause"> the table okay the table is going to be a pretty complex <pause dur="0.3"/> perception because <pause dur="0.4"/> # it's got <pause dur="0.4"/> i mean <pause dur="0.2"/> i can physically divide it into it's got a colour <pause dur="0.4"/> it's got a a hardness it's got a <pause dur="0.6"/><kinesic desc="knocks on table" iterated="n"/> 
sound if i bang on it <pause dur="0.8"/> there are there are <trunc>b</trunc> we can divide this up into a bunch of things and in fact that's the kind of example Hume <pause dur="0.5"/> gives if you're thinking of <trunc>ord</trunc> perceptions of ordinary physical objects they're going to be divisible into parts <pause dur="0.4"/> so he's got an apple <pause dur="0.6"/> says <reading>though a particular colour taste and smell <pause dur="0.5"/> are qualities all united together in this apple <pause dur="0.5"/> it is easy to perceive they're not the same but at least distinguishable from each other</reading> <pause dur="0.3"/> so we can distinguish in the perception of an apple <pause dur="1.1"/> the colour taste and smell i think they had better apples around when <pause dur="0.2"/> Hume was alive but anyway <pause dur="0.3"/> so one one can imagine that there are these <pause dur="0.2"/> these physical objects we can divide <pause dur="0.3"/> perceptions into parts <pause dur="0.3"/> right okay <pause dur="0.3"/> this may <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> ring a bell <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> in your your lectures on perception <pause dur="0.6"/> you may recall <pause dur="0.3"/> # talking about #<pause dur="0.3"/> phenomenalism <pause dur="0.4"/> logical positivism <pause dur="0.9"/> breaking <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> immediate <pause dur="0.2"/> objective perception down into the <pause dur="0.3"/> sense data <pause dur="0.6"/> that make them up so objects are constructions out of 
sense data does that <pause dur="0.6"/> ring any bells at all <pause dur="1.4"/> yeah <pause dur="0.2"/> okay well whatever <pause dur="0.6"/> okay so <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.9"/> we can divide we can divide complex perceptions into parts <pause dur="0.2"/> right <pause dur="1.4"/> this <pause dur="0.2"/> leads to a very very important principle that Hume <pause dur="0.6"/> formulates <pause dur="0.5"/> which is <pause dur="0.2"/> that <pause dur="0.6"/> if you have <pause dur="0.4"/> a <trunc>simp</trunc> <trunc>w</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> <trunc>w</trunc> okay <pause dur="0.8"/> <trunc>s</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> start at the beginning <pause dur="0.2"/> what's the relationship between our ideas and our impressions <pause dur="0.5"/> is it the case that <pause dur="0.3"/> every idea corresponds to an impression and every impression corresponds to an idea <pause dur="0.7"/> 
that's the question he then asks <pause dur="0.3"/> if you've got an idea does it have to <trunc>corres</trunc> is there does there have to be some impression to which it corresponds <pause dur="0.4"/> now if you see why this is important for the empiricism because of course recall that the impressions <pause dur="0.5"/> are the ones that are derived <pause dur="0.2"/> directly from the senses <pause dur="0.9"/> okay can anyone think of an example of an idea <pause dur="0.4"/> that might not be derived from an impression <pause dur="3.9"/> so are there ideas that you have <pause dur="0.3"/> that you haven't <pause dur="0.5"/> derived from impressions </u><u who="sf0167" trans="overlap"> <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> an idea </u><pause dur="0.4"/> <u who="nf0157" trans="pause"> sorry </u><u who="sf0167" trans="latching"> is it God <pause dur="0.2"/> for example </u><pause dur="1.3"/> <u who="nf0157" trans="pause">

streets are paved with gold and rubies or whatever you know and <pause dur="0.3"/> dadadadada <pause dur="0.3"/> one can have an <trunc>i</trunc> an idea of the New Jerusalem without ever having seen it or or a unicorn or whatever <pause dur="0.5"/> so there are <pause dur="0.3"/> but he also thinks that there are <pause dur="1.4"/> impressions <pause dur="0.8"/> of which you have no ideas as well <pause dur="0.2"/> and his example for that is a bit more <pause dur="1.2"/> bit more <pause dur="1.1"/> complicated i mean it's basically say <pause dur="0.5"/> i mean <pause dur="0.7"/> <trunc>ho</trunc> how many people here have been to Paris <pause dur="1.7"/> # quite a few <pause dur="0.3"/> now those of you who've been to Paris <pause dur="0.3"/> you have an impression of Paris i mean you were there you saw # <pause dur="0.6"/> okay <pause dur="0.4"/> but could you now <pause dur="1.0"/> unless you are <shift feature="voice" new="laugh"/>anyone who actually lived there for a while <shift feature="voice" new="normal"/> can shut up for a minute but the rest of you <pause dur="0.5"/> did <pause dur="0.3"/> could you <pause dur="0.5"/> give your idea of Paris could you <pause dur="0.3"/> sort of <pause dur="0.3"/> give a <pause dur="0.2"/> a say a street plan of Paris or a sort of <pause dur="0.3"/> description of all the details of Paris <pause dur="0.7"/> well of course you can't because even if you saw those i mean even if you saw those details in the first place <pause dur="0.7"/> you're not now <pause dur="0.2"/> necessarily going to be able to produce them <pause dur="0.5"/> so the 
idea sort of <pause dur="0.7"/> may have been there originally but it's now <pause dur="0.3"/> faded away <pause dur="0.8"/> # and this is exactly the example that <pause dur="0.9"/> Hume gives he says i have <vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.2"/> excuse me <pause dur="0.6"/> <reading>i have seen Paris <pause dur="0.6"/> but shall i affirm i conform such an idea of that city <pause dur="0.4"/> as will perfectly represent all its streets and houses in their real and just proportions</reading> <pause dur="0.5"/> so sometimes we can have <pause dur="1.1"/> impressions with no ideas <pause dur="1.4"/> and sometimes we can have ideas with no impressions <pause dur="1.3"/> well <pause dur="0.7"/> okay so so <pause dur="0.5"/> that's where we've got to <pause dur="0.6"/> right now this isn't going to help this empiricism <pause dur="0.3"/> but Hume points out that all of these <pause dur="0.5"/> places where there isn't a correspondence a case is a complex of ideas and impressions <pause dur="0.3"/> right <pause dur="0.3"/> the unicorn <pause dur="0.4"/> is a complex idea <pause dur="0.5"/> you can separate out the parts <pause dur="0.8"/> <shift feature="voice" new="laugh"/>you can separate out the horse and the horn <shift feature="voice" new="normal"/><pause dur="0.3"/> yeah <pause dur="0.5"/> familiar example <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.8"/> could the same be true of simple ideas and simple impressions <pause dur="0.5"/> and this is <pause dur="0.5"/> basically the question for for the lecture today <pause dur="0.4"/> could there be a simple idea <pause dur="0.5"/> with no corresponding <pause dur="0.2"/>

and simple ideas <pause dur="0.4"/> so if you've got a simple impression you've got a simple idea if you've got a simple idea <pause dur="0.6"/> the second one is much more important if you've got a simple idea <pause dur="0.3"/> you must have had that corresponding simple impression <pause dur="0.7"/> right <pause dur="0.5"/> why is that an important principle <pause dur="0.5"/> well basically this is what empiricism is for Hume <pause dur="0.6"/> so Hume's an empiricist he thinks all of our knowledge is derived from experience and the bottom line of this <pause dur="0.5"/> is that <pause dur="1.1"/> is this that what we might call a principle of significance <pause dur="0.6"/> that <pause dur="1.5"/> and this is this is famously <pause dur="0.2"/> expressed in his <trunc>i</trunc> <trunc>i</trunc> <trunc>in</trunc> <pause dur="0.3"/> Inquiry have i put this on my <pause dur="0.7"/> handout <pause dur="2.6"/><vocal desc="clicks with tongue" iterated="y" dur="1"/><pause dur="0.5"/> no i haven't <pause dur="0.3"/> ah <pause dur="0.2"/> well okay <pause dur="0.3"/> i mean <pause dur="3.3"/> if we if if we have <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> <reading>all our simple ideas <pause dur="0.2"/> are derived from simple impressions which are correspondent to them and which they exactly represent</reading> <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="3.3"/> there it is it is on the handout it's the third bullet point <pause dur="0.5"/> under the significance of Hume's distinction <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="2.2"/> if <pause dur="0.9"/> Hume's concern that philosophers particularly scholastic philosophers 
people talking about things like substance <pause dur="0.4"/> have no empirical foundation <pause dur="0.6"/> are just talking rubbish <pause dur="0.6"/> it's not just that they're sort of <pause dur="0.4"/> putting forward <pause dur="0.3"/> philosophical principles which we're not sure if they're true or not <pause dur="0.6"/> his <pause dur="0.3"/> basic <pause dur="0.3"/> this this this <pause dur="0.2"/> one to one correspondence between ideas and impressions <pause dur="0.4"/> is intended to guarantee <pause dur="0.4"/> that <pause dur="1.2"/> that <pause dur="0.2"/> in order for a word or a phrase or or something that we talk about to be significant to be meaningful <pause dur="1.1"/> there has it has to ultimately reduce down to impressions to things that we can have knowledge of <pause dur="3.4"/> in the abstract from the Treatise <pause dur="0.3"/> he <pause dur="0.3"/> offers this sarcastic remark <pause dur="1.0"/> so this is someone who's who's going through philosophical treatise he's looking <pause dur="0.2"/> through trying to figure out what's going on <pause dur="0.3"/> and <trunc>i</trunc> he says <pause dur="0.5"/> <reading>when he</reading> <pause dur="0.2"/> he being presumably Hume <pause dur="0.7"/> <reading>when he suspects that any philosophical term <pause dur="0.3"/> has no ideas annexed to it <pause dur="0.4"/> as is too common <pause dur="0.8"/> he always asks <pause dur="0.4"/> from what impression <pause dur="0.4"/> that pretended idea <pause dur="0.3"/> is derived <pause dur="0.5"/> and if no 
impression can be produced <pause dur="0.6"/> he <trunc>cont</trunc> he concludes <pause dur="0.5"/> that the term <pause dur="0.3"/> is altogether <pause dur="0.4"/> insignificant</reading> <pause dur="0.8"/> right <pause dur="0.4"/> so <pause dur="0.3"/> whenever <pause dur="0.3"/> you're looking at a philosophical concept a philosophical idea <pause dur="0.5"/> or <pause dur="0.2"/> some <pause dur="0.2"/> other <pause dur="0.2"/> thing <pause dur="0.2"/> that we might be talking about <pause dur="0.5"/> we say <pause dur="0.3"/> from what impression <pause dur="0.2"/> is that idea derived <pause dur="0.7"/> now if it's a complex idea <pause dur="0.2"/> there may be a complex impression to which it corresponds <pause dur="0.4"/> so for example a complex idea of say <pause dur="0.3"/> father <pause dur="0.6"/> bears an impression <pause dur="0.3"/> of a father so that's okay <pause dur="0.5"/> but if we're talking about something like substance <pause dur="0.6"/> right recall substance from <pause dur="0.5"/> from Locke <pause dur="0.5"/> from what impression is our idea of substance derived <pause dur="2.4"/> well <pause dur="0.3"/> maybe there's a complex idea of substance <pause dur="1.4"/> no <pause dur="0.3"/> can't find that <pause dur="0.2"/> maybe we can break it down <pause dur="0.4"/> into <pause dur="0.4"/> simple <pause dur="0.3"/> impressions which we've built up like with the case of the unicorn <pause dur="0.5"/> right we have the a complex idea of a unicorn we've built that up from <pause dur="0.4"/> simple ideas which are derived from simple impressions a simple idea of <pause dur="0.8"/> well more simple ideas of the horse and the horn or 
whatever <pause dur="0.5"/> with substance are there simple <pause dur="0.4"/> ideas which correspond to impressions from which our <pause dur="0.6"/> our idea of substance is derived <pause dur="0.4"/> and Hume says <pause dur="0.6"/> well no there aren't <pause dur="0.3"/> what does that mean about the philosophical term substance <pause dur="0.9"/> it means that this term is wholly insignificant <pause dur="0.7"/> right it's not just that there isn't any substance <pause dur="0.3"/> it's just that substance doesn't mean anything <pause dur="1.8"/> right so <pause dur="0.2"/> this term <pause dur="0.3"/> is not just <pause dur="0.8"/> doesn't apply to anything it's actually meaningless it's insignificant <pause dur="0.6"/> so <pause dur="0.4"/> this <pause dur="0.6"/> distinction between impressions and ideas <pause dur="0.6"/> guarantees Hume's empiricism it guarantees that <pause dur="0.3"/> all the terms we use <pause dur="0.4"/> at base <pause dur="0.3"/> have to refer back to something <pause dur="0.2"/> which we've <pause dur="0.5"/> observed <pause dur="1.3"/> 
and that's the important <pause dur="0.9"/> i mean of course it also <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> allows Hume to say things like <pause dur="0.5"/> he can he wants to be able to <trunc>redu</trunc> <trunc>rene</trunc> <pause dur="0.3"/> refute <pause dur="0.4"/> the principle of the arguments the doctrine of innate ideas <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> he thinks this will <pause dur="0.3"/> this will offer a foundation for the science of man and so on and so forth <pause dur="0.3"/> but the bottom line of this is <pause dur="0.7"/> from what impression <pause dur="0.3"/> is this pretended this supposed idea derived <pause dur="0.6"/> and if <pause dur="0.2"/> it isn't <pause dur="0.3"/> derived from simple impressions at bottom line <pause dur="0.3"/> then it's not really an idea it's not really something that <pause dur="0.3"/> you can have <pause dur="0.4"/> you may think you have an idea of substance <pause dur="0.2"/> but really you don't it's not really an idea at all <pause dur="1.9"/> that's the bottom line that's that's empiricism for Hume <pause dur="1.5"/> so <pause dur="0.4"/> whether or not you you <pause dur="0.2"/> you like this 
which we're going to come back to in a second <pause dur="0.4"/> this is this is a <pause dur="0.3"/> a highly significant <pause dur="0.7"/> doctrine that <pause dur="0.2"/> at the bottom line there is a there's the one to one correspondence between simple ideas simple impressions <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> simple impressions are all derived simple ideas are all derived from simple impressions <pause dur="0.5"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> you couldn't have a simple idea without an <trunc>i</trunc> simple impression <pause dur="0.4"/> and we can build up more complex ideas from them but if you have an idea <pause dur="0.3"/> you've got to either have an impression that directly corresponds to it <pause dur="0.3"/> or you've got to be able to break it down into simple ideas which correspond to impressions <pause dur="0.6"/> and then <pause dur="0.4"/> and if you can't then it's it's not something that's significant or meaningful <pause dur="2.2"/> right </u><pause dur="0.8"/> <u who="sm0171" trans="pause"> <unclear>do you not</unclear> get ideas in mathematics about any impressions </u><pause dur="1.6"/> <u who="nf0157" trans="pause"> mathematics Hume didn't like very much <pause dur="0.5"/> he's things he says about mathematics are not really <pause dur="0.2"/> very helpful <pause dur="0.4"/> i mean <pause dur="0.7"/> it's it's difficult for <pause dur="0.2"/> empiricists to talk about <pause dur="0.3"/> abstract objects in maths i mean <pause dur="0.3"/> you know okay so i might have the idea of i don't know how

yeah # this <pause dur="0.3"/> <trunc>ho</trunc> dreadful thing right okay <pause dur="0.2"/> i mean this seems to be true <pause dur="0.3"/> that sometimes the things that we think about or reflect about can be much more forceful <pause dur="0.5"/> yeah <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> </u><pause dur="0.2"/> <u who="sf0178" trans="pause"> doesn't she mean though that # <vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.4"/> that's the idea and impression of of the same thing so like <pause dur="0.4"/> it's say if you had a car crash </u><u who="nf0157" trans="latching"> mm-hmm </u><u who="nf0157" trans="overlap"> okay so that <pause dur="0.6"/> that # reflection when you're thinking about it in your mind <pause dur="0.3"/> that might be more forceful than yeah see seeing an old <pause dur="0.5"/> man but <pause dur="0.2"/> would it be more forceful <pause dur="0.2"/> than actually being in that car crash </u><u who="nf0157" trans="latching"> right okay and i think that's a good point and i think that's where he he sort of gets his his terminology from <pause dur="0.3"/> that when obviously when you have <pause dur="0.3"/> your <pause dur="0.2"/> idea of remembering the <pause dur="0.2"/> the car crash later <pause dur="0.2"/> it is only a faint copy of the original <pause dur="0.3"/> impression <pause dur="0.7"/> yeah that's certainly true because <pause dur="0.3"/> the experience when you're right there is clearly more forceful <pause dur="0.9"/> but unfortunately that's not going to do <pause dur="0.2"/> i mean that's right but that's not going to do all the work that Hume wants it to do because <pause dur="0.2"/> he can't <pause dur="0.3"/> he can't make the he doesn't want to make the 
distinction between perceiving <pause dur="0.4"/> and thinking <pause dur="0.4"/> just in terms of <pause dur="0.4"/> of what's going on out there <pause dur="0.3"/> he needs to make this distinction introspectively <pause dur="0.4"/> so it's no good to say well <pause dur="0.2"/> impressions are the things where there is an external object <pause dur="0.5"/> where it's actually happening now or whatever <pause dur="0.4"/> and thinking and reflecting is when <pause dur="0.3"/> the object's gone away <pause dur="0.6"/> and you're just looking back on it <pause dur="0.3"/> because that would just <pause dur="0.3"/> that would just trivialize this distinction that would just be saying well <pause dur="0.4"/> impressions are the things you perceive and ideas are the things you reflect on <pause dur="0.4"/> but he wants to make the distinction between perceiving and thinking <pause dur="0.3"/> by talking about impressions and ideas <pause dur="0.5"/> so if he just defines it in that way he's not <pause dur="0.5"/> he's he's not got a <pause dur="0.5"/> basic distinction between perceiving and thinking <pause dur="1.1"/> he wants to do it introspectively he wants to say you can just look into your mind <pause dur="0.3"/> and distinguish between <pause dur="0.4"/> impressions and ideas <pause dur="0.6"/> right without referring to what's going on outside <pause dur="0.4"/> and the problem is is that 
although in some cases like the one you mentioned <pause dur="0.3"/> it will be quite obvious <pause dur="0.3"/> at other times <pause dur="0.3"/> there is other sort of <pause dur="0.4"/> with <pause dur="0.2"/> <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/>'s example you know there are some very <pause dur="0.5"/> faint and pathetic kind of impressions <pause dur="0.3"/> and some very forceful lively exciting <pause dur="0.4"/> ideas <pause dur="0.6"/> and the distinction just doesn't seem to happen that way </u><pause dur="1.1"/> <u who="sf0179" trans="pause"> if <pause dur="0.4"/> if you're when he says <pause dur="0.3"/><vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/> if you perceive something <pause dur="0.5"/> but it's not actually there <pause dur="0.2"/> you <unclear>you know</unclear> we're not meant to be relying on the external thing but i thought perceiving was relying on the external thing </u><pause dur="0.4"/> <u who="nf0157" trans="pause"> right exactly i mean this is the problem that he wants to say that perception is when you have an impression <pause dur="0.7"/> and thinking is when you have an idea <pause dur="2.1"/> i mean he wants to make the distinction between perceiving and thinking in terms of forcefulness basically <pause dur="0.6"/> and that just doesn't seem to quite work <pause dur="1.3"/> i mean that that's the problem that's exactly the problem that it seems that you can have a forceful <trunc>im</trunc> a forceful idea <pause dur="0.4"/> a forceful mental experience <pause dur="0.3"/> even 
when there's nothing there <pause dur="1.5"/> so it's just not true that the perceptions the real perceptions <pause dur="0.3"/> are always more forceful <pause dur="0.5"/> than the things you reflect on <pause dur="1.7"/> and Hume in fact admits that i mean he says sometimes <pause dur="0.5"/> you know our # our ideas our impressions of our ideas are very lively and our impressions are so low and faint that you can't really <pause dur="0.2"/> distinguish them from my from <pause dur="0.2"/> impressions <pause dur="0.3"/> but generally we know what we mean <pause dur="1.0"/> 
well okay <pause dur="0.9"/> # <pause dur="1.6"/> okay <pause dur="3.7"/><kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="7"/> how does <pause dur="0.3"/> Hume <pause dur="0.9"/> argue for this distinction how does he <pause dur="0.4"/> rely <pause dur="0.2"/> how does he <pause dur="0.6"/> argue for the very very important principle which is <pause dur="0.6"/> that <pause dur="0.9"/> every simple idea must come from a simple impression because <pause dur="0.4"/> this is the the touchstone of his empiricism this is the principle <pause dur="0.3"/> on which he bases his criticisms of cause his criticisms of <pause dur="0.4"/> personal identity right so his basic philosophical method is going to be saying that here's a philosophical term <pause dur="0.7"/> here it is like <pause dur="0.2"/> like substance <pause dur="1.0"/><shift feature="voice" new="laugh"/> where's the impression <shift feature="voice" new="normal"/> from which this <pause dur="0.5"/> idea is derived <pause dur="0.7"/> if we can't find one <pause dur="0.6"/> 
then it's insignificant that is his big philosophical argument <pause dur="0.7"/> and it relies on empiricism so it's pretty important for him to argue <pause dur="0.4"/> for this principle that simple <pause dur="0.3"/> ideas are derived from simple impressions <pause dur="1.5"/> well <pause dur="0.2"/> he gives us various arguments he he challenges anyone to produce a simple idea that's not derived from a <trunc>s</trunc> from a simple impression <pause dur="0.4"/> he says <pause dur="0.2"/> you know if you want he gives a sort of <pause dur="0.6"/> earlier version of the Mary example if you want to teach a child <pause dur="0.3"/> what red is <pause dur="0.5"/> do you try and <pause dur="0.2"/> explain it to them no you don't you show them red <pause dur="0.4"/> so <pause dur="0.2"/> for with children they get the impression and then they have the idea <pause dur="0.3"/> that's the order it goes in <pause dur="0.6"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> he gives the example of a a blind man so that was <pause dur="0.3"/> Erika's example a deaf person he said look a blind man <pause dur="0.3"/> can form no idea of colours <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> a deaf person <pause dur="0.2"/> will have no idea of sounds <pause dur="0.7"/> # someone who's never tasted a pineapple <pause dur="1.0"/> doesn't know what a pineapple tastes like they have no idea of the taste of pineapple <pause dur="1.2"/> okay <pause dur="0.2"/> so that's his argument <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="1.0"/> 
unfortunately <pause dur="0.2"/> he then offers a very famous counter-example <shift feature="voice" new="laugh"/>to <shift feature="voice" new="normal"/> his own argument <pause dur="0.6"/> which is a bit of a <pause dur="0.5"/> a strange thing to do <pause dur="0.7"/> # and this is the example of the missing colour shade so i'm just going to talk about that for two minutes and then we'll stop <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> and this this example of Hume's <pause dur="0.2"/> is <pause dur="1.8"/> let's just imagine that we have <pause dur="0.2"/> a man <pause dur="0.4"/> who's facing a sort of a series of colours so <pause dur="0.3"/> we start with say we <trunc>s</trunc> with blue say we start with dark blue <pause dur="0.3"/> and we move along the colour series to light blue <pause dur="0.3"/> one into the other <pause dur="0.3"/> but in the middle there's a gap <pause dur="0.9"/> and the the the <pause dur="0.7"/> gap <pause dur="0.2"/> corresponds to a shade <pause dur="0.8"/> yeah so everyone got the picture so you've got dark going to light <pause dur="0.3"/> and there's a gap where <pause dur="0.2"/> one of the shades would be <pause dur="0.3"/> and as it happens that shade <pause dur="0.3"/> is not a shade <pause dur="0.3"/> that the person <pause dur="0.2"/> who's looking at the colour series <pause dur="0.2"/> has ever seen before <pause dur="0.5"/> so he hasn't had an impression <pause dur="0.4"/> of that missing colour shade <pause dur="1.0"/> and Hume says <pause dur="1.0"/> can the man form <pause dur="0.2"/> an idea <pause dur="0.7"/> of <pause dur="0.2"/> the missing colour shade <pause dur="0.9"/> from the series presented to him <pause dur="2.6"/> 
what do you reckon can he who thinks he can <pause dur="0.3"/><vocal desc="sniff" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.2"/><kinesic desc="put hands up" n="ss" iterated="n"/> right <pause dur="0.6"/> who anyone think he can't <pause dur="1.6"/> right okay so so <pause dur="0.5"/> Hume says yes it does seem plausible to think that he can in fact form an idea of the missing colour shade <pause dur="0.3"/> when he's had no impression of this <pause dur="0.5"/> and what he says about this example is <pause dur="1.0"/> what's he say about this example <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="1.6"/> he says <pause dur="0.2"/> <reading>is it possible for him to supply this deficiency <pause dur="0.2"/> and raise up to himself the idea of that particular shade <pause dur="0.3"/> though it had never been conveyed to him by the senses <pause dur="0.4"/> i believe there are few that will be of the opinion that he can</reading> <pause dur="0.3"/> as has been empirically demonstrated in this class <pause dur="0.6"/> <reading>and this may serve as a proof that the simple ideas are not always derived from correspondent impressions <pause dur="0.8"/> though the instance is so particular and singular <pause dur="0.3"/> that 'tis scare worth our observing and does not merit that for it alone we should alter our general maxim</reading> <pause dur="0.8"/> so that's not very <pause dur="0.3"/> good really <pause dur="0.4"/> and then there's an enormous literature of 
course in the Hume literature saying well why did Hume do this <pause dur="0.5"/> why having proposed this general theory which is so important to him <pause dur="0.3"/> does he then offer us <pause dur="0.3"/> this counter-example <pause dur="0.4"/> and of course if you well <pause dur="0.2"/> you can go away and read this for yourselves <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> okay <pause dur="1.1"/> what do you reckon <pause dur="1.4"/> so <pause dur="0.5"/> let me remind you by the way that about <pause dur="0.3"/> twenty minutes ago <pause dur="0.3"/> <trunc>y</trunc> you you seemed <pause dur="0.4"/> maybe to be <pause dur="0.5"/> going for this principle that we can't have a simple idea without a simple impression <pause dur="0.2"/> yeah <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> </u><u who="sf0180" trans="overlap"> i don't think it's quite the same because <pause dur="0.6"/> it's not <pause dur="0.6"/> it's the whole thing about not being able to have a simple idea </u><pause dur="0.2"/> <u who="nf0157" trans="pause"> mm-hmm </u><u who="sf0180" trans="latching"> without the simple impression <pause dur="0.4"/> but i think if you <pause dur="0.3"/> say with the example of the shades of blue </u><pause dur="0.2"/> <u who="nf0157" trans="pause"> yeah </u><u who="sf0180" trans="overlap"> you've given them sort of ninety per cent of the idea </u><pause dur="0.5"/> <u who="nf0157" trans="pause"> mm-hmm </u><u who="sf0180" trans="overlap"> and they've got to fill in from that so say somebody who never ever seen red at all <pause dur="0.4"/> if you gave them the whole spectrum of red with a bit missing </u><pause dur="0.3"/> <u who="nf0157" trans="pause"> yeah </u><u who="sf0180" trans="overlap"> they will be able to fill that in 
just by sort of <pause dur="0.6"/> you know <pause dur="0.5"/> working it out from what's there </u><pause dur="0.2"/> <u who="nf0157" trans="pause"> right </u><u who="sf0180" trans="overlap"> you're not asking them to create anything from nothing </u><u who="nf0157" trans="latching"> right </u><u who="sf0180" trans="latching"> if you've given them so much to work from </u><u who="nf0157" trans="latching"> right and i mean <trunc>act</trunc> actually that's that's very interesting because that is <pause dur="0.3"/> basically the line that # Harold Noonan takes and i was going to say i didn't bring with me though <pause dur="0.4"/> that you know those Routledge blue and green books like there's the one on Locke by E J Lowe and there's the Hume one by <pause dur="0.3"/> guy called Noonan and that's very good and that's <pause dur="0.2"/> pretty much the line he takes <pause dur="0.4"/> but <pause dur="0.7"/> i mean there are there are various things i mean that seems to imply that maybe <pause dur="0.2"/> colour shades are not simple ideas <pause dur="0.6"/> that <pause dur="0.2"/> we can sort of derive them from putting together other things <pause dur="1.0"/> the <pause dur="0.4"/> the <pause dur="0.3"/> i suppose 
the one problem with that is that Hume <pause dur="0.4"/> did think that colour shades were simple ideas <pause dur="0.3"/> it doesn't really explain why <pause dur="0.3"/> he offered this as a counter-example and then <pause dur="0.7"/> # changed his mind </u><pause dur="0.2"/> <u who="sf0181" trans="pause"> maybe he didn't know how light worked though because <pause dur="0.2"/> i guess you could </u><u who="nf0157" trans="overlap"> mm-hmm </u><u who="sf0181" trans="overlap">put it in a scientific sense 'cause </u><pause dur="0.2"/> <u who="nf0157" trans="pause"> yeah </u><u who="sf0181" trans="overlap">you know <pause dur="0.2"/> different <pause dur="0.7"/> pure shades of light </u><pause dur="0.3"/> <u who="nf0157" trans="pause"> yeah they're they're different they're different wavelengths and and then we can <pause dur="0.2"/> yeah <pause dur="0.3"/> i mean <pause dur="0.8"/> sure and maybe that's just maybe that's just # <pause dur="0.6"/> a an unfortunate fact about <pause dur="0.2"/> Hume's empiricism but of course you've got then got to think well how far does this apply to any kind of sense data theory about about <pause dur="0.8"/> 
perception about what objects are <pause dur="0.4"/> # okay <pause dur="0.2"/> final thought i mean one thing <pause dur="0.8"/> does this undermine Hume <pause dur="0.4"/> because if it does we might as well stop here <pause dur="0.3"/> and i mean i think the interesting thing is that one can tell various stories about why this might not undermine Hume <pause dur="0.4"/> but i think the bottom line is that <pause dur="0.3"/> this principle for Hume is very important <pause dur="0.4"/> and he will go on to apply it in various areas <pause dur="0.3"/> and this particular counter-example doesn't really seem to undermine <pause dur="0.3"/> his <trunc>ef</trunc> efforts to apply this principle in other areas <pause dur="0.3"/> so particularly in the idea of causation <pause dur="0.3"/> the idea of personal identity <pause dur="0.3"/> that seems to be quite a different kind of principle <pause dur="1.2"/> okay <pause dur="0.3"/> so <pause dur="0.5"/> next week belief
