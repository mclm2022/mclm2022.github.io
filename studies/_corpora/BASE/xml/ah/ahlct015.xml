what i'm going to do in this session <pause dur="0.5"/> is first of all to # do what i think of as sort of housekeeping <pause dur="0.3"/> to sort of organizational matters <pause dur="0.6"/> # then secondly i'm going to give you a sort of <pause dur="0.5"/> very general <pause dur="0.2"/> introduction to neo-realism a kind of taster really <pause dur="0.3"/> of the first part of the course <pause dur="0.4"/> and then i'm actually going to introduce at a bit greater length both this afternoon's films <pause dur="0.3"/> and also the next two films after that <pause dur="0.4"/> # because as you're only seeing each of them once at least <pause dur="0.3"/> # # <trunc>f</trunc> at a formal screening <pause dur="0.3"/> it's quite important that # you're actually primed to look for things and so on and have a sense of <pause dur="0.4"/> where they're coming from <pause dur="0.4"/> you're rather being thrown straight in the deep end with not having a screening <pause dur="0.4"/> before term obviously <pause dur="0.6"/> so if we <trunc>c</trunc> if you could turn first then just on the sort of housekeeping front <pause dur="0.4"/> to the # the first handout Aspects of European Cinema it's that's what it says at the top <pause dur="0.7"/> just one or two points to make i'm not going to sort of read 
through all of this <pause dur="0.3"/> but just one or two points to make <pause dur="0.2"/> about this <pause dur="0.3"/> the first one is <shift feature="voice" new="laugh"/>please read it <shift feature="voice" new="normal"/><pause dur="0.3"/> all the information is there and if the information isn't there <pause dur="0.4"/> obviously please let me know what i have left out <pause dur="0.3"/> # but that is the basic sort of organizational things please do actually take the trouble to read it <pause dur="0.4"/> can i just draw your attention to two changes from last term <pause dur="0.5"/> one is the timetable <pause dur="0.3"/> which # # most of you seem to have <trunc>re</trunc> # remembered this change in the timetable <pause dur="0.2"/> but also i think i'm right in saying the screening <pause dur="0.4"/> is either earlier than i thought it was or earlier than it was last year on Friday <pause dur="0.3"/> was it twelve o'clock <trunc>o</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> on Friday always </u><pause dur="0.4"/> <u who="sf0068" trans="pause"> mm </u><u who="nm0067" trans="overlap"> it was just me that thought it was two o'clock okay <pause dur="0.3"/> so there's there's only the only changes really are <trunc>f</trunc> today <pause dur="0.4"/> <trunc>m</trunc> # the <trunc>s</trunc> the lecture and screening <pause dur="0.7"/> the other change to take note of is the <pause dur="0.3"/> deadline for the long essay <pause dur="0.5"/><vocal desc="cough" iterated="n"/> and that is actually a week later <pause dur="0.4"/> than it says in the course <pause dur="0.3"/> handbook it's actually the first Monday of the 
vacation <pause dur="0.4"/> and the reason for doing that is just quite simply that those that if that that if you wish to write about <pause dur="0.3"/> Fellini in general <pause dur="0.3"/> # obviously you can't really have the deadline <pause dur="0.2"/> when you're <trunc>s</trunc> when we're still <pause dur="0.3"/> lecturing and watching # Fellini movies <pause dur="0.3"/> so it's really to allow you the <trunc>f</trunc> maximum flexibility in what you choose to write about <pause dur="0.2"/> so the essay is actually a week <pause dur="0.3"/> later you can hand it in earlier if you wanted obviously <pause dur="0.4"/> but # the that the deadline is the first Monday of the vacation <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> otherwise <trunc>e</trunc> thing's i think are fairly straightforward i'm always <pause dur="0.3"/> perfectly happy to talk to people about other essay titles than the ones that are actually listed here <pause dur="0.3"/> if they if you if there are things you really want to pursue <pause dur="0.3"/> that i haven't actually signalled in the essays <pause dur="0.3"/> just come and see me and we can talk about the viability of it and so on but <pause dur="0.3"/> i'm always very happy for people to <pause dur="0.2"/> pursue their own ideas <pause dur="0.2"/> one other small thing i mean i've i've just put a little thing in 
brackets at the bottom of the first page <pause dur="0.3"/> # about the about <pause dur="0.2"/> conventions about <pause dur="0.2"/> how you write titles in Italian <pause dur="0.3"/> now i don't want you to be too sort of # <pause dur="0.8"/><shift feature="voice" new="laugh"/> traumatized <shift feature="voice" new="normal"/><pause dur="0.4"/> by the <trunc>prob</trunc> the fact of using Italian language i mean <pause dur="0.4"/> think there might be at least one person here who won't <pause dur="0.2"/> certainly won't be traumatized <pause dur="0.3"/> but # most # most obviously most people here don't know Italian at all <pause dur="0.3"/> and i don't want you to get into a terrible state about it <pause dur="0.4"/> but nonetheless you should <pause dur="0.4"/> as scholars <pause dur="0.2"/> write the titles of films and of any books or texts that you refer to <pause dur="0.3"/> # in Italian <trunc>a</trunc> <trunc>or</trunc> and <pause dur="0.3"/> get the <pause dur="0.2"/> not only get it correct in terms of spelling which is just a question of looking <pause dur="0.3"/> but also get it correct in terms of the <pause dur="0.2"/> convention <pause dur="0.2"/> for <trunc>represent</trunc> for making titles in Italian and that is # <pause dur="0.3"/> explained on this sheet <pause dur="0.6"/> now one of the things about what we're actually going to call the films <pause dur="0.3"/> and you'll notice that # <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> i've <trunc>s</trunc> i sometimes slip between if you if you turn to the projection rota 
for instance <pause dur="0.5"/> # i sort of slip between <pause dur="0.3"/> giving the # Italian title then putting the translation in brackets <pause dur="0.3"/> or else just giving the Italian title <pause dur="0.2"/> and that's simply because of # kind of what has become conventionalized in other words <pause dur="0.4"/> no one calls <distinct lang="it">la</distinct> <trunc>s</trunc> no one in England calls <pause dur="0.4"/> La Strada the road which is what it means it it's never called that <pause dur="0.2"/> in film study i don't know why but it isn't <pause dur="0.3"/> on the other hand <pause dur="0.3"/> few # # few # # British people feel <pause dur="0.2"/> brave enough to say Ladri di Biciclette <pause dur="0.5"/> like that even even as bad as bad as that <pause dur="0.3"/> they'd rather say Bicycle Thieves so it's become a kind of convention <pause dur="0.2"/> so in terms of our speaking <pause dur="0.2"/> you don't need to get your head # <pause dur="0.2"/><shift feature="voice" new="laugh"/> head <shift feature="voice" new="normal"/> your mouth around <pause dur="0.3"/> <distinct lang="it">biciclette</distinct> <pause dur="0.3"/> # you can <shift feature="voice" new="laugh"/>say Bicycle Thieves <shift feature="voice" new="normal"/> but in the essays you should write it <pause dur="0.2"/> # correctly in Italian <pause dur="0.7"/> # i think that's all i want to say about this sort of level of housekeeping except just to draw your <pause dur="0.2"/> attention to the structure of the course <pause dur="1.4"/> the course # is # in basically in <pause dur="0.3"/> three parts 
the last part of which actually <pause dur="0.2"/> relates to the first two parts <pause dur="0.7"/> the first two parts deal with first of all neo-realism which is the first four weeks <pause dur="0.3"/> # and then # popular genre cinema <pause dur="0.2"/> in the middle # three weeks although it's only two 'cause one of them's a reading week <pause dur="0.7"/> and there we're looking at a contrast of practices within Italian cinema <pause dur="0.2"/> in this period <pause dur="0.3"/> that's to say we're looking at what is most famous in Italian cinema in the period <pause dur="0.3"/> namely neo-realism this is the most famous thing that anyone knows <pause dur="0.3"/> about Italian cinema <pause dur="0.3"/> a great period of of cinema Italian neo-realism so we're starting with that <pause dur="0.4"/> kind of canonical moment <pause dur="0.6"/> and that was a moment which was particularly concerned with <pause dur="0.4"/> # make with sort of trying to capture the spirit of the Italian people <pause dur="0.2"/> trying to show <pause dur="0.3"/> the ordinary lives of ordinary Italian people <pause dur="0.2"/> so it was very much concerned with the idea of <pause dur="0.3"/> the popular classes with the popular in the sense of <pause dur="0.2"/> the life of the people <pause dur="0.5"/> however <pause dur="0.5"/> the people <pause dur="0.3"/> 
actually went to see <pause dur="0.2"/> epics and comedies and melodramas <pause dur="0.3"/> # and that's what we're looking at in the second part of the <pause dur="0.3"/> course particularly epics and comedies <pause dur="0.3"/> we're looking at the kinds of <pause dur="0.3"/> popular cinema the big box office hits <pause dur="0.3"/> # that were # that appeared at the time <pause dur="0.3"/> and some people have actually <trunc>s</trunc> been struck by this contrast of a <pause dur="0.3"/> of a <trunc>pe</trunc> of of a kind of filmmaking that is in a way <pause dur="0.3"/> about the people <pause dur="0.2"/> neo-realism and a kind of filmmaking <pause dur="0.5"/> that is <pause dur="0.2"/> for the people <pause dur="0.3"/> which is actually a comedy an epic and melodrama <pause dur="0.3"/> now as we <pause dur="0.4"/> as the course develops you'll <pause dur="0.2"/> <trunc>re</trunc> realize that it's <pause dur="0.2"/> that neat distinction is not quite that <pause dur="0.5"/> simple that a lot of neo-realist films were in fact <pause dur="0.3"/> very popular at the box office and were very melodramatic and could be comedies <pause dur="0.3"/> and similarly of course not every <pause dur="0.2"/> epic or comedy actually <pause dur="0.3"/> did very well at the box office so <pause dur="0.2"/> the distinction becomes more complicated when you look at it <pause dur="0.3"/> but that's the basic distinction <pause dur="0.3"/> i'm working with in the first two 
parts of the course <pause dur="0.6"/> in the final part of the course <pause dur="0.3"/> we're looking at the work of Federico Fellini <pause dur="0.4"/> and what's interesting about Fellini <pause dur="0.4"/><vocal desc="cough" iterated="n"/> is that <pause dur="1.2"/> on the one hand he came out of neo-realism he was <pause dur="0.2"/> one of the scriptwriters even in Paisà which we're seeing this afternoon <pause dur="0.4"/> so he was very involved with neo-realism <pause dur="0.6"/> <trunc>he</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> but at the same time he also made extremely <pause dur="0.4"/> popular films particularly comedies in the early part of his career <pause dur="0.3"/> La Dolce Vita was one of the biggest box office hits in the history of Italian cinema <pause dur="0.8"/> # but his later films and even when you look at them the earlier films are actually very ambiguous in what they really think <pause dur="0.2"/> about both neo-realism <pause dur="0.3"/> and <pause dur="0.3"/> popular genre cinema <pause dur="0.3"/> so Fellini quite apart from being a wonderful filmmaker <pause dur="0.4"/> is particularly interesting to look at <pause dur="0.3"/> in the context of having looked at <pause dur="0.3"/> neo-realism and popular genre cinema <pause dur="0.4"/> so that's why the three <pause dur="0.3"/> that's the relationship between <pause dur="0.2"/> the three parts of the course <pause dur="0.3"/> # and i'll keep 
signalling that as we go through the course <pause dur="1.1"/> okay well i'm to turn from that to # <pause dur="1.1"/> # saying something <pause dur="0.2"/> a little bit more about the course outline <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> now if you turn to the # # the sort of fattest bit really the course outline <pause dur="0.4"/> # i just wanted to make one or two again in a way organizational points about this <pause dur="0.7"/> the first is to say that <pause dur="0.3"/> about the readings <pause dur="0.2"/> now on the one hand this is not everything there is that could be read <pause dur="0.2"/> here <trunc>b</trunc> on all these topics <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> and it's not nor is it everything i expect you to read <pause dur="0.6"/> basically what i've put down here <pause dur="0.3"/> in the readings are very good starting points <pause dur="0.4"/> and starting points particularly related <pause dur="0.3"/> to the work <trunc>i</trunc> <trunc>i</trunc> <trunc>i</trunc> in each week so <trunc>a</trunc> as as we go through in each week <pause dur="0.4"/> so you should really see these # <pause dur="0.5"/> recommendations as recommended starting points <pause dur="0.3"/> rather than kind of this is the reading <pause dur="0.2"/> for this week and when you've read that you've read everything <pause dur="0.3"/> so on the one hand i'm not saying you've got to read that one <pause dur="0.3"/> 
you've actually got to <trunc>des</trunc> you've actually got to glance through things and think well actually this looks like <pause dur="0.4"/> the sort of thing that <pause dur="0.3"/> really <pause dur="0.2"/> talks about it in a way that i find useful <pause dur="0.2"/> so you've got to learn to <pause dur="0.2"/> discriminate between <pause dur="0.3"/> different texts different accounts and so on <pause dur="0.2"/> part of what becoming <pause dur="0.4"/> # you know a good student is is knowing how to <pause dur="0.2"/> distinguish between <pause dur="0.3"/> # different kinds of texts you may come across critical texts you may come across <pause dur="0.3"/> so i deliberately don't say oh this is the one <pause dur="0.2"/> i recommend this above all <pause dur="0.4"/> so on the one hand i'm not saying <pause dur="0.2"/> you must read this <pause dur="0.4"/> i'm saying these are good starting points for reading <pause dur="0.2"/> and i expect you to explore and obviously <pause dur="0.2"/> essays which show that people have really explored <pause dur="0.2"/> explored the library <pause dur="0.2"/> explored the C-D-ROMs in the library and followed up on <pause dur="0.3"/> things they've found through that <pause dur="0.4"/> that shows in an essay <pause dur="0.3"/> and that's obviously something for which you get <pause dur="0.3"/> you get credit as well <pause dur="0.9"/> so <pause dur="0.2"/> the readings as i say are not sort 
of are not <pause dur="0.3"/> things that <pause dur="0.3"/> # you have to read <pause dur="0.3"/> they're good starting points <pause dur="0.2"/> and the point is for you to develop your own <pause dur="0.2"/> scholarship really in relation to <pause dur="0.3"/> the topic week by week <pause dur="0.7"/> and some things i don't really put at all for instance i don't bother to list all the books <pause dur="0.2"/> about Rossellini <pause dur="0.2"/> # that there are in the library and not even all the books about Fellini <pause dur="0.4"/> # the i did for instance for this week <pause dur="0.3"/> mention the Brunette book on Rossellini because i think it's particularly good <pause dur="0.4"/> # so in that particular case i suppose i am actually recommending it <pause dur="0.2"/> as a particularly good starting point <pause dur="0.2"/> but there are other books on Rossellini in the library <pause dur="0.2"/> and you may look at them and think they're better <pause dur="0.6"/> # so i certainly <trunc>d</trunc> things like genres directors <pause dur="0.2"/> and i don't certainly don't give you general reading on the notion of genre or authorship or something i <trunc>s</trunc> assume <pause dur="0.3"/> you know all of that and don't need <pause dur="0.3"/> more theoretical input from me <pause dur="0.4"/> so # again the reading <pause dur="0.2"/> is not this is not meant to 
be you should not see this as a complete reading list <pause dur="0.2"/> on the contrary it's an <trunc>ind</trunc> indication of where to start <pause dur="0.3"/> and if there are particular areas that you take up an interest in and <pause dur="0.3"/> can't <pause dur="0.2"/> don't quite know how to find your way around the library obviously come and see me <pause dur="0.3"/> and we can talk about that <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="1.1"/> again i don't <pause dur="0.5"/> <trunc>w</trunc> <trunc>e</trunc> <trunc>und</trunc> under the films you'll see each week it's # there's there's reading which relates to the topic of the week <pause dur="0.3"/> and there's reading that's very specifically relates <pause dur="0.2"/> to the film of the week <pause dur="0.3"/> and again i don't sort of say oh well you might have a look at <pause dur="0.4"/> Peter Bondanella's general history of # what's it called <pause dur="0.7"/> Italian Cinema from Neo-realism to the Present oh yeah i <trunc>d</trunc> i don't bother to list that <pause dur="0.2"/> for you to go and look and see what he says about Paisà i <pause dur="0.2"/> i assume that you'll realize <pause dur="0.4"/> that any general history <pause dur="0.2"/> or any general book on a director or a # an area or whatever <pause dur="0.4"/> may well be worth looking at <pause dur="0.3"/> in terms of the film of the week <pause dur="0.3"/> it's much more i try to # draw your 
attention <pause dur="0.2"/> to things that you might <pause dur="0.4"/> not come across otherwise like the <pause dur="0.3"/> chapter in Film Hieroglyphs you're unlikely just to <pause dur="0.3"/> casually come across that <pause dur="1.2"/> okay <pause dur="0.3"/> so what i've been doing so far is just organizational matters trying to explain the structure of the course <pause dur="0.2"/> something about # how the how we work and so on <pause dur="1.1"/> now i want to turn from that then <pause dur="0.3"/> to actually talking about <pause dur="0.3"/> the # <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> subject <pause dur="0.3"/> for <pause dur="0.2"/> # this <trunc>s</trunc> part of the course <pause dur="0.3"/> which is <pause dur="0.2"/> namely neo-realism <pause dur="0.7"/> now let me first <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> if you can just first get this <pause dur="0.2"/> lit up <pause dur="0.6"/> to be going on with </u><gap reason="break in recording" extent="uncertain"/> <u who="nm0067" trans="pause"> okay now i'm just going to begin by giving you a <pause dur="0.4"/> a flavour <pause dur="0.2"/> of <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.8"/> neo-realism from just <trunc>b</trunc> by having partly the background music from the films <pause dur="0.3"/> and then just looking at one or two examples of <pause dur="0.2"/> posters or <pause dur="0.3"/> slides or stills from the films <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> basically neo-realism is a period of Italian <pause dur="0.5"/> cinema production <pause dur="0.3"/> usually dated from the mid-forties to the early fifties <pause dur="0.3"/> although again as we will be discussing next term <pause dur="0.3"/><vocal desc="cough" iterated="n"/> quite a <vocal desc="cough" iterated="n"/> lot <pause dur="0.4"/> of <pause dur="0.2"/> # debate is <pause dur="0.2"/> really about 
when and when it starts and particularly when it finishes <pause dur="0.4"/> # and i come back to that in a moment <pause dur="0.4"/> many people see this film Ossessione obsession <pause dur="0.3"/> which is actually the <pause dur="1.1"/> second film version <pause dur="0.4"/> of The Postman Always Rings Twice <pause dur="0.4"/> there are actually four versions the first was French then this one then the <pause dur="0.3"/> two Hollywood ones were later <pause dur="0.4"/> # but this is <trunc>son</trunc> nonetheless seen <pause dur="0.3"/> as as something that <pause dur="0.3"/> was perhaps the first <pause dur="0.3"/> # Italian neo-realist film actually made in about nineteen-forty-one and almost instantly banned <pause dur="0.3"/> by Mussolini who <pause dur="0.3"/> thought it gave a degrading picture of # <pause dur="0.3"/> life in Italy <pause dur="0.4"/> but nonetheless and i'll show you an extract from that next week <pause dur="0.2"/> so there's an argument about <trunc>whe</trunc> whether it starts <kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> but it's usually <pause dur="0.4"/> # associated particularly with Rome Open City <pause dur="0.2"/> and Paisan which we're looking at <pause dur="0.3"/> but i suppose the film that most people have heard of <pause dur="0.3"/> is Bicycle Thieves # i guess it's the most famous <pause dur="0.3"/> Italian neo-realist film <pause dur="0.3"/> this is just the poster from it of course 
what's quite interesting about it <pause dur="0.3"/> is the graphic style <pause dur="0.3"/> the fact that it's actually done in this <pause dur="0.3"/> sort of for a film poster rather impressionistic style <pause dur="0.3"/> rather <pause dur="0.2"/> not actually of course quite sophisticated but nonetheless <pause dur="0.2"/> quite simple looking as a style <pause dur="0.3"/> there was none of the kind of grandeur <pause dur="0.2"/> and special effects that even by <pause dur="0.2"/> the forties had become standard <pause dur="0.2"/> in posters <pause dur="0.2"/> so even in the <pause dur="0.2"/> even the fact that you've just got rather ordinary people <pause dur="0.2"/> and it's drawn in this particular or painted <pause dur="0.3"/> in this rather daubed on style even that <pause dur="0.3"/> is an indication of a different kind of cinema <pause dur="0.3"/> from the from the <pause dur="0.3"/> popular grandiose entertainment cinema <pause dur="0.3"/> that had been <pause dur="0.3"/> popular both in Hollywood <pause dur="0.3"/> but also in Italian in Italy <pause dur="0.2"/> in # the period before neo-realism <pause dur="0.3"/> so the but this as i say is the is the poster for <pause dur="0.3"/> the most famous <kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> <trunc>ex</trunc> <pause dur="0.3"/> # Italian neo-realist film <pause dur="0.7"/> but there are an awful lot of Italian neo-realist films that actually most people outside of Italy <pause dur="0.2"/> have never heard of and that 
actually don't exist in subtitled prints <pause dur="0.3"/> and can't really be shown <pause dur="0.4"/> this for instance # is a film called <pause dur="0.4"/> Molti Sogni per le Strade many cares along the road <pause dur="0.3"/> which is actually a comedy and an awful lot of Italian neo-realist films when you start to look <pause dur="0.3"/> are in fact comedies <pause dur="0.3"/> # and # this actually stars Anna Magnani who is one of the biggest <pause dur="0.3"/> stars of <pause dur="0.3"/> # Italian neo-realism she is the kind of the unforgettable star of Rome Open City <pause dur="0.4"/> but she's she was actually a very well known star in the period generally <pause dur="0.2"/> as indeed was Massimo Girotti <pause dur="0.3"/> who plays the hero in Ossessione <pause dur="0.3"/> so often in fact movie stars despite what you may have read <pause dur="0.3"/> movie stars did appear <pause dur="0.3"/> in Italian neo-realist films and again it's something we'll <pause dur="0.3"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> come back to talking about <pause dur="0.8"/> this is another <pause dur="0.4"/> # just a sort of popular drama film <pause dur="0.2"/> that was nonetheless a neo-realist film it's means <pause dur="0.2"/> spring is here <pause dur="0.4"/> # so it's just another example <pause dur="0.2"/> but i'm just trying to suggest that <pause dur="0.3"/> there's a whole <pause dur="0.5"/> what we tend to talk about 
maybe six films as neo-realist cinema <pause dur="0.3"/> but there's a huge output of cinema a lot of it very popular <pause dur="0.3"/> # comic <pause dur="0.2"/> melodramatic whatever <pause dur="0.3"/> behind the kind of <pause dur="0.4"/> what has become recognized as the canon <pause dur="0.3"/> of Italian neo-realist cinema <pause dur="1.0"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> # particularly important moment <pause dur="0.3"/> was the casting of Silva Mangano who Silvana Mangano who became a <pause dur="0.3"/> a very big star later <pause dur="0.3"/> this is her <trunc>ro</trunc> her <pause dur="0.2"/> you know very famous still <pause dur="0.3"/> from # Bitter Rice which we'll be seeing in three weeks' time whatever it is <pause dur="0.5"/> and # of course the # <pause dur="0.9"/> i don't really need to point out to you the most obvious <pause dur="0.4"/> # feature <pause dur="0.3"/> of this picture but i mean the whole exploitation of sexuality <pause dur="0.3"/> within # neo-realism is also very important <pause dur="0.2"/> and particularly the whole <pause dur="0.2"/> celebration <pause dur="0.3"/> of # sort of beauty she she she like many of the stars <pause dur="0.3"/> of the late forties is an ex-beauty queen <pause dur="0.3"/> and that whole exploitation of the beauty queen the Miss Italia <pause dur="0.4"/> was very important and again is actually part of <pause dur="0.3"/> the neo-realist phenomenon it shouldn't just be thought of as 
something <pause dur="0.2"/> imposed on neo-realism or <pause dur="0.4"/> # something that neo-realism did just to get people into the <pause dur="0.2"/> cinema though no doubt it helped <pause dur="1.2"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> # and this is the poster for a film we're not going to see <trunc>mir</trunc> Miracle in Milan and what's interesting about Miracle in Milan which is <trunc>a</trunc> in on video in the library <pause dur="0.5"/> # is that it's a film <pause dur="0.9"/> which is actually involves fantasy <pause dur="0.4"/> so it's one of the clearest examples of a film that <pause dur="0.2"/> stylistically is absolutely clearly <pause dur="0.2"/> a neo-realist film <pause dur="0.3"/> and yet nonetheless involves the <pause dur="0.3"/> angel on the top of Milan cathedral coming to life and <pause dur="0.2"/> helping poor people to solve out their problems <pause dur="0.2"/> in other words something <pause dur="0.2"/> completely <pause dur="0.2"/> # fantastical at the same time <pause dur="0.3"/> so it's often seen as a <pause dur="0.2"/> a very interesting turning point <pause dur="0.3"/> and again we'll be talking about this whole question of <pause dur="0.6"/> when and why did neo-realism <pause dur="0.3"/> decline <pause dur="0.2"/> # later in the course <pause dur="0.8"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> and finally as a preview this is in fact from <pause dur="0.3"/> La Strada <pause dur="0.3"/> which is # one of the # films that we'll be seeing <pause dur="0.3"/> one of the <trunc>f</trunc> it's the

# which was actually <pause dur="0.2"/> # had some success has been on television <pause dur="0.3"/> made about four or five years ago <pause dur="0.3"/> very clearly still within <pause dur="0.3"/> the neo-realist tradition even though it's only about five years old <pause dur="0.3"/> so you can make a whole argument about <pause dur="0.3"/> is it a particular period <pause dur="0.3"/> is it something that runs through all Italian cinema <pause dur="0.4"/> or what <pause dur="0.2"/> but we're going to take <pause dur="0.3"/> start from <pause dur="0.3"/> the conventional <pause dur="0.2"/> <trunc>w</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> wisdom <pause dur="0.3"/> which is that it's essentially a a quality of <pause dur="0.3"/> a certain kind of output <pause dur="0.2"/> in Italian cinema <pause dur="0.3"/> between nineteen-forty-four and nineteen-fifty-five we'll start with that <pause dur="0.3"/> and sort of complicate it a bit <pause dur="0.3"/> as we go along in the next three or four weeks <pause dur="1.5"/><vocal desc="cough" iterated="n"/> now what i've done here <pause dur="0.4"/> is just tried to convey to you <pause dur="0.3"/> some of the <pause dur="0.5"/> qualities of # of neo-realist cinema that are regularly referred to that is including this sort of # <pause dur="0.2"/> incredibly <pause dur="0.3"/> passionate dramatic music and this is i think actually Paisà <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> but i mean that's that that that is that is a very neo-realist sound <pause dur="0.3"/> # in a way that some of the other things you've 
heard <pause dur="0.2"/> # are much less obviously so <pause dur="0.2"/> i'll come back to that question in a moment <pause dur="0.5"/> so what i want to do is just describe to you some of the things that most people would agree <pause dur="0.2"/> are true about <pause dur="0.2"/> neo-realist films <pause dur="0.3"/> # and as i say once again we'll be complicating this <trunc>im</trunc> picture <pause dur="0.2"/> as the term goes on but for the moment <pause dur="0.3"/> let's just take this and it's <trunc>u</trunc> it's <trunc>ex</trunc> <trunc>ten</trunc> it's <pause dur="0.2"/> assumed to be <pause dur="0.2"/> a kind of filmmaking characterized by <pause dur="0.2"/> the following <pause dur="0.3"/> first of all <trunc>locate</trunc> location shooting <pause dur="0.5"/> now we of course are so used to location shooting <pause dur="0.3"/> that we might think it's almost not worth mentioning <pause dur="0.3"/> but you have to remember that in Hollywood in this period but also certainly <pause dur="0.3"/> in Italian cinema <pause dur="0.2"/> throughout the thirties and forties in fact well into the sixties <pause dur="0.4"/> the norm was to shoot in the studio <pause dur="0.3"/> the studio you shot in the studio because you could control everything in the studio <pause dur="0.3"/> you could <pause dur="0.2"/> the get the sound <pause dur="0.2"/> synchronization right <pause dur="0.2"/> you could get the lighting perfect <pause dur="0.2"/> you could take 
and retake <pause dur="0.2"/> if you hadn't got problems that it might rain or <pause dur="0.3"/> kids suddenly run across the back or a dog <pause dur="0.2"/> whatever <pause dur="0.4"/> so <pause dur="0.3"/> the the norm <pause dur="0.3"/> in filmmaking <pause dur="0.3"/> up until <pause dur="0.4"/> # really the seventies <pause dur="0.2"/> was to shoot in the studio <pause dur="0.4"/> so in the forties <pause dur="0.3"/> to actually shoot on location <pause dur="0.3"/> # was extremely impactful and in fact <pause dur="0.3"/> neo-realism had an <trunc>incre</trunc> extraordinary impact on world cinema generally <pause dur="0.3"/> and often the impact is <pause dur="0.3"/> the idea that you might go into the streets to make a film <pause dur="0.5"/> of course documentarists had done it <pause dur="0.3"/> but feature filmmakers very very rarely had ever done that <pause dur="0.2"/> actually made a story film <pause dur="1.1"/> conventional feature length <pause dur="0.4"/> in the streets or in the <trunc>c</trunc> in the countryside <pause dur="0.3"/> so the location shooting was a kind of extraordinarily <pause dur="0.2"/> important <pause dur="0.2"/> # impact and act <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.8"/> which was important <pause dur="0.4"/> because it was unusual and because in many ways it felt like <pause dur="0.4"/> a rejection <pause dur="0.3"/> of fascist cinema it felt like a rejection <pause dur="0.3"/> of the cinema that had gone before <pause dur="0.3"/> so it's not just that it was <pause dur="0.2"/> an innovation <pause dur="0.3"/> but that in some ways it 
actually felt <pause dur="0.2"/> because it was so different <pause dur="0.3"/> from what had gone before within Italy <pause dur="0.3"/> it felt like a conscious rejection of it <pause dur="0.3"/> now of course many cynics come along and say <pause dur="0.5"/> well actually the studios were actually <pause dur="0.3"/> # being used for # <pause dur="0.3"/> prisoners of war or people who had <trunc>boos</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> been bombed out of their you couldn't use the actually you couldn't use the studios <pause dur="0.4"/> # they had to shoot on if they wanted to make a film at all <pause dur="0.3"/> they had to do it on location which is in fact true <pause dur="0.3"/> but the significance in a way is what they did with that fact <pause dur="0.3"/> the fact that they actually saw <pause dur="0.3"/> as it were it's the kind of you know necessity is the mother of invention <pause dur="0.2"/> because in a way <pause dur="0.2"/> they had to shoot on the streets <pause dur="0.2"/> they had to shoot on location <pause dur="0.3"/> they actually then <pause dur="0.4"/> made that the foundation of an aesthetic <pause dur="0.2"/> and saw <pause dur="0.3"/> what was significant about it <pause dur="0.2"/> in terms of <pause dur="0.3"/> the kinds of conventional filmmaking <pause dur="0.2"/> that people were <trunc>wa</trunc> had been watching up until that time <pause dur="1.4"/> because it's on shot on location <pause dur="0.3"/> the 
light that is used tends to be of the available light so there's no actual assisted light and you have to remember again <pause dur="0.3"/> this is before <pause dur="0.2"/> highly sensitive film stocks <pause dur="0.2"/> that could adjust themselves <pause dur="0.3"/> to the <trunc>l</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> to even quite low levels of light <pause dur="0.3"/> and indeed to high levels of light <pause dur="0.3"/> this is <trunc>ve</trunc> very crude film stock and actually <pause dur="0.3"/> Rome Open City is made up of very different kinds of film stock <pause dur="0.4"/> # so that it sort of gives to it a very raw <pause dur="0.2"/> rough quality <pause dur="0.5"/> so but nonetheless they used the light that was available in the scene <pause dur="0.2"/> or occasionally some maybe one or two at most <pause dur="0.3"/> extra lights now if you actually see <pause dur="0.2"/> shooting on location now <pause dur="0.3"/> there's a <trunc>n</trunc> whole battery of lighting effects and <pause dur="0.4"/> <trunc>boun</trunc> # things to bounce light and so on <pause dur="0.2"/> so that even on location now <pause dur="0.3"/> there's a kind of smoothing out of appearances <pause dur="0.3"/> # if you <trunc>s</trunc> if think of a film like i don't know Sense and Sensibility or something like that <pause dur="0.3"/> all the location work <pause dur="0.2"/> yes it's on location <pause dur="0.3"/> but it's all been <pause dur="0.3"/> # lit and smoothed out in the process <pause dur="0.2"/> whereas 
the point about a lot of neo-realist films is often you can't see them very well <pause dur="0.3"/> there's a sudden <pause dur="0.2"/> jump in the quality of the image <pause dur="0.3"/> you know there's there's a kind of roughness and rawness now again <pause dur="0.3"/> <trunc>y</trunc> one view is <shift feature="voice" new="laugh"/>that it's just crappy filmmaking <shift feature="voice" new="normal"/><pause dur="0.3"/> but another view is ah no  it's really alive it's really raw it's really kind of <pause dur="0.3"/> get in there and catching the reality <pause dur="0.3"/> so again it's an idea of turning that <pause dur="0.3"/> disadvantage in a way <pause dur="0.3"/> to an aesthetic purpose <pause dur="1.3"/> the third # <pause dur="0.2"/> thing is the use of non-professional actors <pause dur="0.3"/> that a lot of the <pause dur="0.2"/> main characters <pause dur="0.2"/> in these films were played by people who were not in fact actors <pause dur="0.3"/> that's true of <pause dur="0.4"/> nearly all of the characters in # <pause dur="0.3"/> Paisan <pause dur="0.2"/> it's true of the hero of <pause dur="0.2"/> # Bicycle Thieves <pause dur="0.6"/> # there was i <trunc>s</trunc> mentioned earlier and i come back to it it's not true of everybody in these films <pause dur="0.2"/> nonetheless it's # was very very common to use non-professional actors <pause dur="0.3"/> again on the idea that somehow non-professional actors <pause dur="0.2"/> would get you past the kind of glamour 
system <pause dur="0.2"/> would get you past all the <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> you know all the kind of tricks and # theatricality and actorliness <pause dur="0.3"/> of actors <pause dur="0.3"/> of course there's a certain paradox <pause dur="0.2"/> about <trunc>non-professi</trunc> using non-professional actors <pause dur="0.3"/> on the one hand they bring a kind of guarantee <pause dur="0.2"/> that they are as it were real people not actors <pause dur="0.3"/> okay we'll <pause dur="0.3"/> leave aside the fact that actors are after all real people <pause dur="0.3"/> nonetheless <pause dur="0.2"/> it brings along that sort of notion and there's a feeling of <pause dur="0.3"/> this is a guarantee <pause dur="0.3"/> of # <pause dur="0.2"/> you know we're really getting the real people now <pause dur="0.3"/> on the other hand of course most <pause dur="0.3"/> non-professional actors act dreadfully <pause dur="0.3"/> so in fact they're terribly stiff <pause dur="0.3"/> and in fact they look more like they're acting <pause dur="0.3"/> than does someone like Anna Magnani or Giulietta Masina who is # <pause dur="0.4"/> the star of La Strada <pause dur="0.2"/> so there's of course the paradox <pause dur="0.3"/> that that we <pause dur="0.2"/> because we have learned certain ways of acting <pause dur="0.3"/> as a kind of <pause dur="0.2"/> the normal way to represent how human beings are <pause dur="0.3"/> when we don't see that <pause dur="0.2"/> we're 
often conscious of the kind of awkwardness <pause dur="0.3"/> of the of the non-professional actors the stiffness the woodenness <pause dur="0.3"/> of the non-professional actors <pause dur="0.3"/> now that's of course an interesting paradox and again <pause dur="0.2"/> does one say well actually it just isn't very good or does one say <pause dur="0.3"/> yes but there's a kind of authenticity in the woodenness <pause dur="0.4"/> and i think there is a view that even that <trunc>authe</trunc> even that woodenness <pause dur="0.6"/> is nonetheless <pause dur="0.3"/> worth a price worth paying <pause dur="0.2"/> for having a sense of you've got real people <pause dur="1.5"/> # a fourth quality is the organization of the narrative in a much more <pause dur="0.2"/> elliptical episodic way than we would be used to certainly from <pause dur="0.3"/> classical Hollywood cinema <pause dur="0.3"/> a feeling that you know <pause dur="0.3"/> there is a story but it's not all that driving <pause dur="0.3"/> an awful lot of what happens hasn't got much to do with the story <pause dur="0.3"/> a lot of the time the camera <pause dur="0.2"/> just sort of # looks at something and it's not really terribly relevant to the story it's just there <pause dur="0.4"/> so that sense that it can be a bit more rambling it 
can be a series of episodes it doesn't have to be <pause dur="0.4"/> driving towards a goal according to the model of <pause dur="0.3"/> classical cinema <pause dur="0.2"/> is # said to be characteristic of <pause dur="0.3"/> # neo-realist films <pause dur="1.2"/> there tends to be <pause dur="0.3"/> a lack of close-ups it's not that there are no close-ups in Italian neo-realist cinema <pause dur="0.3"/> but there tend to be much less of them <pause dur="0.3"/> # the camera stays back <pause dur="0.3"/><vocal desc="cough" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.2"/> and the the importance of this really <pause dur="0.4"/> is that # <pause dur="0.3"/> it <pause dur="0.9"/> it emphasizes people as social performers <pause dur="0.3"/> rather than as individual <pause dur="0.3"/> # psychologies <pause dur="0.2"/> so the close-up <pause dur="0.2"/> tends to take you in on <pause dur="0.3"/> the interior thoughts of someone into the detail <pause dur="0.2"/> into the <pause dur="0.2"/> the individualization often of course celebrated in the case of stars <pause dur="0.4"/> whereas if you stayed back <pause dur="0.4"/> there was a sense at any rate the idea was <pause dur="0.3"/> that this always meant the people were seen in their context in their social context <pause dur="0.4"/> and # they were often seen interacting with other people they weren't just <pause dur="0.3"/> isolated individuals <pause dur="0.3"/> so it was a much more <pause dur="0.2"/> social <pause dur="0.3"/> concern with character <pause dur="0.2"/> # achieved partly through <pause dur="0.3"/> 
the use of medium and long shots or the <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> the the privileging of them <pause dur="1.2"/> and finally very often say finally for this first little group <pause dur="0.3"/> which is quite formal <pause dur="0.4"/> # <vocal desc="cough" iterated="n"/> the <trunc>charact</trunc> the camera will often <pause dur="0.7"/> hang in a scene will just kind of <trunc>l</trunc> just let the thing <trunc>r</trunc> <pause dur="0.3"/> roll on quite after any <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> plot business has been dealt with or even before any plot business is dealt with <pause dur="0.3"/> i'll show you a bit from a moment from <pause dur="0.3"/> Umberto D which is a very famous sequence which is completely <pause dur="0.3"/> <trunc>irre</trunc> it's quite long yet it's irrelevant <pause dur="0.3"/> to the the film in a certain way <pause dur="0.3"/> and yet in it's often seen as the quintessential <pause dur="0.3"/> neo-realist moment of just <pause dur="0.4"/> staying and watching and just looking at ordinary life taking the idea that <pause dur="0.5"/> Zavattini who was one of the main theorists of neo-realists said <pause dur="0.8"/> everyday life is interesting <pause dur="0.2"/> that was kind of one of the credos of <trunc>ne</trunc> Italian neo-realism <pause dur="0.2"/> that as it were ordinary life everyday life <pause dur="0.3"/> was interesting <pause dur="1.3"/> now all the things i've listed there are formal qualities <pause dur="0.2"/> and 
they also relate to ideas of realism which i'll expand upon much more <pause dur="0.3"/> next week <pause dur="0.5"/> but it is worth signalling that nonetheless <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="1.1"/> <trunc>id</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> # neo-realism did in fact use stars <pause dur="0.3"/> # stars that who were <trunc>v</trunc> who were very well established <pause dur="0.4"/> for instance in Rome Open City the two main stars of that are <pause dur="0.2"/> Anna Magnani and Aldo Fabrizi <pause dur="0.4"/> and they were actually famous as movie stars but as comic stars <pause dur="0.3"/> and indeed as comic stars in theatre revues <pause dur="0.3"/> and one of the reasons they agreed to do Rome Open City is that it was rather good publicity <pause dur="0.3"/> for their revues that they were just putting on <pause dur="0.3"/> in Rome <pause dur="0.3"/> so you have to have <shift feature="voice" new="laugh"/>the idea <shift feature="voice" new="normal"/>that you know you are dealing here with actually <pause dur="0.2"/> really major stars <pause dur="0.4"/> although it's interesting which stars <pause dur="0.2"/> did <pause dur="0.2"/> in fact end up <pause dur="0.3"/> making # # neo-realist films and which didn't <pause dur="0.3"/> there were some who were felt to be <pause dur="0.3"/> too artificial <pause dur="0.3"/> too beautiful often <pause dur="0.3"/> # whereas the # stars who became <pause dur="0.2"/> big in neo-realism were often seemed to have more <pause dur="0.3"/> of the common touch <pause dur="0.2"/> and often were associated with 
popular theatre <pause dur="0.3"/> and popular theatre traditions not of the kind of # <pause dur="0.3"/> smart West End farce type but much more like music hall really <pause dur="0.3"/> so <pause dur="0.6"/> although they were professionals they were professionals <pause dur="0.3"/> and although they were film stars <pause dur="0.3"/> they nonetheless tended to come <pause dur="0.3"/> from the music hall vaudeville <pause dur="0.2"/> side of things <pause dur="0.2"/> more than from the <pause dur="0.2"/> high theatre <pause dur="0.3"/> or # mainstream # fascist # <pause dur="0.2"/> # cinema <pause dur="1.2"/> but the other thing that's really striking <pause dur="0.5"/><vocal desc="cough" iterated="n"/> and difficult perhaps for us to understand <pause dur="0.3"/> about something called neo-realism <pause dur="0.3"/> is that they are in fact very melodramatic <pause dur="0.4"/> and # we'll talk about that in <pause dur="0.2"/> two or three weeks' time but the <pause dur="0.5"/> the thing the first thing to <trunc>s</trunc> just one thing to signal to you now is that of course melodrama means <pause dur="0.7"/> # drama with music <pause dur="0.4"/> and melodrama <pause dur="0.3"/> is often used interchangeably <pause dur="0.3"/> in Italy with the term opera <pause dur="0.4"/> well of course in other words opera <pause dur="0.2"/> which is also of course is drama to music <pause dur="0.7"/> and it's worth <pause dur="0.3"/> knowing <pause dur="0.3"/> that Verdi who i suppose is regarded as the greatest of all opera directors opera <pause dur="0.4"/> 
composers <pause dur="0.6"/> # was thought to be a realist he's referred to as # his his work is referred to as verismo <pause dur="0.2"/> realism <pause dur="0.4"/> now i'll talk about the paradox of that <pause dur="0.3"/> # in a couple of weeks' time and try to think through what can that possibly mean <pause dur="0.2"/> opera realist how can you even say that <pause dur="0.3"/> but nonetheless <trunc>i</trunc> actually within the Italian context <pause dur="0.3"/> melodrama is much less of a kind of <pause dur="0.2"/> shock <pause dur="0.3"/> to the idea of realism <pause dur="0.2"/> than it is within an Anglo-Saxon context <pause dur="1.1"/> a final area i want to mention is much more the <pause dur="0.2"/> subject matter because the subject matter of neo-realism is also very important <pause dur="0.2"/> and in many ways i've already mentioned this everyday life <pause dur="0.2"/> ordinary people <pause dur="0.4"/> # and social problems often <pause dur="0.2"/> so first of all it's an idea simply of ordinary everyday life <pause dur="0.5"/> and # ordinary people now <pause dur="0.4"/> of course the interesting thing is well what is <pause dur="0.2"/> everyday life <pause dur="0.3"/> # and what actually <pause dur="0.2"/> you know after all <trunc>a</trunc> this is what i do every day <pause dur="0.2"/> # this <trunc>b</trunc> <trunc>b</trunc> but i wouldn't be in an Italian <trunc>ne</trunc> or even a British neo-realist film if 
there was such a thing <pause dur="0.4"/> now certain things are thought to be more everyday than other kinds of things <pause dur="0.4"/> so # <trunc>ordin</trunc> so everydayness is already <pause dur="0.2"/> often confined to <trunc>i</trunc> for instance domesticity therefore <pause dur="0.2"/> becomes very important <pause dur="0.2"/> because domesticity seems like a more common everyday experience <pause dur="0.4"/> than # more than than many kind of <pause dur="0.3"/> jobs and in the public world <pause dur="0.6"/> and the idea of ordinary people often that <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> to be middle class is in fact perfectly ordinary <pause dur="0.4"/> but <trunc>n</trunc> # although statistically <pause dur="0.5"/> now it's statistically it's the most ordinary thing to be <pause dur="0.2"/> but certainly in # <pause dur="0.2"/> the forties it was more statistically ordinary <pause dur="0.3"/> to be working class or # peasant <pause dur="0.3"/> and that actually is what is really <pause dur="0.2"/> indicated by the notion of ordinary people <pause dur="0.4"/><vocal desc="cough" iterated="n"/> or just people actually <pause dur="0.3"/> # in Italian neo-realist cinema <pause dur="0.2"/> it's the working class it's the peasantry <pause dur="1.3"/><vocal desc="cough" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.2"/> now at one level it's just that idea well you just observe what's going on <pause dur="0.4"/> now it's true that in Paisan <pause dur="0.3"/> and Rome Open City <pause dur="0.4"/> what you're also seeing is 
the war and the resistance so it's rather incredible events and things that none of us <pause dur="0.3"/> have experienced <pause dur="0.5"/><vocal desc="cough" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.3"/> i think <pause dur="0.4"/> # but # the # <pause dur="0.2"/> obviously there you have to say well they had just been fighting a war <pause dur="0.3"/> so <pause dur="0.4"/> yes it's remarkable but it's a remarkable <pause dur="0.3"/> it's the impact of very remarkable events <pause dur="0.2"/> upon nonetheless <pause dur="0.3"/> the actually rather <trunc>a</trunc> <trunc>m</trunc> mundane ordinary lives <pause dur="0.3"/> of Italian people <pause dur="0.9"/> but that sense that really yes it was enough just to see ordinary life in a way <pause dur="0.2"/> did was not maintained and # <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> very often it needed to come down to something that <pause dur="0.2"/> could be thought of as a social problem <pause dur="0.4"/> so increasingly it became the problem of poverty <pause dur="0.3"/> the problem of unemployment <pause dur="0.2"/> the problem of prostitution <pause dur="0.3"/> the problem of the black market <pause dur="0.2"/> so that although <pause dur="0.4"/> there was a notion that oh it's just anything that happens is just ordinary life is interesting <pause dur="0.3"/> when it comes down to it it often means social problems <pause dur="0.3"/> that because they at least they have a kind of dramatic <pause dur="0.3"/> # hold <pause dur="0.3"/> which perhaps just 
seeing someone <pause dur="0.3"/> doing the cooking and waiting for their husband to come home and whatever <pause dur="0.3"/> would would <trunc>d</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> in fact didn't really have <pause dur="0.9"/> but also very important # is the notion of Italian identity <pause dur="0.4"/> that a lot of these films either explicitly as in Paisan or implicitly <pause dur="0.3"/> in many of them <pause dur="0.3"/> are actually about what does it mean to be an Italian <pause dur="0.4"/> and that that was of course a question of particular <pause dur="0.3"/> sensitivity <pause dur="0.3"/> when these films were made <pause dur="0.3"/> because of course only <trunc>un</trunc> until <pause dur="0.4"/> # the end of the war <pause dur="0.3"/> <trunc>it</trunc> Italy had been a fascist country <pause dur="0.4"/> and fascism had all been about <pause dur="0.2"/> the greatness of Italy <pause dur="0.2"/> it had been a great appeal to Italianness <pause dur="0.2"/> the rhetoric of fascism is all about <pause dur="0.3"/> national identity <pause dur="0.3"/> so after the war when everyone had this revulsion <pause dur="0.3"/> or everyone but i mean everyone claimed <shift feature="voice" new="laugh"/>to have a <shift feature="voice" new="normal"/> revulsion <pause dur="0.3"/> against fascism <pause dur="0.4"/> # the # the question came well <pause dur="0.3"/> but if <pause dur="0.3"/> that's not if if i don't remember it was thirty years we had # sorry <pause dur="0.2"/> twenty years <pause dur="0.2"/> much longer than in # <pause dur="0.3"/> Germany <pause dur="0.2"/> that fascism was in Italy <pause dur="0.3"/> so <pause dur="0.3"/> you 
know if that if all of that Italianness of fascism isn't us <pause dur="0.3"/> what is it <pause dur="0.3"/> to be an Italian <pause dur="0.2"/> and a lot of the films are actually about the problem <pause dur="0.3"/> of Italian identity <pause dur="0.5"/> now that problem <pause dur="0.2"/> is exacerbated by something that's always been a problem <pause dur="0.3"/> about Italian identity <pause dur="0.3"/> and that is that Italy is in fact a very regional culture <pause dur="0.4"/> so that # regionality's often much <pause dur="0.5"/> more important to people <pause dur="0.4"/> # people tend to say i'm a Roman <pause dur="0.3"/> i'm a Milanese i'm Sicilian or whatever <pause dur="0.2"/> much more than they say <pause dur="0.2"/> i'm Italian <pause dur="0.4"/> so that # # regional identity <pause dur="0.3"/> is actually a problem and of course <pause dur="0.3"/> Italy has only really been a nation <pause dur="0.3"/> in any modern sense since eighteen-sixty <pause dur="0.3"/> when the <trunc>resorg</trunc> in what's called the Resorgimento <pause dur="0.2"/> happened which was the unification of Italy <pause dur="0.4"/> so the sense of # <pause dur="0.4"/> having been a country a long time which is so <pause dur="0.3"/> pervasive in British <pause dur="0.3"/> # sensibility <pause dur="0.2"/> is actually not true and was even less true <pause dur="0.2"/> in the forties <pause dur="0.2"/> where it was less than a hundred years that Italy <pause dur="0.2"/> had been a nation <pause dur="0.5"/> 
so the question of Italian identity is partly very urgent <pause dur="0.3"/> because you want to have a sense of who you are <pause dur="0.3"/> in the context of not <pause dur="0.2"/> being fascist <pause dur="0.4"/> but on the other hand who are you as an Italian <pause dur="0.4"/> if really what you are is Sicilian or Neopolitan or <pause dur="0.3"/> whatever particular <pause dur="0.2"/> # regional identity is concerned <pause dur="0.3"/> and that's very much # <pause dur="0.2"/> the theme <pause dur="0.2"/> of a lot of the films and it's very marked <pause dur="0.3"/> in Paisan <pause dur="0.3"/> where you actually see which is actually a a trip through Italy <pause dur="1.3"/> okay <pause dur="0.4"/> now i just want to show you then very briefly <pause dur="0.3"/><event desc="looks for video tapes" iterated="y" dur="33"/> the extract from # Umberto D that i mentioned <pause dur="0.6"/> # just to show you <pause dur="0.6"/> the example <pause dur="0.9"/> oh <pause dur="1.6"/> where's <pause dur="1.3"/> did i fail to bring the <pause dur="0.2"/> the videos <pause dur="3.2"/> oh well i'll show it to you next week as an example of realism <pause dur="0.4"/> sorry about that i <pause dur="0.2"/> i hope i haven't lost them along the way <pause dur="0.4"/> # i'll just go straight on to the next # <pause dur="0.4"/> next topic <pause dur="0.2"/> i can't see them nobody can see two videos one <pause dur="0.8"/> just in an ordinary <pause dur="0.7"/> recording cover <pause dur="0.2"/> no <pause dur="0.4"/> sorry <pause dur="0.6"/> okay <pause dur="0.4"/><vocal desc="cough" iterated="n"/><pause dur="1.0"/> so let me then turn to saying something about Paisan <pause dur="0.4"/> and about Rome <pause dur="0.7"/> 
saying first of all something about Paisan <pause dur="0.3"/> the film that we're just about to see <pause dur="1.4"/> first of all the title <pause dur="1.3"/> it's a very ambiguous title it's not a conventional <pause dur="1.1"/> Italian word <pause dur="0.3"/> it's a way of saying <pause dur="0.3"/> <distinct lang="it">paisà</distinct> <pause dur="0.8"/> or <distinct lang="it">paese</distinct> <pause dur="1.0"/> and # it's got a double meaning on the on the one hand <pause dur="0.4"/> to say <distinct lang="it">paisà</distinct> <pause dur="0.8"/> might well be how a peasant <pause dur="0.2"/> would talk about <pause dur="0.3"/> his or her <pause dur="0.3"/> village or his or her land <pause dur="0.3"/> it # <trunc>p</trunc> <distinct lang="it">paese</distinct> is a <pause dur="0.2"/> very fascinating word 'cause it means both village and land <pause dur="0.4"/> # so it's a way it's a could be a very <pause dur="0.4"/> intimate and # <pause dur="0.3"/> felt and located way of talking about where you live where you are <pause dur="0.4"/> so on the one hand it has a very <trunc>mu</trunc> it's very much about <pause dur="0.4"/> being Italian and being rooted in a particular place <pause dur="0.6"/> my place my <distinct lang="it">paisà</distinct> <pause dur="0.5"/> on the other hand it's also the term <pause dur="0.4"/> that the Allies used # particularly the Americans used <pause dur="0.3"/> to call <pause dur="0.3"/> the Italians that they met <pause dur="0.2"/> in that context it really means peasant <pause dur="0.4"/> it was actually rather derogatory and say oh you're a <pause dur="0.3"/> you know you're sort of backward <pause dur="0.3"/> # you're a sort of <trunc>s</trunc> you know you're 
<trunc>un</trunc> uncivilized undeveloped <pause dur="0.2"/> it's actually <trunc>ra</trunc> it was rather a contemptuous term <pause dur="0.3"/> that was used by the Allies particularly Americans <pause dur="0.3"/> to describe <pause dur="0.4"/> the # people they met <pause dur="0.3"/> so it's a very very ambiguous <pause dur="0.4"/> <trunc>n</trunc> term <pause dur="0.4"/> and as you'll see the whole film actually <pause dur="0.6"/> is exactly <pause dur="0.4"/> plays upon that question of <pause dur="0.3"/> what it means <pause dur="0.2"/> to be an Italian for an Italian <pause dur="0.3"/> and how the Italians are perceived <pause dur="0.3"/> by the liberating forces <pause dur="1.0"/> the other thing to say by way of introduction before talking about what we're going to talk about tomorrow <pause dur="1.0"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> is just to remind you you should know this from your reading by now <pause dur="0.3"/> # about the situation # in which this film would have been made <pause dur="0.6"/> Mussolini the fascist leader had been in power since the twenties <pause dur="0.4"/> # had # fled <pause dur="0.3"/> # # by the # nineteen-forty-four <pause dur="0.4"/> # and was eventually executed <pause dur="0.3"/> but <pause dur="0.5"/> Italy was then occupied <pause dur="0.2"/> by the Nazis who were of course the allies of the Italians <pause dur="0.3"/> during the Second World War <pause dur="0.4"/> so at the start of this film and also at the start of Rome Open City <pause dur="0.5"/> Italy <pause dur="0.3"/> is # <pause dur="0.5"/> 
occupied by <pause dur="0.3"/> the Nazis which of course is has a very different feeling from the French <pause dur="0.3"/> who were also <shift feature="voice" new="laugh"/>occupied by the Nazis <shift feature="voice" new="normal"/> at the same <pause dur="0.4"/> period <pause dur="0.3"/> but there they were very much <trunc>c</trunc> a conquered <pause dur="0.3"/> nation <pause dur="0.4"/> whereas of course there was the <trunc>ma</trunc> that there had been a history of an alliance <pause dur="0.2"/> between Germans and Italians <pause dur="0.3"/> so there's a # # # it's quite a complicated <pause dur="0.3"/> <trunc>s</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> it's quite complicated to sort of work out the sense of what it meant <pause dur="0.3"/> to be occupied <pause dur="0.3"/> by a # <pause dur="0.4"/> # by a nation <pause dur="0.2"/> who was nonetheless <pause dur="0.3"/> a # had been an ally of yours <pause dur="0.9"/> in addition to that it's worth remembering that <pause dur="0.2"/> Italy <pause dur="0.6"/> has a huge history of being occupied and had been occupied by <pause dur="0.4"/> Austria <pause dur="0.3"/> for <pause dur="0.2"/> # <trunc>a</trunc> <trunc>a</trunc> about a century <pause dur="0.4"/> now # Austria is not Germany we all <shift feature="voice" new="laugh"/>know that <shift feature="voice" new="normal"/><pause dur="0.3"/> but <pause dur="0.2"/> probably if you hear an a German voice <pause dur="0.3"/> it doesn't really matter to you too much if it's Austria or Germany <pause dur="0.2"/> it's all part of a sort of sense of <pause dur="0.2"/> an occupying force so it's an occupying force <pause dur="0.3"/> who in a sense were invited in <pause dur="0.3"/> so it's a very odd <pause dur="0.2"/> # situation <pause dur="0.5"/> and then the allies <pause dur="0.5"/> 
particularly <trunc>br</trunc> the <trunc>bri</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> British and # Americans <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> liberated <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> <trunc>i</trunc> Italy <pause dur="0.2"/> starting # in Sicily <pause dur="0.2"/> and moving up the continent <pause dur="0.2"/> and # you'll see that <pause dur="0.3"/> in # that's what Paisan's all about <pause dur="1.2"/> now Paisan can be seen as a film <pause dur="0.3"/> that's essentially about the discovery <pause dur="0.2"/> of Italy <pause dur="0.3"/> after fascism well that's one of one of its themes <pause dur="0.3"/> and that's what i <trunc>w</trunc> particularly want us to focus on <pause dur="0.3"/> the way in which <pause dur="0.2"/> ideas of what it means to be an Italian <pause dur="0.3"/> are # <pause dur="0.3"/> focused on and developed through the structure indeed of a <pause dur="0.2"/> what is essentially a trip through <pause dur="0.2"/> six <pause dur="0.2"/> # <trunc>z</trunc> areas of Italy starting in Sicily <pause dur="0.9"/> and one of the ways in which this sense of discovering Italy after fascism <pause dur="0.4"/> # the the the <trunc>wh</trunc> what is Italy if it's not <pause dur="0.2"/> that Italian rhetoric that rhetoric of Italy <pause dur="0.3"/> under Mussolini <pause dur="0.3"/> one of the ways in which it's done is actually in the way the <trunc>ha</trunc> the narrative structure is handled <pause dur="0.3"/> so very often the stories that are told <pause dur="0.3"/> in each of these episodes <pause dur="0.3"/> are actually about <pause dur="0.2"/> the discovery of a hidden truth <pause dur="0.3"/> # so that <pause dur="0.2"/> # 
they're either about the <trunc>s</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> sometimes it's we that discover it <pause dur="0.3"/> sometimes the characters themselves <pause dur="0.2"/> discover the hidden truth <pause dur="0.4"/> # and that that that structure is is already very <pause dur="0.3"/> interesting as a way of realizing at the level of <pause dur="0.3"/> narrative form <pause dur="0.3"/> this basic concern with finding <pause dur="0.2"/> the real Italy <pause dur="0.2"/> that people felt had been hidden <pause dur="0.3"/> by # the # lies of fascism <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.9"/> the one exception to that <pause dur="0.3"/> # is the monastery sequence <pause dur="0.2"/> and that's very much seen as <pause dur="0.3"/> an enclave that actually almost <pause dur="0.2"/> # separate <pause dur="0.2"/> from <pause dur="0.3"/> # Italy generally <pause dur="0.2"/> and so that sense of a # <pause dur="0.4"/> this little <pause dur="0.3"/> enclave that's hidden away <pause dur="0.2"/> is although it's not in the narrative structure it's not about discovery <pause dur="0.3"/> nonetheless the overall <pause dur="0.3"/> # <trunc>struc</trunc> the overall sense of that is that it itself <pause dur="0.3"/> is a hidden part of Italy <pause dur="0.5"/> it's the most controversial part <pause dur="0.3"/> of the film really you either think it's nonsense <pause dur="0.3"/> or that it's really very moving <pause dur="0.4"/> and its ambivalence is <pause dur="0.2"/> actually because it's directed by Rossellini who was a Catholic <pause dur="0.4"/> and scripted by Fellini who was a 
bit more <pause dur="0.2"/> ambivalent <pause dur="0.6"/> anyway <pause dur="0.3"/> # we can talk about that <unclear>#</unclear> <pause dur="0.2"/> tomorrow possibly <pause dur="1.0"/> now <pause dur="0.2"/> so we've got this idea of the true Italy and the discovery of the true Italy now what i want us to talk about tomorrow and what we'll do tomorrow in the seminars is look at the Naples sequence in detail <pause dur="0.7"/><vocal desc="cough" iterated="n"/>  but # the in the essays i've asked you to look at other <pause dur="0.3"/> ones well it's it's a possible essay <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> what's interesting to think about is how exactly is this Italian<pause dur="0.3"/>ness constructed <pause dur="0.6"/> 'cause first there's the question about well who discovered Italy <pause dur="0.3"/> is this Italians <pause dur="0.2"/> discovering their own <pause dur="0.2"/> culture <pause dur="0.2"/> or is it # <pause dur="0.3"/> the G-Is the <trunc>am</trunc> the <trunc>amer</trunc> the liberating forces finding it <pause dur="0.2"/> or is it in some sense we the audience <pause dur="0.3"/> who have the <pause dur="0.3"/> the the the recognition <pause dur="0.2"/> of true Italianness that's signalled to us as something <pause dur="0.2"/> we can understand <pause dur="0.8"/> but equally important is who as # who as it were <pause dur="0.2"/> represents Italy and one might literally say quite literally who embodies <pause dur="0.3"/> Italy <pause dur="0.2"/> there's a sense in which different each <pause dur="0.2"/> episode <pause dur="0.3"/> # chooses a central 
character <pause dur="0.3"/> who in themselves <pause dur="0.2"/> represents something way in the and the way they look and everything about them <pause dur="0.2"/> suggests a particular <pause dur="0.3"/> regional identity a regional Italianness if you like <pause dur="0.4"/> and it's worth thinking about well why is it people of this class <pause dur="0.3"/> # this age <pause dur="0.2"/> # this gender what you know what does it tell us that these are the people <pause dur="0.3"/> who are selected to represent the real Italianness <pause dur="0.4"/> but also think about what they actually look like <pause dur="0.4"/> # you know in other words in the Naples episode which we'll talk about tomorrow <pause dur="0.3"/> you know why choose a little boy <pause dur="0.4"/> why choose a why choose a young <pause dur="0.2"/> why choose a boy <pause dur="0.2"/><kinesic desc="waves arms and shakes body" iterated="y" dur="2"/> why choose a boy that's all like this and moving all over the place like that <pause dur="0.3"/> you know what's that about <pause dur="0.3"/> as a <trunc>percept</trunc> as an embodiment <pause dur="0.3"/> of the Neopolitan <pause dur="1.0"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> but also it's important to think about how they're introduced into the narrative <pause dur="0.3"/> <trunc>t</trunc> are they very clearly seen as <pause dur="0.2"/> this is the star this is the person this is about <pause dur="0.4"/> or are they seen as emerging from the crowd <pause dur="0.4"/> # who they're 
just one of many we could have looked at this one this one <trunc>th</trunc> what we're actually going to look at this one but it could have been any <pause dur="0.5"/> or are they very much a kind of object of enquiry are they <pause dur="0.2"/> actually although they're the main character are they really <pause dur="0.3"/> the object of a an enquiry <pause dur="0.3"/> of some other character <pause dur="0.9"/> and finally what does Italy look like the actual Italy the actual land <pause dur="0.4"/> and here there's the notion of <distinct lang="it">paesaggio</distinct> <pause dur="0.3"/> which means the idea as it was spirit of place <pause dur="0.3"/> the idea that a particular landscape or cityscape <pause dur="0.6"/> itself embodies certain <pause dur="0.3"/> qualities <pause dur="0.3"/> # which are moral aesthetic <pause dur="0.5"/> almost # psychological or felt qualities <pause dur="0.3"/> # which # are make it distinctive to a particular area <pause dur="0.5"/> and again it's worth just thinking about <pause dur="0.3"/> well <pause dur="0.2"/> what does each location <pause dur="0.2"/> look like <pause dur="0.3"/> what <pause dur="0.2"/> <trunc>w</trunc> # what what are the actual characteristics of the various locations <pause dur="0.3"/> # that that we see <pause dur="0.5"/> and are <pause dur="0.2"/> characters actually <pause dur="0.4"/> integrated into their location are they seen as very much emerging <pause dur="0.2"/> into their location or are they <pause dur="0.3"/> 
are they seen as part of it or are they seen as <pause dur="0.3"/> set set against it in some way <pause dur="0.7"/> and it's important to think of ideas of the natural <pause dur="0.2"/> the eternal the uncivilized <pause dur="0.4"/> that after when you start looking for <pause dur="0.3"/> the real something <pause dur="0.3"/> that <trunc>of</trunc> that often draws you into thinking in terms of <pause dur="0.3"/> the natural <pause dur="0.3"/> the # the the eternal the uncivilized <pause dur="0.4"/> and it's important to think about <pause dur="0.3"/> how those are suggested <pause dur="1.8"/> finally i just want to say something very briefly about Rome because # it's <trunc>m</trunc> i'll repeat this next week but i want you to i want to say it before you see <pause dur="0.5"/> Rome Open City <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="1.4"/> there's an episode in Rome in Paisan <pause dur="0.3"/> Bicycle Thieves is also set in Rome <pause dur="0.4"/> and the whole question about what Rome means <pause dur="0.3"/> # is another possible short essay topic <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> Rome is of course the capital <pause dur="0.2"/> of Italy and was then <pause dur="0.2"/> on the other hand <pause dur="0.3"/> it's also seen as a <trunc>r</trunc> as regional <pause dur="0.3"/> it's not actually seen # culturally <pause dur="0.3"/> as necessarily the centre of things even if it's got most money and the most monuments and so on <pause dur="0.3"/> nonetheless <pause dur="0.3"/> 
# it's still seen as a region and people say oh right that he's that's very Roman <pause dur="0.2"/> that accent that <trunc>mat</trunc> that attitude is very Roman <pause dur="0.3"/> so there's a very strong sense of it as a <pause dur="0.3"/> as a regional identity <pause dur="0.2"/> even though it's the capital <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="1.0"/> and it's worth thinking about what Rome means on the one hand of course you've got the Rome <pause dur="0.2"/> the famous Rome <pause dur="0.3"/> the Rome of the monuments the Rome that <pause dur="0.2"/> everybody probably has some sense of <pause dur="0.2"/> even if they've never been there <pause dur="0.3"/> and there are probably two important aspects of that <pause dur="0.3"/> one is ancient Rome or classical Rome the Rome of the <pause dur="0.2"/> ancient Roman Empire <pause dur="0.4"/> # and you in Paisan for instance you see the G-Is <pause dur="0.2"/> outside the Colosseum at one point <pause dur="0.2"/> it's a such a famous monument <pause dur="0.4"/> i imagine a lot of people recognize it <pause dur="0.3"/> so <pause dur="0.2"/> there's that there's those monuments of of Roman antiquity <pause dur="0.7"/> but of course Rome is also <pause dur="0.4"/> # the seat of the Catholic Church <pause dur="0.3"/> so it's also very important as a Christian city <pause dur="0.3"/> and the last shot of Rome Open City <pause dur="0.3"/> is in fact a shot of St Peter's <pause dur="0.3"/> 
the # you know which is like the most important Catholic church in the world <pause dur="0.5"/> # so # the <trunc>s</trunc> that's an equally important aspect of Rome <pause dur="0.3"/> so it's a Rome that's <pause dur="0.2"/> of of monuments both to <pause dur="0.4"/> ancient antiquity and to <trunc>christi</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> Christianity <pause dur="0.3"/> there are other things like <pause dur="0.5"/> # <trunc>i</trunc> within the <trunc>his</trunc> like Renaissance and so on which are important <pause dur="0.3"/> but i think much more difficult for us to pick up i think those two <pause dur="0.3"/> are not too difficult for us <pause dur="0.6"/> now the interesting thing to think about in terms of neo-realism is <pause dur="0.4"/> do we get a kind of tourist view of that <pause dur="0.3"/> do we get a a celebration of that do we get <pause dur="0.4"/> the kind of perhaps the official <pause dur="0.3"/> heritage industry <pause dur="0.2"/> to <pause dur="0.2"/> use a <pause dur="0.3"/> anachronistic term <pause dur="0.2"/> view of that <pause dur="0.4"/> or on the contrary <pause dur="0.2"/> is the Rome of the monuments nonetheless <pause dur="0.3"/> very much part of the texture of ordinary life <pause dur="0.3"/> what has the Rome of the monuments got to do <pause dur="0.3"/> with this function of showing ordinary <pause dur="0.4"/> people in everyday lives <pause dur="0.3"/> # do is it a tourist view that's irrelevant <pause dur="0.3"/> is it a <trunc>pa</trunc> part of an official view <pause dur="0.3"/> or is it <trunc>s</trunc> is it indeed 
integrated into the lives <pause dur="0.8"/> but equally important of course Rome is a working city <pause dur="0.4"/> and Rome is also a living city <pause dur="0.3"/> there's both the question of people actually working for a living and to what extent <pause dur="0.3"/> that is emphasized <pause dur="0.4"/> and the fact that people actually live there <pause dur="0.4"/> and what do we see of their lives <trunc>d</trunc> is what we see of their lives essentially domesticity <pause dur="0.8"/> is it more a sense of neighbourhood <pause dur="0.6"/> how important is leisure activity for instance as part of the sense of what Rome is <pause dur="1.0"/> and the last thing to mention is that this of course is Rome <pause dur="0.3"/> after a terrible defeat <pause dur="0.2"/> in the Second World War <pause dur="0.3"/> a Rome of ruins not of the sort of grandiose Colosseum type of ruins <pause dur="0.3"/> but of modern buildings in ruins <pause dur="0.4"/> to what extent does one see <pause dur="0.4"/> the the the the impact of <pause dur="0.3"/> fascism and particularly of the Second World War <pause dur="0.2"/> within the Rome <pause dur="0.3"/> that we see in these <pause dur="0.3"/> two and two-and-a-<pause dur="0.3"/>fifth <pause dur="0.3"/> films <pause dur="1.0"/> okay <pause dur="0.2"/> so i just wanted to mention those <pause dur="0.2"/> things as things to kind of have in your mind <pause dur="0.3"/> when watching the the films and they're all they are in fact of course relevant to the short essays <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> we'll watch Paisà now and tomorrow as i say what we'll do <pause dur="0.2"/> is look at the <pause dur="0.2"/> # Naples sequence # in detail in the seminars <pause dur="0.3"/> okay let's we'll take a five minute break <pause dur="0.4"/> before the film <pause dur="0.2"/> thank you
