<u who="nf0058"> is <pause dur="0.2"/> on <pause dur="0.2"/> allegory <pause dur="0.6"/> not just <pause dur="0.4"/> allegory in The Faerie Queene <pause dur="0.3"/> but <pause dur="0.3"/> allegory <pause dur="0.3"/> and symbolism in general and one of the things i'm <pause dur="0.4"/> trying <pause dur="0.5"/> to get you to see <pause dur="0.7"/> is <pause dur="0.4"/> that allegory in The Faerie Queene <pause dur="0.3"/> isn't just a sort of <pause dur="0.6"/> special thing <pause dur="0.3"/> that only creatures from the planet <pause dur="0.4"/> Zog and <pause dur="0.3"/> specialists in <pause dur="0.3"/> Reformation theology <pause dur="0.3"/> know about we don't just descend from on high and say <pause dur="0.3"/> oh by the way <pause dur="0.2"/> this bit means this thing <pause dur="0.2"/> and that bit means that thing and this thing over there means the other thing <pause dur="0.6"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> you know this specific bit in the Bible or this specific historical event <pause dur="0.4"/> is what's being alluded to here <pause dur="0.4"/> i mean <pause dur="0.2"/> these are definitely things that you need to know <pause dur="0.3"/> if you don't <pause dur="0.2"/> know about them <pause dur="0.3"/> then we need to point your noses in these directions <pause dur="1.0"/> so that you can find out <pause dur="0.9"/> but <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> when we tell you <pause dur="0.4"/> all these useful pieces of <pause dur="0.9"/> background information <pause dur="1.8"/> what we like to feel we're doing <pause dur="1.0"/> is <pause dur="0.2"/> clearing away <pause dur="0.3"/> a barrier of <pause dur="0.3"/> ignorance <pause dur="1.0"/> that lay between you and the text or perhaps not actual <pause dur="0.3"/> ignorance of <pause dur="0.3"/> events <pause dur="0.3"/> but <pause dur="0.2"/> 
unawareness that those particular events that you did know about <pause dur="0.3"/> like for example <pause dur="0.4"/> the <pause dur="0.4"/> changing <pause dur="0.2"/> religion of England between Roman Catholicism and Protestantism and back again and then back the other way <pause dur="0.6"/> in the sixteenth century would be relevant to this passage <pause dur="0.4"/> or <pause dur="0.2"/> something like # the Spanish Armada <pause dur="0.4"/> of fifteen-eighty-eight <pause dur="0.2"/> Spain's unsuccessful attempt to <pause dur="0.3"/> invade these shores <pause dur="0.2"/> and reclaim all <pause dur="0.2"/> the lost souls for Catholicism <pause dur="1.8"/> the idea <pause dur="0.3"/> is to say oh by the way <pause dur="0.2"/> do you see how this fits here <pause dur="0.2"/> do you see how Spenser is thinking about that bit there <pause dur="1.4"/> so as i say what we're trying to do <pause dur="0.3"/> is remove <pause dur="0.2"/> a barrier <pause dur="0.3"/> of <pause dur="0.2"/> ignorance <pause dur="0.4"/> or <pause dur="0.3"/> unawareness that the things you did know <pause dur="0.2"/> were actually helpful at this point <pause dur="1.4"/> what we do not wish to do <pause dur="0.6"/> by <pause dur="0.3"/> all this saying oh yes well of course Duessa both means the whore of Babylon look at her in Revelation and she means Mary Queen of Scots the <pause dur="0.3"/> rival Catholic claimant to the throne whom <pause dur="0.5"/> Elizabeth had very <pause dur="0.3"/> # reluctantly had had to have <pause dur="0.4"/> 
beheaded <pause dur="0.5"/> <trunc>al</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> and you know it also means the Roman Catholic Church in general <pause dur="0.3"/> as opposed <pause dur="0.2"/> to the Protestant religion <pause dur="0.6"/> and you then think oh great <pause dur="0.2"/> got that <pause dur="0.2"/> that's Duessa hurray <pause dur="0.2"/> finish <pause dur="1.6"/> we don't want you to then feel <pause dur="0.2"/> that we have actually erected another <pause dur="0.2"/> wall <pause dur="0.3"/> another <pause dur="0.2"/> barrier <pause dur="0.2"/> between you and the text <pause dur="0.3"/> so that first there was a barrier <pause dur="1.0"/> between you and the text considering <pause dur="0.3"/> consisting of ignorance <pause dur="0.5"/> and then <pause dur="0.2"/> we stick up another <pause dur="0.3"/> barrier <pause dur="0.6"/> consisting of knowledge and then you think oh God yes i couldn't have worked that out for myself i'm not clever enough or i don't know enough or <pause dur="0.3"/> i'm frankly not that interested in Renaissance politics and history <pause dur="0.4"/> and then say oh right <pause dur="0.2"/> this is what i want to know <pause dur="0.2"/> this is what the lecturers have told me <pause dur="1.5"/> so this is the stuff i need to know <pause dur="0.2"/> this is the answer to the text <pause dur="0.3"/> and this is what i have to give the lecturers back in my essays <pause dur="0.3"/> and in my exams <pause dur="1.5"/> that way <pause dur="0.9"/> some very very dismal work <pause dur="0.4"/> lies <pause dur="0.6"/> and perhaps far more to the point some very very 
dismal reading experiences <pause dur="0.7"/> what we're trying to do <pause dur="0.2"/> is clear the way for you <pause dur="0.3"/> plough the road <pause dur="0.3"/> so that you can then roll up your sleeves and get back into that text and get things <pause dur="0.3"/> out of that text <pause dur="0.3"/> for <pause dur="0.2"/> yourself <pause dur="0.8"/> it's to help you <pause dur="0.2"/> with your reading <pause dur="1.1"/> so i'm going to start off <pause dur="0.3"/> by just going through a few <pause dur="0.2"/> basic <pause dur="0.2"/> reading <pause dur="0.3"/> techniques <pause dur="0.3"/> and critical terms <pause dur="0.3"/> that <pause dur="0.2"/> will crop up and that may come in useful <pause dur="0.4"/> and just to remind you <pause dur="0.3"/> that The Faerie Queene <pause dur="0.4"/> is doing something that lots and lots of poems and plays and novels and films <pause dur="0.2"/> and <pause dur="0.3"/> advertisements and political slogans and football shirts do <pause dur="0.3"/> it's just doing it <pause dur="0.2"/> rather more often and rather more vehemently <pause dur="1.6"/> so <pause dur="0.2"/> just to get you feeling <pause dur="0.3"/> that Spenser was an author <pause dur="0.6"/> like any other author <pause dur="0.4"/> and The Faerie Queene is a work like any other work <pause dur="0.3"/> i want to go through <pause dur="0.2"/> some literal terms that could be useful when you're <pause dur="0.3"/> reading this or anything else <pause dur="1.6"/> and this will gradually lead us into <pause dur="0.5"/> allegory and symbolism and special things that happen there <pause dur="0.8"/> well to start 
with <pause dur="0.7"/> most <pause dur="0.2"/> literature <pause dur="0.6"/> deals <pause dur="0.3"/> with literal <pause dur="0.2"/> description <pause dur="0.6"/> simply saying <pause dur="0.2"/> what <pause dur="0.2"/> something <pause dur="0.2"/> is like <pause dur="1.3"/> # and saying that it's like it in <pause dur="0.7"/> very literal <pause dur="0.3"/> terms you know <pause dur="0.2"/> she had long blond hair <pause dur="1.1"/> # <pause dur="1.8"/> the house was made <pause dur="0.2"/> of grey granite <pause dur="0.6"/> literal description <pause dur="1.9"/> then <pause dur="0.2"/> we start getting figurative language <pause dur="6.1"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="20"/> now figurative language <pause dur="0.3"/> is also known as imagery <pause dur="3.3"/> or figures of speech <pause dur="3.7"/> figures of <pause dur="0.2"/> speech <pause dur="3.9"/> right <pause dur="1.0"/> figures of speech <pause dur="0.5"/> now this is where you say things <pause dur="0.3"/> that <pause dur="0.4"/> are striking <pause dur="0.5"/> but are not literally <pause dur="0.3"/> true <pause dur="1.5"/> and a lot of people make a mistake of talking about imagery <pause dur="0.2"/> whenever they find anything that's particularly <pause dur="0.2"/> vivid or interesting <pause dur="0.2"/> and it really doesn't work that way <pause dur="1.9"/><event desc="wipes board" iterated="y" dur="4"/> so i'll just rub this off now <pause dur="1.5"/> and we'll start <pause dur="0.7"/> with some examples of very simple examples of figures of speech <pause dur="2.7"/> now <pause dur="0.3"/> if something is said to resemble something that it doesn't really resemble very closely <pause dur="0.6"/> that is simile <pause dur="0.4"/> like <pause dur="0.4"/> as if <pause dur="0.5"/> as it were <pause dur="0.4"/> so have i seen two swans or something like that <pause dur="0.3"/> and that's simile <pause dur="4.9"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="5"/> and 
the standard one i always quote here <pause dur="0.3"/> is <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> Robert Burns' famous line <pause dur="0.2"/> my love is like a red red rose <pause dur="0.3"/> very few people would really be attracted to a girl <pause dur="0.3"/> if <pause dur="0.2"/> she was covered with thorns green leaves and petals <pause dur="0.9"/> but we all know that what he's alluding to <pause dur="0.3"/> is <pause dur="0.2"/> her sweetness her softness and maybe you know the loveliness of her blush <pause dur="1.5"/> but she isn't really very like a rose <pause dur="0.3"/> it's a simile <pause dur="1.7"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> then <pause dur="0.9"/> we get <pause dur="0.9"/> metaphor <pause dur="3.6"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="9"/> and most other figures of speech are branches of metaphor one way or the other <pause dur="4.2"/> and metaphor <pause dur="0.4"/> is when you say something <pause dur="0.3"/> is <pause dur="0.7"/> or does <pause dur="0.2"/> something <pause dur="0.3"/> that it isn't real <pause dur="0.5"/> in real life <pause dur="0.5"/> for example <pause dur="0.5"/> # if you say <pause dur="0.2"/> my heart is on fire <pause dur="1.1"/> that's a metaphor <pause dur="0.2"/> i hope <pause dur="1.0"/> love laughs at locksmiths <pause dur="0.3"/> # that's a metaphor because of course <pause dur="0.2"/> there isn't really such a thing as love who is a person that can laugh <pause dur="0.3"/> so that's a <pause dur="0.2"/> personification of love so that comes in under the heading of metaphor <pause dur="0.9"/> my cat is a demon i don't know why i put <trunc>dow</trunc> that 
down as a <pause dur="0.4"/> metaphor you <pause dur="0.5"/> only got to look at me to see that that's true but never mind <pause dur="1.1"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> my son is a pickle <pause dur="0.9"/> well let's hope that's just a metaphor <pause dur="0.5"/> and somebody hasn't been after him <pause dur="1.1"/> right <pause dur="0.6"/> and there are many branches including personification which i've already mentioned <pause dur="0.2"/> love <pause dur="0.2"/> laughs at locksmiths <pause dur="0.2"/> the idea that if you really love somebody <pause dur="0.2"/> you can always get at her <pause dur="0.2"/> however hard her husband is trying to keep you out of the house <pause dur="1.0"/> and you know that's the sort of thing <pause dur="0.6"/> that metaphor does <pause dur="1.7"/> # now something <pause dur="0.6"/> we have here to think about <pause dur="0.3"/> is two other words <pause dur="0.4"/> and you will often find this being thrown at you <pause dur="0.5"/> by critics <pause dur="0.8"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="11"/> so we might as well get it right <pause dur="1.7"/> vehicle <pause dur="2.1"/> and tenor <pause dur="7.0"/> and i could imagine a lot of times when if you're talking about allegory in Spenser or anybody else it's useful to know these words <pause dur="0.8"/> vehicle <pause dur="0.8"/> is <pause dur="0.5"/> the thing <pause dur="0.3"/> you are given <pause dur="0.2"/> it's <pause dur="0.2"/> the image <pause dur="0.8"/> and the tenor <pause dur="0.3"/> is what <pause dur="0.3"/> it is talking <pause dur="0.3"/> about <pause dur="0.8"/> so if i say <pause dur="0.3"/> my cat <pause dur="0.2"/> is a demon <pause dur="1.4"/> 
the idea of the cat <pause dur="0.3"/> being a demon <pause dur="0.3"/> is the vehicle <pause dur="0.5"/> and the meaning <pause dur="0.3"/> the tenor <pause dur="0.4"/> is <pause dur="0.3"/> the idea that my cat has a very bad temper <pause dur="4.6"/> right <pause dur="0.8"/> so much for these words <pause dur="1.2"/> and thus <pause dur="0.3"/> in <pause dur="1.0"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> Spenser <pause dur="0.2"/> you could say for example <pause dur="0.3"/> that <pause dur="0.2"/><vocal desc="sniff" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.2"/> you know Duessa riding along in her <pause dur="0.4"/> bright red dress on her seven-headed beast <pause dur="0.3"/> is <pause dur="0.2"/> the vehicle <pause dur="0.5"/> and that Roman Catholicism <pause dur="0.5"/> or <pause dur="0.2"/> evil <pause dur="0.3"/> or <pause dur="0.2"/> doubleness or whatever else you want to say she represents at the time is the tenor <pause dur="0.2"/> that's what's really going on <pause dur="2.8"/> 
right now here are some other words coming up <pause dur="2.5"/> type and antitype <pause dur="4.4"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="15"/> now <pause dur="1.1"/> you have to remember <pause dur="0.2"/> that we're studying <pause dur="1.4"/> works written by people <pause dur="0.4"/> who believed <pause dur="0.3"/> that God himself <pause dur="1.0"/> used <pause dur="0.3"/> allegory <pause dur="2.3"/> the idea is <pause dur="0.4"/> that in the Old <pause dur="0.2"/> Testament <pause dur="0.4"/> that's the first part of the Bible <pause dur="0.2"/> the part that the Jews believe <pause dur="0.7"/> right <pause dur="1.0"/> in the Old Testament <pause dur="0.8"/> everything important that happens <pause dur="0.5"/> is not only literally true in itself <pause dur="0.8"/> but <pause dur="0.2"/> so arranged <pause dur="0.3"/> that <pause dur="0.3"/> it is <pause dur="0.5"/> a type <pause dur="0.5"/> by which they meant <pause dur="0.6"/> a foretelling <pause dur="0.5"/> an indication <pause dur="0.8"/> a symbol <pause dur="0.7"/> of something that was going to happen <pause dur="0.4"/> in <pause dur="0.3"/> the New Testament <pause dur="0.3"/> that's what starts with the Gospels <pause dur="0.2"/> Matthew Mark Luke and John <pause dur="0.3"/> and it tells the story of Jesus <pause dur="0.3"/> and of his apostles after him <pause dur="0.5"/> in the Acts of the Apostles and <pause dur="0.3"/> the various Epistles of Paul and other saints <pause dur="0.8"/> and <pause dur="0.4"/> it is this <pause dur="0.2"/> together with the Old Testament <pause dur="0.2"/> that Christians <pause dur="0.2"/> believe <pause dur="1.7"/> and <pause dur="0.9"/> one example i can give you of type <pause dur="0.4"/> and <pause dur="0.3"/> antitype <pause dur="0.6"/> it's just one thing but it shows you the way <pause dur="0.3"/> # this sort of biblical 
critical mind worked <pause dur="0.3"/> and you can also find it very useful when you're reading Milton <pause dur="1.5"/> is <pause dur="0.3"/> that when <pause dur="0.6"/> in the Old Testament it describes how <pause dur="0.2"/> Moses and his followers <pause dur="0.2"/> spent <pause dur="0.3"/> forty <pause dur="0.2"/> years <pause dur="0.7"/> in the desert <pause dur="0.2"/> after they came out of Egypt <pause dur="0.2"/> looking for <pause dur="0.2"/> the promised <pause dur="0.2"/> land <pause dur="1.3"/> right which was of course <pause dur="0.3"/> Israel and Judea <pause dur="2.5"/> the antitype <pause dur="1.1"/> to this <pause dur="0.6"/> the thing that this was a symbol of <pause dur="1.0"/> was the forty days <pause dur="0.3"/> that Jesus <pause dur="0.2"/> spent in the wilderness <pause dur="0.4"/> being tempted <pause dur="0.3"/> by the Devil <pause dur="0.5"/> before <pause dur="0.2"/> he took on <pause dur="0.2"/> his mission to save humanity <pause dur="1.1"/> so there is a type <pause dur="0.4"/> and an antitype <pause dur="0.3"/> and these are words that you'll often find thrown at you <pause dur="0.2"/> in critical books <pause dur="1.8"/> # <pause dur="4.1"/> another word <pause dur="0.3"/> # that you might find <pause dur="3.8"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="15"/> which i find enormous fun <pause dur="7.3"/> is <pause dur="0.4"/> if i can get it on <pause dur="0.4"/> yep here it comes <pause dur="0.6"/> euhemerism <pause dur="0.9"/> E-U-<pause dur="0.2"/>H-<pause dur="0.5"/>E-M-E-R-I-S-M <pause dur="0.5"/> euhemerism <pause dur="0.3"/> and you will sometimes find a critic toss he'll say oh yes this is a euhemeristic reading <pause dur="1.3"/> and this is called after the Greek critic Euhemerus <pause dur="1.0"/> # a man for whom i have enormous respect <pause dur="0.7"/> who looked <pause dur="0.5"/> at <pause dur="0.5"/> the <pause dur="0.3"/> pagan <pause dur="0.2"/> myths <pause dur="0.4"/> and legends of the gods and heroes around him <pause dur="0.9"/> 
and i don't think he was the first one to do this but <pause dur="0.4"/> he was the one to get <trunc>i</trunc> get it named after him <pause dur="0.3"/> what he did was <pause dur="0.4"/> he thought of this interpretive <pause dur="0.4"/> system <pause dur="1.8"/> which he felt was desperately needed in order to explain <pause dur="0.6"/> a curious anomaly <pause dur="0.6"/> about myths of the gods and heroes <pause dur="0.5"/> and the curious anomaly was this <pause dur="0.8"/> that we are supposed to venerate the heroes and worship the gods <pause dur="1.0"/> which might suggest a certain amount of respect <pause dur="0.4"/> and yet their behaviour <pause dur="0.3"/> is very often deeply <pause dur="0.2"/> deeply immoral <pause dur="0.8"/> when judged by human standards <pause dur="0.9"/> and in fact <pause dur="0.3"/> # there have been a lot of people throughout history including Pythagoras and Plato <pause dur="0.8"/> who <pause dur="0.2"/> made perhaps what anthropologists would consider the terrible mistake <pause dur="0.3"/> of believing <pause dur="0.2"/> that a god <pause dur="0.2"/> necessarily has to be respectable by human terms <pause dur="0.5"/> the fact is <pause dur="0.2"/> many of the ancient myths that you should be coming across in your classical reading <pause dur="0.3"/> <shift feature="voice" new="laugh"/>show that no such thing<shift feature="voice" new="normal"/><pause dur="0.3"/> is the case <pause dur="0.3"/> and that perhaps ultimately an attempt <pause dur="0.5"/> by <pause dur="0.4"/> # a Greek worshipper <pause dur="0.5"/> of the Olympian gods <pause dur="0.4"/> to <pause dur="0.3"/> condemn <pause dur="0.4"/> Aphrodite goddess of love because she's an adulteress <pause dur="0.3"/> or <pause dur="0.2"/> Ares <pause dur="0.2"/> god of war <pause dur="0.2"/> because he's a bully <pause dur="0.5"/> is <pause dur="0.2"/> totally 
irrelevant and deeply impertinent not to say blasphemous <pause dur="1.1"/> if Aphrodite alias Venus sleeps around then she's doing what she does best <pause dur="0.3"/> this is what is in her nature to do <pause dur="0.7"/> and if a god and <pause dur="0.2"/> personification of war <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> isn't a violent aggressive bully then he's obviously sleeping on the job <pause dur="1.3"/> but this idea <pause dur="0.2"/> that gods <pause dur="0.2"/> personify the essence <pause dur="0.6"/> of universal phenomena <pause dur="0.4"/> is one way of looking at religion <pause dur="0.5"/> and the idea <pause dur="0.3"/> that God <pause dur="0.2"/> should not only <pause dur="0.2"/> demand <pause dur="0.2"/> high moral standards from his or her worshippers <pause dur="0.3"/> but also <pause dur="0.5"/> be a moral being <pause dur="1.1"/> himself or herself <pause dur="0.6"/> that is a very different idea <pause dur="0.2"/> and what we see <pause dur="0.3"/> with Judaism <pause dur="0.2"/> Christianity <pause dur="0.2"/> Islam <pause dur="0.7"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> with a lot of high-minded pagan Greeks and Romans themselves <pause dur="0.4"/> is <pause dur="0.2"/> the clash of these two different ideas <pause dur="0.8"/> and so <pause dur="0.2"/> Euhemerus <pause dur="0.8"/> like others before and after him <pause dur="0.3"/> came up with the idea <pause dur="0.4"/> that the real truth was <pause dur="0.5"/> not so much about morality as about <pause dur="0.2"/> power <pause dur="1.7"/> that the originals of the pagan gods <pause dur="0.3"/> had not been gods <pause dur="0.3"/> but they had been human beings and on the whole <pause dur="0.2"/> 
very badly behaved human beings who had behaved in very violent ways <pause dur="0.8"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> that people had then <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> told legends about them or been forced by their power to worship them as if they were gods <pause dur="0.2"/> and that was how the story started <pause dur="0.3"/> Aphrodite for example <pause dur="0.2"/> had begun her career <pause dur="0.2"/> as a highly successful prostitute <pause dur="0.6"/> somehow <pause dur="0.2"/> it all makes a hideous amount of sense <pause dur="0.8"/> and so very often <pause dur="0.2"/> you'll find <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> stories and interpretations <pause dur="0.3"/> where <pause dur="0.2"/> people will go around to say well there must originally have been a human being <pause dur="0.4"/> who <pause dur="0.2"/> behaved in a particular way and then the stories got enlarged and distorted <pause dur="0.2"/> and that's how <pause dur="0.2"/> ideas about how Jupiter turned himself into a bull and raped Europa started <pause dur="0.2"/> something like that <pause dur="2.2"/> thus for example <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> Actaeon a <pause dur="0.2"/> very popular figure <pause dur="0.3"/> in <pause dur="0.2"/> Renaissance poetry <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> a young man who went out hunting one day <pause dur="0.4"/> accidentally <pause dur="0.2"/> saw <pause dur="0.3"/> the goddess Diana <pause dur="0.3"/> bathing <pause dur="1.0"/> and was thereupon turned into a stag and torn to pieces by his own hounds <pause dur="0.4"/> can turn <pause dur="0.2"/> into a little moral story <pause dur="0.2"/> about a young man who was so <pause dur="0.9"/> 
fond of hunting <pause dur="0.2"/> that he spent more on it than he could afford and his hounds <pause dur="0.2"/> to use <pause dur="0.2"/> a common metaphor <pause dur="0.2"/> ate him out of house and home <pause dur="2.3"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> something else that you'll come across and this is very useful indeed do keep your eye open for this in Spenser <pause dur="2.2"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="11"/> is pathetic fallacy <pause dur="8.3"/> a fallacy of course <pause dur="0.3"/> means something <pause dur="0.4"/> that isn't true <pause dur="1.2"/> and pathetic means to do <pause dur="0.2"/> with <pause dur="0.2"/> feelings <pause dur="0.7"/> and pathetic fallacy <pause dur="0.2"/> is the convention <pause dur="0.2"/> whereby <pause dur="0.2"/> the weather <pause dur="0.3"/> the landscape <pause dur="0.2"/> the whole environment around you <pause dur="0.3"/> matches <pause dur="0.2"/> your mood <pause dur="2.0"/> now <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> in an <pause dur="0.2"/> allegory <pause dur="1.9"/> where <pause dur="0.3"/> # everything can be seen as symbolic <pause dur="0.6"/> pathetic fallacy can be very important indeed so watch for weather <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> note that in Spenser <pause dur="0.3"/> the weather is always there <pause dur="0.4"/> # in connection <pause dur="0.3"/> with <pause dur="0.3"/> # moral developments with some sort of # <pause dur="0.9"/> # turn or twist in the plot <pause dur="0.3"/> if he needs his characters to get lost in a wood it will rain <pause dur="0.4"/> otherwise it won't <pause dur="0.5"/> you know <pause dur="0.2"/> there's there's no sense of <pause dur="0.3"/> giving us the sort of naturalistic randomness <pause dur="0.3"/> of English weather <pause dur="0.3"/> that 
you might get <pause dur="0.2"/> or expect to get <pause dur="0.3"/> in <pause dur="0.2"/> realistic plays poems or novels <pause dur="0.3"/> but there again <pause dur="0.2"/> how random is the weather <pause dur="0.4"/> in <pause dur="0.2"/> most English plays poems or novels anyway <pause dur="0.2"/> how <pause dur="0.2"/> random is the landscape i mean <pause dur="0.3"/> those of you <pause dur="0.2"/> who have read Thomas Hardy <pause dur="0.3"/> will know the way <pause dur="0.3"/> that <pause dur="0.2"/> he will construct landscapes that <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> illustrate and reflect the mood of his characters <pause dur="0.3"/> thus in Tess of the d'Urbervilles <pause dur="0.3"/> when our heroine <pause dur="0.3"/> is having <pause dur="0.2"/> a happy <pause dur="0.4"/> love affair <pause dur="0.3"/> she does it in a lush green landscape full of cows and flowers <pause dur="0.9"/> when <pause dur="0.2"/> she has been cast aside and is miserable <pause dur="0.2"/> she goes to a place with the wonderfully <pause dur="0.2"/> symbolic name <pause dur="0.2"/> of Flintcomb-Ash <pause dur="0.2"/> you know <pause dur="0.2"/> everything is just <pause dur="0.3"/> debris <pause dur="0.3"/> hard <pause dur="0.2"/> sterile <pause dur="0.6"/> and # <pause dur="0.2"/> she has a very miserable hard job <pause dur="1.0"/> even that most ruthlessly <pause dur="0.2"/> realistic of writers <pause dur="0.2"/> Jane Austen <pause dur="0.2"/> will flirt with pathetic fallacy <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> notice the way <pause dur="0.2"/> that in Emma <pause dur="0.3"/> the weather <pause dur="0.3"/> always seems to subtly <pause dur="0.2"/> not only <pause dur="0.2"/> affect <pause dur="0.3"/> but reflect <pause dur="0.2"/> the mood of the characters <pause dur="2.9"/> and as i said all these things <pause dur="0.2"/> have to be thought of and 
these are things that occur all over the place it isn't just something that Spenser does <pause dur="3.0"/> finally <pause dur="1.4"/> what are we going to do about symbolism <pause dur="1.2"/> symbolism is a is a word i think that many people find fraught with perils <pause dur="2.7"/> and again it's a word that will often crop up <pause dur="0.5"/> in <pause dur="0.3"/> discussions of Renaissance poetry not just in Spenser <pause dur="1.2"/> let me see can i get can i get them all on <pause dur="3.1"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="2"/> probably not <pause dur="0.5"/> let's try again <pause dur="0.3"/> <trunc>s</trunc> <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="6"/> now the point about symbolism is <pause dur="0.4"/> it's when something <pause dur="1.4"/> represents <pause dur="1.1"/> a part <pause dur="0.8"/> of a larger whole <pause dur="2.3"/> and probably <pause dur="0.3"/> # the best recognized symbol <pause dur="0.3"/> in our culture <pause dur="0.4"/> would be <pause dur="0.3"/> the cross <pause dur="0.3"/> which is both <pause dur="0.3"/> the cross upon which Christ was crucified and which also <pause dur="0.5"/> # represents <pause dur="0.3"/> Christianity <pause dur="0.2"/> right <pause dur="0.3"/> so something is <pause dur="0.2"/> symbolic <pause dur="0.6"/> when <pause dur="0.5"/> it has <pause dur="0.3"/> its own value <pause dur="0.3"/> but it also has other values that go beyond <pause dur="1.3"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> something that i want to <pause dur="0.4"/> impress on you very strongly <pause dur="0.3"/> is that <pause dur="0.3"/> all the things i've talked about so far <pause dur="0.5"/> from the most literal description <pause dur="0.2"/> to the most fanciful metaphor simile <pause dur="0.3"/> or personification <pause dur="0.3"/> can be symbolic <pause dur="0.3"/> 
anything can be <trunc>sym</trunc> <pause dur="0.3"/> a symbol <pause dur="0.4"/> if it sort of <pause dur="0.4"/> goes beyond its own self <pause dur="0.3"/> if it <pause dur="0.2"/> links up with another meaning <pause dur="1.8"/> right in fact originally <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> the symbol comes from the Greek word <pause dur="0.4"/> which <pause dur="0.2"/> meant <pause dur="0.2"/> a tally <pause dur="0.8"/> where <pause dur="0.2"/> # if you <pause dur="0.2"/> if you owed somebody money <pause dur="0.9"/> and # was sending it to them and you wanted to make sure it went to the right person <pause dur="0.5"/> you sent the money along <pause dur="0.3"/> with half a stick <pause dur="1.0"/> and the person who was going to receive it had the other half of the stick <pause dur="1.6"/> and when the person arriving with the money <pause dur="0.2"/> handed it over to the other guy he would first test his stick to make sure that the <pause dur="0.3"/> that the <pause dur="0.2"/> broken bits of his stick <pause dur="0.3"/> fitted <pause dur="0.2"/> the broken bits of the other guy's stick <pause dur="0.3"/> and that was when the symbol <pause dur="0.2"/> came together <pause dur="1.1"/> so it is something which fits in <pause dur="0.4"/> makes a meaning <pause dur="0.2"/> with something else <pause dur="1.0"/> and it can be anything you like really <pause dur="0.5"/> i mean in drama it can even be a bit of scenery or a prop you know it doesn't have to be words <pause dur="1.7"/> right <pause dur="1.5"/> 
now then <pause dur="2.0"/> now i can give you just a few examples from The Faerie Queene <pause dur="0.9"/> of some of the things that i've been looking at <pause dur="0.5"/> and i would like to do that <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> so that <pause dur="0.2"/> i can just remind you <pause dur="0.2"/> it isn't just a question of looking up your lecture notes <pause dur="0.3"/> but that it's a <pause dur="0.2"/> a question of fine detail too <pause dur="0.4"/> because all the lecture notes do <pause dur="0.2"/> is give you the course outline <pause dur="0.3"/> of <pause dur="0.3"/> you know what <pause dur="0.2"/> tells what story <pause dur="0.4"/> but <pause dur="0.2"/> we want <pause dur="0.2"/> you also <pause dur="0.2"/> to be able to <pause dur="0.2"/> read in <pause dur="0.2"/> the detail <pause dur="0.3"/> for yourselves <pause dur="0.3"/> because if The Faerie Queene <pause dur="0.2"/> were no more <pause dur="0.3"/> than what the useful lecture summaries make it <pause dur="0.3"/> it would neither have been worth writing <pause dur="0.5"/> nor reading <pause dur="0.7"/> it would not be on this syllabus <pause dur="1.3"/> so remember <pause dur="0.3"/> go for the details <pause dur="1.3"/> now <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> if i look at <pause dur="0.2"/> the first book of The Faerie Queene <pause dur="0.6"/> i'm looking at canto two it really doesn't matter what i'm reading <pause dur="0.7"/> it really doesn't matter <pause dur="1.0"/> just listen to me <pause dur="1.4"/> i don't want paper rustling <pause dur="1.5"/> # here's a just an example of # literal description <pause dur="0.6"/> as we've seen already <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> you know of 
Duessa <pause dur="0.2"/> <reading>a goodly lady clad in scarlot red <pause dur="0.3"/> purfled with gold and pearle of rich assay <pause dur="0.4"/> and</reading> <pause dur="0.2"/> oh <pause dur="0.3"/> tiny simile but not really just <reading>like a Persian mitre <pause dur="0.2"/> on her hed she wore <pause dur="0.2"/> with crownes and owches garnished <pause dur="0.2"/> the which her lauish louers to her gaue</reading> <pause dur="0.5"/> so the fact that <pause dur="0.2"/> we're told <pause dur="0.2"/> on the literal level this lady had lavish lovers so we know she's no better than she should be <pause dur="0.2"/> right <pause dur="2.1"/> now <pause dur="0.6"/> when <pause dur="0.2"/> Redcrosse <pause dur="0.4"/> decides to fight <pause dur="0.2"/> her escort <pause dur="1.0"/> there's a simile <pause dur="0.9"/> Redcrosse <pause dur="0.5"/> and the escort <pause dur="0.2"/> are <pause dur="0.2"/> described <pause dur="0.2"/> in terms of <pause dur="0.3"/> animals <pause dur="0.8"/> <reading>as when two rams <pause dur="0.2"/> stird with ambitious pride <pause dur="0.3"/> fight for the rule of the rich fleeced flocke <pause dur="0.3"/> their horned fronts so fierce on either side do meete <pause dur="0.3"/> that with the terrour of the shocke astonied both <pause dur="0.2"/> stand sencelesse as a blocke <pause dur="0.3"/> forgetfull <pause dur="0.2"/> of the hanging <pause dur="0.2"/> victory</reading> <pause dur="0.7"/> so <pause dur="0.2"/> in other words they're both rushing at it eyes shut <pause dur="0.2"/> heads down <pause dur="0.2"/> and you're meant to think not just oh yes aren't they like rams <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> but also <pause dur="0.2"/> aren't they being stupid <pause dur="0.3"/> you 
know <pause dur="0.2"/> literally bashing their heads together <pause dur="0.4"/> over this utterly worthless woman <pause dur="2.2"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> now in <pause dur="0.5"/> in the third book <pause dur="0.4"/> canto eleven <pause dur="0.2"/> there's a nice little <pause dur="0.2"/> simile here <pause dur="0.6"/> of <pause dur="0.4"/> the tapestry <pause dur="1.7"/> which <pause dur="0.3"/> we find <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> decorating <pause dur="0.7"/> the <pause dur="0.2"/> the <pause dur="0.7"/> chamber of Busyrane <pause dur="2.1"/> <reading>for round about the wals yclothed were with goodly <pause dur="0.2"/> arras</reading> <pause dur="0.2"/> and remember goodly here just means beautiful it doesn't imply <pause dur="0.3"/> any sort of moral worth <pause dur="0.2"/> <reading>goodly arras of great maiesty <pause dur="0.3"/> wouen with gold and silke so close and nere <pause dur="0.3"/> that the rich metall <pause dur="0.2"/> lurked <pause dur="0.3"/> priuily <pause dur="0.4"/> as feigning to be hid from enuious eye</reading> <pause dur="0.3"/> interesting personification of the metal there <pause dur="0.2"/> the gold is trying to <pause dur="0.3"/> lurk <pause dur="0.2"/> to hide away <pause dur="0.2"/> even the tapestry is sneaky <pause dur="0.8"/> <reading>yet here and there and euerywhere vnwares it shewd it selfe and shone <pause dur="0.3"/> vnwillingly <pause dur="0.2"/> like a discolourd snake <pause dur="0.4"/> whose hidden snares through the greene gras his long bright burnisht backe declares</reading> <pause dur="0.3"/> and notice there <pause dur="0.3"/> how suddenly <pause dur="0.2"/> the metal <pause dur="0.2"/> has turned into the snake it's like a snake it's coming alive <pause dur="0.2"/> it's treacherous it's going to get 
you <pause dur="0.2"/> oh and notice too <pause dur="0.2"/> how brilliantly there <pause dur="0.2"/> Spenser has used the alexandrine <pause dur="0.5"/> you know the long <pause dur="0.3"/> final line of the stanza <pause dur="0.7"/> <reading>through the greene gras his long bright burnisht backe declares</reading> <pause dur="1.7"/> so a nice usage there <pause dur="0.2"/> of imagery <pause dur="0.3"/> and of sound to get the effect <pause dur="1.1"/> and that's about <pause dur="0.3"/> creating atmosphere <pause dur="0.2"/> not just a one to one correspondence of something <pause dur="0.2"/> and this is what we want you to do <pause dur="0.2"/> look at atmosphere look for subtleties <pause dur="2.8"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> and very often there might be an implied moral judgement too <pause dur="0.5"/> now the original ending of the third book of The Faerie Queene <pause dur="0.5"/> # it's where Scudamour and Amoret come together <pause dur="0.6"/> <reading>lightly he clipt her twixt his armes twaine <pause dur="0.3"/> and streightly did embrace her body bright <pause dur="0.3"/> her body <pause dur="0.2"/> late the prison of sad paine <pause dur="0.2"/> now the sweet lodge of loue and deare delight <pause dur="0.4"/> but she faire lady <pause dur="0.3"/> ouercommen quight of huge affection <pause dur="0.3"/> did in pleasure melt <pause dur="0.3"/> and in sweete rauishment <pause dur="0.3"/> pourd out her spright</reading> <pause dur="0.5"/> and there might be a suggestion here <pause dur="0.3"/> that <pause dur="0.2"/> it might be all right because they 
are actually married <pause dur="0.2"/> but is perhaps their love <pause dur="0.3"/> a <trunc>s</trunc> slightly <pause dur="0.2"/> excessive <pause dur="0.3"/> or is it just warning <pause dur="0.3"/> that love itself is a very powerful thing <pause dur="0.2"/> it can actually dissolve two human beings and turn them into one <pause dur="0.3"/> they go on to be compared to the hermaphrodite <pause dur="0.3"/> which could as i've showed you <trunc>l</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> last time i talked to you <pause dur="0.3"/> be a sign of the danger giving yourself up to excessive passion <pause dur="1.8"/> so it's reminding you how very powerful sexual attraction is <pause dur="1.4"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> here again <pause dur="0.2"/> there's a suggestion of <pause dur="0.5"/> judgement <pause dur="0.8"/> atmosphere <pause dur="0.3"/> in the description of how <pause dur="0.3"/> Florimell <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> runs away <pause dur="2.2"/> Florimell is frightened she's always running away <pause dur="0.3"/> # she's running towards <pause dur="0.2"/> the man she loves Marinell <pause dur="0.3"/> and away <pause dur="0.3"/> from every other man she sees <pause dur="0.2"/> # in the fear that he's going to attack her and mostly the poor thing is right <pause dur="1.1"/> so <pause dur="0.6"/> here she goes on one of her runs <pause dur="0.7"/> <reading>like as an hynd forth singled from the heard <pause dur="0.3"/> that hath escaped from a rauenous beast <pause dur="0.3"/> yet flyes away of her owne feet affeard <pause dur="0.3"/> and euery leafe that shaketh with the least murmure of 
winde <pause dur="0.3"/> her terror hath encreast <pause dur="0.3"/> so fled faire Florimell from her vaine <pause dur="0.3"/> feare <pause dur="0.5"/> long after she from perill was releast</reading> <pause dur="0.3"/> so she's being <trunc>compar</trunc> <sic corr="compared">cared</sic> <pause dur="0.3"/> to a panicking animal <pause dur="0.3"/> and then we're told <pause dur="0.2"/> hey it was vain <pause dur="0.2"/> there was nothing to run away from <pause dur="0.2"/> you should stop <pause dur="0.2"/> but no <pause dur="0.3"/> again <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> like the knights when they're fighting <pause dur="0.2"/> the girl when she's running away <pause dur="0.3"/> is like an animal she's out of control <pause dur="0.7"/> <reading>each shade she saw <pause dur="0.2"/> and each noyse she did heare <pause dur="0.2"/> did seeme to be the same <pause dur="0.3"/> which she escapt whyleare <pause dur="0.7"/> all the same euening she in flying spent <pause dur="0.3"/> and all that night her course continewed <pause dur="0.3"/> <sic corr="ne">nor</sic> did she let dull sleepe once to relent nor wearinesse to slacke her hast <pause dur="0.5"/> but fled euer alike <pause dur="0.4"/> as if her former dred were hard behind <pause dur="0.4"/> were hard behind <pause dur="0.2"/> her readie to arrest <pause dur="0.5"/> and her white palfrey <pause dur="0.3"/> hauing conquered the maistring raines out of her weary wrest <pause dur="0.3"/> perforce her carried <pause dur="0.3"/> where euer he thought best</reading> <pause dur="0.4"/> so her palfrey her riding horse <pause dur="0.4"/> has # <pause dur="0.7"/> has # <pause dur="1.1"/> got away out of her control <pause dur="0.4"/> conquered the maistring reins 
out of her weary wrest <pause dur="0.3"/> her wrist <pause dur="0.2"/> she cannot control her horse <pause dur="1.1"/> and again <pause dur="0.3"/> this is typical <pause dur="0.3"/> that Spenser will often show <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> the accoutrements of a character <pause dur="0.3"/> the horse <pause dur="0.3"/> the armour <pause dur="0.2"/> the garments are telling you something about them <pause dur="0.3"/> and here <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> you know this <pause dur="0.2"/> horse <pause dur="0.3"/> which is <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> bolting <pause dur="0.8"/> is very much a picture <pause dur="0.3"/> of <pause dur="0.3"/> Florimell <pause dur="0.2"/> and in fact you could actually argue here <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> that perhaps you know # <pause dur="0.2"/> the vehicle <pause dur="0.3"/> # you know the girl <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> riding an out of control horse <pause dur="0.4"/> and the tenor <pause dur="0.2"/> which is to tell us about the girl's <pause dur="0.2"/> mindless <pause dur="0.3"/> terror <pause dur="0.5"/> we might in fact see that they were very slightly <pause dur="0.4"/> # in tension here <pause dur="0.2"/> in opposition in friction <pause dur="0.3"/> because if you're looking at that scene <pause dur="0.2"/> completely realistically <pause dur="0.3"/> it's the girl who's frightened of being raped <pause dur="0.3"/> not the horse <pause dur="0.3"/> and you might feel that after hours and hours and hours of galloping <pause dur="0.2"/> if the horse <pause dur="0.2"/> was actually able to gain control of the situation <pause dur="0.2"/> it would probably want to slow down <pause dur="0.5"/> not keep on galloping but there you are <pause dur="0.2"/> the horse here <pause dur="0.3"/> is being 
used <pause dur="0.2"/> to express <pause dur="0.2"/> Florimell's out of control passions <pause dur="1.6"/> but just to remind you here <pause dur="0.4"/> that # <pause dur="0.4"/> this sort of <pause dur="0.6"/> simile this sort of comparing one thing with another background with mood <pause dur="0.4"/> goes on all the time <pause dur="0.4"/> i've got a nice little poem <pause dur="0.3"/> written in the twentieth century <pause dur="0.2"/> by Robert Frost <pause dur="0.3"/> called <pause dur="0.3"/> Birches <pause dur="1.0"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> where <pause dur="0.2"/> he <pause dur="0.2"/> uses <pause dur="0.2"/> a very <pause dur="0.3"/> powerful <pause dur="0.2"/> simile <pause dur="0.2"/> to describe <pause dur="0.3"/> how <pause dur="0.2"/> wandering <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> in a wood can be like <pause dur="0.3"/> living your life generally <pause dur="0.5"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> where <pause dur="0.2"/> you are meant to stop and think and say oh yes <pause dur="0.2"/> this bit fits with this bit oh yeah and that bit fits with that bit <pause dur="1.1"/> # he doesn't kind of # <pause dur="0.4"/> dot all the <pause dur="0.3"/> Is or cross all the Ts for you <pause dur="1.9"/> <reading>it's when i'm weary of consideration <pause dur="0.7"/> and life is too much like a pathless wood <pause dur="0.5"/> where your face <pause dur="0.2"/> burns and tickles with the cobwebs broken across it <pause dur="1.0"/> and one eye is weeping from a twig's having lashed across it open <pause dur="1.1"/> i'd like to get away from Earth awhile and then <pause dur="0.3"/> come back to it and begin over</reading> <pause dur="0.6"/> and he doesn't actually tell you in detail <pause dur="0.2"/> what it is that makes his life so <pause dur="0.8"/> hostile

the point you have to bear in mind there is <pause dur="0.4"/> that he isn't taken <pause dur="0.2"/> to the real Olivet <pause dur="0.3"/> that <pause dur="0.2"/> he is actually standing on the Mount of Contemplation <pause dur="0.5"/> so <pause dur="0.3"/> that what Spenser is saying <pause dur="0.3"/> is that this pilgrimage is all right <pause dur="0.3"/> because <pause dur="0.4"/> it's only spiritual <pause dur="0.5"/> it's all in <pause dur="0.2"/> the mind <pause dur="0.7"/> so <pause dur="0.3"/> it's as if <pause dur="0.3"/> pilgrimage itself could be seen <pause dur="0.3"/> as a type <pause dur="0.9"/> of which <pause dur="0.8"/> contemplation <pause dur="0.7"/> Christian consent <pause dur="0.3"/> to the will of God <pause dur="0.5"/> is <pause dur="0.4"/> the antitype <pause dur="0.5"/> so again <pause dur="0.3"/> it's all about what happens inside you <pause dur="0.4"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> the complexities are there <pause dur="0.7"/> the details are there <pause dur="0.3"/> the fine shades of character drawing are there <pause dur="0.5"/> but <pause dur="0.2"/> you must remember <pause dur="0.3"/> to look for them <pause dur="0.3"/> not just in the individual <pause dur="0.3"/> figures <pause dur="0.3"/> that are named <pause dur="0.2"/> Saint George or <pause dur="0.2"/> Una <pause dur="0.3"/> or Britomart or the rest <pause dur="0.3"/> but look at the way they interact <pause dur="0.2"/> with everybody else <pause dur="0.3"/> and that is how <pause dur="0.4"/> the <pause dur="0.2"/> two-dimensional cardboard <pause dur="0.4"/> figures <pause dur="0.3"/> are slotted together <pause dur="0.3"/> to form <pause dur="0.2"/> structures <pause dur="0.2"/> of great beauty <pause dur="0.2"/> and complexity <pause dur="0.3"/> but do remember <pause dur="0.3"/> that this is something <pause dur="0.3"/> that you have to do <pause dur="0.3"/> for yourselves <pause dur="0.3"/> thank you
