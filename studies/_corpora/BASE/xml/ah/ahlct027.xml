mother <pause dur="0.3"/> not just a father we have to look at the role of mothers in # the formation of our intellectuals as well as <pause dur="0.4"/> the <trunc>f</trunc> the fathers <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> and she was a cultured and liberal Protestant <pause dur="0.5"/> but a woman who had become an overburdened <pause dur="0.2"/> hausfrau <pause dur="0.9"/> she was religious and felt a vocation to charity and good works <pause dur="0.5"/> but these things were of no interest to her husband <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> certainly parental relations in the family home # were estranged <pause dur="0.4"/> it was clear that Weber senior was a martinet to his children and <pause dur="0.3"/> very # overbearing and autocratic # in his behaviour to his wife <pause dur="1.0"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> now <pause dur="0.8"/> what happens # with with Weber is that from his school days he drew away from the the piety of his mother and the philistinism of his father <pause dur="0.4"/> and <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> decided that academic pursuits were going to be his his way in life and he went off to university in Heidelberg <pause dur="0.4"/> there he certainly played the # the role of the the student prince <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> engaging in all kinds of # fun and games as well as a a bit of work <pause dur="0.6"/> # but <pause dur="0.2"/> he later continued his 
studies in Strasburg and Göttingen <pause dur="0.5"/> where he studied law <pause dur="1.0"/> he went he did his period of of military service <pause dur="1.0"/> and after his studies went on to take up <pause dur="0.2"/> service in the law courts in Berlin <pause dur="0.4"/> # where he worked on a PhD thesis # <pause dur="0.2"/> the first thesis he did his PhD <trunc>sis</trunc> thesis <pause dur="1.0"/> went back <pause dur="0.4"/> to his own origins he worked on the trading companies during the Middle Ages <pause dur="0.9"/> and # <pause dur="0.7"/> in eighteen-ninety he passed a second law exam <pause dur="0.3"/> and he did what the # followed the the common German practice which continues to this day <pause dur="0.3"/> of doing a second thesis <pause dur="0.5"/> the habilitatation <trunc>h</trunc> <distinct lang="de">habilitation</distinct> <pause dur="0.4"/> and with a treatise on the history of agrarian institutions <pause dur="0.7"/> and this was a sociology an economic and cultural analysis of ancient societies <pause dur="1.0"/> now finally this is a long period of study that he that he went through <pause dur="0.4"/> he then married # the grand niece of his father <pause dur="0.5"/> Marianne Schnitger <pause dur="0.5"/> and lived the life of a successful young scholar in <pause dur="0.2"/> Berlin where he became a professor <pause dur="0.5"/> of # economics # <pause dur="0.3"/> he # <pause dur="0.4"/> he was in Berlin as a as a as a young 
scholar <pause dur="0.3"/> and then he went on to become a professor of of economics at Freiburg <pause dur="0.5"/> in eighteen-ninety-<pause dur="0.2"/>four <pause dur="1.0"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> # what we what he did in <trunc>frei</trunc> he had a huge workload in Freiburg and just seemed absolutely obsessed with work <pause dur="0.5"/> this # certainly became a very important <shift feature="voice" new="laugh"/>characteristic <shift feature="voice" new="normal"/>of his life <pause dur="0.6"/> # he went on to take a chair at Heidelberg in eighteen-ninety-<pause dur="0.2"/>six <pause dur="0.9"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> but <pause dur="0.7"/> in eighteen-ninety-seven <pause dur="0.7"/> he # and he'd oh as <pause dur="0.3"/> i'll just sort of say a little bit <pause dur="0.3"/> he # <pause dur="0.2"/> he when he the chair that he took in in Heidelberg replaced one of the <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> # a <trunc>m</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> a man named Kniess who was one of the heads of the German Historical School <pause dur="0.3"/> so he was very much part of that # <pause dur="0.5"/> that # general historiographical tradition of the time the German Historical School a lot of <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="1.0"/> # a lot of # <pause dur="0.4"/> people at the time writing histories with a great # <pause dur="0.2"/> economic and sociological sort of content to them <pause dur="0.6"/> and # <pause dur="0.9"/> but he has what happens then in eighteen-ninety-seven <pause dur="0.3"/> he has a crisis his father died <pause dur="0.6"/> # this is was the the onset of his his crisis his father died <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> and he <trunc>d</trunc> just before his 
father's death he'd had a huge <pause dur="0.4"/> quarrel with him a huge fight with him <pause dur="0.5"/> over # the way he was his # Weber's mother was being treated by his father <pause dur="0.7"/> and # <pause dur="1.3"/> he didn't see <trunc>ge</trunc> get to see his father <pause dur="0.3"/> before he died he'd had this big <trunc>f</trunc> big fight with him so felt terrible guilt and remorse after this <pause dur="0.7"/> and had a nervous breakdown <pause dur="2.0"/> so <pause dur="0.7"/> and he suffered for the rest of his life from <pause dur="0.5"/> severe depression <pause dur="0.5"/> interspersed by <pause dur="0.2"/> manic work <pause dur="0.2"/> and periods of travel <pause dur="0.6"/> so that really was sort of marked his life from from that time onward we see <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> this # <pause dur="1.7"/> this this <vocal desc="sigh" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.6"/> conflict with the father <pause dur="0.5"/> and then this period of <trunc>s</trunc> of # a nervous breakdown after after his father's death and # <pause dur="0.5"/> it affecting him for the rest of his life <pause dur="1.0"/> well in nineteen-o-two he returned to some duties he did some teaching <trunc>ad</trunc> and administration <pause dur="0.4"/> but he was mainly doing a lot of travelling <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> after this time <pause dur="0.4"/> and # he travelled <trunc>i</trunc> during this time and he travelled # through to Italy <pause dur="0.7"/> he hoped he would recuperate in Italy but he couldn't concentrate <pause dur="0.5"/> and # <pause dur="0.6"/> he did 
start to do some writing and in nineteen-o-four <pause dur="0.5"/> wrote <pause dur="0.3"/> the first chapter of The Protestant Ethic <pause dur="0.7"/> so he writes that that first chapter then <pause dur="0.3"/> but immediately after that <pause dur="0.3"/> he set off to the U-S <pause dur="0.8"/> and it was his <pause dur="0.2"/> it was you know this was # a really a big event for him <pause dur="0.2"/> it was his trip to his first trip to America <pause dur="0.7"/> and he went with # other leading figures German figures of the time <pause dur="0.4"/> Werner Sombart <pause dur="0.4"/> and # and Troeltsch <pause dur="0.6"/> but particularly Sombart who was someone i'll <pause dur="0.2"/> we we'll be mentioning him <trunc>la</trunc> after <pause dur="0.4"/> who that he he came to debate The Protestant Ethic # with <pause dur="0.6"/> now he was enthralled by # the United States by <pause dur="0.3"/> the pace of life in the big cities <pause dur="0.5"/> # he was bemused by the democratic customs of the natives there <pause dur="0.4"/> but found in in it absolutely exhilarating experience # <pause dur="0.6"/> # seeing it <pause dur="0.2"/> and he came to write about it quite a lot in the The Protestant Ethic <pause dur="0.6"/> he he wanted to enter sympathetically into the New World <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> but wanted to retain his capacity for an informed judgement on the directions it was taking <pause dur="1.9"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> he was <pause dur="0.9"/> absolutely # 
fascinated by the characteristics of American capitalism <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> impressed by the extent of the waste of human life in # this frenetic activity of money making # <pause dur="0.3"/> in in the U-S <pause dur="0.4"/> and <pause dur="0.3"/> in New York decided he would look for material that he could <pause dur="0.4"/> use to develop this the chapter that he'd started before he'd left <pause dur="0.4"/> and it started the The Protestant Ethic <pause dur="0.2"/> so that experience in America was also extreme was absolutely fundamental <pause dur="0.4"/> to what he came <pause dur="0.3"/> to write <pause dur="0.3"/> in <pause dur="0.2"/> The Protestant Ethic <pause dur="1.2"/> # <pause dur="1.2"/> now <pause dur="0.2"/> after he returned to German # Germany he finished <pause dur="0.4"/> the <pause dur="0.2"/> finished the text <pause dur="1.1"/> then the Russian # the first <trunc>ru</trunc> Russian revolution <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> was something that was <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> redirected his attention and his scholarly interest <pause dur="0.5"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> this man of enormous # energies he <pause dur="0.4"/> he was also you know working flat out # <pause dur="0.3"/> well he had these these periods when he sort of went in for this sort of manic work <pause dur="0.3"/> and he <pause dur="0.5"/> managed to learn Russian in bed before getting up each morning <pause dur="0.2"/> imagine it <pause dur="0.6"/><vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" n="ss" dur="1"/> # so that he could follow the Russian daily press and he wrote a piece on the nineteen-o-five revolution <pause dur="0.8"/> 
so he's very much one of these # what we find # <pause dur="0.4"/> with # with <trunc>ver</trunc> Weber he's very much one of this generation of universal scholars <pause dur="0.3"/> that we find # in this period <pause dur="0.4"/> a lawyer <pause dur="0.2"/> an economist <pause dur="0.2"/> a historian a philosopher he ranged across these fields <pause dur="0.5"/> he was also well acquainted with the <pause dur="0.4"/> the <trunc>thi</trunc> the <trunc>liter</trunc> all the lot of literature on the theology of his day <pause dur="0.6"/> # he did an enormous quantity of work <pause dur="0.8"/> and # <pause dur="1.0"/> i have to say it was a rather different kind of setting than # we find in universities today <pause dur="0.5"/> there was a lot of research time <pause dur="0.4"/> available <pause dur="0.2"/> <shift feature="voice" new="laugh"/>to <shift feature="voice" new="normal"/> then <pause dur="0.4"/> and there was no # pressure for rapid publication <pause dur="0.4"/> so he was <trunc>d</trunc> # ranging across these fields doing a huge amount of research and # learning a <pause dur="0.3"/> a huge amount over many fields <pause dur="0.4"/> but # in a rather different setting than # than we face in in in universities now <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="1.8"/> but this was something that certainly allowed him to range widely over the humanities <pause dur="0.8"/> # and <pause dur="0.3"/> we find him being transformed # <pause dur="0.3"/> the the whole world of the of the the German scholar the German # <pause dur="0.5"/> # the <pause dur="0.2"/> the German professor over that period 
was being transformed from <pause dur="0.5"/> # a petty bourgeois <pause dur="0.4"/> sort of character harried by money into an upper class academician <pause dur="0.4"/> with a large house and the facilities to establish an international salon culture <pause dur="0.5"/> so he's moved certainly moved into that that world by this time <pause dur="1.0"/> he was also # Weber was also one of the # the last of the political <pause dur="0.2"/> professors <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> he made <pause dur="0.9"/> contributions # <pause dur="1.0"/> # detached contributions to science and # and <trunc>a</trunc> also acted as a as a political <trunc>f</trunc> figure in the intellectual vanguard of the middle classes <pause dur="0.5"/> # at the time <pause dur="0.4"/> but he was much less successful than he would like to have been he was a sort of <pause dur="1.0"/> he he tried to have a political career <pause dur="0.3"/> almost did it <pause dur="0.2"/> but didn't <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="1.5"/> he # at the age of fifty-four <pause dur="0.3"/> he allowed his name to go forward as a candidate for the German Democratic Party <pause dur="0.2"/> but didn't bother to canvass thought that <pause dur="0.5"/> people should just know who he was and # <pause dur="0.3"/> and and vote for him <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.8"/> he thought he expected he would be he would be adopted as the party candidate but was passed over for a local non-entity and he was very 
deeply hurt <pause dur="0.2"/> by this <pause dur="0.3"/> so at the end of the day <pause dur="0.3"/> this was a man who was better about writing about the mechanics of power <pause dur="0.4"/> than dealing in its practicalities <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="1.7"/> so # <pause dur="0.2"/> he he <trunc>w</trunc> <trunc>de</trunc> was very disappointed and he actually he ended up dying shortly after this at the age of fifty-six <pause dur="0.5"/> but gosh he was just fifty-six and the <pause dur="0.5"/> volume of the his his scholarly output by this time was absolutely amazing <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> but this <trunc>inde</trunc> and indeed <kinesic desc="holds up book" iterated="n"/> this was one of the shortest # <pause dur="0.6"/> tracts that he he he ever wrote <pause dur="0.3"/> it was a short and inspired piece of writing <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> it represented Weber's early turning to broader cultural themes and one of <pause dur="0.5"/> # it was very much one of the early pieces he wrote after <pause dur="0.3"/> his breakdown <pause dur="3.2"/> # <pause dur="0.9"/> as i said before it was written in two parts over the period nineteen-o-four to five # <pause dur="0.2"/> interspersed by <kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> this <trunc>t</trunc> # trip to America <pause dur="1.8"/> # <pause dur="3.0"/> now <pause dur="0.9"/> just to say # something on the context <pause dur="0.3"/> in which it was written <pause dur="0.5"/> i just want to # to set that out first of all <pause dur="0.4"/> Weber's often <pause dur="0.2"/> thought about as a theorist who championed <pause dur="0.7"/> the cause of the independent role of <pause dur="0.2"/> # 
ideas and social life but he also had strong <trunc>materias</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> materialist leanings <pause dur="0.4"/> so we can sort of # debate that that issue <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> there's a lot of misunderstandings of The Protestant Ethic <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> really taken from <pause dur="0.2"/> Baudelairizing <pause dur="0.2"/> the thesis creating a kind of Baudelairized thesis that Calvinism was the principal cause of capitalism <pause dur="0.7"/> of ideas leading # to the to the economic system <pause dur="0.4"/> # but this is not # <pause dur="0.4"/> this is not <pause dur="0.3"/> how we should characterize # the argument in this text <pause dur="0.4"/> first of all <pause dur="0.3"/> we have to see <pause dur="0.3"/> that there was a very important <pause dur="0.3"/> social and political context for this essay <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> i <trunc>d</trunc> i want to to to come to <pause dur="0.4"/> the characteristics of of of that context <pause dur="0.4"/> it was written in the context of a contemporary debate <pause dur="0.3"/> in Germany <pause dur="0.2"/> on the differences between <pause dur="0.5"/> Protestants and Catholics <pause dur="1.2"/> and the impact of this <pause dur="0.3"/> on <pause dur="0.4"/> social structure <pause dur="0.3"/> and social status <pause dur="0.7"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> the broader background to that <pause dur="0.5"/> goes <pause dur="0.4"/> back to the context of the Kulturkampf <pause dur="0.3"/> in <pause dur="0.2"/> Prussia <pause dur="0.4"/> that period which Bismarck had launched of # <pause dur="0.4"/> # discrimination against the Catholics <pause dur="1.9"/> so 
this turns of course a lot of the the civil service the # the state sort of denies this <pause dur="0.3"/> but what it turns into is an academic <pause dur="0.3"/> # aspects of it turning into an academic debate <pause dur="0.3"/> on the positions of Catholics <pause dur="0.3"/> # in the society <pause dur="0.6"/> and and the the # the the Catholic # Protestant <pause dur="0.3"/> division <pause dur="0.6"/> the other # <pause dur="0.5"/> # context i want to draw attention to <pause dur="0.4"/> # in this is the whole approach that that Weber took <pause dur="0.4"/> in writing # writing this this essay <pause dur="0.3"/> it's a very simple <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.8"/> simple # <trunc>si</trunc> simple approach a sort of simple # formulation <pause dur="0.3"/> of the question # <pause dur="1.3"/> he combined what he managed to do was to combine a sensitivity to <pause dur="0.4"/> diverse structural meanings # <pause dur="0.3"/> in this <pause dur="0.3"/> with <pause dur="0.2"/> an <trunc>insi</trunc> an insistence on <pause dur="0.3"/> an <trunc>abs</trunc> a fundamental causal role <pause dur="0.6"/> for # <pause dur="0.4"/> material factors in influencing the course of history <pause dur="1.6"/> he drew on elements of Marx but he was not <pause dur="0.2"/> definitely not a a Marxist never accepted # Marxism <pause dur="0.3"/> rejected its politics <pause dur="0.2"/> but he certainly did draw on elements of Marx <pause dur="0.9"/> the essay was also as i <pause dur="0.3"/> i <pause dur="0.2"/> it it presents a sort of fairly simple formulation because it was highly focused <pause dur="0.3"/> he wanted to make a very 
clear and focused <pause dur="0.3"/> explanation of what he was putting <pause dur="0.3"/> forward <pause dur="0.3"/> he rejected <pause dur="0.4"/> # a multidimensional analysis of the whole problem <trunc>betw</trunc> of religion and society <pause dur="0.9"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> focused on the economic sector <pause dur="0.5"/> was the <trunc>eco</trunc> he <trunc>w</trunc> he focused right down <pause dur="0.2"/> into the the economic sector <pause dur="0.3"/> and the rise of what he called a rational capitalism <pause dur="2.2"/> so he was <pause dur="0.7"/> interested in two things a rational capitalism <pause dur="0.3"/> and <pause dur="0.3"/> its religious preconditions <pause dur="0.5"/> now the other interesting thing about <pause dur="0.3"/> the religious preconditions that he looks at <pause dur="0.3"/> he doesn't look at all religious preconditions <pause dur="0.4"/> by any means <pause dur="0.9"/> he <pause dur="0.2"/> <trunc>foc</trunc> he doesn't even look at Germans and Lutherans <pause dur="0.3"/> instead he focuses in <pause dur="0.4"/> on <pause dur="0.5"/> Anglo-Saxons <pause dur="0.5"/> he talks about Americans a lot here as well <pause dur="0.5"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> the Calvinist world <pause dur="0.3"/> so <pause dur="0.4"/> he centres his argument on on those aspects <pause dur="0.4"/> so <pause dur="0.3"/> he was looking <pause dur="0.3"/> to find <pause dur="0.4"/> in this <pause dur="0.3"/> much more focused # approach <pause dur="0.8"/> to to find the guiding principles of conduct <pause dur="0.5"/> and the value system governing patterns of behaviour <pause dur="0.8"/> that's really what he's trying to do <pause dur="0.3"/> now let's turn to his 
argument <pause dur="0.5"/> which you will find by reading the text <pause dur="0.9"/> okay <pause dur="0.2"/> very clearly set out <pause dur="0.4"/> first of all he tells us he wants to tell us about capitalism <pause dur="0.5"/> and you'll find on your handout <pause dur="0.7"/> my spelling isn't very good so you'd better correct # <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> perhaps some kind of <pause dur="0.8"/> slip there <pause dur="0.2"/> but # <pause dur="0.5"/> not mens but means <pause dur="0.5"/> okay <pause dur="0.6"/> now if we turn to his argument he he tells us first what he # <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.9"/> what he <pause dur="0.2"/> he wants to single out in his definitions of capitalism <pause dur="0.8"/> what The Protestant Ethic starts with # The Protestant Ethic starts with is a very fairly broad and <pause dur="0.5"/> <trunc>e</trunc> very contestable if you read these you will find these very contestable but # <pause dur="0.5"/> # contrasts he wants to set out contrasts <pause dur="0.3"/> between the development of the West and the East <pause dur="1.2"/> so <pause dur="0.2"/> we get <pause dur="1.1"/> the West the the East and the West # set out <pause dur="0.3"/> as different systems <pause dur="0.4"/> and <pause dur="0.5"/> he looks at rational systems in the West he sees <trunc>s</trunc> argues there are more rational systems developed in the West <pause dur="0.5"/> # in music in architecture in perspective <pause dur="0.6"/> # that there's trained officials of the state <pause dur="0.4"/> that the state # <pause dur="0.7"/> # itself has sort of a rational structure with a written constitutional constitution <pause dur="0.6"/> 
rationally ordained law and an administration bound to rules or laws <pause dur="0.7"/> capitalism was not then identified <pause dur="0.2"/> with greed <pause dur="0.2"/> for gain <pause dur="0.9"/> but identified with the pursuit of profit <pause dur="1.6"/> an ever renewed profit <pause dur="0.3"/> by means of continuous <pause dur="0.4"/> rational <pause dur="0.3"/> capitalistic enterprise <pause dur="1.0"/> so that's what he he sees as as the central # the central point <pause dur="0.3"/> in in capitalism <pause dur="0.3"/> it was that pursuit of profit <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="1.2"/> and ever renewed profit <pause dur="0.5"/> and that pursued by rational capitalistic enterprise <pause dur="1.9"/> now he argues certainly <pause dur="0.5"/> <trunc>ca</trunc> # calculation was carried on in India <pause dur="0.8"/> where the decimal system was invented <pause dur="1.1"/> but <pause dur="0.7"/> that decimal system was only really made use of by developing capitalism in the West he argues <pause dur="0.4"/> # in India it led to no <pause dur="0.3"/> modern bookkeeping <pause dur="1.3"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> and he cites other examples like China <pause dur="0.6"/> where we see <pause dur="0.2"/> origins of # mathematics and mechanics <trunc>t</trunc> # <pause dur="0.9"/> but # <pause dur="1.6"/> the <pause dur="0.5"/> again the technical utilization of this knowledge # <pause dur="0.3"/> was not taken up <pause dur="0.2"/> in the way that it was in in the West <pause dur="0.8"/> so we have that East-West comparison set out <trunc>a</trunc> at the beginning <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="2.4"/> so <pause dur="0.8"/> # 
finally <pause dur="0.2"/> just to to recap <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> capitalist action <pause dur="0.4"/> as we see in the West involved regular pursuit of profit <pause dur="0.2"/> through economic exchange <pause dur="2.7"/> now <pause dur="0.4"/> Weber also goes into different types of capitalism <pause dur="1.2"/> okay he's got # <pause dur="1.1"/> the the the different types of capitalism <pause dur="0.4"/> he he <pause dur="0.3"/> enquires into <pause dur="1.1"/> these were set out as <pause dur="0.2"/> booty capitalism <pause dur="0.2"/> that is the robber barons <pause dur="1.9"/> pariah capitalism <pause dur="1.5"/> now this is a kind of commercial activity <pause dur="0.6"/> which <pause dur="0.2"/> he identified with forms of money lending <pause dur="0.5"/> and again <pause dur="0.5"/> sets this discusses this in terms of Jewish enterprise <pause dur="0.6"/> now this led to a lot of debate over the the text later on <pause dur="0.3"/> # especially the # debate that he has with Sombart <pause dur="0.4"/> who takes this further and argues that # <pause dur="0.5"/> we can see sort of origins of capitalism <pause dur="0.3"/> being tied up with <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> the # enterprise of the Jews <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="1.1"/> but <pause dur="1.2"/> i think it's a very interesting # area i won't be able to go into it in any depth today but it's something that # you may want to pursue in your seminars and # <pause dur="0.3"/> and your essays <pause dur="0.3"/> but <pause dur="0.3"/> that was an a a <trunc>fair</trunc> a central part of the some of the critique of

Christianity <pause dur="0.7"/> and he notices there a sharp contrast between Catholic and Protestant attitudes and draws some broad generalizations from this <pause dur="0.6"/> he argues <pause dur="0.4"/> that the Reformation <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="1.2"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> the the Reformation <pause dur="1.7"/> <reading>brought not the elimination of the church's control over everyday life <pause dur="0.4"/> but the substitution of a new form of control</reading> <pause dur="1.2"/> he argued that <pause dur="0.8"/> <reading>the Catholic Church was relatively lax in these controls and have # previously <pause dur="0.4"/> and # many of them were scarcely <pause dur="0.2"/> perceptible <pause dur="0.5"/> but <pause dur="0.4"/> Calvinism <pause dur="0.5"/> penetrated to all departments of private and public <pause dur="0.2"/> public life <pause dur="1.2"/> infinitely burdensome <pause dur="0.4"/> earnestly enforced</reading> <pause dur="1.2"/> was # would be today he he argues it would be for us <trunc>t</trunc> us today # # <reading>an absolutely unbearable form of ecclesiastical control</reading> <pause dur="1.1"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> so this was <trunc>som</trunc> something that had become the strongest of of the fates <pause dur="1.2"/> # <pause dur="2.1"/> Catholicism in addition <pause dur="0.3"/> <reading>was associated with magic and superstition <pause dur="0.9"/> the cycle of sin repentance <pause dur="0.2"/> atonement release <pause dur="0.7"/> followed by renewed sin <pause dur="0.3"/> and mediated by a priest</reading> <pause dur="2.0"/> this was his # very much his his image of # <pause dur="0.2"/> of of Catholicism <pause dur="1.4"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> now <pause dur="0.2"/> i have recently found it

entrepreneurs <pause dur="4.2"/> now Weber found much to admire in Calvinism for its effectiveness <pause dur="0.7"/> but he also found it deeply <pause dur="0.2"/> problematic <pause dur="0.4"/> so let's look at about at how he he writes about it </u><gap reason="break in recording" extent="uncertain"/> <u who="nf0090" trans="pause"> he he looks at <pause dur="0.2"/> predestination <pause dur="0.6"/> and <pause dur="1.2"/> shows that <pause dur="0.3"/> there were no magical means of attaining the grace of God <pause dur="0.2"/> for those to whom God had decided to deny it <pause dur="0.3"/> and you didn't know whether you were going to fall into that category <pause dur="0.6"/> there were the harsh very harsh doctrines of absolute <trunc>trans</trunc> transcendentality of God <pause dur="0.5"/> and the corruption of everything pertaining to the <trunc>c</trunc> to the flesh <pause dur="0.8"/> an inner isolation of the individual <pause dur="1.8"/> # so he <trunc>f</trunc> <trunc>s</trunc> you <trunc>f</trunc> see in this the the reason for the negative attitude of Puritanism to sensuous and emotional elements in culture and religion <pause dur="1.0"/> # <pause dur="4.3"/> <reading>and the God of Calvinism demanded of believers not single good works but a life of good works combined with a unified system <pause dur="0.3"/> a consistent method of conduct as a whole</reading> <pause dur="1.8"/> now for the Catholics by contrast there was absolution <pause dur="0.3"/> a cycle of sin repentance atonement <pause dur="0.5"/> release <pause dur="1.2"/> # <pause dur="1.1"/> 
what <trunc>f</trunc> happens with Calvinism is the idea of the necessity of proving one's faith in worldly activity <pause dur="1.8"/> now if we turn to # <pause dur="1.0"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> turn <pause dur="0.4"/> # just got another <pause dur="4.0"/><kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="4"/> turn further to look at # asceticism <pause dur="0.3"/> which is an aspect of of # Calvinism <pause dur="2.2"/> now Weber pursues these themes of the relentless the all pervasive character of Calvinism <pause dur="0.7"/> # he talks about <reading>the waste of time being the first and deadliest sin <pause dur="1.3"/> human life <pause dur="0.2"/> infinitely short and precious <pause dur="1.1"/> # it's very precious to make <trunc>w</trunc> sure of one's own election <pause dur="1.0"/> a loss of time would be caused through sociability idle talk luxury <pause dur="0.9"/> in the Puritan view <pause dur="0.3"/> we see the providential character of the the play of private economic interest taking on a new emphasis</reading> <pause dur="0.5"/> the <trunc>p</trunc> and there's this sort of the whole # providentialism of of the the system <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="2.2"/> the <reading>the providential purpose of the division of labour was to be known by its fruits</reading> <pause dur="0.9"/> and again the asceticism <pause dur="0.6"/> is very # # an ascetic # <pause dur="0.3"/> # discipline <pause dur="0.6"/> something that is # <pause dur="1.5"/> # <reading>an enemy to # hostility to sport to recreation to spontaneous
