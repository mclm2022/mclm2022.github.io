<u who="nm0078"> <reading>when you're invited to give a guest lecture it's always important to think about who your audience will be <pause dur="0.9"/> they should be kept in mind when you're choosing your topic <pause dur="0.3"/> and deciding the best way to present it <pause dur="0.8"/> your audience will also want to know something about you <pause dur="0.9"/> who and what you are <pause dur="0.2"/> helps to explain why you've chosen a particular subject <pause dur="0.5"/> and what you make of it <pause dur="1.0"/> i'm a historian <pause dur="0.8"/> i spend my time studying the past <pause dur="0.8"/> the period of the past that i study most intensively <pause dur="0.5"/> is the nineteenth and twentieth centuries <pause dur="0.5"/> and the particular area of the world <pause dur="0.3"/> has been Africa <pause dur="0.4"/> and in particular the European impact on Africa <pause dur="0.4"/> during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries</reading> </u><gap reason="break in recording" extent="uncertain"/> <u who="nm0078" trans="pause"> many of you here today are not <pause dur="0.2"/> from Africa <pause dur="0.7"/> but you are many of you from parts of the world that have been affected by one of the great global <pause dur="0.5"/> forces at work <pause dur="0.5"/> in world history <pause dur="0.4"/> what we loosely call imperialism <pause dur="0.5"/> and that is why <pause dur="0.3"/> i thought what i should <pause dur="0.3"/> try to <pause dur="0.5"/> talk to you about today <pause dur="0.3"/> is this phenomenon <pause dur="0.3"/> of imperialism <pause dur="0.6"/> not just 
in terms of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries <pause dur="0.6"/> and as you will see <pause dur="0.3"/> not just in terms of the impact of Europe <pause dur="0.7"/> on the non-European world <pause dur="0.8"/> because what we are grappling with <pause dur="0.5"/> in the phenomenon of imperialism <pause dur="0.7"/> is a phenomenon that in various forms <pause dur="0.6"/> is as old as the formation of state systems <pause dur="0.4"/> by human beings <pause dur="0.5"/> so i'm going to # at considerable <pause dur="0.3"/><shift feature="voice" new="laugh"/> risk <pause dur="0.3"/> # to myself <shift feature="voice" new="normal"/><pause dur="0.3"/> try to set this phenomenon in a much wider <pause dur="0.5"/> # more global <pause dur="0.2"/> perspective <pause dur="0.5"/> i hope that might be of interest to many of you <pause dur="0.4"/> who have either been <pause dur="0.3"/> subjected to what you consider imperialism <pause dur="0.4"/> or indeed have been part of states and societies that have themselves <pause dur="0.4"/> been imperialistic <pause dur="0.4"/> or are still being so <pause dur="0.8"/> because whatever one says about <pause dur="0.5"/> the phase of European domination on a global scale <pause dur="0.6"/> which was such a feature <pause dur="0.5"/> of the <pause dur="0.2"/> late nineteenth <pause dur="0.3"/> and the <pause dur="0.3"/> first part of the twentieth century <pause dur="0.6"/> European colonial empires <pause dur="0.3"/> may come and go <pause dur="0.4"/> but the phenomenon <pause dur="0.2"/> of imperialism <pause dur="0.5"/> goes on <pause dur="0.5"/> and it goes on <pause dur="0.3"/> in different forms and in different 
places <pause dur="0.4"/> all the time <pause dur="0.9"/> so what i'm going to try to talk to you about is <pause dur="0.5"/> this subject of what is imperialism <pause dur="0.6"/> and what can we say <pause dur="0.4"/> about some of its <pause dur="0.3"/> actual <pause dur="0.2"/> # record <pause dur="0.6"/> in the past <pause dur="0.5"/> and the recent past </u><gap reason="break in recording" extent="uncertain"/> <u who="nm0078" trans="pause"> i think <pause dur="0.2"/> we have to begin <pause dur="1.3"/> by <pause dur="0.4"/> facing up to the fact that today <pause dur="0.5"/> we live in an age of anti-imperialism <pause dur="1.3"/> all over the world there is a reaction <pause dur="0.5"/> against the things which we associate <pause dur="0.4"/> with the <pause dur="0.2"/> phenomenon of imperialism <pause dur="1.1"/> the domination <pause dur="0.6"/> of weak countries <pause dur="0.5"/> or societies <pause dur="0.7"/> by the strong <pause dur="1.5"/> the economic exploitation <pause dur="0.4"/> of the natural resources <pause dur="0.4"/> of often poorer countries <pause dur="0.7"/> # in the world <pause dur="0.5"/> by the rich <pause dur="0.2"/> industrialized <pause dur="0.3"/> parts of the world <pause dur="1.4"/> the gross <pause dur="0.5"/> and in many parts of the world <pause dur="0.6"/> the widening gap <pause dur="0.6"/> in terms of the political <pause dur="0.6"/> military <pause dur="0.4"/> and economic power <pause dur="0.5"/> and standards of living <pause dur="0.9"/> between the rich <pause dur="0.5"/> and the poor countries <pause dur="1.9"/> the belief <pause dur="0.6"/> <trunc>i</trunc> <pause dur="0.3"/> in one society <pause dur="0.8"/> of the absolute superiority <pause dur="0.3"/> of its culture <pause dur="0.7"/> its values <pause dur="0.5"/> and its beliefs <pause dur="0.9"/> and the attempt to impose these <pause dur="0.3"/> upon the people of other cultures <pause dur="0.6"/> and often of 
different races <pause dur="1.3"/> today in Europe and America <pause dur="0.8"/> in the countries of the <pause dur="0.3"/> ex-Soviet Union <pause dur="0.7"/> and in Asia <pause dur="0.7"/> as well as in <pause dur="0.4"/> all those areas of the what used to be called <pause dur="0.4"/> the Third World <pause dur="0.7"/> which were until so recently <pause dur="0.5"/> under European influence <pause dur="0.4"/> or indeed <pause dur="0.3"/> colonial rule <pause dur="1.0"/> imperialism is regarded as a bad thing <pause dur="1.4"/> to call someone an imperialist <pause dur="0.7"/> is a term of abuse <pause dur="0.9"/> like calling them a racist <pause dur="0.9"/> or a fascist <pause dur="1.6"/> the very word imperialism i think you'll agree <pause dur="0.4"/> is loaded with emotional and ideological overtones <pause dur="1.6"/> if i <pause dur="0.2"/> say for instance that <pause dur="0.2"/> recently i have been studying and contributing to a new Oxford history of the British empire <pause dur="0.6"/> which i have <pause dur="1.1"/> that is a clear <pause dur="0.4"/> concrete and perfectly respectable <pause dur="0.2"/> historical subject <pause dur="0.5"/> to study <pause dur="0.5"/> it was indeed <pause dur="0.4"/> the most powerful and extensive empire <pause dur="0.4"/> in world history <pause dur="1.3"/> but if i say i'm studying and writing <pause dur="0.5"/> about the history of British imperialism <pause dur="0.8"/> that's already <pause dur="0.4"/> a somewhat different thing <pause dur="1.7"/> the kind of books that are written about it <pause dur="0.4"/> are different too <pause dur="1.4"/> the point i'm making is well 
illustrated <pause dur="0.4"/> if one looks up the word for one aspect of imperialism <pause dur="0.7"/> colonialism <pause dur="0.8"/> in two <pause dur="0.3"/> different <pause dur="0.2"/> dictionaries <pause dur="1.5"/> in Webster's American Dictionary <pause dur="0.8"/> colonialism <pause dur="0.5"/> is simply defined as <pause dur="1.1"/> <reading>the system in which <pause dur="0.2"/> a country maintains foreign colonies</reading> <pause dur="2.1"/> but if you take the <pause dur="0.4"/> dictionary produced in the Soviet Union of foreign <trunc>s</trunc> words and look up the word <pause dur="0.4"/> <distinct lang="ru">kolonizatsiya</distinct> <pause dur="1.0"/> you find it defined as <pause dur="0.7"/> <reading>the seizure of a country or region by imperialists <pause dur="0.3"/> accompanied by the subjection <pause dur="0.3"/> brutal exploitation <pause dur="0.3"/> and sometimes the annihilation <pause dur="0.3"/> of the local population</reading> <pause dur="1.6"/> you see what i mean about the ideological <pause dur="0.4"/> and emotional overtones that almost inevitably <pause dur="0.4"/> creep into discussions <pause dur="0.4"/> about the phenomenon <pause dur="0.3"/> we are addressing </u><gap reason="break in recording" extent="uncertain"/> <u who="nm0078" trans="pause"> now as a historian i believe that if history teaches us anything <pause dur="0.8"/> it should teach us to take the long term view <pause dur="0.9"/> of what happens <pause dur="0.8"/> and has happened <pause dur="0.6"/> in the past <pause dur="0.4"/> seeing ourselves in the long <pause dur="0.4"/> perspective of time <pause dur="1.0"/> and not just <pause dur="0.4"/> in terms of the 
present <pause dur="0.7"/> and its very particular attitudes <pause dur="0.4"/> values <pause dur="0.3"/> and preoccupations <pause dur="0.6"/> that i'd say is <pause dur="0.2"/> one of the <pause dur="0.2"/> key <pause dur="0.3"/> things that the study of history <pause dur="0.6"/> can give us <pause dur="1.5"/> and in any long view <pause dur="0.7"/> empires <pause dur="0.5"/> and what today we mean by imperialism <pause dur="1.4"/> are a perennial feature <pause dur="0.4"/> of history <pause dur="1.4"/> indeed until very recently <pause dur="1.2"/> until <pause dur="0.5"/> almost the twentieth century in fact <pause dur="0.9"/> that impulse to expansion <pause dur="0.2"/> by powerful states <pause dur="0.6"/> usually at the expense of the weak <pause dur="0.7"/> has been regarded not only as a part of the natural order of things <pause dur="0.9"/> but also as a force for good <pause dur="1.5"/> a movement which was bound up with the progress <pause dur="0.3"/> of the world <pause dur="0.4"/> as a whole <pause dur="1.1"/> and certainly <pause dur="0.4"/> of its more backward <pause dur="0.2"/> regions <pause dur="1.5"/> it's in this context that i think <pause dur="0.2"/> probably the history of the British empire will eventually in the long run <pause dur="0.5"/> come to be set <pause dur="0.5"/> in perspective <pause dur="1.1"/> after all <pause dur="0.5"/> that is certainly what has happened <pause dur="0.3"/> to the history of the ancient Roman empire <pause dur="1.1"/> it was the conquest <pause dur="0.4"/> colonization <pause dur="0.5"/> and incorporation into the Roman empire <pause dur="0.5"/> of the backward areas <pause dur="0.2"/> like the British Isles <pause dur="0.4"/> and France <pause dur="1.1"/> which 
first drew these areas into the mainstream of European history <pause dur="1.5"/> certainly <pause dur="0.6"/> in Europe as a whole <pause dur="0.2"/> it's a fact <pause dur="0.4"/> that after the collapse of the Roman empire <pause dur="0.5"/> in the fifth century <pause dur="0.4"/> A-D <pause dur="1.0"/> the memory of that empire <pause dur="0.2"/> haunted and encouraged <pause dur="0.4"/> the attempts of later generations <pause dur="0.4"/> to recreate it <pause dur="1.3"/> Charlemagne <pause dur="0.7"/> the Hohenstaufen kings of Germany <pause dur="0.6"/> the Habsburgs <pause dur="0.5"/> and the long history of the Holy Roman Empire <pause dur="0.2"/> as it was called <pause dur="0.4"/> right down to <pause dur="0.2"/> its disappearance in eighteen-o-six <pause dur="0.7"/> all these <pause dur="0.4"/> in one way or another <pause dur="0.6"/> drew some of their inspiration <pause dur="0.9"/> from the dignity <pause dur="0.7"/> glory <pause dur="0.6"/> grandeur and <pause dur="0.2"/> power <pause dur="0.7"/> associated with Rome <pause dur="1.6"/> the very term imperialism <pause dur="1.5"/> deriving as it does from the Latin word <pause dur="0.2"/> <distinct lang="la">imperator</distinct> <pause dur="0.9"/> has clearly <pause dur="0.3"/> Roman associations <pause dur="1.9"/> and if we look outside Europe <pause dur="0.5"/> as i think one should encourage <pause dur="0.2"/> everybody <pause dur="0.2"/> to do <pause dur="0.4"/> in terms of this term <pause dur="1.2"/> to the world at large <pause dur="0.7"/> then again we find that in the world at large empires <pause dur="0.3"/> and imperial systems <pause dur="0.4"/> are a perennial feature of history <pause dur="1.7"/> the Ming <pause dur="0.4"/> and Manchu empires in China <pause dur="0.9"/> from the 
fourteenth to the seventeenth centuries <pause dur="1.3"/> the Ottoman empire <pause dur="0.4"/> in the Middle East <pause dur="1.3"/> the Mogul empire <pause dur="0.2"/> in India <pause dur="1.4"/> the Aztec and Inca empires <pause dur="0.2"/> in Central and South America <pause dur="1.3"/> the Egyptian <pause dur="0.6"/> and Fulani <pause dur="0.5"/> and Zulu empires <pause dur="0.3"/> in Africa <pause dur="1.3"/> the Japanese empire <pause dur="0.8"/> in Korea <pause dur="0.6"/> Manchuria <pause dur="0.7"/> and China <pause dur="1.5"/> wherever we look <pause dur="0.5"/> it would seem <pause dur="0.2"/> that empires <pause dur="0.8"/> and what we today would regard as imperial situations <pause dur="0.6"/> are as old <pause dur="0.4"/> and continuous <pause dur="0.4"/> as the formation of state systems <pause dur="0.4"/> by humankind </u><gap reason="break in recording" extent="uncertain"/> <u who="nm0078" trans="pause"> the term <pause dur="0.2"/> imperialism is <pause dur="0.3"/> as i've said such a loose and loaded word <pause dur="0.3"/> today <pause dur="0.8"/> that in any discussion it's necessary to define <pause dur="0.2"/> what you mean <pause dur="1.8"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> in this <pause dur="1.0"/> terms <pause dur="0.5"/> by what one means quite carefully <pause dur="0.8"/> because one of the reasons <pause dur="0.4"/> why <pause dur="0.3"/> so many of the books about imperialism are so unsatisfactory <pause dur="0.8"/> is that different writers use the term <pause dur="0.3"/> to mean quite different things <pause dur="1.3"/> now since i'm painting with a very broad indeed a global brush <pause dur="0.4"/> this morning <pause dur="0.6"/> and i <pause dur="0.2"/> still stand by the point that the question of definitions 
is always important <pause dur="0.7"/> # let me suggest that there are broadly speaking two different meanings <pause dur="0.4"/> of the term imperialism <pause dur="1.6"/> firstly <pause dur="0.3"/> there is the meaning <pause dur="0.2"/> as i've already been using <pause dur="0.4"/> the term <pause dur="0.4"/> that is <pause dur="0.7"/> to mean any effective <pause dur="0.5"/> <sic corr="domination"> dominalation</sic> or <pause dur="0.3"/> relationship of control <pause dur="1.1"/> by one society <pause dur="0.4"/> over another <pause dur="1.4"/> that control <pause dur="0.5"/> need not be direct <pause dur="0.3"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> political <pause dur="1.1"/> or involve military conquest or rule <pause dur="1.1"/> that control can be indirect <pause dur="0.6"/> or informal <pause dur="0.8"/> between two independent countries <pause dur="1.0"/> and take any of the forms <pause dur="0.4"/> of economic <pause dur="0.5"/> military <pause dur="0.5"/> social <pause dur="0.5"/> or cultural <pause dur="0.4"/> domination <pause dur="0.7"/> rather than <pause dur="0.2"/> outright <pause dur="0.2"/> political rule <pause dur="2.0"/> now defined like that <pause dur="0.5"/> it's clear that imperialism is a perennial feature of history <pause dur="0.7"/> and is to be found in all periods <pause dur="0.3"/> and in very different parts <pause dur="0.4"/> of the world <pause dur="1.4"/> it's not making <pause dur="0.8"/> imperialism <pause dur="0.2"/> something peculiar <pause dur="0.4"/> to Europeans <pause dur="0.3"/> or Americans <pause dur="0.4"/> in the nineteenth <pause dur="0.3"/> and twentieth centuries </u><gap reason="break in recording" extent="uncertain"/> <u who="nm0078" trans="pause"> secondly <pause dur="1.0"/> there is the loosely Marxist definition <pause dur="0.6"/> given <pause dur="0.3"/> not by Karl Marx himself <pause dur="0.4"/> he never uses the term <pause dur="0.4"/> 
imperialism <pause dur="0.9"/> but by Lenin <pause dur="0.7"/> in his highly influential booklet <pause dur="0.5"/> Imperialism <pause dur="0.4"/> the Highest State of Capitalism <pause dur="0.4"/> published <pause dur="0.3"/> when Lenin seemed to be a no hope <pause dur="0.4"/> revolutionary in exile <pause dur="0.4"/> in nineteen-sixteen <pause dur="1.5"/> there Lenin defined imperialism in terms of a particular stage <pause dur="0.7"/> what he called <pause dur="0.4"/> the highest stage <pause dur="0.4"/> in the development of capitalism <pause dur="1.8"/> this is a much narrower definition <pause dur="0.3"/> of imperialism <pause dur="0.5"/> than my first one <pause dur="1.1"/> but it has been extraordinarily influential <pause dur="1.4"/> i find amongst <pause dur="0.3"/> African students in African universities <pause dur="0.4"/> what mine one might loosely call the Leninist definition of imperialism is simply taken <pause dur="0.4"/> for granted <pause dur="2.5"/> defined in Leninist terms <pause dur="0.2"/> imperialism becomes a function <pause dur="0.9"/> an inevitable result in his view <pause dur="0.9"/> of the economic history <pause dur="0.2"/> of certain <pause dur="0.9"/> mainly western <pause dur="0.6"/> societies <pause dur="1.3"/> in terms of this definition imperialism didn't appear anywhere in the world <pause dur="0.6"/> until the late nineteenth century <pause dur="0.9"/> and in the twentieth century its main focus <pause dur="0.3"/> has moved <pause dur="0.2"/> from Europe <pause dur="0.5"/> to the United States <pause dur="0.5"/> but also to include 
Japan </u><gap reason="break in recording" extent="uncertain"/> <u who="nm0078" trans="pause"> the trouble with this definition of imperialism <pause dur="0.3"/> is that even within the narrow restrictions <pause dur="0.3"/> of nineteenth of twentieth century history <pause dur="0.7"/> it raises very awkward questions <pause dur="1.7"/> i can only <pause dur="0.3"/> pause to <pause dur="0.7"/> raise a few of these awkward questions here but you can perhaps <pause dur="0.3"/> think about <pause dur="0.2"/> some others yourself <pause dur="1.2"/> firstly <pause dur="0.4"/> if you've got # # a definition of imperialism that equates it as a certain stage <pause dur="0.4"/> an inevitable stage in Lenin's view <pause dur="0.4"/> in the development of capitalism <pause dur="0.7"/> can <pause dur="0.2"/> supposedly non-capitalist economies <pause dur="0.4"/> and societies <pause dur="0.4"/> be imperialistic <pause dur="1.4"/> how else would we describe <pause dur="0.5"/> the <pause dur="0.3"/> activities of the ex-Soviet Union <pause dur="0.7"/> or <pause dur="0.4"/> some would say <pause dur="0.2"/> to this day <pause dur="0.5"/> of China <pause dur="1.9"/> but how else would we describe <pause dur="0.3"/> many other societies which have <pause dur="0.2"/> <trunc>ex</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> exhibited <pause dur="0.5"/> that tendency to <pause dur="0.3"/> expansionism <pause dur="0.6"/> and domination of weaker <pause dur="0.5"/> smaller <pause dur="0.4"/> societies or states <pause dur="0.3"/> that i've mentioned <pause dur="1.2"/> if <pause dur="0.2"/> one can think of cases of American <pause dur="0.3"/> imperialism which fit that bill <pause dur="0.8"/> what about the relationship <pause dur="0.4"/> of <pause dur="0.5"/> the # of <pause dur="0.3"/> the Soviet Union <pause dur="0.4"/> with the <pause dur="0.2"/> states of eastern 
Europe <pause dur="0.4"/> in the <pause dur="0.2"/> half-century or so <pause dur="0.3"/> after the Second World War <pause dur="0.7"/> or about the relationship to be provocative <pause dur="0.5"/> between China and Tibet <pause dur="0.4"/> to this day <pause dur="1.8"/> so there's that first objection can so-called non-capitalist societies be imperialistic <pause dur="0.6"/> the answer seems to be yes <pause dur="1.6"/> secondly why is it that only some capitalist societies <pause dur="0.3"/> become imperialistic <pause dur="0.9"/> Portugal for instance <pause dur="0.5"/> one of the <pause dur="0.2"/> least developed <pause dur="0.3"/> capitalist <pause dur="0.3"/> societies <pause dur="0.3"/> in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries had a large <pause dur="0.2"/> colonial empire and was one of the last <pause dur="0.5"/> # European <pause dur="0.3"/> colonial powers to decolonize <pause dur="1.7"/> Switzerland <pause dur="0.6"/> far more developed capitalist society <pause dur="1.4"/> Belgium <pause dur="0.4"/> with its huge colony <pause dur="0.4"/> in the Congo <pause dur="1.3"/> but not Denmark <pause dur="0.6"/> again <pause dur="0.2"/> a small but <pause dur="0.4"/> highly developed highly capitalist <pause dur="0.3"/> society <pause dur="1.5"/> so # <pause dur="0.8"/> if <pause dur="0.5"/> imperialism is a stage an inevitable stage in the development of capitalism why is it that only certain states <pause dur="0.4"/> seem to <pause dur="0.3"/> # become imperialistic or <pause dur="0.2"/> more so than others and why is it that many states which are <pause dur="0.3"/> or societies which
