the later chapters are going to be <pause dur="1.6"/> what i'm going to do for these chapters <pause dur="0.2"/> three four five and six <pause dur="0.9"/> is to distribute to you <pause dur="0.2"/> notes <pause dur="0.2"/> quite specific notes on the content of those chapters <pause dur="0.5"/> and then in the lectures what i want to do is to try and get over to you what the point of the chapter is <pause dur="0.7"/> so there's going to be kind of more detailed summation in the handouts than there actually is <pause dur="0.5"/> # in the lecture <pause dur="0.2"/> so you'll need the handouts to fill out some of the <pause dur="0.2"/> <trunc>s</trunc> points the handouts form a kind of commentary on the text <pause dur="0.8"/> # whereas the lectures are going to try and <pause dur="0.2"/> get what the main point of it all is of each of those chapters <pause dur="0.2"/> okay <pause dur="0.3"/> so what i'm going to do now is to hand out <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> the <pause dur="0.2"/> notes on chapter three <pause dur="0.4"/> and tomorrow i'll hand out notes on chapter four next Wednesday on chapter five <pause dur="0.5"/> next Thursday on chapter six <pause dur="2.5"/> again just to repeat as always if there are previous handouts that you need <pause dur="0.5"/> then you can obtain those from the <pause dur="0.7"/> Philosophy department office <pause dur="22.5"/> okay <pause dur="4.0"/> you'll recall that <pause dur="0.2"/> Searle <pause dur="0.4"/><vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/><pause dur="1.3"/> 
says that there are two <pause dur="0.2"/> claims which are typical of <pause dur="0.2"/> strong A-I strong artificial intelligence <pause dur="1.5"/> one of those claims <pause dur="0.2"/> is that <pause dur="0.2"/> computers put very <pause dur="0.2"/> very briefly that computers can think <pause dur="0.4"/> or that <pause dur="0.7"/> put it slightly less briefly <pause dur="0.2"/> a suitably programmed <pause dur="0.3"/> digital computer may at some time <pause dur="0.8"/> at in the future <pause dur="0.3"/> be said to be able to think <pause dur="1.4"/> there are of course people in A-I who think <pause dur="0.6"/> that the very strongest claim is true that computers already can think <pause dur="0.6"/> an example of such a person is the Professor of Cybernetics at this university Kevin Warwick <pause dur="0.8"/> who holds <pause dur="0.2"/> rather a controversial opinion and one of those is that already you can say that computers can think <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="1.5"/> the other claim <pause dur="0.2"/> second claim <pause dur="0.9"/> okay first claim <pause dur="0.2"/> computers can think <pause dur="0.4"/> the second claim is <pause dur="0.8"/> that <pause dur="1.7"/> a digital computer <pause dur="0.2"/> provides the suitable model <pause dur="0.4"/> for thinking about the human brain <pause dur="0.6"/> or put it more briefly <pause dur="0.2"/> the human brain is like a digital computer <pause dur="0.7"/> okay that's the second claim <pause dur="0.5"/> that second claim <pause dur="0.6"/> that a human brain is like a 
digital computer <pause dur="0.4"/> is <pause dur="0.2"/> the claim which is discussed in chapter three <pause dur="0.4"/> on cognitive science <pause dur="1.0"/> okay <pause dur="1.1"/><vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/><pause dur="3.4"/> Searle starts off by observing <pause dur="0.6"/> that <pause dur="1.0"/> we seem to have available to us two different ways of being able to explain human behaviour <pause dur="1.4"/> the first way of explaining human behaviour was the sort of <pause dur="0.2"/> way of explaining human behaviour that i was talking about last week <pause dur="0.5"/> when i said that as far as human beings are concerned <pause dur="0.4"/> we can explain human behaviour in terms of <pause dur="0.4"/> the purposes the ambitions the drives the wishes <pause dur="0.4"/> that people have <pause dur="0.5"/> those provide a sort of general background which makes it sensible to say <pause dur="0.8"/> # why somebody is doing something <pause dur="0.4"/> why is somebody doing something somebody somebody who's doing something absolutely bizarre <pause dur="0.7"/> you know they're standing on one leg like this and you see them <unclear>and say</unclear> why are they doing that <pause dur="0.7"/> and you say oh well <pause dur="0.2"/> one thing <pause dur="0.4"/> might <pause dur="0.5"/> you know they're being a <pause dur="0.2"/> street performer of some sort <pause dur="0.9"/> okay <pause dur="1.3"/> so that will be one way of explaining human behaviour <pause dur="1.6"/> now 
there's another way of explaining human behaviour which might be open to us <pause dur="0.4"/> and that is a scientific explanation of human behaviour <pause dur="0.2"/> and in particular <pause dur="0.5"/> as it's a scientific explanation of human behaviour i mean <pause dur="0.2"/> science can explain all sorts of things # it can explain chemical reactions it can explain <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> you know the # <pause dur="0.5"/> way one billiard ball hits another billiard ball with mechanics and physics and so on <pause dur="0.4"/> but if we're explaining human behaviour there might be a sort of scientific explanation <pause dur="0.3"/> which addresses itself to explaining human behaviour <pause dur="0.4"/> why is somebody doing that <pause dur="0.2"/> well we produce an explanation in terms of science <pause dur="0.4"/> and that might be in terms of for example neurophysiology <pause dur="0.4"/> in terms of what's going on in a person's brain <pause dur="1.4"/> well the first sort of explanation by and large is concerned with <pause dur="0.7"/> explaining what's in the person's mind what their motive what their intention <pause dur="0.3"/> what their desires wishes purposes are <pause dur="0.2"/> the second sort of explanation <pause dur="0.2"/> in terms of 
what's going on in their brain in the <pause dur="0.2"/> in the stuff in here <pause dur="0.4"/> in terms of their neurophysiology <pause dur="2.1"/> that first <pause dur="0.2"/> common thing for psychology the sort of explanation that we deploy all the time in everyday life in talking about other people <pause dur="0.5"/> is often talked about in the literature the literature of <pause dur="0.5"/> # psychology the literature of philosophy the literature of popular science is often referred to as folk psychology <pause dur="0.5"/> and what all the folk psychology <pause dur="0.2"/> come across it says <pause dur="0.3"/> all that folk psychology means is simply common sense approach <pause dur="0.4"/> okay <pause dur="1.5"/> now there's a problem <pause dur="0.9"/> Searle says i've taken his <pause dur="0.9"/> statement of the problem from page twenty-two of the book <pause dur="1.2"/> the problem is there's a sort of gap <pause dur="0.2"/> between these two sorts of explanation <pause dur="1.6"/> he says the first of these sorts of explanation works well enough in practice <pause dur="0.6"/> we explain other people's behaviour in terms of their desires their motivations their wishes their intentions and that seems to work in a certain sort of way <pause dur="0.7"/> 
but it isn't scientific <pause dur="1.4"/> and the second sort of explanation is certainly scientific <pause dur="0.6"/> but we've no idea how to make it work in practice <pause dur="0.6"/> in other words if you do see somebody standing on a leg like this <pause dur="0.4"/> and you say why are they doing that <pause dur="0.4"/> then <pause dur="0.2"/> it's actually <pause dur="0.3"/> very very difficult to produce a <trunc>neuroph</trunc> neurophysiological explanation which satisfactorily explains <pause dur="0.4"/> why they're doing that <pause dur="1.5"/> and Searle says <pause dur="0.5"/> we've got no idea how to bring together these two sorts of explanations integrate them <pause dur="2.0"/> we've no idea how to integrate or unify common sense <pause dur="0.2"/> explanations with neuroscientific ones <pause dur="0.3"/> he says just to <trunc>con</trunc> <pause dur="0.3"/> continue that <pause dur="0.5"/> quotation at the bottom of the slide <pause dur="1.6"/> since we've no idea how to <pause dur="0.2"/> integrate <pause dur="0.9"/> or unify common sense explanations with the explanations of science pure scientific ones <pause dur="0.3"/> we are tempted to think that there's a gap <pause dur="0.4"/> between <pause dur="0.2"/> the mind and the brain <pause dur="0.5"/> now chapter three <pause dur="0.2"/> is concerned with attempts that people have made <pause dur="0.3"/> to fill this gap <pause dur="0.4"/> the gap between common sense 
explanations and scientific explanations <pause dur="0.9"/> okay <pause dur="2.4"/> this <pause dur="0.2"/> appearance of a gap <pause dur="0.2"/> has led philosophers and others and psychologists and a whole series of # <trunc>o</trunc> other sorts of scientists <pause dur="0.5"/> into thinking that the gap needs filling <pause dur="0.2"/> and that what we need when you fill a gap <pause dur="0.2"/> you use an intermediate level explanation <pause dur="0.6"/> you fill the gap by producing another level of explanation <pause dur="0.2"/> intermediate between common sense psychology and neuroscience <pause dur="1.5"/> an explanation which will <pause dur="0.3"/> explain how common sense psychological phenomena <pause dur="0.4"/> derive from goings on <pause dur="0.2"/> in the central <pause dur="0.2"/> nervous <pause dur="0.2"/> system <pause dur="0.9"/> 
okay <pause dur="1.4"/><vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/><pause dur="2.3"/> and <pause dur="0.3"/> he he says in a <pause dur="1.0"/> another place not in Minds Brains and Science but in a review he wrote <pause dur="0.5"/> he talked about filling this gap and he says <reading>couldn't there be <pause dur="0.7"/> a third possibility <pause dur="0.2"/> between common sense psychology and neuroscience <pause dur="0.4"/> a science of human beings that was not introspective common sense psychology <pause dur="0.4"/> but was not neurophysiology either <pause dur="0.8"/> this has been the great dream of the human sciences <pause dur="0.4"/> in the twentieth 
century</reading> <pause dur="0.9"/> okay <pause dur="1.6"/> that's <pause dur="1.7"/> the background <pause dur="6.6"/> now <pause dur="2.1"/> Searle says that in the twentieth century <pause dur="0.6"/> there's been a whole series of attempts to try and <pause dur="0.2"/> fill <pause dur="0.3"/> the gap <pause dur="1.6"/> and <pause dur="0.9"/> he says <pause dur="0.3"/> look all of these <pause dur="0.3"/> attempts have been failures none of them have satisfactorily managed to fill the gap <pause dur="0.7"/> and he surveys what some of these attempts <pause dur="0.2"/> have been <pause dur="0.8"/> and we can just look <pause dur="0.5"/> briefly at <pause dur="1.1"/> some of those <pause dur="0.2"/><vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/><pause dur="1.3"/> previous gap-filling efforts <pause dur="0.5"/> for example behaviourism <pause dur="1.0"/> behaviourism a highly influential psychological theory particularly just post-Second World War <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> surrounding in particular one <pause dur="0.6"/> figure <pause dur="0.2"/> B F Skinner <pause dur="0.5"/> and Skinner's <pause dur="0.7"/> behaviourist psychology <pause dur="0.7"/> was <pause dur="0.2"/> extremely influential as a <pause dur="0.3"/> way of trying to explain human behaviour <pause dur="2.8"/> then there was <pause dur="0.2"/> Gagne's theory <pause dur="0.4"/> again very influential <pause dur="0.2"/> actually in the fifties and sixties <pause dur="1.2"/> # cybernetics <pause dur="0.5"/> became extremely influential from about the fifties and sixties onwards <pause dur="0.6"/> through the works of people like Stafford Beer <pause dur="0.2"/> and others <pause dur="0.9"/> information theory <pause dur="0.2"/> highly influential particularly as 
computer science developed <pause dur="0.9"/> structuralism <pause dur="0.4"/> became extremely influential through work in <pause dur="0.4"/> in linguistics <pause dur="1.5"/> and <vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.7"/> more recently <pause dur="0.5"/> we've seen sociobiology <pause dur="0.2"/> and a part of sociobiology evolutionary biology <pause dur="0.3"/> the work of people like Richard Dawkins say in particular The Selfish Gene and other books like that <pause dur="0.6"/> attempts to try and produce explanations of human behaviour <pause dur="0.3"/> which in some way or other fill the gap <pause dur="0.5"/> between the everyday explanations and <pause dur="0.5"/> the more <pause dur="0.2"/> as it were basic level biochemical neurophysiological explanations <pause dur="1.5"/> Searle claims that all of these attempts have failed <pause dur="0.2"/> which of course is a bold a bold claim <pause dur="0.6"/> since <pause dur="0.4"/> although some of them seem to have withered and died many of them still live in one form or another and there are plenty of people who still <pause dur="0.7"/> stake their reputation in one way or another on some of these theories <pause dur="4.0"/> now i # observe what is the on the rest of this slide is something which isn't in # <pause dur="1.0"/><vocal desc="cough" iterated="n"/> it isn't in Searle's 
chapter but i'm just observing something about these sorts of modes of explanation <pause dur="0.9"/> very often when people try to produce large scale explanations of human behaviour <pause dur="0.2"/> large scale theories of which all of these are examples <pause dur="0.6"/> which large scale explanations of human behaviour are often based on some sort of <pause dur="0.5"/> reductionist idea <pause dur="1.1"/> a reductionist view of human behaviour <pause dur="1.2"/> and what i mean by a reductionist view of human behaviour <pause dur="0.8"/> is trying to explain <pause dur="0.2"/> all human behaviour <pause dur="0.9"/> by means of a single explanation <pause dur="0.9"/> a single motive <pause dur="0.6"/> a single explanation <pause dur="1.6"/> and i'll <trunc>ju</trunc> just two examples so that you have in mind the sort of thing that i'm getting at here <pause dur="0.6"/> Thomas Hobbes the <pause dur="0.3"/> extremely influential English moral and political philosopher <pause dur="0.6"/> who wrote the great <pause dur="0.3"/> book The Leviathan <pause dur="1.4"/> most famous i suppose for saying that <pause dur="0.2"/> if there were no human society <pause dur="0.6"/> then human life would be solitary poor nasty brutish and short <pause dur="0.6"/> his most famous sentence <pause dur="1.3"/> his view was that all human behaviour <pause dur="0.4"/> every act of every human being was 
selfish <pause dur="0.5"/> okay <pause dur="0.8"/> okay <pause dur="0.3"/> the whole explanation of human behaviour <pause dur="0.3"/> was that it was selfish every single human act of every single human being <pause dur="0.2"/> was selfish <pause dur="0.7"/> and so you've got one explanation <pause dur="0.2"/> for all human behaviour <pause dur="1.3"/> okay <pause dur="1.5"/> another example would be a slightly simplified version <pause dur="0.3"/> of <pause dur="0.4"/> early Freud <pause dur="0.2"/> not necessarily later Freud <pause dur="0.2"/> but early Freud <pause dur="0.4"/> where we might say that all human action is motivated by sexual desire <pause dur="0.7"/> later Freud brought in a number of other possible <pause dur="0.2"/> principles as well but we might <pause dur="0.2"/> produce that as a kind of slightly caricatured version of what Freud said <pause dur="2.1"/> now such explanations have a greater appeal because they are so <pause dur="0.3"/> there are two reasons why they have great appeal one is that they provide an enormously strict explanation for everything <pause dur="0.7"/> one motives <pause dur="0.2"/> <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> <pause dur="0.3"/> great simplicity of explanation <pause dur="0.9"/> and secondly they're very appealing because they kind of <pause dur="0.9"/> if we might put it <pause dur="0.2"/> deflate the pompous <pause dur="1.0"/> you know <pause dur="0.7"/> to say that all human actions are selfish <pause dur="0.4"/> is in one way appealing <pause dur="0.6"/> 
because it enables us to think in some way or other <pause dur="0.3"/> that even the most saintly person <pause dur="0.4"/> is motivated by the same base <pause dur="0.4"/> motivation <pause dur="0.3"/> as <pause dur="0.2"/> we are <pause dur="0.7"/> and deflates the pompous <pause dur="0.2"/> or <pause dur="0.3"/> in the case of Freud <pause dur="0.4"/> it's attractive because <pause dur="0.2"/> you know <pause dur="0.3"/> even the most puritanical uptight person is being motivated by sexual desire <pause dur="0.2"/> and that kind of tactic is a <pause dur="0.5"/> you know kind of <pause dur="0.2"/> deflates them in some way or other <pause dur="0.6"/> so there's a great appeal <pause dur="0.4"/> because of the simplicity of explanation <pause dur="1.5"/> but at the same time of course if you hold such a theory a reductionist view of human behaviour in which all human behaviour is explained by <pause dur="0.2"/> just one motive <pause dur="0.4"/> you've got work to do <pause dur="0.8"/> because you've got to explain how it is <pause dur="0.4"/> that the most saintly action is really selfish <pause dur="0.5"/> or <pause dur="0.2"/> that the most puritanical person is really motivated by sexual desire <pause dur="0.8"/> you've got to explain away all the apparent <pause dur="0.2"/> counter-examples to your theory <pause dur="1.1"/> and so what such <pause dur="0.2"/> reductionist accounts will do <pause dur="0.8"/> will be to produce an enormously elaborate <pause dur="0.2"/> structure of human 
behaviour <pause dur="0.4"/> an enormously elaborate account <pause dur="0.4"/> in which there will be for example in Freud <pause dur="0.2"/> repression the ego the id the conscious mind the unconscious mind drives and so on <pause dur="0.2"/> a whole enormous kind of hydraulic scheme <pause dur="0.4"/> <unclear>representing</unclear> his world <pause dur="0.3"/> in order to be to be able to explain why it is that every single action <pause dur="0.6"/> # is motivated by sexual desire <pause dur="1.5"/> so combined with great simplicity of explanation <pause dur="0.3"/> is a hugely elaborate structure of human behaviour <pause dur="0.8"/> but that's appealing too <pause dur="0.7"/> because although the simplicity of explanation appeals to us <pause dur="0.4"/> we also want to think that human beings are <pause dur="0.5"/> mysterious and deep and complicated <pause dur="0.6"/> # the <pause dur="0.5"/> complicated explanation which is necessary for Hobbes or Freud to produce <pause dur="0.4"/> again appeals to us <pause dur="0.3"/> so these reductionist accounts <pause dur="0.2"/> appeal for two quite contradictory reasons <pause dur="0.6"/> one is they appeal because of the simplicity of explanation <pause dur="0.5"/> and the other is they appeal because of the complexity of theory which goes with it <pause dur="0.5"/> so it provides us with 
two things both of which you want to like <pause dur="0.5"/> simplicity and complexity <pause dur="1.1"/> okay <pause dur="1.7"/><vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/><pause dur="5.1"/> <trunc>th</trunc> okay i'm sorry that the <trunc>quota</trunc> the what i've said at the bottom there is just cut off a bit what i what i was saying there <pause dur="0.6"/> is to <trunc>a</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> to attempt to produce a simple explanation of human behaviour <pause dur="0.3"/> will actually involve a highly elaborate theory <pause dur="0.4"/> for which there will be <pause dur="0.4"/> frequently no empirical evidence <pause dur="0.5"/> # to explain <pause dur="0.2"/> apparent <pause dur="0.5"/> counter-examples in other words the rest of that sentence was just what i've been saying to you <pause dur="0.2"/> okay <pause dur="1.2"/><vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/><pause dur="6.8"/> now <pause dur="2.5"/> previous attempts <pause dur="0.2"/> having failed <pause dur="0.7"/> there's <pause dur="0.3"/> a new attempt in town <pause dur="0.3"/> Searle says <pause dur="0.6"/> and a new attempt to fill the gap <pause dur="0.2"/> is <pause dur="0.2"/> cognitivism <pause dur="0.8"/> and it's cognitivism which is then Searle's main <pause dur="0.3"/> target <pause dur="0.2"/> in this chapter <pause dur="0.7"/> so what is cognitivism <pause dur="1.2"/> well cognitivism and cognitive science are terms which have been <pause dur="0.2"/> used in the last thirty years or so <pause dur="0.4"/> to cover a wide variety of different <pause dur="1.0"/> areas and disciplines in philosophy of mind in <pause dur="0.4"/> linguistics in psychology in 
computer science cybernetics and in <pause dur="0.3"/> strong artificial intelligence and so on <pause dur="0.5"/> these are the term cognitivism cognitive science those terms <pause dur="0.4"/> have been used quite widely <pause dur="0.7"/> so what does Searle mean <pause dur="0.3"/> by <pause dur="0.5"/> cognitivism <pause dur="1.1"/><vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/><pause dur="3.5"/> basically <pause dur="1.1"/> the view <pause dur="0.8"/> is <pause dur="1.0"/> as i said at the beginning of the lecture <pause dur="0.6"/> the view of cognitivism <pause dur="0.2"/> that he's concerned with <pause dur="0.3"/> is that the mind ought to be thought of <pause dur="0.6"/> on the model <pause dur="0.2"/> of a computer <pause dur="0.6"/> that's the theory which <pause dur="0.7"/> he thinks is the essence of cognitivism <pause dur="0.4"/> and which is his target of attack <pause dur="1.0"/> because that view <pause dur="0.4"/> like the previous <pause dur="0.4"/> gap-filling <pause dur="0.3"/> theories <pause dur="0.4"/> is one <pause dur="0.3"/> which Searle thinks is wrong <pause dur="0.8"/> so <pause dur="0.5"/> first important point is that Searle is going to be attacking cognitivism <pause dur="0.9"/> so in red there is a summary from page forty-three of the book of what Searle thinks cognitivism is <pause dur="0.4"/> but remember this is a theory which he's going to be attacking <pause dur="0.6"/> so what it says in red is a quotation from Searle <pause dur="0.2"/> but it's the theory which is his <unclear>target</unclear> <pause dur="0.4"/> which he's going to attack <pause dur="0.8"/> okay <pause dur="0.6"/> please remember that this is 
the direct quotation from Searle <pause dur="0.5"/> these are not thoughts to be attributed to him <pause dur="0.4"/> these are thoughts he's going to attack <pause dur="0.5"/> okay <pause dur="1.0"/> so <pause dur="1.5"/> what he's going to attack is the idea that thinking <pause dur="0.3"/> is <pause dur="0.2"/> processing information <pause dur="1.2"/> but information processing is just <pause dur="0.3"/> symbol manipulation <pause dur="1.4"/> remember in the Chinese room example <pause dur="0.6"/> Searle wants to draw a very <pause dur="0.2"/> strong distinction <pause dur="0.5"/> between mere symbol manipulation <pause dur="0.4"/> which is what the computer does although man in the Chinese room who doesn't understand Chinese <pause dur="0.2"/> does <pause dur="0.5"/> from <pause dur="0.7"/> real <pause dur="0.2"/> thinking <pause dur="0.5"/> okay <pause dur="1.5"/> 
so <pause dur="0.2"/> again thinking is processing information but information processing is just symbol manipulation <pause dur="0.2"/> computers do symbol <trunc>manipu</trunc> manipulation <pause dur="0.6"/> so the best way to study thinking <pause dur="0.7"/> or cognition <pause dur="0.4"/> is to study computational symbol manipulation <pause dur="0.2"/> programs <pause dur="0.3"/> symbol manipulating programs <pause dur="0.4"/> whether they're in computers or in the brains <pause dur="0.6"/> on this view the view he's attacking <pause dur="0.6"/> the task of cognitive science is to characterize the brain <pause dur="0.5"/> not at the level of nerve cells the 
neurophysiological level <pause dur="0.7"/> nor at the level of conscious mental states <pause dur="0.2"/> the common sense psychology level <pause dur="0.6"/> but rather at the level of its functioning <pause dur="0.3"/> a sort of information processing system <pause dur="0.5"/> and that's where the gap gets filled <pause dur="1.0"/> it's alleged <pause dur="0.4"/> Searle disagrees with that <pause dur="0.3"/> <unclear>doesn't mean that he does agree with that</unclear> <pause dur="0.4"/> okay <pause dur="1.4"/> so the cognitivist's <pause dur="0.2"/> big idea <pause dur="1.1"/> is that we can fill the gap <pause dur="0.3"/> between the mind and the brain <pause dur="0.4"/> by focusing on an intermediate level <pause dur="0.8"/> the level of information processing <pause dur="1.1"/><vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/></u><pause dur="57.8"/> <u who="nm0140" trans="pause"> i was just searching for a <pause dur="0.9"/> actually was round here for a minute or two <pause dur="0.4"/> i was just searching for a a <gap reason="inaudible due to background noise" extent="1 sec"/> <unclear>after slide</unclear> which i couldn't find <pause dur="0.8"/><vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.9"/> what i wanted to say was this that <pause dur="4.9"/> throughout history <pause dur="1.3"/> human beings have tried to <pause dur="1.4"/> understand what goes on <pause dur="0.4"/> in the human brain in the mind <pause dur="0.9"/> by means of various different models or analogies <pause dur="0.3"/> i mean Searle discusses this is in the chapter <pause dur="2.6"/> and it's interesting to look at what <pause dur="0.5"/> some of those previous models or analogies have been <pause dur="1.8"/> # for instance the <pause dur="0.3"/> the Greeks <pause dur="0.9"/> compared 
the human mind to <pause dur="0.2"/> a catapult <pause dur="1.8"/> which sounds to the class to be rather <pause dur="0.7"/> odd <pause dur="1.4"/> it's interesting that <pause dur="0.8"/> that in different societies at different times the model which has been used to try and explain the workings of the human mind or human brain <pause dur="0.4"/> has often been to do with the lastest technology available <pause dur="0.6"/> and of course the catapults had formed a part of <pause dur="0.2"/> military technology for the Greeks <pause dur="1.4"/> later <pause dur="0.2"/> Leibniz the great <pause dur="0.4"/> German philosopher <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> whom Searle quotes from talks about a bit later in the chapter as well <pause dur="0.6"/> saw the human mind as being like a mill <pause dur="0.5"/> you know a flour mill <pause dur="0.2"/> grinding <pause dur="0.4"/> separating the wheat from the chaff making flour <pause dur="0.8"/> and again that's a kind of technological <pause dur="0.6"/> analogy <pause dur="1.3"/> model of the human mind <pause dur="1.6"/> later in the # nineteenth century <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> people compared this <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/><pause dur="0.4"/> compared the human mind to the telegraph system <pause dur="0.6"/> remember that the the telegraph system was developed in the <pause dur="0.4"/> early to mid-<pause dur="0.4"/>nineteenth century <pause dur="0.2"/> it's quite an early piece a quite remarkable piece of technology <pause dur="1.2"/> # 
the telegraph which predated <pause dur="0.2"/> the telephone <pause dur="0.6"/> enabled people to communicate with each other over long distances <pause dur="0.3"/> got the first telegraph cable between England and America was for example the <pause dur="0.3"/> <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> first telephone cable <pause dur="1.0"/> and # <pause dur="0.2"/> do any of you know the book about the telegraph system which <pause dur="0.2"/> calls it the Victorian internet system <pause dur="0.3"/> <unclear>no</unclear> any of you read that book <pause dur="0.5"/> it's a it's a really extraordinary book published about two or three years ago <pause dur="0.2"/> about the early development of the <pause dur="0.5"/> of the telegraph <pause dur="0.2"/> and there are extraordinary comparisons between <pause dur="0.2"/> the mid-nineteenth century telegraph system and the Internet <pause dur="0.6"/> people had their own private accounts people communicated with each other privately <pause dur="0.2"/> over the telegraph people used various sorts of abbreviation and code and <pause dur="0.5"/> there were worries about you know pornography on the telegraph <vocal desc="laughter" n="ss" iterated="y" dur="2"/> things like that extraordinary set of <pause dur="0.7"/> # comparisons between the <pause dur="0.5"/> you know late twentieth century internet and the <pause dur="0.3"/> 
mid-<pause dur="0.5"/>nineteenth century telegraph system <pause dur="0.8"/> actually you might just see that book in <pause dur="0.3"/> the science areas of libraries or book shops you might look at it <pause dur="0.3"/> can't remember the exact title but it's <pause dur="0.6"/> i think in the title there's some reference to the Victorian internet system <pause dur="0.3"/> okay <pause dur="2.1"/> # then later <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> for instance in my childhood a very common analogy <pause dur="0.2"/> for the human brain <pause dur="0.4"/> was <pause dur="0.4"/> the telephone system <pause dur="0.3"/> and that's to say the old-fashioned telephone system not a modern telephone system <pause dur="0.3"/> but the old-fashioned telephone system where you have an operator <pause dur="0.2"/> sitting <pause dur="0.3"/> you know at a board <pause dur="0.2"/> you know saying oh hello Mrs Baker you want to be put through to Mrs Jones okay <pause dur="1.6"/> and that kind of idea you know <pause dur="0.2"/> pulling out plugs and then pulling in putting in plugs <pause dur="0.3"/> was used for a long time as an analogy for what goes on <pause dur="0.4"/> in the brain <pause dur="1.4"/> for <pause dur="0.2"/> Freud <pause dur="0.5"/> as i already <pause dur="0.2"/> partly indicated as a kind of analogy to what goes on in the brain as a kind of hydraulic system <pause dur="0.7"/> Freud in a way thought of the human brain # brain as being a 
vast system of <pause dur="0.3"/> pipes that were connected together through which fluids <pause dur="0.3"/> pass <pause dur="0.5"/> and if you push the fluid from one part to <trunc>a</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> another it would come to erupt somewhere else <pause dur="1.0"/> and # <pause dur="0.2"/> he also Freud sometimes used a kind of electromagnetic <pause dur="0.3"/> # analogy for the human brain <pause dur="0.6"/> and now there's the idea of the digital <pause dur="0.3"/> computer <pause dur="0.9"/> as the model for the human brain <pause dur="0.6"/> so <pause dur="0.5"/> what i'm pointing out is there's been a constant series of attempts to try to explain what goes on in the human brain <pause dur="0.3"/> by means of invoking the lastest bit of technology <pause dur="2.2"/><vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/><pause dur="2.4"/> now there are all sorts of reasons why people have found cognitivism attractive <pause dur="0.6"/> and Searle lists these in the chapter <pause dur="0.2"/> and in the notes that i've handed out i've gone through <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> some of the reasons why cognitivism might be thought to be attractive <pause dur="0.4"/> i'm not going to go through <pause dur="0.3"/> those <pause dur="0.4"/> now <pause dur="0.2"/> you can read those in the book itself <pause dur="0.4"/> you can read the sort of summary the comment that i've made about those <pause dur="0.4"/> reasons why <trunc>con</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> cognitivism might be 
thought attractive <pause dur="0.4"/> # in the handout there are various sorts of pieces of psychological evidence <pause dur="0.3"/> which might be thought to support the idea that the human brain is information processing <pause dur="2.6"/> what i want to do <pause dur="0.7"/> is to as it were <pause dur="0.7"/> get to the very <pause dur="0.2"/> nub of the matter <pause dur="0.5"/> and to consider <pause dur="0.2"/> the sort of claim that cognitivism makes and the reason why Searle thinks it to be <pause dur="0.3"/> wrong <pause dur="1.7"/> okay <pause dur="9.1"/> here's one example <pause dur="2.7"/> i saw a programme on # television a few years ago <pause dur="0.5"/> now <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="1.6"/> it was a a science <pause dur="0.2"/> in one of a science series called Big Science <pause dur="1.6"/> on B-B-C-two <pause dur="0.6"/> in the early evening it was one of those <pause dur="0.2"/> one of those television programmes where they thought it necessary in order to present science to <pause dur="0.5"/> have a kind of mode of presentation which i found highly irritating so you had <pause dur="0.2"/> for example <pause dur="0.2"/> you know the face of somebody on the screen speaking and behind them you had a whole series of kind of flashing lights and moving # <pause dur="0.2"/> you know amoeba-like things and <pause dur="0.2"/> streaming across underneath there was you know bits of text and 
you know <pause dur="0.2"/> there's all kind of <pause dur="0.6"/> somehow or other the producers <pause dur="0.5"/> it seemed to me <pause dur="0.4"/> there was something fundamentally wrong here the producers were thinking <pause dur="1.0"/> you know at some level they were thinking look science is so boring <pause dur="0.2"/> we're going to have to make this attractive by producing lots of big visual effects <pause dur="0.3"/> and that seemed to be a terribly <pause dur="0.4"/> you know patronizing view <pause dur="0.7"/> anyway <pause dur="1.0"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> sorry about that <pause dur="1.5"/> in Big Science there was an Oxford <pause dur="0.4"/> scientist an Oxford psychologist <pause dur="0.6"/> who had just discovered something very important he thought <pause dur="1.1"/> he'd discovered how it was that cricketers managed to catch cricket balls <pause dur="0.7"/> okay <pause dur="0.4"/> he'd done a lot of research on this <pause dur="0.8"/> and # <pause dur="0.2"/> he had filmed a lot of cricketers catching cricket balls <pause dur="0.4"/> and he'd used in particular <pause dur="0.2"/> Mark Ramprakash <pause dur="0.3"/> the <pause dur="0.7"/> England cricketer in the news this week because he's just <pause dur="0.2"/> transferred from Middlesex to Surrey <pause dur="2.1"/> and # <pause dur="0.7"/> what <pause dur="0.6"/> this scientist said <pause dur="10.0"/> i've got the <pause dur="0.4"/> yeah <pause dur="0.9"/> okay nineteen-ninety-four <pause dur="1.1"/> he says this <pause dur="2.0"/> <reading>in order to catch a ball <pause dur="0.2"/> your mind your 
subconscious mind <pause dur="0.4"/> calculates the second order differential equation of the sort A-level students struggle with</reading> <pause dur="0.8"/> i think he's got an optimistic view of A-level students actually but still <vocal desc="laughter" n="ss" iterated="y" dur="1"/><pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> a sort of <pause dur="0.5"/> <trunc>s</trunc> <trunc>seco</trunc> second order differential equation sort of thing that <pause dur="0.7"/> undergraduate <shift feature="voice" new="laugh"/>maths students struggle with <shift feature="voice" new="normal"/>anyway <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> <reading>it calculates that the second differential of the tangent of the angle of gaze is zero</reading> <pause dur="0.8"/> so in other words what you do you know the ball's in the air and you're running to catch it <pause dur="0.2"/> and your mind is working out the second order differential <trunc>eca</trunc> equation so that the <pause dur="0.2"/> you know the <vocal desc="laughter" n="sf0144" iterated="y" dur="1"/> <pause dur="0.5"/> tangent of the angle of gaze is zero <pause dur="0.4"/> and then when it's successfully worked out that <pause dur="0.3"/> you know it tells you stand there <vocal desc="whoop" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.3"/> like that <pause dur="2.8"/> it shows <pause dur="0.6"/> Dr McLeod <pause dur="0.6"/> said <pause dur="0.4"/> how powerful the subconscious mind is <pause dur="0.5"/> and Mark Ramprakash <pause dur="0.8"/> <shift feature="voice" new="laugh"/>on <shift feature="voice" new="normal"/> the programme was asked <pause dur="0.3"/><vocal desc="laughter" n="sf0145" iterated="y" dur="1"/> how do you <pause dur="0.4"/> how 
do you catch the ball and he said i just try to catch it <pause dur="0.4"/><vocal desc="laughter" n="ss" iterated="y" dur="1"/> okay <pause dur="1.6"/> now look <pause dur="0.5"/> <vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/><vocal desc="laughter" n="sf0145" iterated="y" dur="1"/> <pause dur="1.5"/> this <trunc>a</trunc> in this quotation in this programme <pause dur="1.1"/> i think we have revealed <pause dur="0.3"/> something <pause dur="0.9"/> about <pause dur="0.7"/> the cognitive <pause dur="0.8"/> cognitive science approach <pause dur="0.5"/> but something why it seems <pause dur="0.2"/> weird <pause dur="0.8"/> because the sort of claim <pause dur="0.3"/> that Dr McLeod is making <pause dur="0.3"/> is just the sort of claim <pause dur="0.5"/> <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> cognitivism is making <pause dur="1.0"/> but what our brains do <pause dur="0.2"/> is complicated information processing <pause dur="1.0"/> okay <pause dur="1.0"/> and so when we catch a ball <pause dur="0.8"/> we've gone through a complicated process <pause dur="0.4"/> of <pause dur="0.3"/> information processing <pause dur="2.7"/> now what's <pause dur="0.7"/> you might say well what's wrong with that <pause dur="0.4"/> i mean who's to say <pause dur="0.5"/> that our unconscious mind doesn't <gap reason="inaudible due to backgroud noise" extent="1 sec"/> up the process <pause dur="1.3"/> now Searle admits in the chapter that he doesn't have <pause dur="0.7"/> a knock-down argument against cognitivism <pause dur="0.4"/> he doesn't have an absolutely decisive argument against cognitive cognitivism <pause dur="0.5"/> as he thinks he does <pause dur="0.5"/> against <pause dur="0.6"/> the first claim of A-I he Searle thinks <pause dur="0.2"/> the Chinese room 
argument <pause dur="0.5"/> disposes of the first claim <pause dur="1.1"/> but he admits that he hasn't got such a knock-down argument for this <pause dur="1.0"/> and he wants to show us <pause dur="0.2"/> how implausible such a claim is <pause dur="1.0"/> now i think actually <pause dur="0.2"/> just by showing that sort of claim to you <pause dur="0.5"/> some of you already felt that that was just kind of implausible <pause dur="0.6"/> but let me emphasize let me produce a <trunc>se</trunc> a second example <pause dur="1.8"/> and this example is taken from Searle but not i think from the chapter <pause dur="0.6"/> but from <pause dur="0.2"/> # Searle on many other occasions <pause dur="0.5"/> for example Searle when he was standing <pause dur="0.3"/> right here <pause dur="1.1"/> # four-and-a-half years ago <pause dur="0.4"/> Searle came to a conference at <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> University <pause dur="0.5"/> and he gave a lecture just where i'm giving <pause dur="0.4"/> the lecture now <pause dur="0.3"/> that he produced <pause dur="0.2"/> this example which i'm now going to produce for you <pause dur="1.7"/> he said he had a <pause dur="0.3"/> dog <pause dur="1.1"/> and a dog called Ludwig <pause dur="1.7"/> and he says that the dog loves to <pause dur="0.3"/> as <pause dur="0.3"/> many dogs do loves to <pause dur="0.2"/> fetch things catch things bring them to him and so on <pause dur="0.7"/> and a game that he often plays with Ludwig <pause dur="0.4"/> is that Searle will <pause dur="0.4"/> throw a tennis ball against a wall <pause dur="0.4"/> and then <pause dur="0.2"/> Ludwig will go on and catch the tennis ball in its mouth <pause dur="0.9"/> okay <pause dur="1.0"/> 
now <pause dur="1.0"/> think <pause dur="0.2"/> what Ludwig has to do <pause dur="0.6"/> think what Ludwig has to do <pause dur="0.7"/> first of all <pause dur="0.7"/> Searle throws the tennis ball against the wall <pause dur="0.9"/> so in order for Ludwig to calculate <pause dur="0.3"/> where to go to catch the ball <pause dur="1.0"/> first of all <pause dur="0.2"/> Ludwig must know the angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection <pause dur="0.6"/> okay going sort of <pause dur="0.2"/> if Searle <pause dur="0.2"/> throws the ball like that then the ball's going to go up like that <pause dur="1.1"/> then the dog has got to calculate what the initial velocity <pause dur="0.3"/> of Searle throwing the ball is <pause dur="0.6"/> and then what the effect of <pause dur="0.2"/> friction <pause dur="0.2"/> of the of air <pause dur="0.4"/> will do and the effect of gravity <pause dur="0.5"/> on decreasing the speed of the tennis ball <pause dur="0.9"/> and then what the effect of the actual surface of the wall will be <pause dur="0.2"/> the coefficient of friction of the wall and various other factors which may <pause dur="0.2"/> slow down the rate of the ball <pause dur="0.6"/> okay <pause dur="0.2"/> and then you take into account wind speed and so on <pause dur="0.9"/> and that's not going to be it <pause dur="0.3"/> because then Ludwig has got to calculate <pause dur="0.4"/> what amount of energy to release in its legs that'll push it <pause dur="0.2"/> you know <pause dur="0.2"/> to it's got to calculate 
all of these things <pause dur="0.2"/> it's a miracle Ludwig ever gets that <pause dur="0.8"/> but he does every time <pause dur="0.8"/> okay <pause dur="2.0"/> now <vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/><pause dur="1.6"/> one thing that Dr McLeod didn't say <pause dur="0.3"/> but i heard other people talking about cognitivism say <pause dur="1.0"/> one thing he didn't say <pause dur="0.4"/> was <pause dur="1.3"/> <trunc>h</trunc> <pause dur="0.4"/> he didn't say it shows how powerful the human mind is <pause dur="0.3"/> he just said subconscious mind <pause dur="0.4"/> if he had said human mind then the Ludwig example be would be even more <pause dur="0.2"/> pertinent <pause dur="0.4"/> because of course it isn't just Mark Ramprakash that manages to catch a ball dogs do it too <pause dur="0.8"/> but anyway <pause dur="1.3"/> is it <pause dur="0.2"/> plausible to suppose <pause dur="0.4"/> that the dog <pause dur="0.3"/> actually <pause dur="0.2"/> calculates all of those things <pause dur="0.6"/> what if there were another type of explanation which as it were disposes of the need <pause dur="0.6"/> for giving such an explanation <pause dur="0.9"/> i mean <pause dur="1.5"/> we don't have to disagree with Dr McLeod's <pause dur="0.6"/> physics <pause dur="0.4"/> it may very well be <pause dur="0.8"/> that in order to calculate <pause dur="0.2"/> where a ball is going to land <pause dur="0.2"/> you're going to calculate it <pause dur="0.2"/><vocal desc="sniff" iterated="n"/> it may be true <pause dur="0.3"/> i'm <pause dur="0.2"/> i take it <pause dur="0.4"/> from him that it is true <pause dur="0.3"/> that the second differential of the angle of gaze <pause dur="0.7"/> of the tangent 
of the angle of gaze has to be zero i take that as being true if you're going to calculate it <pause dur="1.0"/> but isn't there another way <pause dur="0.3"/> isn't it just that human beings like dogs <pause dur="0.3"/> learn how to do things <pause dur="0.6"/> they learn how to do things by trial and error <pause dur="0.6"/> dogs and human beings are not very good at catching balls to begin with <pause dur="0.5"/> you know watch a three year old trying to catch a ball you know <pause dur="0.4"/> misses it it's <unclear>fine</unclear> we gradually get better at it <pause dur="0.8"/> now is that because we're getting more sophisticated at differential equations <pause dur="1.1"/> or is it because somehow or other our body is learning how to do a particular task <pause dur="2.0"/> because we have to come back to a point that i've made so many times now in the last few lectures <pause dur="0.5"/> we have bodies of a particular sort <pause dur="0.3"/> bodies which are adapted to perform particular sorts of tasks <pause dur="0.7"/> those tasks that we've described in mathematical terms <pause dur="1.1"/> but that doesn't mean that we have to perform that mathematics <pause dur="0.3"/> in order for our body to perform <pause dur="1.1"/> okay <pause dur="0.9"/> any more than you have to suppose 
that even something quite inanimate <pause dur="0.5"/> has to perform <pause dur="0.3"/> a particular <pause dur="0.2"/> task to behave as it does <pause dur="0.8"/> the cricket ball <pause dur="0.6"/> the cricket ball <pause dur="0.7"/> you throw the cricket ball in the air <pause dur="0.8"/> how does the cricket ball know where to land <pause dur="0.6"/> does it have to calculate the second order differential of blah blah blah blah blah <pause dur="0.3"/> no <pause dur="0.3"/> it is just <trunc>pe</trunc> <pause dur="0.3"/> it's just as it were obeying laws of physics doesn't have to calculate <pause dur="1.0"/> and our bodies too behave in certain ways <pause dur="0.4"/> which can be explained <pause dur="0.3"/> in certain sorts of mathematical terms <pause dur="0.3"/> but that isn't <pause dur="0.2"/> to say that those are the causes of the way in which they behave <pause dur="0.2"/> okay <pause dur="2.2"/> an example from the chapter <pause dur="1.8"/> is walking okay here i am walking around <pause dur="0.7"/> and every now and then getting slightly unbalanced <pause dur="0.7"/> but i manage to correct myself <pause dur="0.5"/> how do i do that <pause dur="0.4"/> okay <pause dur="0.7"/> well <pause dur="1.2"/> we know <pause dur="0.7"/> that there's a way in which human beings manage to maintain their balance <pause dur="0.6"/> we know in some sort of <pause dur="0.3"/> rough <pause dur="0.2"/> degree of detail or <pause dur="0.2"/> relatively good detail depending on how much we know about physiology <pause dur="0.7"/> and unfortunately i know 
rather little about <trunc>physiolo</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> physiology <pause dur="0.5"/> but <pause dur="0.2"/> i <pause dur="0.6"/> know something like this that there are these semicircular canals in the ear in which there <pause dur="0.4"/> is some sort of fluid and that as we <pause dur="0.3"/> you know <pause dur="0.2"/> tip our <pause dur="0.3"/> head <pause dur="0.2"/> around the place then <pause dur="0.4"/> different levels of the fluid in the inner ear will <pause dur="0.3"/> enable them to <pause dur="0.2"/> keep ourselves upright and there are people who have <pause dur="0.6"/> various sorts of # malfunction of those semicircular canals find it very difficult to maintain their balance <pause dur="0.4"/> as often happens in old people <pause dur="1.2"/> Searle discusses that particular example <pause dur="0.4"/><vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/><pause dur="9.7"/> and the point that he's making <pause dur="0.4"/> is <pause dur="1.6"/><vocal desc="cough" iterated="n"/><pause dur="1.5"/> that in behaving as we do <pause dur="2.1"/> in a lot of the tasks that we perform <pause dur="0.6"/> we are not following rules <pause dur="1.4"/> and therefore it's wrong to suppose that there's some sorts of unconscious calculation going on <pause dur="1.4"/> when i <pause dur="0.2"/> when i walk along and maintain my balance <pause dur="0.3"/> i'm not <pause dur="0.3"/> following a rule <pause dur="0.6"/> although there are in me as it were scientific laws that apply <pause dur="0.5"/> to my behaviour <pause dur="10.0"/> how does the brain <pause dur="0.5"/> 
manage to enable me <pause dur="0.2"/> to keep my balance <pause dur="1.3"/> Searle says the brain just does it <pause dur="2.2"/> he says there's no particular answer for how does the brain perform a task <pause dur="0.2"/> it just does it <pause dur="1.4"/> in particular he says there's no answer like this <pause dur="0.5"/> this isn't the way <pause dur="0.2"/> it goes <pause dur="1.7"/> so the bit in red again is Searle saying what doesn't happen <pause dur="0.4"/> okay <pause dur="0.8"/> the brain <pause dur="0.3"/> does it by assuming that gravity is constant assessing how the internal fluids are distributed and calculating the angle at which the head is inclined to the body <pause dur="0.3"/> then calculating that the body needs to lean over to the right to the tune of five degrees in order to remain upright <pause dur="0.9"/> no such calculation takes place <pause dur="0.5"/> it simply is the case that as i <pause dur="0.3"/> start to <pause dur="0.3"/> lean over <pause dur="0.2"/> then <pause dur="0.3"/> i adjust myself to go back <pause dur="0.5"/> now <pause dur="2.8"/> although many people <pause dur="0.5"/> would agree <pause dur="1.0"/> that the <pause dur="0.4"/> Mark <pause dur="0.2"/> Ramprakash <pause dur="0.2"/> Dr McLeod <pause dur="0.5"/> explanation the Dr McLeod explanation of catching a cricket ball seemed implausible and it seemed implausible to suggest <pause dur="0.5"/> that a cricketer does go through that calculation <unclear>as to</unclear> even unconsciously <pause dur="0.5"/> but 
although many people would agree that it does seem implausible to suggest that Searle's dog Ludwig goes through <pause dur="0.2"/> a massive series of physical and mathematical calculations <pause dur="0.2"/> even if unconsciously <pause dur="0.6"/> and although many people would agree that it does seem implausible to say <pause dur="0.6"/> that the brain <pause dur="0.2"/> goes through a series of calculations like that <pause dur="0.5"/> nevertheless <pause dur="0.3"/> a number of people <pause dur="0.2"/> find it kind of # unsatisfactory when Searle says that the brain <pause dur="0.3"/> just does it <pause dur="0.4"/> that's a phrase that he uses quite a lot i've heard him use it again and again <pause dur="0.7"/><vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.2"/> how is it that i catch a cricket ball <pause dur="0.3"/> well Mark Ramprakash <pause dur="0.2"/> i'm sure in complete ignorance of Searle <pause dur="0.2"/> did answer i just try and catch it <pause dur="0.6"/> and it so happens <pause dur="0.7"/> and <pause dur="0.5"/> <trunc>w</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> i don't i mean <trunc>s</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> the point here i don't think Searle <pause dur="0.5"/> i don't think Searle is saying <pause dur="0.7"/> that there's nothing to be explained in here <pause dur="1.0"/> i think what he's what he's pointing out and if <pause dur="0.2"/> if you look in the chapter it's quite clear <pause dur="0.3"/> what he's pointing out <pause dur="0.4"/> is that <pause dur="0.6"/> because we are the sorts of 
creatures that we are because we've got the sorts of bodies that we have <pause dur="0.4"/> because those bodies have evolved in a certain sort of way <pause dur="0.6"/> they are particularly good at performing certain sorts of tasks <pause dur="0.5"/> tasks they learn to perform <pause dur="0.4"/> over a period of time <pause dur="0.6"/> children learn to do things <pause dur="0.3"/> and they learn to do things by very simple processes of trial and error <pause dur="0.3"/> and all of that all of that provides a perfectly satisfactory explanation <pause dur="0.5"/> of how they manage to do it <pause dur="0.9"/> okay <pause dur="1.7"/> there are other ways in which their behaviour could be described <pause dur="0.5"/> we can talk about the physics of catching a cricket ball <pause dur="0.4"/> and that's a perfectly <trunc>gi</trunc> legitimate area <pause dur="0.7"/> despite it <pause dur="0.5"/> but it doesn't mean that we have to do the physics <pause dur="0.5"/> to catch the cricket ball <pause dur="0.9"/> any more than the stars <pause dur="0.3"/> have to perform <pause dur="0.3"/> calculations <pause dur="0.6"/> to stay where there are in the sky or planets to <pause dur="0.3"/> perform calculations to move around the sun <pause dur="1.1"/> okay <pause dur="1.4"/> that's the point of it <pause dur="0.5"/> chapter four tomorrow
