<u who="nf0057"> to Huckleberry Finn <pause dur="3.1"/> i'm being recorded here so # <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> if i go <trunc>i</trunc> get into a terrible fit of coughing you'll know and just <vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/><pause dur="1.2"/> anyway right <pause dur="0.8"/> okay <pause dur="0.6"/> when The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn <pause dur="0.2"/> was published <pause dur="0.2"/> in the mid-eighteen-eighties <pause dur="1.0"/> the first thing that happened was that it ran into a whole barrage of critical flak <pause dur="1.4"/> especially in the more <pause dur="0.2"/> culturally refined Eastern states <pause dur="0.4"/> the book was banned from numerous schools <pause dur="0.2"/> it was withdrawn from public libraries <pause dur="0.4"/> it was attacked <pause dur="0.2"/> in the establishment press <pause dur="0.7"/> and it was generally disapproved of <pause dur="1.0"/> now the reason for this hostility <pause dur="0.6"/> wasn't the actual plot <pause dur="0.2"/> of the novel <pause dur="0.9"/> by eighteen-eighty-five remember slavery had already been legally abolished for # over twenty years in the U-S <pause dur="0.4"/> the Emancipation Proclamation was eighteen-sixty-three <pause dur="0.6"/> so the story of a young boy <pause dur="0.2"/> helping an escaped slave wasn't in itself particularly <pause dur="0.3"/> controversial <pause dur="0.3"/> in fact contemporary readers would be more likely to approve <pause dur="0.3"/> of Huck's action than to <pause dur="0.2"/> throw up their hands in outrage <pause dur="0.7"/> so 
the plot itself wasn't a problem <pause dur="1.3"/> what did offend the guardians of respectable culture though <pause dur="0.5"/> was that in just about every other respect Huck was such a thoroughly bad lot <pause dur="1.2"/> he has slovenly personal habits <pause dur="0.5"/> he lies he steals he's disrespectful of religion <pause dur="0.8"/> # he's scornful of respectability and he's an educational dropout to boot <pause dur="1.2"/> Louisa May Alcott <pause dur="0.7"/> who was the author of Little Women <pause dur="0.6"/> # friend and associate of Emerson and transcendentalist <pause dur="0.3"/> Louisa May Alcott was horrified by the book <pause dur="0.4"/> and if you've got the handout you'll see i've i've put # <pause dur="1.0"/> one of her particular <pause dur="0.6"/> objections <pause dur="0.3"/> <reading>if Mr Clemens cannot think of something better to tell our pure minded lads and lasses <pause dur="0.3"/> he had better stop writing for them</reading> <pause dur="1.3"/> notice the assumption incidentally that Mr Clemens I-E <pause dur="0.2"/> Mr Twain <pause dur="0.4"/> was actually writing for children <pause dur="0.7"/> this is a dangerous assumption <pause dur="0.3"/> and i'll have more to say about that in a minute <pause dur="1.3"/> meanwhile though we mustn't forget to add to the list of Huckleberry's sins <pause dur="0.5"/> the fact that he speaks and 
writes such <pause dur="0.5"/> uneducated English <pause dur="1.2"/> his spelling is shaky <pause dur="0.2"/> his grammar is awful <pause dur="0.6"/> and his style his characteristic mode of expression is an offence to all traditional standards of literary decorum <pause dur="1.4"/> so <pause dur="0.3"/> in what always strikes me as one of the glorious ironies of American literary history <pause dur="1.1"/> we find supposedly progressive <pause dur="0.6"/> institutions like the Public Library Committee of Concord Massachusetts that's the same Concord that's Thoreau's birthplace for instance <pause dur="0.7"/> the Library Committee decided to exclude Huckleberry Finn from their shelves <pause dur="0.4"/> believing it to be and i'm quoting <pause dur="0.6"/> <reading>more profitable for the slums than it is for respectable people</reading> <pause dur="0.7"/> you'll find the full text of the <pause dur="0.4"/> Library Committee's decision in the box on the back of the handout <pause dur="1.3"/> Mark Twain of course was delighted <pause dur="0.2"/> by the bad press <pause dur="0.7"/> he reckoned that every time Huckleberry Finn was criticized or banned it just increased public interest and it upped the sales of his book <pause dur="1.1"/> and certainly many of the press reports were as bad as 
even he could have wished <pause dur="1.5"/> in addition to the Concord committee's description of Huckleberry Finn as <pause dur="0.4"/> rough <pause dur="0.3"/> coarse <pause dur="0.2"/> inelegant and irreverent <pause dur="0.6"/> other negative epithets thrown at the book by earlier reviewers include <pause dur="0.3"/> vulgar <pause dur="0.4"/> semi-obscene <pause dur="0.3"/> trashy <pause dur="0.4"/> and vicious <pause dur="1.1"/> so that's one view <pause dur="0.2"/> of the text <pause dur="1.7"/> and in case you think that such hostility <pause dur="0.5"/> is merely a dated phenomenon of the Victorian era <pause dur="0.5"/> it's worth noticing that even recently <pause dur="0.7"/> as recently as fifteen years <pause dur="0.2"/> ago in fact <pause dur="0.4"/> the censorship brigade has been back on the warpath <pause dur="1.2"/> this time the accusation is racism <pause dur="1.0"/> and there have been highly publicized calls <pause dur="0.3"/> for Huckleberry Finn to be banned from the school curriculum in the United States <pause dur="0.5"/> because of its endemically offensive use of the word nigger <pause dur="0.6"/> and because of its allegedly demeaning portrayal of black people <pause dur="2.6"/> now obviously the book's treatment of race is something which needs looking at in detail and i'll be coming back to that question <pause dur="0.2"/> in <pause dur="0.2"/> the second lecture next week <pause dur="0.7"/> but for the moment <pause dur="0.4"/> 
just add the charge of racism <pause dur="0.3"/> to all the other reasons that people have found for condemning Huckleberry Finn and wanting to see it removed <pause dur="0.6"/> from circulation <pause dur="2.6"/> now then in contrast to those negative views <pause dur="0.2"/> there's another school of thought <pause dur="1.5"/> which in fact was probably sanctioned and perpetuated by even more <pause dur="0.5"/> libraries than banned the book in the first place <pause dur="0.4"/> and this is the view that <pause dur="0.2"/> holds <pause dur="0.2"/> that Huckleberry Finn belongs on the shelves of children's literature <pause dur="1.0"/> that it's first <pause dur="0.2"/> foremost <pause dur="0.2"/> finally an uncomplicated boys' book <pause dur="0.6"/> like its predecessor Tom Sawyer <pause dur="1.5"/> Mark Twain himself in typically misleading fashion <pause dur="0.2"/> seems to lend weight to this view <pause dur="0.6"/> you'll remember the prefatory note <pause dur="0.3"/> at the front of the novel <pause dur="0.5"/> where he says <pause dur="0.4"/> <reading>persons attempting to find a motive in the narrative will be prosecuted <pause dur="0.6"/> persons attempting to find a moral in it <pause dur="0.2"/> will be banished <pause dur="0.3"/> persons attempting to find a plot <pause dur="0.4"/> will be shot</reading> <pause dur="1.5"/> unfortunately quite a few critics have made the mistake of taking that 
disclaimer at face value <pause dur="0.8"/> for example i had this # Puffin <pause dur="0.8"/><kinesic desc="holds up book" iterated="n"/> # paperback edition where Huckleberry Finn is printed alongside Tom Sawyer <pause dur="1.0"/> and the editor's introduction denounces <pause dur="0.3"/> all those literary bloodhounds who tried to sniff out improbably complicated meanings <pause dur="0.6"/> as far as he's concerned the two books Tom Sawyer and Huck Finn belong together as i quote <pause dur="0.6"/> the radiant memories of an unspoilt mind <pause dur="1.0"/> forget all about <pause dur="0.2"/> morals and motives <pause dur="0.2"/> says this kind of reader <pause dur="0.6"/> Huck is simply a delightful ragamuffin <pause dur="0.3"/> and his adventures are the thing <pause dur="0.6"/> after all look at the ingredients <pause dur="0.4"/> we have escapes uninhabited islands camping outdoors boat wrecks floods dead bodies buried treasure <pause dur="0.4"/> all the ingredients of a ripping yarn <pause dur="1.0"/> and no boring girls along to spoil the fun <pause dur="0.9"/> and no boring critics either it's implied should be <pause dur="0.5"/> allowed to spoil the fun <pause dur="1.4"/> so there you've got a second perspective on Huckleberry Finn <pause dur="0.5"/> the first one points to the novel's nastiness <pause dur="0.6"/> the second one makes it sound merely nice <pause dur="0.7"/> and in neither 
case do we get much sense that <pause dur="0.7"/> the book has any real literary merit <pause dur="1.7"/> so let's redress the balance <pause dur="2.0"/> and to suggest some of the claim that the book does have on our attention <pause dur="0.5"/> let me quote the verdict of some other commentators <pause dur="0.2"/> first <pause dur="0.2"/> the critic Lionel Trilling <pause dur="1.0"/> <reading>Huckleberry Finn</reading> he says <pause dur="0.5"/> <reading>is one of the central documents of American culture</reading> <pause dur="1.6"/> in nineteen-eighty-six a century after its publication <pause dur="0.4"/> there was an article in the Washington Post <pause dur="0.4"/> which called Huckleberry Finn <pause dur="0.2"/> i quote <pause dur="0.5"/> <reading>the greatest work of art by an American <pause dur="0.4"/> the Sistine Chapel <pause dur="0.3"/> of our civilization</reading> <pause dur="1.3"/> Mark Twain as the American Michelangelo no less <pause dur="1.2"/> and i'm sure that you'll already have come across Ernest Hemingway's famous accolade <pause dur="0.5"/> where he says <pause dur="0.3"/> <reading>all modern American literature <pause dur="0.6"/> comes from one book by Mark Twain <pause dur="0.3"/> called Huckleberry Finn <pause dur="0.3"/> it's the best book we've had</reading> <pause dur="0.6"/> all American writing comes from that <pause dur="1.5"/> now these are fairly breathtaking claims <pause dur="0.7"/> but at least they suggest that there is more to this novel <pause dur="0.4"/> than either the 
book-burners or the children's librarians have recognized <pause dur="0.9"/> so don't be lulled into a false sense of security <pause dur="0.2"/> by Twain's authorial pretence that there's nothing serious going on <pause dur="1.7"/> remember that Mark Twain is a pseudonym <pause dur="1.1"/> it's a constructed and very <pause dur="0.4"/> convenient device <pause dur="0.4"/> through which Samuel Langhorne Clemens <pause dur="0.3"/> promoted a public persona as <pause dur="0.2"/> humorist and popular entertainer <pause dur="1.2"/> but that <pause dur="0.8"/> ingenuous comic persona is a mask <pause dur="0.5"/> and it's adopted for a purpose <pause dur="1.0"/> and i reckon that you should always keep in mind the George Bernard Shaw comment that i've quoted on this sheet here <pause dur="0.9"/> # Mark Twain says Shaw <pause dur="0.5"/> <reading>has to put things in such a way as to make people who would otherwise hang him <pause dur="0.9"/> believe he is joking</reading> <pause dur="1.4"/> and there may be a more serious purpose going on beneath this apparently <pause dur="0.4"/> casual insubstantial text <pause dur="2.9"/> right <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="1.0"/> just a few details # <pause dur="0.4"/> career details which seem to me significant <pause dur="0.5"/> in the shaping of Huckleberry Finn <pause dur="1.2"/> the first book Clemens actually published under the pseudonym Mark Twain <pause dur="0.4"/> in 
eighteen-sixty-nine <pause dur="0.6"/> was a sort of comic travelogue called Innocents Abroad <pause dur="1.0"/> three years later in seventy-two <pause dur="0.6"/> he published Roughing It <pause dur="0.7"/> which he'd originally thought of calling The Innocent At Home <pause dur="0.8"/> again this was a comic <pause dur="0.3"/> first person <pause dur="0.4"/> account of his travels # this time to the open <pause dur="0.2"/> spaces of the American West <pause dur="0.5"/> and the only reason i mention these books is that <pause dur="0.3"/> they show Twain already experimenting with the strategy of a deliberately naive <pause dur="0.3"/> narrator-protagonist <pause dur="1.1"/> he was obviously drawn to the idea of <pause dur="0.4"/> speaking through the persona <pause dur="0.7"/> of an innocent at large <pause dur="0.9"/> someone whose wide-eyed confrontation with the world could be developed as a source of both comedy <pause dur="0.3"/> and satire <pause dur="2.7"/> then came Tom Sawyer <trunc>ninetee</trunc> # eighteen-seventy-six <pause dur="1.1"/> now here Twain abandoned the first person format <pause dur="0.5"/> for a more traditional third person omniscient narrator <pause dur="1.1"/> but what's significant for our purposes is that <pause dur="0.7"/> here for the first time <pause dur="0.6"/> he turned from the contemporary scene back <pause dur="0.5"/> to <pause dur="0.6"/> the fictionalized world of his own 
boyhood <pause dur="0.3"/> in the small riverbank town of Hannibal Missouri <pause dur="1.8"/> in Tom Sawyer in other words <pause dur="0.6"/> Twain opened up the imaginative arena <pause dur="0.5"/> where <pause dur="0.6"/> Huckleberry Finn is also set <pause dur="0.6"/> he also of course introduced Huck <pause dur="0.2"/> Huck is a character in Tom Sawyer as <pause dur="0.2"/> one of Tom's friends <pause dur="0.8"/> but significantly he's observed from the outside and <pause dur="0.4"/> well in any case the focus is on Tom <pause dur="1.8"/> having finished the novel <pause dur="0.7"/> Twain obviously felt there was more <pause dur="0.5"/> to be said <pause dur="0.2"/> about that childhood world of the old South <pause dur="0.3"/> enough for a kind of companion volume <pause dur="0.3"/> to Tom Sawyer <pause dur="1.0"/> but <pause dur="0.8"/> perhaps with a different perspective <pause dur="0.3"/> perhaps it needed <pause dur="0.3"/> that innocent at large <pause dur="0.3"/> to see the world <pause dur="1.4"/> so spurred on by the popular success of Tom Sawyer Twain immediately set to work <pause dur="0.9"/> on what seems to have been conceived initially as an unproblematic <pause dur="0.2"/> sequel <pause dur="1.1"/> 
he wrote to his friend William Dean Howells <pause dur="0.3"/> that he'd begun another boys' book <pause dur="0.4"/> which he describes as Huckleberry Finn's autobiography <pause dur="1.8"/> but then the trouble started <pause dur="1.1"/> having launched Huck and Jim off downriver <pause dur="0.7"/> on the raft <pause dur="1.9"/> suddenly the narrative seemed to hit a snag <pause dur="0.2"/> stall <pause dur="0.2"/> midstream <pause dur="0.6"/> and Twain found that he simply <pause dur="0.2"/> couldn't write any more <pause dur="1.3"/> at one point in fact he was so frustrated that he spoke of possibly burning the manuscript <pause dur="0.2"/> just gave up on it <pause dur="2.6"/> fortunately he didn't burn it he simply shelved the work for several years he returned to it briefly in eighteen-seventy-nine gave up again it still wasn't moving <pause dur="0.4"/> got on with other things <pause dur="0.8"/> what eventually seems to have produced the breakthrough <pause dur="0.5"/> was a trip to the South in eighteen-eighty-two <pause dur="0.9"/> this was the first time that Twain had <pause dur="0.4"/> been back on home ground he himself was a Southerner from Missouri <pause dur="0.4"/> it's the first time he'd been back to 
the South <pause dur="0.3"/> in over twenty years <pause dur="0.6"/> and when he returned from that trip <pause dur="0.6"/> the languishing manuscript of Huckleberry Finn was revived <pause dur="0.6"/> everything seemed suddenly to fall into place <pause dur="0.4"/> and after more than seven years in the making <pause dur="0.2"/> the novel was finished <pause dur="0.4"/> eighteen-eighty-three and went to press <pause dur="0.3"/> in eighty-four <pause dur="2.2"/> now then let's backtrack <pause dur="2.3"/> it used to be thought <pause dur="0.8"/> that the snag i mentioned the the sticking point at which the novel almost got <pause dur="0.6"/> # abandoned or destroyed <pause dur="0.7"/> used to be thought that that snag was <pause dur="0.3"/> # the end of chapter sixteen <pause dur="1.3"/> now if this had been so it would have been wonderfully appropriate <pause dur="0.5"/> because chapter sixteen you remember is the one where <pause dur="0.6"/> # Huck and Jim's downstream journey is brought to a catastrophic violent end <pause dur="0.2"/> when the raft <pause dur="0.2"/> collides with the upriver steamboat <pause dur="0.9"/> so that would have been a lovely place to say <pause dur="0.2"/> cut the story has come to a dead halt <pause dur="0.8"/> in fact <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> recently a manuscript was discovered which shows that the break in composition came just a bit later <pause dur="0.5"/> Twain 
stopped writing <pause dur="0.2"/> halfway through chapter eighteen rather than immediately <pause dur="0.2"/> after the steamboat collision <pause dur="0.9"/> still as the critic Shelley <pause dur="0.3"/> Fishkin says <pause dur="0.8"/> the fact remains <pause dur="0.2"/> in the summer of eighteen-seventy-six <pause dur="0.6"/> Mark Twain smashed the raft that was to have carried Huck and Jim out of slave territory and into freedom <pause dur="0.6"/> and he did not return to the manuscript for several years <pause dur="0.9"/> so clearly <pause dur="0.3"/> there was some kind of narrative crisis <pause dur="0.2"/> at this juncture of the novel <pause dur="0.8"/> and we need to ask why <pause dur="1.3"/> why did Twain feel he couldn't continue writing <pause dur="0.4"/> what are the implications of that steamboat collision <pause dur="0.2"/> what kind of turning point <pause dur="0.4"/> does it represent <pause dur="3.6"/> i'm not sure i can answer those questions definitively <pause dur="1.0"/> since critical <pause dur="0.2"/> opinion on the subject is notoriously divided <pause dur="0.8"/> but i've got a few suggestions at any rate <pause dur="0.8"/> that may give you something to mull over <pause dur="2.6"/> one way of looking at the steamboat collision <pause dur="0.9"/> is to see it as a symbol of modern technology <pause dur="1.1"/> destroying a pastoral way of life <pause dur="1.4"/> there's an excellent book 
by Leo Marx i've mentioned this point three on the the lecture notes <pause dur="0.4"/> Leo Marx's book The Machine in the Garden <pause dur="1.2"/> which argues that this theme the idea of the impact of industrialization <pause dur="0.4"/> on a traditionally rural society the machine <pause dur="0.2"/> invading the garden <pause dur="0.5"/> he argues that this has generated some of the most compelling themes <pause dur="0.3"/> in American literature <pause dur="0.5"/> you might remember in <pause dur="0.3"/> Thoreau for instance <pause dur="0.4"/> how the peace of Walden Pond is is shattered by the reverberations from the Fitchburg railroad <pause dur="1.4"/> anyway in Mark Twain's version of this theme <pause dur="0.7"/> we have Huck and Jim drifting <pause dur="0.7"/> peacefully downriver <pause dur="0.8"/> in harmony with the flow of nature <pause dur="1.5"/> only to have their pastoral idyll smashed to pieces by the steamer pounding upstream against the current <pause dur="0.2"/> the unnatural machine if you like <pause dur="0.3"/> destroying <pause dur="0.5"/> the natural idyll of the raft <pause dur="1.6"/> so at a symbolic level <pause dur="0.2"/> Twain may be expressing his sense that the pace of change the mechanisation of society <pause dur="0.8"/> was already well on its way to <pause dur="0.9"/> destroying or obliterating <pause dur="0.2"/> America's <pause dur="0.4"/> 
pastoral dream of a more <pause dur="0.9"/> natural simple existence <pause dur="1.7"/> however to get the full force of this pivotal moment i've just lost my <pause dur="2.7"/><event desc="sorts through notes" iterated="y" dur="3"/> notes there we are <pause dur="0.5"/> yes we're still on this sheet <pause dur="1.0"/> to get the full force of this # <pause dur="1.3"/> we need a bit of historical context <pause dur="0.2"/> i'm sure you know this already <pause dur="0.2"/> right <pause dur="0.2"/> but anyway let's just remind ourselves <pause dur="0.4"/> Huck Finn went to press in eighteen-eighty-four <pause dur="0.4"/> but we're told that the scene of the novel <pause dur="0.2"/> is the Mississippi valley <pause dur="0.7"/> some forty to fifty years ago <pause dur="0.9"/> in other words the novel is set <pause dur="0.6"/> roughly around the late eighteen-thirties <pause dur="1.3"/> there's a huge significance in these dates or <pause dur="0.4"/> in what happened between <pause dur="0.2"/> those dates between <pause dur="0.2"/> the date of the novel's imagined action <pause dur="0.7"/> and the date of its actual composition <pause dur="0.8"/> and what happened of course was the American Civil War <pause dur="0.5"/> eighteen-sixty-one to sixty-five <pause dur="2.0"/> now even if you know next to nothing about <pause dur="0.3"/> American history <pause dur="0.2"/> you must be aware that the Civil War was <pause dur="0.6"/> cataclysmic <pause dur="0.7"/> in the national consciousness <pause dur="1.8"/> quite apart from the appalling <pause dur="0.3"/> loss of life <pause dur="0.7"/> 
a bitter division of loyalties <pause dur="0.6"/> the spectre of disunion <pause dur="0.2"/> the devastation of the South <pause dur="1.6"/> and everything else <pause dur="0.8"/> the war also seemed metaphorically speaking <pause dur="0.5"/> to bring <pause dur="1.3"/> one phase of American history to an end <pause dur="1.4"/> the urban <pause dur="0.2"/> mechanized technologically superior north <pause dur="0.5"/> had ruled <pause dur="0.3"/> ruled its juggernaut <pause dur="0.3"/> over the South <pause dur="0.7"/> and the largely agrarian economy of the Confederate States <pause dur="0.5"/> the machine had invaded the garden <pause dur="0.3"/> with a vengeance <pause dur="0.4"/> and the modern citified industrial age was # <pause dur="0.7"/> upon us <pause dur="0.8"/> and this was a psychic watershed <pause dur="1.0"/> which Henry James i think has defined as well as anyone and i've produced this quotation on the sheets 'cause i think it's important <pause dur="1.4"/> Henry James says <pause dur="0.7"/> <reading>the Civil War marks an era <pause dur="0.2"/> in the history of the American mind <pause dur="0.9"/> it introduced into the national consciousness <pause dur="0.5"/> a certain sense of the world being a more complicated place <pause dur="0.2"/> than it had hitherto seemed <pause dur="0.9"/> the good American <pause dur="0.2"/> in days to come <pause dur="0.5"/> will be a more critical person <pause dur="0.4"/> than his complacent and confident grandfather <pause dur="1.8"/> he has eaten of the 
tree of knowledge</reading> <pause dur="1.9"/> he has eaten of the tree of knowledge <pause dur="0.9"/> think that phrase should have started some bells ringing for you <pause dur="1.3"/> because inevitably we're back to that familiar theme in the American imagination we've traced since the start the idea the myth if you like of the American Adam <pause dur="3.0"/> if you follow through on the implications of the James quotation <pause dur="0.4"/> you see that the antebellum period <pause dur="0.3"/> pre-war period <pause dur="0.5"/> is being tacitly imaged as a sort of <pause dur="0.7"/> Garden of Eden <pause dur="1.6"/> it's as if the Civil War like Adam's transgression in the garden <pause dur="0.5"/> has effectively put an end to American innocence <pause dur="0.8"/> and set the American people adrift in a fallen world <pause dur="5.4"/> now it's true that Mark Twain was <pause dur="0.3"/> born and grew up before the Civil War <pause dur="1.0"/> however he wrote all his fiction <pause dur="0.4"/> after <pause dur="0.3"/> the Civil War <pause dur="0.9"/> so he may yearn <pause dur="0.2"/> for the <pause dur="0.3"/> simple certainties of his childhood <pause dur="0.5"/> before he and his countrymen <pause dur="0.5"/> had their illusions <pause dur="0.2"/> shattered <pause dur="0.7"/> he may well be tempted as many people were <pause dur="0.7"/> to invest that vanished <pause dur="0.2"/> antebellum world with a a mythic glow of paradisal 
innocence <pause dur="1.0"/> but like Henry James' good American <pause dur="0.8"/> Twain too had eaten of the tree of knowledge <pause dur="1.2"/> and it seems to me that as Huckleberry Finn took shape <pause dur="0.4"/> Twain found it less and less possible to blinker out <pause dur="0.4"/> the facts of change <pause dur="1.0"/> so you have <pause dur="0.9"/> a nostalgia for the past <pause dur="1.4"/> becoming informed by a sharper historical sense and a more <pause dur="0.6"/> critical and complex realism <pause dur="0.7"/> as he recognizes that that world of the past has gone <pause dur="1.6"/> so let's go back to the crux of chapter sixteen <pause dur="1.1"/> Huck and Jim <pause dur="0.4"/> like <pause dur="0.4"/> Thoreau for instance before them <pause dur="1.1"/> Huck and Jim have turned their back <pause dur="0.2"/> on the corrupt <pause dur="0.2"/> artificial values of so-called civilization <pause dur="0.5"/> and they've attempted to escape to a freer <pause dur="0.8"/> more authentic life in harmony with nature <pause dur="1.3"/> and for a while <pause dur="0.6"/> the life that they create for themselves on the raft <pause dur="0.7"/> seems as though it could go on forever <pause dur="1.7"/> seems like a sort of timeless <pause dur="0.7"/> idyll <pause dur="1.7"/> but however much <pause dur="0.2"/> Twain yearned to stop the clock <pause dur="0.8"/> he was also aware going back to that James quotation <pause dur="0.6"/> that the world was a more complicated place than it 
had hitherto seemed <pause dur="1.2"/> Twain knew that the illusion of innocence <pause dur="0.2"/> childhood idyll <pause dur="0.3"/> American dream of pastoral retreat <pause dur="0.4"/> a fresh start in nature <pause dur="1.0"/> he knew that <pause dur="0.2"/> all of these were vulnerable to the logic of history <pause dur="1.1"/> Huck and Jim <pause dur="0.3"/> cannot live in a time warp <pause dur="0.3"/> they cannot make a separate peace <pause dur="0.4"/> and pretend <pause dur="0.3"/> that they can cut themselves off from the world around <pause dur="1.1"/> the raft therefore has to be destroyed <pause dur="0.2"/> they have to engage <pause dur="0.8"/> with the real world <pause dur="1.7"/> but what then <pause dur="0.2"/> where could they go next <pause dur="1.4"/> now it seems to me that Twain's <pause dur="0.9"/> critical intelligence <pause dur="0.4"/> recognized the world as it was as it had become <pause dur="1.0"/> but part of him emotionally <pause dur="0.5"/> was still tied to this nostalgic vision <pause dur="0.3"/> of the world as he <pause dur="0.8"/> in part remembered it to have been <pause dur="0.4"/> so he's at an impasse <pause dur="0.7"/> with his commitment to realism <pause dur="0.8"/> denying him the <pause dur="0.3"/> romantic release of the story he wanted to write <pause dur="0.9"/> so maybe that's why <pause dur="0.2"/> he couldn't <pause dur="1.2"/> continue with the story maybe that's why it comes to that grinding halt <pause dur="1.4"/> it's one theory anyway <pause dur="1.7"/> however <pause dur="0.4"/> we're on 
firmer ground if we <pause dur="0.8"/> move on to the question of whether in fact <pause dur="1.4"/> and if so how <pause dur="0.6"/> the novel <pause dur="0.4"/> changes <pause dur="0.3"/> after <pause dur="0.5"/> that break <pause dur="0.4"/> after the steamboat crash <pause dur="0.2"/> did Huckleberry Finn in fact <pause dur="0.3"/> alter <pause dur="0.2"/> in direction in emphasis <pause dur="0.3"/> when Twain returned to the manuscript in eighteen-eighty-three <pause dur="1.3"/> so let's examine some of the textual evidence for that <pause dur="2.9"/> maybe the first thing we notice <pause dur="0.3"/> from chapter sixteen onwards <pause dur="0.6"/> is that Jim's role <pause dur="0.2"/><vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/> excuse me Jim's role in the narrative is <pause dur="0.2"/> considerably diminished <pause dur="0.8"/> he's actually absent from the story <pause dur="0.4"/> for a couple of chapters <pause dur="0.4"/> when Huck is staying with the Grangerford family <pause dur="0.7"/> and in many later scenes he's merely assumed <pause dur="0.8"/> if we remember him at all <pause dur="0.6"/> assumed to be waiting patiently somewhere in the wings <pause dur="1.2"/> so what this suggests is that Twain's narrative attention <pause dur="1.1"/> may have <pause dur="1.3"/> shifted <pause dur="0.6"/> from the the thematic <pause dur="0.5"/> line of Jim's bid for freedom <pause dur="0.7"/> to a satirical attack <pause dur="0.2"/> on various aspects of Southern society <pause dur="0.9"/> that the 
main point of the story may have shifted sideways from Jim <pause dur="1.2"/> to white Southern society <pause dur="1.6"/> in confirmation of this we find that <pause dur="0.3"/> in the second part of the novel or after chapter sixteen <pause dur="0.4"/> far more time is spent <pause dur="1.0"/> far more of the action now takes place <pause dur="0.3"/> on shore <pause dur="2.0"/> and it's noticeable too <pause dur="0.5"/> that the quality of the action changes <pause dur="1.0"/> violence <pause dur="0.2"/> fraud <pause dur="0.8"/> cruelty <pause dur="0.3"/> cheating <pause dur="0.2"/> attempted lynching murder <pause dur="1.7"/> had a wonderful # sentence in a finals examination paper a couple of years back <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> where a student wrote <pause dur="1.1"/> i took notes on the exam paper <pause dur="1.1"/> a student wrote <reading>it is possible to count approximately thirteen corpses between Saint Petersburg and Pikesville <pause dur="0.3"/> and none of the corpses died a meaningful or purposeful death</reading> <pause dur="1.3"/> i haven't counted the corpses but i'll take her word for it <pause dur="0.9"/> anyway <pause dur="0.5"/> what we find is that the indictment of shore society <pause dur="0.8"/> becomes increasingly <pause dur="0.2"/> # savage <pause dur="0.9"/> # with a bitterness of vision that <pause dur="0.5"/> # is quite different from the perspective of the early chapters <pause dur="1.4"/> now <pause dur="0.4"/> of 
course the raft is <pause dur="1.0"/> patched up <pause dur="1.2"/> and the journey is resumed after the Grangerford episode <pause dur="1.0"/> but the idyll <pause dur="0.4"/> can't be restored <pause dur="0.7"/> Jim says that he's managed to stick the raft together almost as good as new <pause dur="0.8"/> but the fact is that neither <pause dur="0.2"/> the raft nor the dream it embodied <pause dur="0.3"/> can ever be whole again <pause dur="1.3"/> previously <pause dur="0.4"/> the raft had been a sanctuary from the shore <pause dur="0.5"/> a haven of sanity and right values <pause dur="0.5"/> compared with the corruption of society <pause dur="1.1"/> but now <pause dur="0.5"/> in the second half of the book <pause dur="0.7"/> that polarity <pause dur="0.6"/> seems to break down <pause dur="2.7"/> in fact the con men <pause dur="0.4"/> society in the shape of the con men the Duke and the King <pause dur="0.3"/> actually invades the raft <pause dur="1.0"/> not only that but the con men bring with them and impose onto the raft <pause dur="0.3"/> precisely the cultural baggage <pause dur="0.4"/> of shore life <pause dur="0.3"/> that Huck and Jim had been trying to escape from in the first place <pause dur="1.7"/> when it was just the two of them <pause dur="0.6"/> alone on # the raft in nature <pause dur="1.4"/> the gulf between the races seemed to be <pause dur="0.5"/> closing <pause dur="0.6"/> an ideal of equality and brotherhood <pause dur="0.3"/> seemed to be attainable <pause dur="0.6"/> but as soon as the Duke and 
the King come back on board <pause dur="0.5"/> with their fake titles and their jockeying for position <pause dur="0.7"/> the concept of social hierarchy <pause dur="0.3"/> again imposes itself <pause dur="1.0"/> and ominously as soon as social hierarchy imposes itself <pause dur="0.9"/> where does Jim find himself <pause dur="0.5"/> right at the bottom <pause dur="0.5"/> finds himself having to <pause dur="0.2"/> revert to the role of slave <pause dur="1.8"/> so <pause dur="1.5"/> i think there is substantial evidence that Huckleberry Finn <pause dur="0.2"/> does change <pause dur="0.2"/> in terms of tone <pause dur="0.6"/> emphasis <pause dur="0.2"/> atmosphere <pause dur="1.1"/> perhaps even in terms of Twain's own purposes <pause dur="0.7"/> after the crux of chapter sixteen <pause dur="3.1"/> this does not mean however <pause dur="0.3"/> that i think the novel is broken-backed or lacking in continuity <pause dur="0.9"/> or overall design <pause dur="1.1"/> on the contrary <pause dur="0.6"/> i'd argue that as the tone darkens <pause dur="0.4"/> as the satire intensifies after the steamboat collision <pause dur="0.8"/> what Twain does is echo <pause dur="0.3"/> rework <pause dur="0.3"/> or extrapolate <pause dur="0.5"/> from the material of the earlier chapters <pause dur="0.5"/> so as to expose the meanings which were latent there from the start <pause dur="1.0"/> now there are lots of examples of how this works <pause dur="0.6"/> but i've picked out one which i think is a particularly good one <pause dur="1.0"/> and 
it's <pause dur="0.7"/> the way the Shepherdson-Grangerford feud <pause dur="0.7"/> seems to expose <pause dur="0.3"/> the underlying implications of Tom Sawyer's <pause dur="0.9"/> early games at the start of the book where Tom's messing around with his robber gang <pause dur="1.3"/> now you'll remember in those early chapters <pause dur="0.5"/> Tom and his friends are <pause dur="0.3"/> only playing <pause dur="1.1"/> they're just school kids <pause dur="0.4"/> hyped up with the clichés of adventure romantic fiction <pause dur="1.2"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> we might think that the fantasies of gore and violence are pretty lurid <pause dur="0.5"/> but we're probably inclined just to put that down to the <pause dur="0.3"/> amusing excesses of a childish imagination <pause dur="0.8"/> we'd probably laugh at Tom <pause dur="0.8"/> when rather than <pause dur="0.2"/> admit the mundane reality in front of him which is simply a dull Sunday school picnic <pause dur="0.6"/> # he glamorizes into that romantic scenario of camels and elephants and Arabs <pause dur="0.7"/> so <pause dur="0.2"/> you know we laugh at Tom Sawyer's games <pause dur="1.7"/> but the laughing stops surely <pause dur="0.8"/> when we see precisely the same syndrome at work <pause dur="0.3"/> in the Shepherdson and Grangerford clans <pause dur="1.5"/> think about this <pause dur="0.4"/> rather than <pause dur="0.7"/> recognize and admit <pause dur="0.7"/> to the facts in front of them <pause dur="0.4"/> 
which are <pause dur="0.7"/> the facts of the stupid brutality of meaningless murder <pause dur="1.3"/> rather than admit that <pause dur="0.5"/> they too dress up their activity as a romance <pause dur="0.2"/> this time with the high-flown rhetoric of feud <pause dur="0.4"/> family honour <pause dur="0.2"/> inherited codes of duty nobody knows what this feud is about nobody gives a damn what this feud is about but they all know they've got to kill each other because that's what the books say that's what tradition says <pause dur="1.1"/> okay <pause dur="1.0"/> now <pause dur="0.7"/> it's as if Mark Twain had decided to show the full-grown poison tree <pause dur="0.5"/> that springs from the seeds of corruption in Tom Sawyer's world <pause dur="0.6"/> if you take <pause dur="0.4"/> Tom Sawyer's <pause dur="0.2"/> romanticized <trunc>fa</trunc> fantasies of violence <pause dur="0.3"/> if you take that childish imagination <pause dur="0.7"/> saturated with the stylized posturing <pause dur="0.5"/> of romantic <pause dur="0.5"/> # tradition and heroism <pause dur="0.5"/> if you then translate that into the adult arena <pause dur="1.1"/> you get real killing <pause dur="0.4"/> real death <pause dur="2.2"/> now in a sense this is the <pause dur="1.6"/> folly the tragedy <pause dur="0.8"/> of the American South as a whole <pause dur="1.4"/> Twain was deeply critical <pause dur="0.4"/> of the antebellum South <pause dur="0.6"/> for its romantic self-image as a 
land of <pause dur="0.4"/> gallant hot-blooded heroes high chivalric gesture <pause dur="1.5"/> he believed that Southerners had become so crippled <pause dur="0.5"/> by what he called the Sir Walter disease <pause dur="0.7"/> that is they'd become so infatuated with the <pause dur="0.4"/> mythic world of historical romance created by novelists like Sir Walter Scott <pause dur="1.8"/> that they'd actually lost touch with reality <pause dur="2.4"/> instead of <pause dur="0.4"/> sober self-knowledge <pause dur="0.6"/> Twain said <pause dur="0.3"/> Southerners had deluded themselves with i quote <pause dur="0.3"/> sham grandeurs sham gauds sham chivalries <pause dur="1.0"/> and it was this as much as anything <pause dur="0.3"/> Twain thought <pause dur="0.4"/> which had allowed the evils of Southern society to go unchecked <pause dur="1.6"/> actually Twain thought that Sir Walter Scott <pause dur="0.2"/> was responsible for the Civil War but that's <pause dur="0.6"/> slightly <pause dur="0.4"/> # uncharacteristic historical analysis <pause dur="0.4"/> you might notice just in passing <pause dur="0.8"/> another episode where the steamboat goes <trunc>a</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> aground on the rocks and is breaking up <pause dur="1.2"/> and don't blink or you'll miss it <pause dur="0.8"/> but the name of that steamboat is the Sir Walter Scott <pause dur="1.4"/> and the fact that it goes down <pause dur="0.5"/> on a sandbank <pause dur="0.3"/> 
with a bunch of murderers on board may be a fair indication of what <pause dur="0.6"/> Twain thought <pause dur="0.2"/> should happen to Southern romanticism <pause dur="2.0"/> anyway <pause dur="0.8"/> this kind of extrapolations cross-reference the symbolic linking <pause dur="0.3"/> between early and later episodes <pause dur="0.7"/> seems to me <pause dur="0.5"/> a crucial aspect of the novel's <pause dur="0.2"/> design <pause dur="1.2"/> and i am stressing the idea of design and form <pause dur="1.3"/> because Huckleberry Finn is <pause dur="0.2"/> sometimes assumed not to have any <pause dur="1.3"/> the basic structure of Huckleberry Finn is of course picaresque <pause dur="0.8"/> oh i <pause dur="0.2"/> don't need to write that on the board i've written it on your <pause dur="0.9"/> # <pause dur="3.4"/> things yes <pause dur="0.5"/> five second dash loose picaresque form <pause dur="0.4"/> picaresque <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.8"/> picaresque novels characteristically are are <pause dur="0.4"/> these loose shambling affairs <pause dur="0.3"/> with <pause dur="0.3"/> separate episodic adventures strung together by virtue of the of the hero's presence <pause dur="0.4"/> and <pause dur="0.3"/> Huckleberry Finn appears to <pause dur="0.2"/> follow that so people have sometimes assumed it's not a very <pause dur="0.6"/> artistically designed novel <pause dur="1.1"/> i want to argue though <pause dur="0.4"/> that there is in fact a much firmer <pause dur="0.4"/> more cohesive <pause dur="0.2"/> formal organization at work <pause dur="1.9"/> firstly 
as i've just been suggesting <pause dur="0.2"/> # there is this # <pause dur="0.8"/> way that connections are made between one part of the journey and another <pause dur="0.4"/> they're established through <pause dur="0.3"/> prolepsis <pause dur="0.7"/> and echo prolepsis <pause dur="0.2"/> a kind of foreshadowing <pause dur="0.6"/> a figure of anticipation <pause dur="0.6"/> so you have this proleptic link <pause dur="0.6"/> between <pause dur="0.4"/> Tom Sawyer's games <pause dur="0.6"/> and the Grangerford killings <pause dur="0.3"/> okay <pause dur="0.3"/> so there's those kinds of connections <pause dur="0.7"/> but equally or perhaps even more important <pause dur="1.2"/> the novel's coherence and continuity come from the constant presence of the river <pause dur="0.2"/> the river itself <pause dur="1.6"/> from the time that Huck escapes his father in chapter seven <pause dur="0.6"/> to the time he lands up at the Phelps' farm <pause dur="0.4"/> in chapter thirty-one <pause dur="0.8"/> the entire narrative action <pause dur="0.5"/> is based on back and forth movement <pause dur="0.3"/> between shore <pause dur="0.2"/> and river <pause dur="1.1"/> between civilization <pause dur="0.2"/> and nature <pause dur="0.2"/> if you like <pause dur="1.1"/> and the tension <pause dur="0.5"/> between those two <pause dur="0.5"/> gives rise to the structuring polarities <pause dur="0.2"/> that underpin the whole novel <pause dur="2.1"/> now i've i've given <pause dur="0.5"/> some examples on the sheet of what i mean by <pause dur="0.4"/> these structuring <pause dur="0.2"/> polarities <pause dur="1.1"/> shore versus 
river <pause dur="0.9"/> civilization versus nature you can call it <pause dur="0.5"/> what you like <pause dur="0.6"/> but what we see is that that basic structural contrast <pause dur="1.1"/> generates a whole series of other oppositions <pause dur="0.2"/> in the novel <pause dur="1.4"/> as an obvious example <pause dur="1.2"/> the shore <pause dur="0.9"/> is associated with captivity <pause dur="1.0"/> it's where Jim has been a slave <pause dur="1.0"/><vocal desc="cough" iterated="n"/> and it's where Huck has been <pause dur="0.3"/> first of all cramped up by the widow Douglas and secondly <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.8"/> abused and locked in by his drunken father <pause dur="0.6"/> so the shore is associated with captivity <pause dur="1.1"/> and <trunc>tha</trunc> against this the river <pause dur="0.9"/> for both runaways is associated with freedom <pause dur="0.8"/> although it is worth noticing that <pause dur="0.5"/> freedom means slightly different things to Huck and Jim <pause dur="0.8"/> however <pause dur="0.4"/> another contrast here <pause dur="0.7"/> the shore is identified with <pause dur="0.6"/> artifice <pause dur="0.4"/> insincerity <pause dur="0.8"/> style <pause dur="1.1"/> watch out for that word style in the novel by the way <pause dur="0.4"/> it's a term that develops extremely negative connotations it's almost always associated with Tom Sawyer <pause dur="0.3"/> who throws a bit of style into everything <pause dur="1.4"/> okay the shore is associated with <pause dur="0.8"/> style artifice <pause dur="0.9"/> whereas <pause dur="1.8"/> the river is <pause dur="0.5"/> associated with the alternative values of <pause dur="0.8"/> simplicity <pause dur="0.3"/> naturalness <pause dur="0.8"/> authenticity <pause dur="0.5"/> truth telling <pause dur="3.2"/> 
and there's one more <pause dur="0.3"/> polarity <pause dur="0.5"/> which <pause dur="1.3"/> you need to register <pause dur="0.4"/> it's crucial because it lies at the very heart of Huck's <pause dur="0.5"/> moral dilemma <pause dur="1.1"/> and this is the opposition between <pause dur="0.2"/> conscience <pause dur="0.5"/> and heart <pause dur="1.8"/> now at first sight it may seem a bit strange to put conscience in my left hand column here <pause dur="1.7"/> for people like Thoreau <pause dur="0.6"/> remember <pause dur="0.3"/> conscience <pause dur="0.6"/> was the authentic <pause dur="0.9"/> inner voice of natural morality <pause dur="1.0"/> Thoreau would obey his own conscience <pause dur="0.7"/> at all costs even against the dictates of society or <pause dur="0.3"/> even go to gaol <pause dur="0.2"/> for his conscience sake <pause dur="0.8"/> so you might think that conscience ought to be associated with <pause dur="0.3"/> the river <pause dur="0.5"/> you know the natural values of the river rather than the shore <pause dur="0.5"/> but that's not how Mark Twain is using the term <pause dur="0.8"/> for Mark Twain <pause dur="0.5"/> conscience <pause dur="0.5"/> is the repository and the spokesman for society's values <pause dur="0.8"/> it's like the sort of <pause dur="0.2"/> the Freudian superego <pause dur="0.6"/> conscience is the <pause dur="0.3"/> socialized <pause dur="0.4"/> authoritarian voice which tells Huck <pause dur="0.4"/> what's right 
and moral in the eyes of the majority <pause dur="0.8"/> so all those lessons that he's learned from Sunday School from Widow Douglas from <pause dur="0.2"/> absorbing the racism of his community <pause dur="1.4"/> so it's what society tells him is moral <pause dur="0.5"/> is his conscience <pause dur="1.3"/> the heart <pause dur="0.2"/> by contrast is what speaks for the innate values of the individual <pause dur="2.2"/> so in Mark Twain's own words <pause dur="0.2"/> Huckleberry Finn is i quote <pause dur="0.3"/> <reading>a book of mine where a sound heart <pause dur="0.4"/> and a deformed conscience <pause dur="0.3"/> come into collision</reading> <pause dur="2.1"/> and basically it's the developing interplay between those two between Huck's <pause dur="0.2"/> natural individual <pause dur="0.4"/> heart based values <pause dur="0.6"/> and the corrupted values that he's absorbed from society <pause dur="0.2"/> individual versus society <pause dur="1.7"/> that provides the novel's thematic coherence <pause dur="3.6"/> right <pause dur="0.2"/> well it's probably something of a record but so far i've managed to put off talking about the single most important thing in the whole novel <pause dur="1.5"/> and this is the thing which above all gives its <pause dur="0.5"/> continuity <pause dur="0.2"/> coherence and aesthetic unity <pause dur="0.5"/> and that's the voice <pause dur="0.2"/> of <pause dur="0.7"/> Huck Finn himself <pause dur="2.1"/> it's 
difficult to know quite where to start on this how on earth do you convey the <pause dur="0.8"/> revolution <pause dur="0.2"/> inherent <pause dur="0.2"/> in Twain's choice of narrator <pause dur="1.2"/> and not the least of my problems is that the critic Tony Tanner <pause dur="0.7"/> has already done such a brilliant study of the # qualities and the significance of Huck's <pause dur="0.7"/> language that <pause dur="0.2"/> really my best advice is go and read The Reign Of Wonder for yourselves particularly chapter seven <pause dur="0.5"/> where Tanner talks about the whole new world that is opened up <pause dur="0.8"/> by Huck's vernacular style <pause dur="1.2"/> however just to kind of whet your appetite i'll give you a few pointers <pause dur="1.6"/> the key to Tanner's argument is <pause dur="0.9"/> a lovely and useful phrase which i've quoted on your handout <pause dur="0.6"/> <reading>language <pause dur="0.3"/> is a way of world-watching</reading> <pause dur="1.7"/> now what he means by this <pause dur="0.7"/> is that the kind of language you use <pause dur="0.4"/> has a bearing on the way you perceive and think about <pause dur="0.5"/> the world around you <pause dur="1.2"/> we're often told for instance i gather this is a myth but it doesn't matter we all believe it anyway <pause dur="0.4"/> we're often told that the Eskimo or the the Inuit peoples <pause dur="0.3"/> 
have something like thirty different words for snow <pause dur="1.0"/> so the language <pause dur="0.9"/> enables them to see snow more specifically than we do <pause dur="0.3"/> they can articulate <pause dur="0.3"/> minute differences <pause dur="1.0"/> they can <pause dur="0.4"/> have a word for the way it falls they can have a word for the way it lies for the type of snow <pause dur="0.6"/> for the changing texture <pause dur="0.2"/> for how fast it melts <pause dur="0.2"/> all these kinds of things <pause dur="1.7"/> the English language just isn't geared to that kind of <pause dur="0.2"/> visual discrimination so when we look all we see is snow or sleet or sludge <pause dur="2.0"/> language is a way of world-watching <pause dur="1.2"/> there was another fascinating example that turned up in the Guardian <pause dur="0.7"/> some while back <pause dur="0.2"/> again i <shift feature="voice" new="laugh"/> i don't know <shift feature="voice" new="normal"/> if this is true <pause dur="0.2"/> but it said it was in the Guardian <pause dur="1.2"/> # in Japanese apparently <pause dur="0.9"/> only men are allowed to use a certain form of the first person singular <pause dur="0.9"/> the language allows <pause dur="0.3"/> a man <pause dur="0.3"/> to assert his personal identity <pause dur="0.2"/> in relation to the world he perceives so a man can say <pause dur="0.3"/> i say it's cold outside <pause dur="1.4"/> Japanese women by contrast <pause dur="0.4"/> would have to say something like <pause dur="0.5"/> it's cold 
outside don't you think <pause dur="1.8"/> now just imagine what <pause dur="0.4"/> structures of perception and self-perception are built in to linguistic codes like that <pause dur="0.3"/> there's George Orwell's Nineteen-Eighty-Four <pause dur="0.6"/> where the government <pause dur="1.7"/> takes hold of language if you like tries to <pause dur="0.2"/> simplify all the possibilities <pause dur="0.6"/> out of language so that they're suppressed <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.8"/> peoples can only think in in <pause dur="0.4"/> orthodox ways <pause dur="0.9"/> okay language is a way of world-watching i'm sure you've got the idea <pause dur="0.5"/> now <pause dur="0.5"/> in Huckleberry Finn for the first time <pause dur="0.3"/> in American literature <pause dur="0.6"/> a particular type of language is used <pause dur="0.9"/> Tanner calls it a subsocial vernacular <pause dur="0.9"/> a spoken American idiom which is unsophisticated <pause dur="0.2"/> unliterary <pause dur="0.6"/> blithely unconscious of the correct forms <pause dur="0.6"/> correct in inverted commas <pause dur="1.2"/> and the point is that because of this language <pause dur="1.5"/> Huck has a different perception of America <pause dur="0.9"/> precisely because <pause dur="0.3"/> he is naive and uneducated <pause dur="0.5"/> he hasn't yet learned the orthodox ways of world-watching <pause dur="1.3"/> this means that his perceptions <pause dur="0.3"/> aren't conditioned by conventional 
linguistic habits <pause dur="0.9"/> so he can see and respond to things <pause dur="2.4"/> in a different way <pause dur="1.5"/> and what we get then is this <pause dur="0.8"/> marvellously fresh <pause dur="0.2"/> spontaneous <pause dur="0.5"/> registering of experience <pause dur="1.1"/> not the world as other people have described it <pause dur="0.3"/> not the world as filtered through the lens of official <pause dur="0.4"/> language and culture not the world that has been described for him in books <pause dur="0.3"/> but he's learned to see through <pause dur="0.7"/> an inherited tradition <pause dur="0.4"/> this is the world or <pause dur="0.2"/> America rather <pause dur="0.2"/> seen <pause dur="0.8"/> as it were for the first time <pause dur="1.6"/> when Hemingway says that all modern American literature comes from Huckleberry Finn <pause dur="1.0"/> he probably had several things in mind but primarily <pause dur="0.4"/> i think <pause dur="0.3"/> he was referring to <pause dur="0.3"/> this stylistic breakthrough <pause dur="0.6"/> to the fact that here for the first time <pause dur="0.4"/> we have <pause dur="0.3"/> a vernacular American language that is capable <pause dur="0.8"/> of seeing and describing not what we're taught to look at <pause dur="0.4"/> but what actually presents itself to the eye <pause dur="1.5"/> and the innocent eye <pause dur="1.2"/> that <pause dur="0.3"/> has an innocent language if you like to <pause dur="1.0"/> articulate its perceptions <pause dur="0.4"/> so Huck's voice then <pause dur="0.3"/> that 
distinguished that distinctive <pause dur="0.5"/> language and style which opens up his distinctive vision of the world <pause dur="0.5"/> is the control centre of the novel and <pause dur="1.3"/> of the novel's aesthetic unity <pause dur="1.7"/> and its success <pause dur="1.6"/> at which point <pause dur="0.6"/> right it's time to come clean many people <pause dur="0.6"/> perhaps even the majority of readers and critics <pause dur="0.4"/> do not <pause dur="0.2"/> believe or are not convinced that Huckleberry Finn <pause dur="0.2"/> is <pause dur="0.5"/> a successful <pause dur="0.2"/> aesthetic whole <pause dur="1.1"/> the first <pause dur="0.7"/> # sentence of my Norton critical edition <pause dur="0.4"/> reads <pause dur="0.4"/> <reading>Mark Twain was a great writer who never wrote a great book</reading> <pause dur="1.9"/> so we have a problem here <pause dur="1.8"/> you may have noticed that i have studiously avoided any discussion of the concluding section of the novel <pause dur="0.4"/> from chapter thirty-two to the end <pause dur="1.5"/> now this is the notorious Phelps farm sequence <pause dur="0.7"/> where Jim has been recaptured <pause dur="1.1"/> Tom Sawyer comes back on the 
scene <pause dur="0.5"/> much fun and games and merry pranks supposedly <pause dur="0.6"/> and it all ends happily ever after <pause dur="0.3"/> or something like that <pause dur="1.5"/> now the fact is <pause dur="0.2"/> this section the Phelps farm sequence <pause dur="0.4"/> is one of the most controversial and fiercely debated pieces of text in all American literature <pause dur="1.0"/> for many people <pause dur="1.5"/> those final chapters destroy <pause dur="0.9"/> the unity <pause dur="0.2"/> the coherence <pause dur="0.3"/> and even the meaning <pause dur="0.3"/> of the whole novel <pause dur="1.6"/> Ernest Hemingway for instance <pause dur="0.6"/> may have called Huckleberry Finn the best book we've had <pause dur="0.5"/> but he went on to say <pause dur="0.7"/> i apologize for the racist language but i'm quoting <pause dur="0.8"/> he went on to say <reading>you must stop <pause dur="0.2"/> where the nigger Jim is stolen <pause dur="0.5"/> that is the real end <pause dur="0.4"/> the rest is just cheating</reading> <pause dur="2.0"/> so anyone who believes that the novel actually works <pause dur="0.5"/> that it is <pause dur="0.3"/> purposefully and successfully shaped all the way through including <pause dur="0.4"/> 
the stuff at the Phelps farm <pause dur="0.9"/> has to confront what's come to be known as the problem of the ending <pause dur="1.1"/> now i want you to think about this <pause dur="1.2"/> if you <pause dur="0.7"/> feel or felt when you read it <pause dur="0.4"/> that the end of the novel jars if it <pause dur="0.7"/> if it leaves you uncomfortable <pause dur="0.2"/> try to analyse why <pause dur="1.4"/> and if it doesn't jar <pause dur="0.9"/> then you probably haven't been reading carefully enough <pause dur="1.1"/> i'm trailing my coat here <pause dur="0.7"/> but basically there's three <pause dur="0.4"/> major issues that i want to talk about next week <pause dur="0.4"/> Mark Twain's <pause dur="0.3"/> treatment of race <pause dur="1.8"/> the question of whether the novel is intended <pause dur="0.6"/> intended <pause dur="0.2"/> to be comic <pause dur="1.1"/> and the perennially thorny question of what's actually going on at the Phelps farm <pause dur="1.6"/> okay <pause dur="0.4"/> don't miss next week's exciting instalment
