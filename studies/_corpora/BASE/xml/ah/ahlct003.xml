what most people say what the general <pause dur="0.4"/> approach is <pause dur="0.3"/> to the life of Pericles the Athenian <pause dur="0.3"/> statesman <pause dur="0.3"/> Pericles and he's going to be the subject <pause dur="0.3"/> of our thoughts for the next two lectures this lecture and next lecture <pause dur="0.4"/> and the seminar <pause dur="0.8"/> and we did <pause dur="0.2"/> a <pause dur="0.4"/> a brief <pause dur="0.2"/> uncontroversial run-through <pause dur="0.3"/> of what you'll find written about Pericles <pause dur="0.4"/> in history books <pause dur="0.8"/> and in this lecture <pause dur="0.2"/> we're going to take that picture apart <pause dur="0.2"/> a bit and this lecture is entitled <pause dur="0.4"/> how important <pause dur="0.4"/> actually <pause dur="0.3"/> was Pericles <pause dur="0.4"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> you'll gather from the very fact we're having a lecture on this that <pause dur="0.3"/> we're going to be arguing that the importance of Pericles <pause dur="0.4"/> who's <pause dur="0.3"/> presented as <pause dur="0.2"/> the figure <pause dur="0.2"/> of fifth century Athenian democracy <pause dur="0.5"/> in all the books you read <pause dur="0.3"/> we're going to be arguing that Pericles was actually not <pause dur="0.4"/> so <pause dur="0.4"/> important <pause dur="0.6"/> and that the importance of Pericles <pause dur="0.3"/> has been exaggerated <pause dur="0.3"/> by one person <pause dur="0.4"/> the historian <pause dur="0.2"/> Thucydides <pause dur="1.0"/> and that this exaggeration <pause dur="0.3"/> has got into the <pause dur="0.4"/> # literary and historical tradition ever since until our lecture now <pause dur="0.3"/> 
where we're going to challenge it <pause dur="0.7"/> so <pause dur="1.6"/> how important was Pericles <pause dur="0.9"/> Pericles tends to be seen <pause dur="0.3"/> as <pause dur="0.3"/> the representative figure the embodiment <pause dur="0.4"/> of <pause dur="0.3"/> Athenian <pause dur="0.3"/> democracy <pause dur="2.8"/> you can find <pause dur="0.7"/> studies of Pericles <pause dur="0.4"/> # in the history books we talked about last time that are on the handout <pause dur="2.8"/> this <pause dur="0.9"/> # <pause dur="1.3"/> exaggeration this this sense of Pericles as the <pause dur="0.3"/> most important figure <pause dur="0.3"/> starts off in the historian Thucydides <pause dur="0.5"/> who of course is contemporary <pause dur="0.4"/> with Pericles <pause dur="1.2"/> can anyone <pause dur="0.7"/> tell us or guess <pause dur="0.3"/> what sort of a a family <pause dur="0.2"/> or what sort of political background <pause dur="0.3"/> Thucydides came from </u><pause dur="0.6"/> <u who="sf0015" trans="pause"> aristocrat </u><pause dur="0.4"/> <u who="nm0007" trans="pause"> aristocrat <pause dur="0.2"/> right <pause dur="0.2"/> all <pause dur="0.3"/> ancient writers pretty much are going to be aristocratic <pause dur="0.4"/> to have the time <pause dur="0.3"/> and the leisure to write you are by definition <pause dur="0.3"/> rich <pause dur="0.2"/> which <pause dur="0.4"/> in classical Athens means <pause dur="0.5"/> an aristocrat you own lots of land <pause dur="0.6"/> and what happened to Thucydides what big event <pause dur="0.5"/> allowed him to write the History </u><u who="sf0016" trans="latching"> was he exiled </u><pause dur="0.2"/> <u who="nm0007" trans="pause"> he was exiled he was exiled by <pause dur="0.3"/> the Athenian democracy <pause dur="0.5"/> does anyone know why he was exiled </u><pause dur="1.1"/> <u who="sf0017" trans="pause"> <unclear>he was on some sort of campaign and he failed</unclear></u><u who="nm0007" trans="overlap"> yeah <pause dur="0.5"/> that 
exactly <pause dur="0.3"/> he was on campaign <pause dur="0.4"/> and failed he failed <pause dur="0.3"/> to save the city of Amphipolis <pause dur="0.3"/> from the Spartans <pause dur="0.3"/> in four-two-five <pause dur="0.4"/> B-C and it was taken by Sparta <pause dur="1.4"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="8"/> and he actually writes about <pause dur="0.7"/> about this in his History <pause dur="0.4"/> and just sort of <pause dur="0.7"/> when he's narrating the fall of Amphipolis he says that <pause dur="0.3"/> <reading>an an Athenian squadron from the island of Thasos <pause dur="0.5"/> <trunc>al</trunc> <pause dur="0.5"/> commanded by Thucydides</reading> it doesn't say commanded by me commanded by Thucydides <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> <reading>just failed to relieve the city</reading> <pause dur="0.7"/> and it gives the impression a poor guy <pause dur="0.4"/> # you know he did his best and # <trunc>i</trunc> <trunc>i</trunc> it didn't <pause dur="0.4"/> didn't quite get there in time of course we don't know whether that's quite true <pause dur="0.4"/> # he was exiled by the government in other words the people <pause dur="0.4"/> in Athens <pause dur="0.2"/> so <pause dur="0.8"/> these two facts the fact that he's an aristocrat and the fact that he's <pause dur="0.8"/> he suffered at the hands of the democracy <pause dur="0.4"/> would <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> lead us to expect <pause dur="0.3"/> that he would be somebody who had a rather negative might have a rather negative view <pause dur="0.4"/> of <pause dur="0.2"/> democratic power <pause dur="0.4"/> in Athens <pause dur="0.4"/> 
and might be rather <pause dur="0.2"/> well <pause dur="0.2"/> disposed towards <pause dur="0.4"/> aristocratic leaders <pause dur="0.5"/> # rather than <pause dur="0.4"/> # the rabble as he would see it of Athenian politics <pause dur="0.4"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> that's <pause dur="0.2"/> one <pause dur="0.3"/> possibility of why Pericles gets <pause dur="0.2"/> such a good write-up <pause dur="0.4"/> from <pause dur="0.3"/> Thucydides they share the same political aristocratic <pause dur="0.4"/> background <pause dur="3.2"/> what actually though does <pause dur="0.4"/> Thucydides say about Pericles <pause dur="0.4"/> what events does Thucydides say Pericles was involved in <pause dur="0.5"/> well if you go through <pause dur="0.5"/> if you read <pause dur="0.2"/> Thucydides' History you get an impression <pause dur="0.4"/> of the overwhelming greatness and importance <pause dur="0.5"/> of Pericles the authority of Pericles <pause dur="1.2"/> where does that sense of Pericles' importance come from <pause dur="0.8"/> his speeches <pause dur="0.3"/> he gets a lot of speeches in the first two books of Thucydides <pause dur="0.6"/> a lot of times when the narrative stops <pause dur="0.4"/> Pericles comes on the stage <pause dur="0.3"/> and Thucydides gives us <pause dur="0.2"/> as it were a verbatim report <pause dur="0.4"/> of what Pericles said <pause dur="0.6"/> to the Athenian democracy <pause dur="0.8"/> probably not actually his original words probably <pause dur="0.5"/> a # # <pause dur="0.5"/> a write-up by Thucydides a fictionalized account <pause dur="0.4"/> but <pause dur="0.3"/> this gives us the 
impression of of that Pericles was the most important statesman we get words <pause dur="0.5"/> put into his mouth <pause dur="0.3"/> nobody else <pause dur="0.2"/> gets <pause dur="0.5"/> so many speeches <pause dur="0.5"/> so it gives the impression of this important person <pause dur="1.3"/> we also get occasional <pause dur="0.5"/> paragraphs of direct praise we're going to be looking at one of these <pause dur="0.4"/> # later on where <pause dur="0.6"/> <trunc>per</trunc> where Thucydides says <pause dur="0.3"/> <reading>Pericles was the best <pause dur="0.2"/> leader of the time <pause dur="0.3"/> and after his death <pause dur="0.2"/> Athens went downhill</reading> <pause dur="4.2"/> if we actually look however at events Thucydides says Pericles was involved in <pause dur="0.9"/> # there are very few <pause dur="0.2"/> and we'll come to that <pause dur="0.2"/> in a moment <pause dur="0.5"/> there are actually very few events Thucydides <pause dur="0.4"/> himself can pin <pause dur="0.3"/> on Pericles for all the praise <pause dur="0.4"/> for all the speeches he gets <pause dur="0.4"/> there aren't that many things Pericles <pause dur="0.4"/> is actually said to have done <pause dur="2.6"/> Thucydides <pause dur="2.0"/> sets the agenda <pause dur="0.3"/> then <pause dur="0.3"/> for how <pause dur="0.8"/> Pericles and fifth century Athens <pause dur="0.3"/> would be seen <pause dur="0.3"/> in later generations <pause dur="2.7"/> including in <pause dur="0.2"/> in the history books that you'll look at so the fifth century for Thucydides <pause dur="0.3"/> is <pause dur="0.5"/> the Persian Wars <pause dur="0.8"/> four-ninety four-eighty <pause dur="0.7"/> then <pause dur="0.3"/> 
the fifty year period <pause dur="0.3"/> between the Persian Wars and the Peloponnesian War we've talked about <pause dur="0.5"/> Pentekontaetia <pause dur="1.1"/> then the Peloponnesian War <pause dur="0.6"/> so <pause dur="0.3"/> there's <pause dur="1.4"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> Thucydides' view of the fifth century <pause dur="0.6"/> we've had cause already to question <pause dur="0.4"/> that how have we questioned <pause dur="1.0"/> that how have we said that view of the fifth century is <pause dur="0.6"/> really Thucydides' construction what <pause dur="2.4"/> what </u><u who="sf0018" trans="overlap"> everybody else <pause dur="0.2"/> thought of it as <pause dur="0.3"/> three separate words <gap reason="inaudible" extent="3 secs"/> </u><u who="nm0007" trans="overlap"> yeah that's # this <pause dur="0.7"/> exactly <pause dur="0.3"/> so <pause dur="0.5"/> what you'll read in lots of history books is <pause dur="0.2"/> exactly what <pause dur="0.3"/> Thucydides said <pause dur="0.3"/> that you get <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="1.8"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="18"/> Persian War <pause dur="0.3"/> then this fifty year period of Athens growing power <pause dur="0.4"/> and then <pause dur="0.3"/> the Peloponnesian War and it's basically the end of the fifth century four-o-four <pause dur="2.8"/> 
# <pause dur="0.8"/> we've said well actually the Peloponnesian War you could <pause dur="0.7"/> this is an artificial construct of Thucydides' <pause dur="0.3"/> to say the Peloponnesian War is four-three-one to four-o-four <pause dur="0.4"/> the they're fighting the Spartans and their allies as far back as <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="1"/> four-six-one <pause dur="0.8"/> this is there are lots of other ways of presenting Athenian history <pause dur="0.3"/> similarly <pause dur="0.2"/> well Persian Wars <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> peace isn't made with Persia until four-four-six <pause dur="0.9"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="2"/> a peace treaty is signed with <pause dur="0.5"/> # <trunc>a</trunc> between Athens and Persia <pause dur="0.3"/> so <pause dur="0.3"/> already we're seeing that Thucydides constructs history <pause dur="0.7"/> in his way it's not wrong but it's <pause dur="0.4"/> just one way of <pause dur="0.4"/> setting out the events <pause dur="0.4"/> so <pause dur="0.2"/> another part of Thucydides' construction <pause dur="0.4"/> of the fifth century <pause dur="0.3"/> is <pause dur="0.3"/> Pericles <pause dur="1.2"/> as the leader of good <pause dur="0.5"/> moderate <pause dur="0.2"/> democracy <pause dur="0.2"/> when Pericles is in power <pause dur="0.4"/> democracy is basically good <pause dur="0.5"/> because there's an aristocrat in power at the head of it <pause dur="0.4"/> and after Pericles' death <pause dur="0.4"/> it goes 
downhill <pause dur="1.0"/> so this is how Thucydides presents it <pause dur="0.6"/> good democracy <pause dur="0.4"/> Pericles and before Pericles <pause dur="0.4"/> radical <pause dur="0.3"/> democracy in other words over the top <pause dur="0.2"/> democracy <pause dur="0.5"/> after Pericles' death <pause dur="2.3"/> why <pause dur="0.8"/> is he <pause dur="0.2"/> so fond of Pericles why does he give this such a positive <pause dur="0.4"/> picture <pause dur="0.3"/> of Pericles <pause dur="0.4"/> as we've <pause dur="0.3"/> we talked about at the start <pause dur="0.3"/> both Pericles and Thucydides are aristocrats <pause dur="0.4"/> Thucydides opposed to the developed democracy <pause dur="1.0"/> # we know of <pause dur="1.8"/> <trunc>i</trunc> it seems from reading Thucydides' treatment of the oligarchic coups <pause dur="0.4"/> in the Peloponnesian War <pause dur="0.3"/> that he approved of <pause dur="0.2"/> these right wing regimes he gives them quite good <pause dur="0.4"/> write-ups these times when democracy's overthrown <pause dur="0.4"/> briefly <pause dur="0.5"/> so <pause dur="1.3"/> therefore he's <pause dur="0.7"/> # emotionally inclined <pause dur="0.5"/> to <pause dur="0.5"/> be in favour of <pause dur="0.4"/> an aristocratic leader <pause dur="0.5"/> in the democracy and before the democracy became more <pause dur="0.2"/> democratic before it really took off <pause dur="0.4"/> towards the end of the fifth century <pause dur="3.4"/> this <pause dur="0.2"/> picture <pause dur="0.2"/> has been influential <pause dur="0.3"/> then <pause dur="0.3"/> for later <pause dur="0.4"/> classicists this picture <pause dur="0.4"/> from Thucydides <pause dur="1.2"/> has been influential in later classicists in 
particular <pause dur="0.5"/> the <pause dur="0.7"/> classicists of the ancient world like Plutarch <pause dur="0.2"/> in other words people living centuries later <pause dur="0.4"/> looking back and admiring <pause dur="0.3"/> the classical world and thinking that everything from the classical <pause dur="0.5"/> world in other words <pause dur="0.3"/> the days of Athenian greatness and democracy <pause dur="0.6"/> was best <pause dur="0.8"/> <trunc>ad</trunc> admiring that world <pause dur="0.5"/> Plutarch <pause dur="1.9"/> having read Thucydides <pause dur="0.3"/> places Pericles at the high point of Athenian democracy <pause dur="0.4"/> and writes as we'll see next week <pause dur="0.3"/> a very very positive <pause dur="0.4"/> account <pause dur="0.3"/> of Pericles <pause dur="1.2"/> there's long sections in Plutarch's Life of <pause dur="0.4"/> admiration for what he calls <pause dur="0.6"/> # Pericles' <pause dur="0.5"/> aristocratic <pause dur="0.2"/> government <pause dur="0.8"/> now you can immediately see <pause dur="0.3"/> that <pause dur="0.3"/> is a contradiction in terms historically speaking why <pause dur="0.4"/> why <trunc>i</trunc> is that a contradiction in terms <pause dur="0.5"/> aristocratic government <pause dur="0.4"/> of Athenian <pause dur="0.5"/> democracy </u><pause dur="0.5"/> <u who="sf0019" trans="pause"> <unclear>because it was a democracy</unclear> </u><pause dur="0.7"/> <u who="nm0007" trans="pause"> it was a democracy <pause dur="0.2"/> that's right it was a democracy <pause dur="0.5"/> # so to talk of it as an aristocratic <pause dur="0.4"/> government <pause dur="0.5"/> is both <pause dur="0.3"/> incorrect historically speaking but also reveals <pause dur="0.6"/> what's going on in the minds of someone like

comes into <pause dur="0.3"/> the modern world <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> when <pause dur="0.2"/> in the nineteenth century <pause dur="0.3"/> historians started looking <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> in earnest at Ancient Greece <pause dur="0.4"/> people like <pause dur="0.3"/> # George Grote who wrote one of the early <pause dur="0.8"/> histories of Greece <pause dur="0.4"/> # were impressed <pause dur="0.2"/> by Pericles in the same way <pause dur="0.5"/> and <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> one can see why <pause dur="0.3"/> the presentation of Pericles by Thucydides appealed <pause dur="0.4"/> to these liberals of the nineteenth century <pause dur="0.3"/> because <pause dur="0.4"/> he wasn't <pause dur="0.5"/> a a monarch <pause dur="0.6"/> he wasn't # somebody a a kind of ruler <pause dur="0.4"/> that nineteenth century liberals would be opposed to he wasn't a monarch an emperor <pause dur="0.5"/> he was <pause dur="0.8"/> # in a a a state with a broader political base <pause dur="0.4"/> but <pause dur="0.3"/> he opposed <pause dur="0.4"/> according to Thucydides <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="1.2"/> the <trunc>m</trunc> the masses the rabble he wasn't a demagogue <pause dur="0.5"/> he was an <trunc>en</trunc> an enlightened leader <pause dur="0.3"/> controlling the masses in their own for their own good <pause dur="1.0"/> so <pause dur="0.7"/> Pericles gets a very good press <pause dur="0.3"/> from <pause dur="1.2"/> # <pause dur="0.9"/> intellectuals <pause dur="0.5"/> powerful <pause dur="0.2"/> people of the nineteenth century who <trunc>ha</trunc> who saw themselves as a bit like <pause dur="0.4"/> Thucydides' Pericles someone who could <pause dur="0.6"/> who was <pause dur="0.3"/> working in a kind of democracy <pause dur="0.3"/> but <pause dur="0.5"/> keeping the 
people <pause dur="0.3"/> in their place <pause dur="0.2"/> a democracy where the people respected their leaders <pause dur="0.4"/> and stayed in their place <pause dur="3.8"/> we've looked <pause dur="0.3"/> then <pause dur="0.3"/> at <pause dur="0.4"/> Thucydides' picture of Pericles <pause dur="0.8"/> and we've looked at the influence of that picture <pause dur="1.1"/> we've looked at the influence on <pause dur="0.2"/> Plutarch and later <pause dur="0.6"/> ancient writers and the influence on the modern <pause dur="0.5"/> on modernish <pause dur="0.3"/> # writers and through into <pause dur="0.5"/> the twentieth and twenty-first century <pause dur="3.9"/> we now go on to ask the question well what evidence is there <pause dur="0.4"/> actually <pause dur="0.3"/> for <pause dur="0.4"/> Pericles <pause dur="0.3"/> what <pause dur="0.2"/> what evidence is there <pause dur="0.3"/> for <pause dur="0.2"/> him being considered important <pause dur="0.4"/> in his own day <pause dur="4.4"/> well <pause dur="0.7"/> if we look at Thucydides what Thucydides actually associates Pericles with what actions <pause dur="0.4"/> Thucydides says Pericles <pause dur="0.4"/> did <pause dur="0.8"/> we see that there's very little concrete <pause dur="1.0"/> # that <pause dur="0.2"/> Pericles is associated with <pause dur="0.7"/> lots of speeches in Pericles' mouth lots of praise of <pause dur="0.3"/> what a great leader Pericles was <pause dur="0.4"/> but very little <pause dur="0.5"/> to actually put down to his agency <pause dur="0.4"/> so i've put down on the handout <pause dur="0.4"/> the list of what <pause dur="0.4"/> his great <pause dur="0.8"/> admirer <pause dur="0.3"/> Thucydides actually says 
about Pericles <pause dur="0.3"/> well <pause dur="0.3"/> he mentions him as commanding a fleet briefly <pause dur="0.4"/> on campaign in the four-fifties <pause dur="0.3"/> okay he was a he was a general one of ten generals <pause dur="0.5"/> in the four-fifties <pause dur="1.2"/> he mentions him <pause dur="0.3"/> as on campaign suppressing revolts <pause dur="0.4"/> in <pause dur="0.4"/> islands revolting from the Athenian empire <pause dur="0.4"/> in <pause dur="0.2"/> the four-forties Euboia <pause dur="0.4"/> and Samos so again <pause dur="0.3"/> a general <pause dur="0.2"/> of which there were ten <pause dur="0.2"/> at any one time <pause dur="3.0"/> he <pause dur="2.1"/> has him <pause dur="0.4"/> # involved in <pause dur="0.3"/> the <pause dur="0.2"/> negotiations and the decision about whether to go to war with Sparta <pause dur="0.3"/> in four-three-one <pause dur="1.0"/> and that seems to be <pause dur="0.2"/> there were mentions in comic poets of this as well of <pause dur="0.6"/> the fact that <pause dur="0.3"/> Pericles <pause dur="0.3"/> perhaps encouraged Athens to go to war for private reasons this kind of thing <pause dur="0.3"/> so <pause dur="0.3"/> that seems to be something Pericles is <trunc>ac</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> actually associated with <pause dur="0.5"/> and we get him dying of plague <pause dur="0.2"/> in four-two-nine <pause dur="0.7"/> so this is what <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> the concrete <pause dur="0.3"/> events <pause dur="0.5"/> Thucydides actually <pause dur="0.3"/> # gives to Pericles <pause dur="1.5"/> we only <pause dur="0.9"/> get the <trunc>impr</trunc> we only get <pause dur="0.4"/> # evidence there for him <trunc>ac</trunc> actually at the centre of power <pause dur="0.6"/> making speeches in the Assembly <pause dur="0.3"/> having any part in <pause dur="0.3"/> decisions as opposed to being a general for a few years before <pause dur="0.6"/> and at the start of the Peloponnesian War <pause dur="1.7"/> 
what about in the next century what about as people <pause dur="0.4"/> as <pause dur="0.3"/> orators <pause dur="0.3"/> looked back on the fifth century <pause dur="0.7"/> in the fourth from the fourth century <pause dur="1.0"/> what did they say about Pericles <pause dur="0.3"/> well the really <trunc>s</trunc> this is the the really surprising <pause dur="0.2"/> fact <pause dur="0.3"/> but if you go through all the hundreds of speeches <pause dur="0.4"/> made by Athenian orators <pause dur="0.3"/> in the fourth century <pause dur="0.7"/> in a lot of which they look back to the fifth century and say to their audience <pause dur="0.5"/> we should stand up to Macedonia <pause dur="0.3"/> now <pause dur="0.3"/> because we're the people who stood up to the Persians we're the people who stood up to the Spartans <pause dur="0.3"/> and you've got to show yourselves worthy of your great ancestors <pause dur="0.6"/> when <pause dur="0.4"/> fourth century <pause dur="0.3"/> speakers <pause dur="0.2"/> make this kind of appeal to the past <pause dur="0.4"/> to the <pause dur="0.2"/> to the glories of the past <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> Pericles is hardly ever <pause dur="0.5"/> mentioned <pause dur="1.0"/> lots of other leaders of the fifth century Themistocles Cimon <pause dur="0.4"/> Aristides <pause dur="0.4"/> other people <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> that you could think

never sought power <pause dur="0.3"/> from any wrong motive</reading> says Thucydides <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> there's no way of knowing that <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> <reading>he was under no necessity <pause dur="0.3"/> of flattering them <pause dur="0.4"/> in fact <pause dur="0.3"/> he was so highly respected <pause dur="0.3"/> that he was able to speak angrily to them <pause dur="0.2"/> and contradict them</reading> <pause dur="0.5"/> so Pericles as someone who <pause dur="0.4"/> led the people and didn't flatter them <pause dur="0.5"/> well <pause dur="1.9"/> what <pause dur="0.2"/> was it that Plato said about Pericles <pause dur="0.3"/> we looked talked about this last week <pause dur="1.0"/> to do with <pause dur="0.4"/> flattering the people <pause dur="2.2"/> what <pause dur="0.2"/> what <pause dur="0.5"/> # </u><u who="sf0045" trans="latching"> he called him a demagogue <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> the others </u><u who="nm0007" trans="latching"> he called him a demagogue like all the others like other <pause dur="0.3"/> leaders of the democracy <pause dur="0.3"/> and <pause dur="0.7"/> <trunc>peric</trunc> and <pause dur="0.2"/> Plato associated Pericles with one particular <pause dur="0.7"/> # event one particular <pause dur="0.5"/> # deed political deed </u><pause dur="0.5"/> <u who="sm0046" trans="pause"> jury pay </u><u who="nm0007" trans="latching"> jury pay introducing pay <pause dur="0.4"/> for the juries <pause dur="0.3"/> which <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> Plato <pause dur="0.6"/> saw <pause dur="0.2"/> as flattery of the people in other words <pause dur="0.3"/> that <pause dur="0.3"/> you're giving the people cash <pause dur="1.0"/> for something which <pause dur="0.3"/> rich <trunc>peop</trunc> sitting on juries which should in the view of aristocrats like <pause dur="0.5"/> # Plato <pause dur="0.3"/> be done for free by rich people <pause dur="0.3"/> and <pause dur="0.3"/> Pericles <pause dur="0.3"/> gives money and <pause dur="0.5"/> Plato saw 
this as flattering the people to win power to win votes <pause dur="0.5"/> so <pause dur="0.3"/> here we say have Thucydides denying he flattered the people and we can see therefore that it's not <pause dur="0.2"/> quite so simple <pause dur="0.6"/> so again we have <pause dur="0.6"/> Thucydides' praise of Pericles not <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.8"/> as straightforward or as objective as we might think <pause dur="1.7"/> <reading>certainly when he saw they were going too far in a mood of <trunc>over-con</trunc> <pause dur="0.4"/> confidence <pause dur="0.3"/> he would bring <pause dur="0.2"/> bring to them a sense of their dangers and when they were discouraged for no good reason <pause dur="0.3"/> he would restore their confidence <pause dur="0.2"/> so <pause dur="0.4"/> in what was nominally a democracy <pause dur="0.4"/> power was really in the hands of the first <pause dur="0.3"/> citizen</reading> <pause dur="1.1"/> really <pause dur="0.6"/> a wish <pause dur="1.1"/> of Thucydides of how it should <pause dur="0.4"/> be <pause dur="0.5"/> how a state should be <pause dur="0.4"/> you should have power <pause dur="0.4"/> in the hands of the first citizen <pause dur="0.8"/> # not necessarily how it actually <pause dur="0.4"/> was <pause dur="0.6"/> <reading>but his successors <pause dur="0.3"/> were more on a level with each other <pause dur="0.4"/> and each one of them <pause dur="0.3"/> aimed at occupying the first place <pause dur="0.4"/> adopting methods of demagogy</reading> <pause dur="0.2"/> well we saw Plato <pause dur="0.4"/> thought Pericles was a demagogue <pause dur="0.4"/> <reading>which resulted in their losing 
control <pause dur="0.3"/> over the actual <pause dur="0.3"/> conduct of affairs <pause dur="0.4"/> such a policy <pause dur="0.3"/> in a great city with an empire to govern <pause dur="0.3"/> naturally led to a number of mistakes <pause dur="0.3"/> amongst which was the Sicilian expedition</reading> now we think Thucydides is going to say <pause dur="0.9"/> they shouldn't have sent out a fleet <pause dur="0.2"/> they should have abided by Pericles' policy not <pause dur="0.4"/> # try to expand the empire they should have just stayed <pause dur="0.6"/> and # bided their time <pause dur="0.4"/> but he doesn't actually say that <pause dur="0.3"/> <reading>though in this case the mistake was not so much an error of judgement <pause dur="0.4"/> with regard to the opposition <pause dur="0.4"/> to be expected <pause dur="0.3"/> as a failure on the part of those who were at home <pause dur="0.4"/> to give proper support to their forces overseas</reading> <pause dur="2.0"/> people think this bit <pause dur="0.6"/> # must have been added <pause dur="0.5"/> after <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> the Peloponnesian War <pause dur="0.3"/> towards the end of the Peloponnesian War <pause dur="0.4"/> when Thucydides changes his view <pause dur="0.4"/> about the way the war was going and actually <pause dur="0.2"/> he seems to suggest there that <pause dur="0.4"/> decisive action <pause dur="0.4"/> overseas <pause dur="0.7"/> might have been the best idea <pause dur="0.7"/> once Thucydides himself writing his History <pause dur="0.5"/> 
has actually seen Persia come into the war <pause dur="0.6"/> he's changing his his view there so this sentence if not more of <pause dur="0.3"/> it is thought by scholars to be an insertion <pause dur="0.4"/> by Thucydides that ah well <pause dur="0.3"/> maybe <pause dur="0.2"/> the Sicilian expedition wasn't such a bad thing after all maybe the idea <pause dur="0.4"/> was quite good <pause dur="0.2"/> maybe Alcabiades who led the expedition could have defeated <pause dur="0.6"/> the Spartans <pause dur="0.2"/> and the mistake was that it wasn't supported properly <pause dur="0.4"/> from home and they recalled Alcabiades and <pause dur="0.5"/> the the expedition went to pot <pause dur="0.7"/> # so <pause dur="0.7"/> just you could just mark that as a later insertion <pause dur="0.2"/> by Thucydides probably <pause dur="0.5"/> from the context <pause dur="1.9"/> <reading>because they were so busy with their own personal intrigues</reading> <pause dur="0.2"/> picking up the passage again <pause dur="0.4"/> <reading>for securing the leadership of the people <pause dur="0.3"/> they</reading> that is post-Pericles leaders <pause dur="0.3"/> <reading>allowed this expedition to lose its impetus <pause dur="0.4"/> and by quarrelling amongst themselves began to bring confusion <pause dur="0.3"/> into the policy of the state <pause dur="0.4"/> and yet after losing most of their fleet <pause dur="0.3"/> and all of the other forces in Sicily <pause dur="0.3"/> 
with revolutions already breaking out in Athens <pause dur="0.3"/> they nonetheless held out for eight years against their original enemies <pause dur="0.4"/> which were now reinforced by the Sicilians <pause dur="0.3"/> against their own allies most of which had revolted <pause dur="0.3"/> and against Cyrus <pause dur="0.2"/> son of the King of Persia <pause dur="0.3"/> who later joined the other side <pause dur="0.3"/> and provided the Peloponnesians with money <pause dur="0.3"/> for their fleet <pause dur="0.8"/> and in the end it was only because they'd destroyed themselves by their own internal strife <pause dur="0.4"/> that finally they were forced to surrender <pause dur="0.3"/> so <pause dur="0.4"/> overwhelmingly great were the resources which Pericles had in mind at the time <pause dur="0.3"/> when he prophesied an easy victory <pause dur="0.3"/> for Athens over the Peloponnesians alone</reading> <pause dur="0.5"/> so <pause dur="0.2"/> we can see there Thucydides changing his ground a bit <pause dur="0.3"/> that it's not that <pause dur="0.5"/> Pericles' policy was correct <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> Thucydides has seen the failure of Pericles' policy the Persians enter the war <pause dur="0.5"/> it's that <pause dur="0.3"/> well <pause dur="0.9"/> he left <pause dur="0.2"/> Athens very strong <pause dur="0.6"/> and the fact they survived for so long proves it but not that his war policy was great so <pause dur="1.1"/> the 
second half of that passage at least is a retrospect <pause dur="0.5"/> by <pause dur="0.3"/> Thucydides taking into account later <pause dur="0.4"/> events <pause dur="0.2"/> in the war <pause dur="2.4"/> Thucydides two-sixty-five is the <pause dur="1.0"/> passage for <pause dur="0.3"/> the later history of the image of Pericles <pause dur="0.6"/> so very important to fix that one <pause dur="0.4"/> in your mind and <trunc>p</trunc> and we'll see next lecture Plutarch exploiting <pause dur="0.5"/> this passage <pause dur="1.5"/> if we return <pause dur="0.3"/> briefly to <pause dur="0.4"/> the actual <pause dur="0.6"/> handout of the lecture <pause dur="0.4"/> just run through briefly <pause dur="3.7"/> one or two other things about the importance of Pericles we've looked at <pause dur="0.8"/> what Thucydides says about him <pause dur="0.3"/> the <pause dur="0.2"/> praise of Pericles <pause dur="0.6"/> and yet the lack of hard evidence of Pericles being important <pause dur="0.7"/> we've looked at <pause dur="0.2"/> one example of this praise <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="1.7"/> Aristotle <pause dur="1.3"/> very much carries on <pause dur="0.2"/> this idea of Thucydides plainly relies on <pause dur="0.3"/> Thucydides has read <pause dur="0.4"/> Thucydides <pause dur="0.5"/> he associates him with two measures the citizenship law the introduction of jury pay <pause dur="1.5"/> these two <trunc>wo</trunc> the one of which we mentioned just before <pause dur="2.6"/> and <pause dur="0.9"/> sees sees this as part of Pericles' rivalry <pause dur="0.5"/> with <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> his <pause dur="0.2"/> with <pause dur="0.2"/> other aristocratic <pause dur="0.3"/> leaders <pause dur="0.8"/> 
so <pause dur="0.5"/> Aristotle presents these measures by Pericles like the introduction of jury pay <pause dur="0.4"/> as a means of winning popular support <pause dur="0.4"/> as a a <pause dur="0.3"/> means of of <pause dur="0.2"/> bribing the people you give them <pause dur="0.4"/> money for the jury <pause dur="0.4"/> you restrict citizenship so the citizens get the benefits <pause dur="0.4"/> of the the money pouring into Athens so for Aristotle though influenced by Thucydides <pause dur="0.4"/> there's there is this sense of Pericles as <pause dur="1.1"/> a demagogue as not so different from <pause dur="0.5"/> later <pause dur="0.3"/> leaders <pause dur="0.3"/> you don't have this sense of everybody was worse <pause dur="0.4"/> than Pericles it went downhill after Pericles <pause dur="0.6"/> with Aristotle Pericles is the start of it going downhill <pause dur="0.6"/> with these measures to bribe the people as <pause dur="0.4"/> as <pause dur="0.5"/> Aristotle would see it <pause dur="4.8"/> i've put just there finally you can read it that <pause dur="0.3"/> there's basically no other <pause dur="0.2"/> legislation <pause dur="0.4"/> associated with Pericles <pause dur="0.4"/> there's even an attempt <pause dur="0.3"/> by <pause dur="0.5"/> 
# one historian <pause dur="0.3"/> Mattingly <pause dur="0.5"/> # to <pause dur="0.2"/> redate a lot of the <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> measures concerning the Athenian empire <pause dur="0.2"/> preserved on <trunc>i</trunc> the evidence for these is inscriptions <pause dur="0.5"/> from the four-forties when Pericles could have had something to do with them <pause dur="0.5"/> to the four-twenties <pause dur="0.7"/> and this is a very technical argument about the letter styles of inscriptions <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> but <pause dur="0.2"/> you could just file that away in your mind that somebody reckons that <pause dur="0.5"/> even <pause dur="0.2"/> some of the events of the four-forties to do with the Athenian empire <pause dur="0.3"/> which could <pause dur="0.4"/> have <pause dur="0.3"/> possibly been associated with Pericles there's no evidence for it <pause dur="0.3"/> might not even have happened till after his death anyway <pause dur="2.3"/> so we leave it there we've talked about <trunc>th</trunc> <pause dur="0.3"/> Thucydides <pause dur="0.4"/> and <pause dur="0.4"/> his influence on later tradition next time we look at <pause dur="0.7"/> Plutarch's biography <pause dur="0.4"/> of Pericles <pause dur="1.5"/> as <pause dur="0.5"/> always there are <pause dur="0.2"/> back handouts <pause dur="0.2"/> for previous lectures here <pause dur="0.4"/> if you missed any
