<u who="nm0097"> okay i'll i'll begin then <pause dur="0.3"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> # just for a bit of atmosphere if you feel you want to break into spontaneous applause <vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" dur="2" n="ss"/> throw flowers cheers of bravo <pause dur="0.5"/> rush up for my autograph any of that feel free <pause dur="1.3"/> so <pause dur="0.4"/> today we're turning to landscape and representations of the rural <pause dur="0.3"/> having concentrated on Paris for the last few weeks <pause dur="0.4"/> and i want to begin by making <pause dur="0.5"/> a general <pause dur="0.2"/> but i think a highly significant point <pause dur="0.5"/> that underpins <pause dur="0.3"/> the bulk of landscape production in nineteenth century France <pause dur="0.2"/> and indeed elsewhere as well <pause dur="0.3"/> and it's this <pause dur="1.2"/> landscapes are produced in <pause dur="0.3"/> and for <pause dur="0.5"/> the city <pause dur="1.4"/> landscape is an essentially <pause dur="0.2"/> urban genre <pause dur="1.0"/> and wherever artists may physically paint their pictures <pause dur="0.6"/> which is of course very often in urban studios <pause dur="0.6"/> the controlling institutions <pause dur="0.8"/> # audiences exhibitions dealers <pause dur="0.9"/> all belong to Paris or Rome or London or some other large urban centre <pause dur="1.2"/> and indeed one might say that <pause dur="0.8"/> the very idea of the rural <pause dur="0.3"/> the very idea of the city <pause dur="0.3"/> is <trunc>construc</trunc> # <trunc>s</trunc> of of the country i beg your pardon is constructed in <pause dur="0.3"/> the city <pause dur="4.3"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> now 
since the end of the seventeenth century <pause dur="0.5"/> French academic art theory had distinguished between two kinds of landscape <pause dur="1.3"/> firstly <pause dur="0.3"/> historical landscape <pause dur="0.3"/> or <distinct lang="fr">paysage historique</distinct> <pause dur="1.5"/> and secondly rural landscape <pause dur="0.5"/> or <distinct lang="fr">paysage champêtre</distinct> <pause dur="2.3"/> the first of these categories historical landscape <pause dur="0.4"/> is best represented by the two great <pause dur="0.2"/> seventeenth century masters of the genre <pause dur="0.8"/> Poussin and Claude <pause dur="0.5"/> and here we've got on the right <pause dur="0.4"/> by Claude <pause dur="0.2"/> which is just spelled <pause dur="0.2"/> like the name Claude <pause dur="0.5"/> # The Judgement of Paris <pause dur="3.1"/> and on the left <pause dur="0.5"/> Poussin's <pause dur="0.4"/> landscape <pause dur="0.7"/> with Orpheus and Euridice <pause dur="0.4"/> or Euridice <pause dur="0.4"/> and they're both from about the middle of the seventeenth century <pause dur="2.2"/> and you can see <pause dur="0.3"/> what function the landscape has here it's <pause dur="0.5"/> basically an arena a setting <pause dur="0.2"/> which includes some of the elements of history painting <pause dur="0.8"/> a mythological or sometimes a biblical subject <pause dur="0.6"/> classical architecture <pause dur="0.3"/> an episode from ancient history <pause dur="0.9"/> whatever <pause dur="1.0"/> so that's historical landscape <pause dur="1.4"/> the second category <pause dur="0.9"/> <distinct lang="fr">paysage champêtre</distinct> or rural landscape <pause dur="0.6"/> was 
used to refer to <pause dur="0.2"/> something like this <kinesic desc="indicates slide" iterated="n"/> the image on the right <pause dur="0.4"/> which is a seventeenth century Dutch <pause dur="0.2"/> landscape <pause dur="0.5"/> by Ruisdael <pause dur="0.2"/> and that's spelled R-U-I-S-<pause dur="0.5"/>D-A-E-L <pause dur="1.1"/> it's just called Landscape <pause dur="1.8"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> as you can see <kinesic desc="indicates slides" iterated="n"/> in the comparison here <pause dur="0.5"/> there seem to be fewer rules it's a more casual or more <trunc>s</trunc> straightforward look <pause dur="0.4"/> at nature <pause dur="2.9"/> this distinction between historical and rural <pause dur="0.2"/> is very much in operation in the early part of the nineteenth century <pause dur="0.7"/> and the story that i'm going to be telling in the next <pause dur="0.3"/> # three lectures <pause dur="0.5"/> is <pause dur="0.3"/> of <pause dur="1.0"/> the <pause dur="0.2"/> original primacy of historical landscape <pause dur="0.3"/> the way that's gradually undermined <pause dur="0.2"/> by the ascendance of rural landscape <pause dur="0.7"/> # and the way then that changes to introduce new forms of landscape <pause dur="0.3"/> so this is in a way the first instalment of <pause dur="0.3"/> a trilogy <pause dur="3.5"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> now in the Academy <pause dur="0.4"/> the powerful ruling body of French art <pause dur="1.3"/> who organize training and production <pause dur="0.7"/> as we know landscape wasn't considered <pause dur="0.2"/> particularly <pause dur="0.2"/> worthy as a genre <pause dur="0.7"/> and in the hierarchy of <trunc>res</trunc> of genres you'll remember <pause dur="0.2"/> it trails behind history painting and 
portrait painting and animal painting <pause dur="0.2"/> so it's quite low down <pause dur="0.7"/> in this sort of hierarchy <pause dur="2.0"/> one <pause dur="0.5"/> the shining examples of <pause dur="0.2"/> Claude and Poussin <pause dur="0.9"/> gave landscape <pause dur="0.2"/> quite an eminent history <pause dur="0.7"/> the genre was <pause dur="0.4"/> insufficient in two main respects <pause dur="1.3"/> firstly <pause dur="0.4"/> landscape was seen as less morally elevating <pause dur="0.4"/> than history painting <pause dur="1.0"/> images like these <pause dur="0.4"/><kinesic desc="indicates slide" iterated="n"/> this is a <pause dur="0.2"/> a painting by an artist called Drouais <pause dur="1.6"/> and it's called Marius at Minternae <pause dur="0.2"/> from seventeen-eighty-six a bit of <pause dur="0.2"/> Roman history <pause dur="0.8"/><kinesic desc="indicates slide" iterated="n"/> and on the <pause dur="1.0"/> right on your right here <pause dur="0.2"/> Ingres' painting from eighteen-o-one <pause dur="0.5"/> Achilles Receiving the Ambassadors of Agamemnon <pause dur="1.7"/> and i just put those up as examples of <pause dur="0.5"/> history painting <pause dur="0.3"/> the most elevated kind <pause dur="1.0"/> so landscape can't fulfil the same moral and didactic <pause dur="0.2"/> functions <pause dur="0.2"/> as <kinesic desc="indicates slides" iterated="n"/> images like this according to the Academy <pause dur="0.2"/> that's the first problem with it <pause dur="0.9"/> secondly <pause dur="0.2"/> and a kind of corollary of that <pause dur="0.9"/> the landscape artist was viewed as less erudite <pause dur="3.0"/> a landscape painting like <pause dur="0.4"/> the Ruisdael for instance <pause dur="0.6"/> would seem to show no signs of 
scholarship <pause dur="0.5"/> no signs of <pause dur="0.3"/> ethical subtlety <pause dur="0.3"/> no signs of antiquarian learning <pause dur="1.2"/> and the Academy was very keen on promoting the idea of the artist as <pause dur="0.3"/> a learned scholarly <pause dur="0.2"/> professional <pause dur="3.1"/> so landscape deficient <pause dur="0.3"/> both because it wasn't <pause dur="0.4"/> elevated and moral enough <pause dur="0.2"/> and because the artist who produced it <pause dur="0.5"/> wasn't scholarly <pause dur="0.5"/> enough himself <pause dur="0.8"/> but it's worth mentioning that in spite of this <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> huge numbers of landscapes were produced <pause dur="0.3"/> and all the way through the eighteen-tens eighteen-twenties and into the eighteen-thirties <pause dur="0.5"/> as many of a third as a third of all entries in the Salon would be landscapes <pause dur="0.4"/> so of all the artists in Paris <pause dur="0.6"/> a third of them <pause dur="0.2"/> would at any time probably be painting <pause dur="0.4"/> landscapes so it was a popular genre nonetheless <pause dur="1.7"/> now there were considerable attempts <pause dur="0.5"/> at the end of the eighteenth and in the early nineteenth centuries <pause dur="0.6"/> to revive the flagging fortunes of historical landscape <pause dur="0.7"/> to elevate it and raise its status both <pause dur="0.3"/> aesthetically and institutionally <pause dur="1.6"/> and academicians <pause dur="0.3"/> started a kind of 
campaign i suppose to <pause dur="0.5"/> position the landscape painter as being a learned and morally forceful figure <pause dur="0.3"/> just like his colleague who painted history painting <pause dur="1.0"/> and the key figure behind this <pause dur="0.4"/> campaign <pause dur="0.7"/> is an artist called Pierre-Henri <pause dur="0.2"/> de Valenciennes <pause dur="0.3"/> and his name is spelled V-A-L-<pause dur="0.7"/>E-N-<pause dur="0.5"/>C-I-E-<pause dur="0.4"/>double-N-E-S and he's a landscape specialist who's working <pause dur="0.2"/> around the turn of the nineteenth century <pause dur="1.5"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> and here's a couple of his images <pause dur="0.5"/> this is from seventeen-ninety-three <pause dur="0.2"/> it's called Mercury and Argus </u><gap reason="break in recording" extent="uncertain"/><u who="nm0097" trans="pause"> <kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> this is Ideal Landscape <pause dur="0.5"/> with Washerwomen <pause dur="1.9"/> from eighteen-o-seven <pause dur="2.5"/> but more important than Valenciennes' painting <pause dur="0.5"/> was a textbook he published in eighteen-hundred <pause dur="0.3"/> called Elements of Practical Perspective <pause dur="1.5"/> which proved to be a very influential work right the way through the nineteenth century <pause dur="2.1"/> in his book Valenciennes defended <pause dur="0.2"/> the practice 
of landscape <pause dur="1.2"/> # but he didn't actually try and subvert the academic hierarchy <pause dur="0.3"/> his defence was mounted very much within a standard sort of academic <pause dur="0.3"/> framework <pause dur="2.1"/> and he used the conventional split between historic and <pause dur="0.2"/> rural landscape <pause dur="0.3"/> as the basis of his argument <pause dur="1.8"/> and what he wanted to do was consolidate <pause dur="0.4"/> a separate hierarchy <pause dur="0.3"/> within the genre of landscape so just as the Academy worked with an idea of <pause dur="0.4"/> a hierarchy of genres from the most elevated to the least elevated <pause dur="1.3"/> Valenciennes wanted to take landscape and create <pause dur="0.4"/> an internal hierarchy <pause dur="0.2"/> to the genre <pause dur="1.8"/> with <pause dur="0.4"/> <distinct lang="fr">paysage historique</distinct> at the top <pause dur="1.8"/> Valenciennes claimed that there were two ways of looking at nature <pause dur="0.5"/> and he says and i'm quoting now from his book <pause dur="1.4"/> <reading>the first <pause dur="0.6"/> is that in which we see nature as it is <pause dur="0.5"/> and represented and represented as faithfully as possible <pause dur="1.5"/> according to this procedure <pause dur="0.3"/> one eliminates objects that don't seem interesting enough <pause dur="0.4"/> brings forward others that fit <pause dur="0.5"/> even though they might be far away <pause dur="0.4"/> looks for harmonies and contrasts <pause dur="0.2"/> 
and finally chooses this or that view <pause dur="0.2"/> because it's more pleasing and picturesque <pause dur="1.3"/> the second <pause dur="0.7"/> is that in which we see nature as it ought to be <pause dur="0.6"/> and in the way <pause dur="0.2"/> enriched imagination <pause dur="0.3"/> presents the view to the eyes of man <pause dur="0.3"/> of genius <pause dur="0.5"/> who has seen much <pause dur="0.2"/> composed carefully <pause dur="0.5"/> and analysed and reflected <pause dur="0.2"/> upon the choice that one must make</reading> <pause dur="2.1"/> so he's <pause dur="0.9"/> talking about nature as it is <pause dur="0.5"/> as opposed to nature as it ought to be the real <pause dur="0.3"/> and the ideal <pause dur="1.4"/> and it's this latter category of course the ideal <pause dur="0.2"/> nature as it ought to be <pause dur="0.3"/> that Valenciennes holds up as the higher <pause dur="1.9"/> not only for him does it resemble history painting <pause dur="0.4"/> in its visual and moral perfection <pause dur="1.0"/> but he gives the painter of such a picture <pause dur="0.5"/> a very specific identity <pause dur="0.9"/> and in his book he makes it clear that the artist who paints <pause dur="0.4"/> historical landscape <pause dur="0.5"/> will have read the poets <pause dur="0.4"/> by which he means <pause dur="0.4"/> # the great classical poets like Homer and Virgil <pause dur="1.0"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> the painter of <distinct lang="fr">paysage</distinct> <trunc>hi</trunc> <distinct lang="fr">historique</distinct> will be able to distinguish specific customs and costumes <pause dur="0.6"/> historical and archaeological 
detail that he'll have gleaned from reading <pause dur="0.6"/> well again Homer Xenophon <pause dur="0.2"/> Pausanias <pause dur="0.4"/> Roman historians as well <pause dur="2.1"/> and <reading>the <pause dur="0.2"/> painter of <distinct lang="fr">paysage historique</distinct></reading> says Valenciennes <pause dur="0.4"/> <reading>will also understand the ethical and philosophical implications of his work</reading> <pause dur="1.2"/> so in other words Valenciennes is presenting an image of the historical landscape painter <pause dur="0.3"/> as exactly this kind of scholarly <pause dur="0.4"/> professional <pause dur="1.2"/> while the rural painter <pause dur="0.5"/> is perhaps more like an artisan <pause dur="1.1"/> historical landscape requires intellect <pause dur="1.0"/> the other requires less highbrow faculties <pause dur="3.2"/> now it's clear i think from this particular defence of landscape <pause dur="0.5"/> that <pause dur="1.0"/> various forms of the genre <pause dur="1.1"/> are invested with specific <pause dur="0.2"/> identities <pause dur="0.2"/> and in particular i think there's an issue here about class <pause dur="0.4"/> and institutional status <pause dur="0.4"/> which we might # <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> exemplify as <pause dur="0.3"/> the professional <pause dur="0.3"/> versus the artisan <pause dur="1.2"/> interestingly though this division also maps onto a kind of geographical <pause dur="0.5"/> division <pause dur="1.6"/> the professional historical landscape painter <pause dur="0.4"/> is connected to a southern tradition <pause dur="1.8"/> of the Italian 
landscape <pause dur="0.3"/> which stretches back to Roman history <pause dur="0.7"/> and Greek history <pause dur="1.8"/> while the more artisanal <pause dur="0.4"/> rural landscape painter <pause dur="0.3"/> belongs to a northern tradition <pause dur="0.2"/> exemplified by Dutch and Flemish artists <pause dur="2.7"/> so there's Valenciennes the most articulate <pause dur="0.5"/> of <pause dur="0.3"/> the defenders of the genre <pause dur="0.7"/> and the redefinition of <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> its function <pause dur="1.0"/> and <kinesic desc="indicates slide" iterated="n"/> here's just one more image by him <pause dur="0.5"/> # this is just called Arcadian Landscape <pause dur="0.4"/> from around the turn of the century <pause dur="4.9"/> now academic landscape received another huge boost in eighteen-seventeen <pause dur="0.7"/> when it was announced that in parallel <pause dur="0.2"/> with the annual Prix de Rome for history painting <pause dur="0.5"/> there would be a Prix de Rome <pause dur="0.2"/> for landscape painting <pause dur="0.2"/> to be held every four years <pause dur="1.9"/> the Prix de Rome was the most important competition <pause dur="0.4"/> in <pause dur="0.3"/> academic <pause dur="0.2"/> art education <pause dur="1.4"/> every two years a subject was set from <pause dur="0.2"/> either the classics or the Bible <pause dur="1.1"/> and every student entering it <pause dur="0.4"/> had to paint a picture <pause dur="0.5"/> of that <pause dur="0.2"/> theme <pause dur="1.2"/> and the student who was judged to have delivered the best rendition of it <pause dur="0.5"/> was sent to work 
and study <pause dur="0.3"/> in Rome <pause dur="0.4"/> which at the turn of the nineteenth century was the Mecca of the art world <pause dur="2.6"/> the Prix de Rome for landscape <pause dur="0.2"/> was to work the same way except it would be every four years but again there would be a <trunc>s</trunc> <pause dur="0.4"/> a subject set <pause dur="0.4"/> students would enter <pause dur="0.3"/> and the winner would go off to Rome to study in <pause dur="0.3"/> Italy <pause dur="1.7"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> and <pause dur="0.5"/> there we are <pause dur="0.5"/> so i'll just put up this as a <pause dur="0.4"/> kind of visual memento <pause dur="0.2"/> this is by Cogniet <pause dur="0.8"/> whose painting we looked at you remember in the seminars a few weeks ago <pause dur="0.5"/> this is called The Artist in his Room at Rome <pause dur="1.9"/> from eighteen-seventeen <pause dur="0.3"/> and it shows Cogniet who's just arrived from Paris <pause dur="0.5"/> with a rather <pause dur="0.7"/> nice Italian landscape <pause dur="0.8"/> out of the window <pause dur="4.4"/> Rome <pause dur="0.3"/> visiting Italy was considered crucial <pause dur="0.2"/> to the development of an artist <pause dur="0.9"/> it was the home of antiquity <pause dur="0.4"/> Roman antiquity <pause dur="0.5"/> it was also the home of course of the great masters most notably Raphael <pause dur="0.5"/> whom the French Academy <pause dur="0.5"/> absolutely # deified <pause dur="1.5"/> and it was felt that <pause dur="0.3"/> the artist needed to go and study these works first hand <pause dur="0.9"/> and to 
absorb the artistic ambience <pause dur="0.2"/> of Rome <pause dur="3.0"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> here's two examples of French landscape painters working in Rome <pause dur="0.8"/> one an unfinished sketch the other a highly finished picture <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> both showing one of <pause dur="0.3"/> the French artists' favourite subjects the Colosseum <pause dur="0.8"/> the image on the right <pause dur="0.3"/> the sketch <pause dur="0.4"/> is by Michallon <pause dur="0.7"/> he's spelled M-I-C-H-<pause dur="0.4"/>A-double-L-O-N <pause dur="0.4"/> which is called The View of the Colosseum <pause dur="1.2"/> from around <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.8"/> eighteen early eighteen-twenties i think <pause dur="1.5"/><kinesic desc="indicates slide" iterated="n"/>  and here on the <pause dur="0.7"/> left <pause dur="0.7"/> by an artist called Bracassat <pause dur="0.3"/> that's B-R-A-<pause dur="0.3"/>C-A-<pause dur="0.2"/>double-S-A-T <pause dur="0.4"/> the Colosseum from around eighteen-twenty <pause dur="3.3"/> note <pause dur="0.2"/> in the Bracassat <pause dur="0.4"/> how the landmark the Colosseum <pause dur="0.5"/> is contained within an ideal landscape <pause dur="1.2"/> that's very Claudian in its composition <pause dur="0.8"/> in its division between silver and shade in the foreground <pause dur="0.4"/> and then <pause dur="0.6"/> sort of this golden light on the horizon <pause dur="1.7"/> the building the focus nestles in the very centre <pause dur="0.3"/> of the image it's the focus of the image <pause dur="0.4"/> and it's as if <pause dur="0.4"/> we the viewers <pause dur="0.3"/> are positioned as tourists coming across this <pause dur="0.3"/> view <pause dur="0.6"/> as if we sort of <pause dur="0.4"/> 
walk down this path <pause dur="0.3"/> and there it is spread out before us <pause dur="0.8"/> the glorious Colosseum <pause dur="3.3"/> and what's meant to be happening here <pause dur="0.6"/> is that the <pause dur="0.4"/> meaning of the architecture <pause dur="0.6"/> is supposed to be inflecting <pause dur="0.2"/> the meaning of the landscape <pause dur="0.3"/> and vice versa <pause dur="2.3"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> and <pause dur="1.0"/> perhaps a <pause dur="1.2"/> better <trunc>e</trunc> a clearer example of what that means is this painting this is Valenciennes again <pause dur="1.0"/> # The Ancient City of <sic corr="Agrigento">Agrigentum</sic> <pause dur="0.4"/> from seventeen-eighty-seven <pause dur="4.1"/> and what Valenciennes is trying to do <pause dur="0.3"/> is trying to imbue <pause dur="0.2"/> the entire landscape <pause dur="0.2"/> with the spirit of classical antiquity <pause dur="2.7"/> so just as the <pause dur="1.4"/><kinesic desc="indicates point on slide" iterated="n"/>  togas or antique dress of the figures down here <pause dur="0.5"/> identifies them as <pause dur="1.0"/> antique <pause dur="0.5"/> morally elevated <pause dur="0.2"/> noble <pause dur="1.7"/> and just as the <pause dur="1.4"/> architecture <pause dur="0.6"/> of these classical buildings <pause dur="0.7"/> connotes <pause dur="0.4"/> antique <pause dur="0.2"/> grandeur <pause dur="0.2"/> that's now been lost <pause dur="1.5"/> so Valenciennes wanted the landscape itself <pause dur="0.2"/> the very setting <pause dur="0.6"/> to be imbued with these same ideas of <pause dur="0.3"/> moral worth <pause dur="1.0"/> grandeur <pause dur="0.6"/> elevation <pause dur="1.4"/> a sort of an ethical force <pause dur="2.9"/> so they're trying to make the landscape itself <pause dur="1.1"/> connote some 
kind of moral <pause dur="0.4"/> value <pause dur="2.8"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> so <pause dur="0.4"/> what kind of work <pause dur="0.2"/> would get a student to Italy <pause dur="0.8"/> well here are two winners <pause dur="0.3"/> of the Prix de Rome for landscape <pause dur="1.5"/> on the right <pause dur="0.5"/> the very first winner from eighteen-seventeen <pause dur="0.6"/> Michallon again <pause dur="0.6"/> and this is Democritus and the Abderites <pause dur="1.5"/> quite what's going on i don't know i have to say i <pause dur="0.3"/> have to confess ignorance and say i don't even know who the Abderites were <pause dur="1.1"/> # <pause dur="1.9"/> but if you're that interested i'm sure there's a book in the library somewhere and if you find out you can tell me <pause dur="1.1"/> # on the left by an artist called Buttura <pause dur="0.3"/> B-U-double-T-U-R-A <pause dur="2.1"/> this is the winner of eighteen-thirty-seven <pause dur="1.3"/> Apollo Attending his Flocks <pause dur="3.2"/> and i think they are both good examples of the kind of work that was demanded <pause dur="0.5"/> classical subjects <pause dur="0.2"/> very highly finished very smooth surfaces <pause dur="0.6"/> and very highly composed very sort of artificially put together <pause dur="0.8"/> the similarity of composition <pause dur="0.5"/> should be immediate at once i think the same device of <pause dur="0.3"/> trees as framing motifs <pause dur="1.3"/> and also note in both the 
trees are used to construct space <pause dur="2.3"/> the tree <pause dur="0.6"/> at the front marks the <pause dur="0.5"/> frontal plane <pause dur="1.1"/> there's another tree or a <trunc>s</trunc> bit of foliage further back which marks a middle plane <pause dur="0.5"/> and then there's a kind of horizon line which marks a <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> a plane at the back so there's this sort of planar construction <pause dur="0.5"/> to create space <pause dur="1.1"/> it's the same here <pause dur="0.9"/> frontal plane <pause dur="0.8"/> middle plane and then the backdrop <pause dur="0.3"/> almost as if they're sort of <pause dur="0.2"/> backdrops in a stage set <pause dur="5.1"/> highly # conventional <pause dur="1.6"/> # this is <pause dur="0.5"/> clearly <pause dur="0.3"/> a <pause dur="0.2"/> Claudian or Poussinesque Poussinesque <pause dur="0.6"/> # device <pause dur="1.5"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> there for instance is Claude's landscape with Isaac and Rebecca <pause dur="2.8"/> # and you can see at once that the debt to Claude <pause dur="0.4"/> in terms of composition <pause dur="0.3"/> is enormous <pause dur="1.5"/> in terms of the <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> planar organization <pause dur="0.3"/> also in the structure of light that became very traditional <pause dur="0.4"/> darks in the foreground <pause dur="0.3"/> emphasizing the framing motifs <pause dur="0.8"/> and then <pause dur="0.2"/> becoming systematically lighter <pause dur="0.4"/> towards the horizon <pause dur="1.4"/> and again that's a way of creating space it's what's known as aerial <pause dur="0.2"/> perspective <pause dur="1.0"/> create a 
sense of recession <pause dur="0.6"/> by moving from dark <pause dur="0.9"/> to light <pause dur="1.1"/> at the first point </u><gap reason="break in recording" extent="uncertain"/> <u who="nm0097" trans="pause"> so <pause dur="1.1"/> works like this <kinesic desc="indicates slides" iterated="n"/> winners of the Prix de Rome <pause dur="0.7"/> # displaying their learning <pause dur="1.0"/> full of intellectual investment <pause dur="1.4"/> showing off classicizing tendency <pause dur="0.4"/> and also very consciously <pause dur="0.4"/> using <pause dur="0.6"/> seventeenth century French models the idea of a great national style <pause dur="1.1"/> and of course in the nineteenth century many people were looking back <pause dur="0.3"/> to the seventeenth century as a kind of French golden age <pause dur="0.5"/> so clearly there's <trunc>someth</trunc> something invested here <pause dur="0.3"/> to do with national identity and sort of the <pause dur="0.3"/> French cultural prowess <pause dur="5.2"/> now you've seen how conventional <pause dur="0.3"/> these compositions are <pause dur="1.0"/> how much they conform to templates <pause dur="0.8"/> from <pause dur="0.4"/> Claude and Poussin <pause dur="1.0"/> and of course what that alerts us to at once <pause dur="0.5"/> is that these are studio paintings <pause dur="0.6"/> 
it's as if the artists haven't gone out and copied nature <pause dur="0.9"/> but they've merely gone into the Louvre or another art gallery <pause dur="0.3"/> and copied other paintings <pause dur="0.9"/> what they're representing is not the world outside <pause dur="0.4"/> but they're representing other representations <pause dur="1.9"/> but we shouldn't infer from this <pause dur="0.2"/> that study for nature wasn't undertaken <pause dur="0.2"/> by these artists <pause dur="0.6"/> one often comes across accounts <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> in sort of <pause dur="0.2"/> a lot of survey books of nineteenth century French art for instance <pause dur="0.8"/> which declare that <pause dur="0.5"/> it was the Barbizon painters or even the Impressionists who were the first to go out and paint <pause dur="0.6"/> in the open <pause dur="0.7"/> to make studies in the open air <pause dur="1.1"/> but by the turn of the nineteeenth century <pause dur="0.8"/> plein air landscape study and plein air just means in the open air <pause dur="0.6"/> was a very common <pause dur="0.8"/> academic practice <pause dur="0.5"/> and again it was one that Valenciennes <pause dur="0.4"/> had particularly encouraged <pause dur="3.0"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> and here are <pause dur="2.9"/> a couple of <pause dur="0.2"/> studies <pause dur="0.4"/> done plein air <pause dur="0.2"/> by Valenciennes <pause dur="1.0"/> here's another little quotation from his treatise <pause dur="0.3"/> The <pause dur="0.4"/> # Elements of Practical Perspective 
from eighteen-hundred <pause dur="1.4"/> he says quote <pause dur="1.1"/> <reading>my student has drawn under my direction for some months <pause dur="0.7"/> he's copied several paintings of the best masters <pause dur="0.4"/> but he has not yet looked at nature <pause dur="0.8"/> he must study it <pause dur="0.5"/> and when the weather is fine <pause dur="0.2"/> we go into the country together <pause dur="0.7"/> there i give him my views on how to make studies <pause dur="0.4"/> that may serve him later <pause dur="0.4"/> in composing pictures</reading> <pause dur="1.1"/> well that <pause dur="0.4"/> short quotation i think is very dense <pause dur="0.4"/> and <trunc>reme</trunc> reveals a lot about the workings of the academic landscape <pause dur="0.7"/> and there are three particular things i'd like to <pause dur="0.2"/> emphasize about that <pause dur="1.1"/> firstly of course <pause dur="1.0"/> simply that Valenciennes <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> stresses the importance <pause dur="0.2"/> of looking at nature and of making these sketches <pause dur="0.5"/> en plein air <pause dur="0.2"/> in the open <pause dur="0.7"/> and here's two he did in Rome from the <trunc>seventeen-se</trunc> seventies <pause dur="0.5"/> this is just known as Roofs in Sunlight <pause dur="1.4"/> and on the 
other side on the right <pause dur="0.2"/> Study of Roman Sky <pause dur="1.5"/> so these are examples of Valenciennes himself in Rome <pause dur="0.5"/> sitting outside with his paints and easel <pause dur="1.0"/> and <pause dur="1.3"/> sketching details atmospheric effects and so forth <pause dur="2.6"/> secondly <pause dur="1.5"/> we should note <pause dur="0.3"/> that Valenciennes thinks of these sketches as raw materials <pause dur="0.2"/> to be used later <pause dur="0.2"/> in a composition <pause dur="1.1"/> he says studies <pause dur="0.3"/> that will serve one later in composing pictures <pause dur="0.5"/> so it's almost as if <pause dur="0.7"/> these images <pause dur="0.3"/> are part of something like a renaissance model book a compendium of <pause dur="0.2"/> skies lighting effects natural elements foliage or so forth <pause dur="0.4"/> that the artist can refer back to <pause dur="0.4"/> when he's back in his studio <pause dur="0.8"/> and build up <pause dur="0.7"/> a more formal composition from them <pause dur="1.5"/> and of course what we witnessing there <pause dur="0.3"/> is the transition from nature as it is <pause dur="0.4"/> to nature as it should be <pause dur="0.4"/> from the empirical <pause dur="0.5"/> like this <pause dur="0.4"/> to the ideal <pause dur="0.7"/> like those Prix de Rome winners <pause dur="2.8"/> so that's the second i think important thing <pause dur="1.4"/> point <trunc>vale</trunc> Valenciennes makes about plein air painting <pause dur="1.6"/> thirdly <pause dur="0.9"/> i think we should note that <pause dur="0.2"/> 
the process only takes place <pause dur="0.5"/> after a lengthy period of instruction <pause dur="1.5"/> he began by saying <pause dur="0.2"/> <reading>my student has drawn under my direction for some months</reading> <pause dur="1.5"/> so the student has already copied other paintings <pause dur="0.5"/> copied other prints <pause dur="0.4"/> and only then will Valenciennes take him out into the open air <pause dur="0.5"/> with his paints and <pause dur="0.7"/> # a sketchbook <pause dur="1.9"/> which again reminds us that academic landscape begins with other representations <pause dur="3.9"/> and i think what's going on here is that the student Valenciennes' students students in the Academy whoever it may be <pause dur="0.7"/> are somehow being inculcated <pause dur="0.6"/> are being taught <pause dur="0.4"/> how they ought to look at nature <pause dur="0.6"/> they are given preformed modes of visual <pause dur="0.2"/> experience <trunc>pre</trunc> predetermined ways of looking at <pause dur="0.5"/> and apprehending nature <pause dur="1.5"/> so it's as if <pause dur="0.3"/> Valenciennes <pause dur="0.2"/> and other teachers <pause dur="0.3"/> want to mediate <pause dur="0.7"/> the way their students look at <pause dur="0.3"/> nature <pause dur="1.5"/> and <pause dur="0.5"/> i suppose influence <pause dur="0.7"/> how they see it <pause dur="0.2"/> and how they represent it <pause dur="1.9"/> well of course in a sense <pause dur="0.3"/> no visual experience escapes that kind of mediation <pause dur="0.6"/> we can't see 
anything in a pure way <pause dur="1.0"/> you know what we see around it is always preceded by our knowledge <pause dur="0.3"/> our preconceptions our prejudices <pause dur="0.6"/> by other representations we've seen other things we've assimilated and learned about <pause dur="0.8"/> there can be no <pause dur="0.4"/> # direct observation <pause dur="0.3"/> detached from our <pause dur="0.7"/> intellectual <pause dur="0.3"/> and perceptual make-up <pause dur="1.9"/> but what's striking here <pause dur="0.6"/> is the way that the process of artistic production <pause dur="0.2"/> the process of making a picture <pause dur="0.6"/> is structured <pause dur="0.2"/> so deliberately with representations <pause dur="0.7"/> preceding <pause dur="0.4"/> the raw material <pause dur="1.1"/> with pictures <pause dur="0.3"/> preceding nature <pause dur="1.6"/> and of course what it means is that the moment the student steps outside the studio <pause dur="0.2"/> and goes and looks <pause dur="0.7"/> at <pause dur="0.8"/> a river a pond <pause dur="0.2"/> # a tree whatever it is <pause dur="1.4"/> he already sees it in terms of landscape traditions <pause dur="0.3"/> in terms of pastoral traditions <pause dur="0.5"/> in terms of other kinds of painting <pause dur="2.8"/> and also <pause dur="0.6"/> he will also view nature <pause dur="0.4"/> as <pause dur="0.5"/> something bucolic <pause dur="0.4"/> picturesque <pause dur="0.3"/> jolly <pause dur="0.6"/> or something noble <pause dur="0.3"/> and moralizing <pause dur="1.9"/> so the landscapes he produces <pause dur="0.3"/> are firmly set within <pause dur="0.4"/> what one might call <pause dur="0.3"/> 
ideological frames <pause dur="5.1"/> now in making that claim <pause dur="1.2"/> that there's something about <pause dur="0.2"/> academic landscapes <pause dur="0.2"/> that's <pause dur="0.2"/> ideological <pause dur="1.0"/> i'm parting company <pause dur="0.2"/> with i think many of the books <pause dur="0.3"/> you'll read <pause dur="3.7"/> for instance <pause dur="0.3"/> if you've looked at Peter Galassi's book Corot in Italy which i put on the reading list <pause dur="1.0"/> you might have read this <pause dur="0.2"/> Galassi says of academic landscape <pause dur="0.2"/> quote <pause dur="1.2"/> <reading>if for history painters <pause dur="0.7"/> antiquity was fraught with passion and conflict <pause dur="0.4"/> dense with urgent analogy <pause dur="0.2"/> to contemporary affairs <pause dur="0.7"/> for Valenciennes and his school <pause dur="0.4"/> the classical past <pause dur="0.2"/> was a dreamland of tranquillity</reading> <pause dur="2.5"/> so Galassi seems to be claiming that history painting is all about <pause dur="0.5"/> drama and morality <pause dur="0.7"/> but that <pause dur="0.3"/> historical landscape <pause dur="0.2"/> is just a kind of <pause dur="0.5"/> lovely utopian dreamland <pause dur="0.2"/> that's not really about anything in particular <pause dur="1.2"/> and he also seems to make the <trunc>p</trunc> <pause dur="0.7"/> claim that <pause dur="0.6"/> history painting <pause dur="0.2"/> is very loaded <pause dur="0.2"/> with <pause dur="0.5"/> political <pause dur="0.3"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> ideological significance <pause dur="0.8"/> but <pause dur="0.3"/> historical landscape had none of that <pause dur="2.2"/> i would claim <pause dur="0.7"/> that Galassi overlooks some 
important <pause dur="0.7"/> dimensions to the argument <pause dur="2.4"/> firstly <pause dur="0.7"/> as i've suggested <pause dur="0.7"/> i think he overlooks <pause dur="0.2"/> the relationship between <pause dur="0.5"/> landscape <pause dur="0.7"/> and <pause dur="0.7"/> what one might call cultural power <pause dur="0.8"/> knowledge and learning <pause dur="1.2"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="3.5"/> the # <pause dur="0.3"/> the moral <pause dur="0.3"/> contents of <pause dur="0.3"/> intellectual endeavour <pause dur="2.6"/> in other words the very pleasure derived from historical landscapes <pause dur="0.6"/> is bound up with a certain cultural and social status <pause dur="1.0"/> they were painted for <pause dur="0.4"/> an elite <pause dur="0.4"/> with elite tastes who could go <pause dur="0.3"/> and exercise their own scholarship by identifying <pause dur="0.2"/> Democritus <pause dur="0.4"/> by identifying the Abderites and unlike me <pause dur="0.3"/> being able to say who they were <pause dur="1.7"/> so i think that's the first point <pause dur="3.5"/> secondly <pause dur="1.2"/> consider this <pause dur="0.2"/> quotation from Valenciennes <pause dur="2.0"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> and <pause dur="0.7"/> he's talking about the work of an artist called Gaspard Dughet <pause dur="0.7"/> often just known as Gaspard <pause dur="0.9"/> and he's represented on the right there <pause dur="1.6"/> i think <pause dur="1.2"/> yes <pause dur="0.6"/> # this is an ideal landscape of his <pause dur="0.3"/> from <pause dur="0.5"/> again the mid-seventeenth century <pause dur="1.1"/> this is what Valenciennes says about Gaspard <pause dur="0.2"/> quote <pause dur="1.4"/> <reading>his works quite simply offer landscapes <pause dur="0.4"/> 
in which one might desire to have a house <pause dur="0.6"/> for it would be situated with a beautiful view <pause dur="0.8"/> one could breathe in the coolness at midday <pause dur="0.5"/> one might walk along the shady banks of the river <pause dur="0.4"/> or lose oneself in the thickness of a forest <pause dur="0.3"/> and give oneself over <pause dur="0.3"/> to sentimental reveries</reading> <pause dur="2.1"/> i think that's very interesting and it's a very interesting clue <pause dur="0.2"/> to how Valenciennes reads images <pause dur="0.3"/> like the one on the right <pause dur="0.7"/> and he reads them in terms of a personal <pause dur="0.3"/> appropriation <pause dur="0.4"/> of landscape <pause dur="1.9"/> he began after all by <pause dur="0.2"/> staking his claim on property <pause dur="0.3"/> it's where you might like to have a house <pause dur="1.3"/> and then he <trunc>s</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> evoked that <trunc>s</trunc> sort of # set of <pause dur="0.4"/> conventional leisure activities <pause dur="1.0"/> going into a forest walking along a river <pause dur="0.6"/> dreaming <pause dur="0.2"/> as you're wandering through the beauties of nature <pause dur="2.6"/> what's happening here <pause dur="0.2"/> is nicely summed up <pause dur="0.5"/> by <pause dur="1.0"/> # this quotation <pause dur="0.2"/> this comes from a book by a geographer called Denis Cosgrove <pause dur="0.9"/> and it's from a work called Social Formation <pause dur="0.4"/> and Symbolic Landscape <pause dur="0.6"/> which is actually terribly interesting <pause dur="0.2"/> # if 
anyone feels brave enough to tackle it <pause dur="0.8"/> Cosgrove says this <pause dur="0.2"/> quote <pause dur="1.1"/> <reading>landscape <pause dur="0.3"/> is an ideological concept <pause dur="1.0"/> it represents a way in which certain classes of people have signified themselves in their world <pause dur="0.4"/> through their imagined relationship with nature <pause dur="0.9"/> and through which <pause dur="0.3"/> they've underlined and communicated <pause dur="0.3"/> their own social role <pause dur="0.5"/> and that of others with respect to external nature</reading> <pause dur="1.9"/> so what Cosgrove is <pause dur="0.3"/> talking about is the way that people <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> construct their personal identity construct a sense of who they are <pause dur="0.6"/> through their relationship with nature <pause dur="0.9"/> and obviously there's a big difference between if you think of your relationship with nature <pause dur="0.4"/> in terms of being <pause dur="0.4"/> a landowner <pause dur="0.5"/> an owner of a house in woods that you can stroll in <pause dur="0.6"/> or if you sort of think of your relationship with nature as being one of <pause dur="0.2"/> work <pause dur="0.2"/> of having to till the soil <pause dur="0.9"/> and so forth <pause dur="1.5"/> # and Valenciennes certainly seems to have a very clear idea in that little quotation <pause dur="0.3"/> what his relationship with 
nature is <pause dur="0.3"/> and the kind of personal identity that gives him <pause dur="0.7"/> it's leisured <pause dur="0.4"/> property owning <pause dur="0.2"/> cultured <pause dur="0.2"/> and mobile <pause dur="1.1"/> so there again there seems to be a real <pause dur="0.4"/> # ideological <pause dur="1.0"/> underpinning <pause dur="0.3"/> to landscape and how it's viewed <pause dur="2.2"/> and this leads on i think to the third way <pause dur="0.3"/> in which we <trunc>th</trunc> might think of <pause dur="0.2"/> landscape <pause dur="0.2"/> as being particularly this kind of academic landscape <pause dur="0.5"/> as being <pause dur="0.3"/> ideologically loaded <pause dur="1.3"/> and it's this <pause dur="0.4"/> that this very <pause dur="0.3"/> pastoral mode <pause dur="0.2"/> this sort of bucolic <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> mode of representing nature <pause dur="0.6"/> is in an way a misreading <pause dur="0.3"/> of rural life <pause dur="0.9"/> it's a representation of the countryside <pause dur="0.3"/> that excludes labour <pause dur="0.3"/> it excludes peasants <pause dur="0.4"/> it excludes poverty <pause dur="0.5"/> it excludes class <pause dur="1.9"/> and again i think there's a clear <pause dur="0.4"/> ideological underpinning there it's turning nature into this kind of dreamland <pause dur="0.9"/> where you're not disturbed <pause dur="0.4"/> by any of the sort of real grubby events that happen out there <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> in the countryside <pause dur="3.0"/> now in saying all that i'm not trying to make the claim that <pause dur="0.5"/> # a work <pause dur="0.3"/> like <pause dur="0.3"/> the <trunc>de</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> Democritus and the Abderites <pause dur="0.3"/> is designed to circulate political messages 
in the same way <pause dur="0.2"/> as Daumier for instance who we were looking at last week <pause dur="1.0"/> they're not <pause dur="1.0"/> political propaganda <pause dur="0.2"/> they're not trying to make political points <pause dur="1.0"/> but <pause dur="0.5"/> i am trying to <pause dur="0.2"/> argue <pause dur="0.4"/> that there are certain values <pause dur="0.4"/> certain <pause dur="0.6"/> # ideas <pause dur="1.3"/> and a certain idea about status <pause dur="0.2"/> that's sort of built into the genre <pause dur="2.1"/> that there is a kind of ideological <pause dur="0.5"/> underpinning <pause dur="2.3"/> # <pause dur="1.0"/> on the other hand <pause dur="0.2"/> you may agree with Peter Galassi <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> and think <pause dur="0.3"/> i'm talking nonsense <pause dur="2.0"/> # <pause dur="6.8"/> so there we've looked at <pause dur="0.7"/> the kind of works that won the Prix de Rome <pause dur="2.4"/> the kind of subjects <pause dur="0.2"/> the kind of compositions <pause dur="1.2"/> and i've argued <pause dur="0.3"/> that <pause dur="1.0"/> there is a political dimension to this work <pause dur="0.9"/> also to be considered <pause dur="1.8"/> and i want to end just by talking about what happens <pause dur="0.5"/> to <distinct lang="fr">paysage historique</distinct> <pause dur="0.6"/> as we get nearer to the middle of the nineteenth century <pause dur="3.0"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> and let's just have <pause dur="0.9"/> a couple more <pause dur="0.2"/> up <pause dur="0.9"/> on the <pause dur="1.2"/> # left here <pause dur="1.3"/> is <pause dur="0.2"/> a work by an artist called <pause dur="0.2"/> Benouville <pause dur="0.9"/> he's spelled B-E-N-<pause dur="0.8"/>O-U-<pause dur="0.5"/>V-I-double-L-E <pause dur="1.5"/> it's Ulysses <pause dur="0.2"/> and Nausicaa <pause dur="1.8"/> again a Homeric subject <pause dur="0.4"/> and that 
won the eighteen-forty-five competition <pause dur="3.5"/> and on the right here <pause dur="1.2"/> the winner of the eighteen-twenty-one <pause dur="0.4"/> competition the second landscape Prix de Rome <pause dur="0.4"/> by an artist called Remond <pause dur="0.3"/> R-E-M-O-N-D <pause dur="2.0"/> and that's The Rape of Proserpine <pause dur="0.8"/> so again another well established classical <pause dur="0.5"/> # a theme <pause dur="4.7"/> # shifts in attitude <pause dur="0.2"/> towards historical landscape <pause dur="0.5"/> and its style <pause dur="1.1"/> can be captured to some extent <pause dur="0.7"/> by <pause dur="0.4"/> looking at critical reactions <pause dur="0.2"/> to the entries for the Prix de Rome <pause dur="1.1"/> looking at how critics responded <pause dur="0.3"/> to <pause dur="0.3"/> the winners when they were announced <pause dur="0.7"/> # each time <pause dur="1.6"/> of course as with any documentary evidence we need to be quite circumspect <pause dur="0.4"/> and remember that critics are a specialized audience <pause dur="0.3"/> they have agendas of their own that affect their responses <pause dur="1.4"/> # so it's not as if <pause dur="0.5"/> we can look at criticism <pause dur="0.5"/> take a quotation and assume that it stands for <pause dur="0.2"/> an entire audience or all Parisians or all French people <pause dur="1.1"/> but nonetheless i think to review the critical literature <pause dur="0.7"/> what critics said about these works is instructive <pause dur="2.0"/> and i 
want to point out some of the ways in which <pause dur="0.4"/> critics' concerns changed <pause dur="0.3"/> between the eighteen-twenties <pause dur="0.2"/> and <pause dur="0.6"/> eighteen-forty-five <pause dur="0.5"/> when Benouville won <pause dur="3.2"/> so <pause dur="1.5"/> firstly <pause dur="1.0"/> there seemed to be <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="4.3"/> a shift <pause dur="0.8"/> in <pause dur="0.6"/> ideas about <pause dur="0.9"/> how to paint <pause dur="2.2"/> reviewing the finalists in eighteen-twenty-nine <pause dur="1.2"/> the Journal des Artistes <pause dur="0.6"/> which was a <pause dur="0.2"/> an art newspaper <pause dur="1.6"/> complained <pause dur="0.4"/> about the sheer diversity <pause dur="0.8"/> diversity of manner diversity of style diversity of treatment <pause dur="2.7"/> this diversity <pause dur="0.2"/> said the anonymous critic <pause dur="0.6"/> was symptomatic of a lack of good teaching <pause dur="0.3"/> in the École des Beaux Arts the Academy's school <pause dur="1.3"/> because <pause dur="0.2"/> quote <pause dur="0.8"/> <reading>there is one manner <pause dur="0.5"/> which must be better than the others <pause dur="0.4"/> that is to say which is truer <pause dur="0.5"/> closer to nature <pause dur="0.4"/> and which does not exclude <pause dur="0.2"/> the choice and arrangement demanded by good taste</reading> <pause dur="0.6"/> unquote <pause dur="1.3"/> so this critic is saying <pause dur="0.2"/> there's a right way to paint landscape <pause dur="0.2"/> one way that is superior to all others <pause dur="0.3"/> this is what the Academy should be teaching people <pause dur="0.4"/> but they're clearly not <pause dur="0.7"/> because if you look at all the 
entries <pause dur="0.9"/> they're all painting in different styles <pause dur="3.6"/> by eighteen-forty-five <pause dur="0.2"/> the opposite criticism is being made <pause dur="1.2"/> and the journal <pause dur="0.2"/> L'Illustration <pause dur="0.2"/> illustration <pause dur="0.5"/> complained in that year <pause dur="0.2"/> as it was reviewing <pause dur="0.2"/> the finalists of the Prix de Rome <pause dur="0.5"/> that the Academy was too conventional <pause dur="1.9"/> that its rigid protocols around landscape <pause dur="0.5"/> its adherence to <distinct lang="fr">paysage historique</distinct> and the <pause dur="0.4"/> Claudian tradition <pause dur="0.4"/> didn't allow sufficient diversity <pause dur="2.2"/> so that seems to be the first shift <pause dur="0.8"/> in eighteen-twenty-nine complaining <pause dur="0.3"/> everything's too different rather than sticking to the true way of doing it <pause dur="0.8"/> in eighteen-forty-five <pause dur="0.2"/> complaining that people are sticking to the true way of doing it too much <pause dur="0.3"/> and there's not enough diversity <pause dur="2.6"/> a similar switch in critical fortune <pause dur="0.2"/> relates to the historical subject itself <pause dur="1.8"/> in eighteen-thirty-three <pause dur="0.6"/> the Journal des Artistes again <pause dur="0.5"/> voiced some concerns about some of the entries <pause dur="0.4"/> the entries was # a Homeric subject <pause dur="1.8"/> again <pause dur="0.2"/> from <pause dur="1.0"/> the The Odyssey <pause dur="2.9"/> what they were worried about here was 
not so much <pause dur="0.2"/> technique <pause dur="0.4"/> or style <pause dur="0.6"/> but the way <pause dur="0.4"/> that <pause dur="0.2"/> the subject had been treated and in particular they found that <pause dur="0.3"/> women <pause dur="0.2"/> hadn't been made pure enough <pause dur="1.1"/> and there was a kind of a <pause dur="0.8"/> a carping rant <pause dur="0.4"/> about the way that the finalists in the Prix de Rome <pause dur="0.2"/> hadn't represented the women in their antique purity <pause dur="0.8"/> but had just painted them as if they were modern Parisiennes <pause dur="3.2"/> so <pause dur="0.5"/> there was this worry <pause dur="0.6"/> that <pause dur="0.6"/> they weren't treating the subject in quite the right way <pause dur="1.6"/> but by eighteen-forty-five again there seems to be a shift <pause dur="0.3"/> and the critics aren't concerned with how the subject is being treated <pause dur="0.4"/> but with the very subject themselves and they're dismissing them as irrelevant <pause dur="2.3"/> so from a sort of <pause dur="0.3"/> scholarly <pause dur="0.9"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> exposition of how Homer ought to be painted <pause dur="0.5"/> it shifts to a lot of critics just saying why paint Homer <pause dur="0.2"/> who cares <pause dur="7.6"/> there's also i think <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.8"/> a shift <pause dur="1.7"/> to be examined in terms of audience <pause dur="0.5"/> for landscapes <pause dur="2.2"/> and as i'll discuss next week <pause dur="0.8"/> the audience for <pause dur="0.2"/> historic <pause dur="0.2"/> landscape declines <pause dur="0.2"/> and the 
<trunc>la</trunc> and the audience for <pause dur="0.2"/> other landscape forms particularly <distinct lang="fr">paysage champêtre</distinct> <pause dur="0.7"/> increases <pause dur="2.9"/> and this starts to happen even in academic circles <pause dur="3.0"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> the other great treatise on landscape from the early part of the century <pause dur="0.8"/> is a case in point <pause dur="0.6"/> and this treatise is by an # a writer called Deperthes <pause dur="0.2"/> and that's spelled D-E-P-<pause dur="0.7"/>E-R-<pause dur="0.3"/>T-H-E-S <pause dur="0.8"/> and it's just called The Theory of Landscape <pause dur="0.5"/> it was published in eighteen-eighteen <pause dur="1.1"/> and i suppose comes second to Valenciennes in <pause dur="0.4"/> historical importance <pause dur="5.5"/> and Deperthes challenged Valenciennes in two ways <pause dur="1.7"/> he didn't sort of try to completely undermine Valenciennes' theory <pause dur="0.3"/> but there were two significant <pause dur="0.4"/> amendments he wanted to make <pause dur="1.0"/> firstly <pause dur="0.3"/> he declared that historical landscape <pause dur="0.2"/> and <distinct lang="fr">paysage champêtre</distinct> <pause dur="0.5"/> were equally important <pause dur="3.0"/> so <pause dur="0.2"/> Valenciennes had set up this hierarchy <pause dur="0.6"/> Deperthes says <pause dur="0.2"/> no <pause dur="0.5"/> both the rural and the historical modes of landscape <pause dur="0.2"/> are <pause dur="0.5"/> as good as each other <pause dur="5.8"/> what's more i suppose is a corollary of that <pause dur="0.3"/> Deperthes also <pause dur="0.4"/> 
wanted to <trunc>s</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> claim that the painter <pause dur="0.2"/> of rural landscapes <pause dur="0.3"/> is just as professional <pause dur="1.4"/> just as artistic just as imaginative and just as scholarly <pause dur="0.7"/> as the historical <pause dur="0.2"/> landscape painter <pause dur="4.0"/> so Deperthes breaks down that hierarchy <pause dur="0.7"/> the second important <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="1.3"/> challenge he makes <pause dur="0.7"/> is that while he affirms <pause dur="0.4"/> that landscape <pause dur="0.3"/> is inferior to history painting <pause dur="1.4"/> he still believes that history painting is a greater genre <pause dur="1.1"/> he places landscape second in the hierarchy <pause dur="0.7"/> so he says history painting's the greatest <pause dur="0.6"/> after that comes landscape <pause dur="1.6"/> and his reason for doing this <pause dur="0.2"/> very largely <pause dur="0.6"/> was that he said landscape was socially more significant <pause dur="0.8"/> because being less esoteric <pause dur="1.5"/> being less archane <pause dur="0.3"/> not dealing <pause dur="0.6"/> with <pause dur="0.7"/> Abderites and Ulysses and the like <pause dur="0.7"/> it could appeal to a greater number of people <pause dur="0.5"/> it would speak to a larger audience <pause dur="6.0"/> so again there's an important shift there <pause dur="0.3"/> in terms of audience <pause dur="1.0"/> from <pause dur="1.3"/> Valenciennes <pause dur="0.8"/> placing this sort of more elite genre this very scholarly <pause dur="0.4"/> kind of highbrow genre at the top <pause dur="0.6"/> Deperthes is 
saying well no actually this more <pause dur="0.4"/> general genre something that the bourgeoisie can go and buy and enjoy <pause dur="0.7"/> is actually just as good <pause dur="3.1"/> so i think we can <pause dur="0.3"/> trace the decline <pause dur="0.3"/> of historical landscape <pause dur="0.6"/> from <pause dur="0.6"/> its sort of high point in eighteen-seventeen when the <pause dur="0.2"/> Prix de Rome is instituted <pause dur="3.1"/> through the worries of the eighteen-thirties all those critics <pause dur="1.1"/> concerned that <pause dur="0.2"/> it's not being done properly <pause dur="0.8"/> to the open hostility we saw <pause dur="0.2"/> in eighteen-forty-five <pause dur="1.0"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> to end with two <pause dur="0.7"/> <trunc>ex</trunc> further examples of that hostility <pause dur="2.5"/> again from the eighteen-forty-five competition that <pause dur="0.5"/><kinesic desc="indicates slide" iterated="n"/> this painting won <pause dur="1.4"/> the journal L'Artiste <pause dur="0.2"/> the artist <pause dur="0.8"/> called <distinct lang="fr">paysage</distinct> <trunc>os</trunc> <distinct lang="fr">historique</distinct> <pause dur="0.3"/> the worst of all landscapes <pause dur="1.1"/> again turning Valenciennes' hierarchy on its head <pause dur="2.0"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> L'Illustration <pause dur="0.3"/> summed up <pause dur="0.2"/> the whole genre with these words <pause dur="0.6"/> something without truth <pause dur="0.4"/> something without naivety <pause dur="0.4"/> and completely boring <pause dur="1.9"/> so in a sense just like Titanic <pause dur="1.3"/> thank you # i'll end there <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="1.1"/> and as i say for the next seminar <pause dur="1.1"/> after reading week make sure you read the little extract from Teno <pause dur="0.3"/> and we'll <pause dur="0.5"/> discuss <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> a bit more <pause dur="0.3"/> about ways of making landscapes thank you
