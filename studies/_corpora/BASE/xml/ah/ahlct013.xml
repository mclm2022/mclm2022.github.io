<u who="nf0062"> if you have been looking at the <pause dur="0.9"/> the web site newsgroup <pause dur="0.3"/> you would have realized that last week's lecture had been changed round because <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> <pause dur="0.4"/> <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> had to be <pause dur="0.2"/> somewhere else <pause dur="0.2"/> today and so i agreed to swap with him <pause dur="0.7"/> which was # <pause dur="0.2"/> just as well given that i went down with the flu <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> so <pause dur="0.3"/> those of you who read the newsgroup <pause dur="0.3"/> will have known that if you didn't there's a good reason for <pause dur="0.3"/> keeping up with the newsgroup because bits of information like that <pause dur="0.5"/> do get relayed <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> and <pause dur="0.4"/> i've not put on the handout <pause dur="0.5"/> details of the books <pause dur="0.6"/> i'm referring to but <pause dur="0.3"/> they are there <pause dur="0.2"/> on the newsgroup <pause dur="0.4"/> so again another incentive to go and use it <pause dur="0.6"/> it saves my time i only have to do it once and send it rather than <pause dur="0.3"/> start <trunc>f</trunc> copying more <pause dur="0.2"/> paper <pause dur="0.8"/> okay # <pause dur="0.7"/> so i'm going to be lecturing on Orlando <pause dur="1.1"/> Orlando A Biography today <pause dur="0.8"/> and <pause dur="0.3"/> <vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/> <pause dur="0.7"/> i'm going to concentrate on three main aspects today <pause dur="0.8"/> the biographical aspect <pause dur="0.6"/> the whole issue of parody <pause dur="0.7"/> and issues about <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> relationship to history <pause dur="0.8"/> and in 
fact i had hoped to do more than that and i think i'm not going to have time to do more than that in an hour <pause dur="0.4"/> so i'm going to as it were <pause dur="0.2"/> hold over part of my agenda till next term <pause dur="0.3"/> when i lecture on modernism and gender <pause dur="0.6"/> and i shall talk in more detail next term <pause dur="0.4"/> about the issues around Orlando's sex change <pause dur="0.4"/> and issues of <pause dur="0.4"/> # identity <pause dur="0.2"/> sexual identity <pause dur="0.4"/> and the whole issue of the self whatever that is <pause dur="0.5"/> so today is going to be as it were <pause dur="0.2"/> part one of my approaches <pause dur="0.3"/> to Orlando <pause dur="1.2"/> and i'm going to start with the biographical <pause dur="1.1"/> whatever that means # <pause dur="0.9"/> Virginia Woolf was born in eighteen-eighty-two <pause dur="0.7"/> the third of four children from the marriage of Leslie and Julia Stephen <pause dur="1.0"/> both parents had been married previously <pause dur="0.6"/> so the household <pause dur="0.5"/> also included two elder half-brothers <pause dur="0.6"/> George and Gerald Duckworth <pause dur="0.6"/> and two half-sisters Stella Duckworth <pause dur="0.5"/> and Leslie Stephen's daughter by his first marriage <pause dur="0.4"/> called Laura <pause dur="0.5"/> and if you're interested in biography behind <pause dur="0.4"/> that plain statement there's an awful lot of <pause dur="0.4"/> possibly 
relevant <pause dur="0.3"/> information <pause dur="0.8"/> which i won't go into now but i would recommend Hermione Lee's biography <pause dur="0.6"/> of Virginia Woolf <pause dur="0.3"/> simply called Virginia Woolf <pause dur="0.4"/> which came out last year to great critical acclaim <pause dur="1.2"/> now as children # the family lived in Hyde Park Gate <pause dur="0.5"/> which is a narrow cul-de-sac off Kensington Road <pause dur="0.5"/> and spent the summers at Talland House <pause dur="0.3"/> just outside Saint Ives in Cornwall <pause dur="0.5"/> and if you've read To the Lighthouse you'll know that that <pause dur="0.4"/> is a kind of # <pause dur="0.7"/> <trunc>r</trunc> recall a memoir of <pause dur="0.3"/> of Talland House in fictional form <pause dur="1.4"/> # Virginia Woolf's mother died in eighteen-ninety-five when <pause dur="0.5"/> well she was then Virginia Stephen when Virginia Stephen was thirteen <pause dur="1.1"/> and just between childhood and adolescence <pause dur="0.5"/> in her memoirs she describes it thus <pause dur="1.7"/> <reading>the years between childhood and maturity are so complex <pause dur="0.6"/> my mother's death fell into the very middle of that amorphous time <pause dur="0.6"/> that made it much more broken <pause dur="0.8"/> the whole thing <pause dur="0.3"/> was strained</reading> <pause dur="1.1"/> her father <pause dur="0.2"/> Leslie Stephen <pause dur="0.2"/> was the first editor of The Dictionary of 
National Biography <pause dur="0.4"/> which is mentioned in Orlando <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> and Hermione Lee explains what <pause dur="0.5"/> it involved for him <pause dur="1.4"/> she says <pause dur="0.3"/> <reading>Leslie may have been anxious for Julia's health <pause dur="0.6"/> but he was exhausting her the most <pause dur="1.0"/> in the year of Virginia's birth <pause dur="0.4"/> he was labouring with a different kind of gestation <pause dur="0.9"/> the Cornhill Magazine was flagging and the publisher George Smith suggested <pause dur="0.3"/> that Leslie give up the editorship in order to embark on The Dictionary of National Biography <pause dur="1.1"/> from then on <pause dur="0.2"/> for nine years <pause dur="0.4"/> he committed himself to the massive undertaking <pause dur="0.4"/> of marshalling a team of <pause dur="0.4"/> six-hundred-and-fifty-three contributors <pause dur="0.5"/> editing the articles of the first twenty-six volumes <pause dur="0.4"/> writing three-hundred-and-seventy-eight entries himself <pause dur="0.6"/> endlessly proof correcting not his forte <pause dur="1.2"/> and corresponding <pause dur="1.3"/> by the end there would be sixty-three volumes <pause dur="0.3"/> of twenty-nine-thousand-one-hundred-and-twenty lines <pause dur="0.6"/> a monument to Victorian industry <pause dur="0.6"/> a tomb for Leslie Stephen's health <pause dur="1.0"/> the first volume came out in 
eighteen-eighty-five <pause dur="0.4"/> already it seems to have been perceived by the children as a blight <pause dur="0.7"/> Toby <pause dur="0.2"/> at five <pause dur="0.8"/> bought Leslie a <pause dur="0.6"/> contradictionary <pause dur="0.4"/> box <pause dur="0.5"/> which <pause dur="0.3"/> Toby said was <pause dur="0.3"/> full of rubbish</reading> <pause dur="0.3"/> <vocal desc="sniff" iterated="n"/> <pause dur="0.6"/> so i start with these biographical details <pause dur="0.5"/> because one could argue <pause dur="0.6"/> that all of Virginia Woolf's writing is based on her autobiography <pause dur="0.7"/> or what she describes as life <pause dur="0.3"/> writing <pause dur="0.5"/> again as Hermione Lee says <pause dur="0.6"/> <reading>her life story enters and shapes <pause dur="0.5"/> her novels <pause dur="0.2"/> and her essays <pause dur="0.4"/> she returns again and again <pause dur="0.4"/> to her family <pause dur="0.4"/> her parents her sister <pause dur="0.3"/> the death of her mother the death <pause dur="0.2"/> of her brother</reading> <pause dur="0.6"/> <vocal desc="sniff" iterated="n"/> <pause dur="0.9"/> now <pause dur="0.3"/> in the case of Orlando <pause dur="0.4"/> A Biography <pause dur="0.7"/> the biography <pause dur="0.5"/> is not <pause dur="0.5"/> of Virginia Woolf <pause dur="0.8"/> but of Vita Sackville-West <pause dur="0.9"/> with whom Virginia Woolf had what one could describe as an affair <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> in the twenties <pause dur="1.3"/> they first met at the end of nineteen-twenty-two <pause dur="0.7"/> introduced by Virginia's brother-in-law Clive Bell <pause dur="1.5"/> Vita was married to Harold Nicolson <pause dur="0.5"/> in a 
marriage <pause dur="0.2"/> which permitted them both <pause dur="0.3"/> to continue homosexual affairs and liaisons <pause dur="1.0"/> the affair with Virginia Woolf <pause dur="0.4"/> lasted through most of the nineteen-twenties <pause dur="0.3"/> and included their going on holiday to France together towards the end of that time <pause dur="1.0"/> Orlando was written <pause dur="0.5"/> towards the end of the affair <pause dur="0.9"/> and can be seen as Virginia's way <pause dur="0.4"/> of <pause dur="0.2"/> saying farewell <pause dur="0.8"/> and taking possession of her own agendas again <pause dur="1.3"/> it's <pause dur="0.2"/> based on Vita Sackville-West <pause dur="0.6"/> but there are many elements in the novel <pause dur="1.0"/> which <pause dur="0.6"/> derive from Virginia Woolf rather than Sackville-West for example feminism <pause dur="1.1"/> the preoccupation with the impossibility of writing history <pause dur="0.7"/> and writing biography <pause dur="0.9"/> and the whole way in which the concept of a stable <pause dur="0.4"/> unified self is dissolved <pause dur="0.4"/> in the text <pause dur="2.0"/> on the other hand there's clearly a fascination <pause dur="0.4"/> with an aristocratic family whose lineage stretched back to Elizabethan times <pause dur="0.9"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> and with the whole notion of the ancestral family home <pause dur="1.2"/> and arguably <pause dur="0.6"/> well i'm not 
quite sure how <pause dur="0.2"/> strongly i'd want to argue the case <pause dur="0.3"/> there's also <pause dur="0.3"/> a critique <pause dur="0.3"/> of some of the values <pause dur="0.3"/> which the English aristocracy subscribe to <pause dur="1.7"/> so <pause dur="1.4"/> i want to approach the text first of all <pause dur="0.4"/> <trunc>thr</trunc> through this notion of its being <pause dur="0.3"/> a biography and it's there in the subtitle of the novel <pause dur="0.6"/> # and in fact it caused some confusion when it was first published because it wasn't put in <pause dur="0.3"/> kind of the fiction section in bookshops but in the biography <pause dur="0.3"/> section <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> so <pause dur="0.5"/> it's a biography <pause dur="0.4"/> a life writing <pause dur="1.9"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> remember <pause dur="0.5"/> that <pause dur="0.2"/> Vita's name <pause dur="0.2"/> in Latin <pause dur="1.1"/> means life <pause dur="1.0"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> and of course it's still present in words like <pause dur="0.3"/> vital <pause dur="0.4"/> vitality <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> and even if you don't know Latin you may know the Latin tag <pause dur="0.5"/> # <vocal desc="sniff" iterated="n"/> <pause dur="0.4"/> <distinct lang="la">ars longa vita brevis</distinct> <pause dur="1.4"/> yes long the art short the life the life is long the art <trunc>i</trunc> <pause dur="0.3"/> the sorry the <pause dur="0.4"/> the art is long the life is short <pause dur="0.3"/> i think comes from Horace <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> so part of Virginia Woolf's <pause dur="0.4"/> playfulness in this text <pause dur="0.5"/> is that we have a kind of <pause dur="0.4"/> a variation 
on this theme of <distinct lang="la">ars longa vita brevis</distinct> we have <distinct lang="la">ars longa</distinct> <pause dur="0.6"/> <distinct lang="la">vita longa</distinct> as well to kind of correspond to it <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> i'm going to quote from Rachel Bowlby's introduction <pause dur="0.5"/> to Orlando which some of you might have in your edition but <pause dur="0.3"/> not sure that everybody does <pause dur="0.6"/> <trunc>s</trunc> <pause dur="0.5"/> since she gives a clear and succinct account of <pause dur="0.2"/> Vita <pause dur="1.3"/> and again you'll see on the newsgroup that you can also go to Feminist Destinations <pause dur="0.4"/> where that essay is reprinted <pause dur="0.6"/> # <vocal desc="sniff" iterated="n"/> <pause dur="1.2"/> so Bowlby says <reading>Vita was the latest <pause dur="0.3"/> in a line of the noble Sackvilles <pause dur="0.4"/> whose history she had lovingly written a few years before Orlando <pause dur="0.4"/> in <pause dur="0.4"/> Knole and the Sackvilles <pause dur="0.4"/> nineteen-twenty-two <pause dur="0.7"/> on which Woolf drew extensively for her background to the novel <pause dur="1.6"/> she took upon herself the conserving role of historian <pause dur="0.5"/> and prided herself on the continuity <pause dur="0.5"/> and illustriousness of her ancestry <pause dur="0.9"/> since the sixteenth century <pause dur="0.5"/> when one of them was granted the estate by Queen Elizabeth the First <pause dur="0.5"/> the Sackvilles had consistently been <pause dur="0.2"/> men of 
national importance <pause dur="0.5"/> they made up a long run of statesmen <pause dur="0.4"/> ambassadors and minor men of letters <pause dur="0.9"/> and it is not difficult to imagine how Vita herself the wife of a twentieth century ambassador <pause dur="0.4"/> Harold Nicolson <pause dur="0.6"/> and a prolific seeker after literary fame <pause dur="0.5"/> should have found <pause dur="0.9"/> both points of correspondence in this history <pause dur="0.4"/> and <pause dur="0.5"/> for the two must be inseparable <pause dur="0.6"/> been prompted <pause dur="0.5"/> in the choices of her own life by the models provided <pause dur="0.4"/> by her extraordinary array of forebears</reading> <pause dur="1.4"/> so <pause dur="0.6"/> many of the incidents in the plot of Orlando <pause dur="0.5"/> are based on the history of the Sackville family <pause dur="0.8"/> which had been written by Vita <pause dur="0.6"/> and which arguably influenced her in her own life choices <pause dur="1.2"/> and for example the whole incident <trunc>o</trunc> of <pause dur="0.5"/> # the <pause dur="0.6"/> living with the gypsies <pause dur="0.4"/> Vita <sic corr="Sackville-West">Sackwille-Welf</sic> <pause dur="0.2"/> <trunc>w</trunc> # West's grandmother <pause dur="0.3"/> was a quite famous <pause dur="0.2"/> Spanish <pause dur="0.2"/> gypsy dancer <pause dur="0.6"/> # <vocal desc="sniff" iterated="n"/> <pause dur="0.9"/> so <pause dur="0.3"/> Vita herself in her own life <trunc>dr</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> kind of lived out a lot of different roles and somehow managed to kind of keep them all <pause dur="0.3"/> kind 
of going at once <pause dur="1.8"/> however <pause dur="1.3"/> having given you that information i would also say <pause dur="0.6"/> Orlando A Biography <pause dur="0.3"/> is clearly not <pause dur="0.4"/> a biography of Vita Sackville-West <pause dur="0.5"/> it's rather a fantastical jeu d'esprit <pause dur="1.1"/> yet <pause dur="0.4"/> it plays with the issues which arise from life writing <pause dur="0.6"/> including the central issue which is <pause dur="0.8"/> can <pause dur="0.2"/> anyone ever know for sure the truth of someone else's life <pause dur="1.0"/> especially if that subject is remote <pause dur="0.2"/> in time <pause dur="0.7"/> is it possible to ever really know somebody <pause dur="0.8"/> <vocal desc="sniff" iterated="n"/> <pause dur="1.0"/> now Rachel Bowlby suggests <pause dur="0.3"/> that there are two related aspects <pause dur="0.4"/> in the publication <pause dur="0.4"/> and in the reception of biographies <pause dur="0.5"/> and she <pause dur="0.4"/> terms them this way <pause dur="0.5"/> the exemplary-didactic <pause dur="0.4"/> story for our times <pause dur="0.7"/> and the projective <pause dur="0.5"/> identifying oneself as biographer or a reader <pause dur="0.3"/> with another's story <pause dur="1.6"/> now if you think of those two terms <pause dur="1.6"/> i think neither of them allow for impartiality <pause dur="0.6"/> and objectivity <pause dur="0.3"/> either you're telling it with a kind of moral purpose <pause dur="0.2"/> i'm telling you this story because you can apply it to our times now <pause dur="0.4"/> or 
you're kind of <pause dur="0.2"/> vicariously <pause dur="0.4"/> kind of living out <pause dur="0.5"/> you know almost a fantasy self <pause dur="0.6"/> # <vocal desc="sniff" iterated="n"/> <pause dur="1.1"/> so <pause dur="0.8"/> i think what <pause dur="0.7"/> # Bowlby does is to give us definitions <pause dur="0.4"/> of contemporary trends in biography writing <pause dur="1.0"/> now when Leslie Stephen edited <pause dur="0.3"/> The Dictionary of National Biography <pause dur="0.6"/> he was engaged in a project <pause dur="0.6"/> which was doubtless seen as <pause dur="0.3"/> impartial <pause dur="0.6"/> and objective <pause dur="0.3"/> a kind of <pause dur="0.2"/> authoritative <pause dur="0.2"/> compilation <pause dur="1.5"/> although the editorial choices involved in deciding who should be included in this monument <pause dur="0.3"/> to late Victorian culture <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> must have <pause dur="0.7"/> included a set of implicit <pause dur="0.3"/> value judgements <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> but i suspect that they weren't consciously applied <pause dur="1.7"/> so Virginia Woolf <pause dur="0.6"/> née Stephen of course <pause dur="0.4"/> would go on to question <pause dur="0.6"/> many of these value judgements <pause dur="0.4"/> in her own writings <pause dur="0.6"/> and in particular <pause dur="0.5"/> # value judgements which centre around issues of <pause dur="0.4"/> gender <pause dur="0.3"/> and empire <pause dur="0.5"/> things which # <pause dur="0.2"/> the Victorian establishment <pause dur="0.4"/> took <pause dur="0.2"/> for granted but which she as being on the margins of that society <pause dur="0.4"/> a kind of an outside insider <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> was 
able to kind of question <pause dur="0.2"/> and and and # <pause dur="0.5"/> question the the sense of them really <pause dur="1.0"/> <vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/> <pause dur="0.7"/> so and i i would argue that the <pause dur="0.2"/> the playfulness <pause dur="0.5"/> of Orlando <pause dur="1.0"/> is not merely frivolous <pause dur="0.9"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> but it's a way of <pause dur="0.3"/> questioning assumptions about sensitive issues <pause dur="0.6"/> especially around gender and sexuality <pause dur="0.6"/> and around <pause dur="0.3"/> politics and power <pause dur="1.0"/> and questioning <pause dur="0.5"/> the assumptions when you put those two things together gender <pause dur="0.3"/> and politics <pause dur="0.5"/> you know who has the power <pause dur="0.9"/> well it's usually not the men <pause dur="0.5"/> i mean to say it's usually not the women it's usually men in <trunc>vic</trunc> in Virginia Woolf's society <pause dur="0.6"/> # and that's again something i want to talk about more next term <pause dur="1.5"/> and <pause dur="1.2"/> i think Orlando is a way of questioning <pause dur="0.5"/> the assumptions <pause dur="0.2"/> absolutely of her father's generation <pause dur="0.4"/> but indeed also of some of her contemporaries and <pause dur="0.6"/> she had contemporaries who were also writing <pause dur="0.4"/> # biographies for example eminent Victorians <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> and <pause dur="0.5"/> again it's a way of her questioning their assumptions <pause dur="0.3"/> without causing too 
much offence <pause dur="0.5"/> or bringing the weight of the establishment down on her <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> and remember in the year that she publishes <pause dur="0.8"/> Orlando <pause dur="0.6"/> # Radclyffe Hall is actually being <pause dur="0.3"/> prosecuted <pause dur="0.5"/> for obscenity <pause dur="0.8"/> because of the publication of her novel <pause dur="0.4"/> The Well of Loneliness <pause dur="0.2"/> which also talks about lesbianism <pause dur="0.4"/> # but does this in a more realist way <pause dur="0.5"/> # and consequently i mean Radclyffe Hall <pause dur="0.3"/> as it were didn't get away with it <pause dur="1.9"/> okay so i think that brings me to my first <pause dur="0.7"/> extract <pause dur="1.1"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> which i <pause dur="0.6"/> put on the sheet <pause dur="0.7"/> partly 'cause you may not have your book with you and partly because you're probably all working from different texts <pause dur="0.5"/> # it's <pause dur="0.2"/> as you see from the start of chapter two <pause dur="1.6"/> and it's one of a number of places in the text <pause dur="0.3"/> where the biographer calls attention to himself <pause dur="1.7"/> so chapter two begins <pause dur="0.4"/> <vocal desc="sniff" iterated="n"/><pause dur="1.2"/> <reading>the biographer <pause dur="0.9"/> is now faced <pause dur="0.5"/> with a difficulty <pause dur="1.0"/> which it is better perhaps to confess than to gloss over <pause dur="1.3"/> up to this point in telling the story of Orlando's life <pause dur="0.4"/> documents both private and historical <pause dur="0.3"/> have made it possible <pause dur="0.3"/> 
to fulfil the first duty of a biographer <pause dur="0.7"/> which is to plod without looking to right or left <pause dur="0.3"/> in the indelible footprints of truth <pause dur="1.1"/> unenticed by flowers <pause dur="0.3"/> regardless of shade <pause dur="0.6"/> on and on methodically <pause dur="0.3"/> till we fall <pause dur="0.2"/> plump into the grave <pause dur="0.3"/> and write <distinct lang="la">finis</distinct> on the tombstone above our heads <pause dur="1.4"/> but now we come to an episode <pause dur="0.2"/> which lies right across our path <pause dur="0.2"/> so there is no ignoring it <pause dur="0.9"/> yet it is <pause dur="0.2"/> dark <pause dur="0.3"/> mysterious and undocumented <pause dur="0.7"/> so that there is <pause dur="0.3"/> no explaining it <pause dur="0.9"/> volumes might be written in interpretation of it <pause dur="0.4"/> whole religious systems be founded upon the signification of it <pause dur="0.9"/> our simple duty <pause dur="0.3"/> is to state the facts as far as they <event desc="turns down lights" iterated="n"/> are known <pause dur="0.3"/> and so let the reader make of them <pause dur="0.2"/> what he may</reading> <pause dur="0.6"/> sorry <pause dur="0.2"/> put that back on if i can <pause dur="2.3"/> <event desc="turns up lights" iterated="n"/> right <pause dur="1.4"/><vocal desc="sniff" iterated="n"/> <pause dur="1.9"/> shades of Dickens and <pause dur="0.3"/> # <unclear>facts</unclear> <pause dur="0.8"/> in there i think <pause dur="0.7"/> so <pause dur="0.3"/> to state the obvious <pause dur="0.6"/> if anything is obvious <pause dur="0.3"/> in this novel <pause dur="1.6"/> Virginia Woolf <pause dur="0.5"/> the author <pause dur="0.6"/> is not <pause dur="0.8"/> the biographer in the text <pause dur="0.5"/> who 
refers to himself <pause dur="0.4"/> impersonally <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> the biographer is now faced with he doesn't say i am now faced with <pause dur="0.4"/> or he adopts the first person plural pronoun <pause dur="0.5"/> # our simple duty is <pause dur="0.4"/> that kind of thing <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="1.4"/> which i think is a habit of scholarly prose which some of us still continue <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="1.8"/> i imagine this is because <pause dur="0.5"/> this suggests that all individual subjectivity <pause dur="0.4"/> has been edited out <pause dur="0.6"/> # and that this man of letters <pause dur="0.3"/> is drawing on and purveying <pause dur="0.3"/> a more general truth <pause dur="0.6"/> he's a spokesman for the truth <pause dur="0.3"/> for the facts <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> and that this is not just an idiosyncratic take on his subject <pause dur="0.6"/> so that kind of <pause dur="0.4"/> our duty is the biographer is now faced with <pause dur="0.4"/> # conveys <pause dur="0.3"/> weight <pause dur="0.3"/> and authority <pause dur="0.8"/> and suggests that the value judgements and the discriminations made by the <trunc>biog</trunc> biographer <pause dur="0.5"/> are pretty much infallible <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> because they're part of a wider set of assumptions <pause dur="0.3"/> that all right thinking men adhere to <pause dur="0.9"/> # <pause dur="1.0"/> Woolf the author though <pause dur="0.9"/> does just enough for the biographer to appear <pause dur="0.3"/> somewhat fussy <pause dur="0.4"/> and narrow minded <pause dur="1.1"/> in his 
preoccupation with facts and <pause dur="0.3"/> the indelible footprints <pause dur="0.4"/> of truth <pause dur="0.8"/> he becomes a somewhat <pause dur="0.2"/> ridiculous absurd character <pause dur="2.1"/> i think in effect she's <pause dur="0.7"/> parodying the conventional biographer of late Victorian times <pause dur="0.8"/> which is to say <pause dur="0.4"/> she is parodying and critiquing <pause dur="0.3"/> her father's life's work <pause dur="1.8"/> so <pause dur="1.3"/> much of this parody is an attack of the man of letters who believes in <pause dur="0.4"/> the indelible footprints of truth <pause dur="0.7"/> and defines these as <pause dur="0.4"/> having to tread quite a narrow path <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> and <trunc>th</trunc> i think <pause dur="0.2"/> what you might want to do is <pause dur="0.3"/> to examine for yourselves the various points in the text <pause dur="0.6"/> where the biographer calls attention to himself and i'm saying himself <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> and calls attention to his dilemmas <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="1.4"/> and then <trunc>c</trunc> try and consider him as # <pause dur="0.2"/> as a character <pause dur="0.8"/> in this novel <pause dur="1.0"/> # <pause dur="1.3"/> and think about the distance between the point of view <pause dur="0.2"/> of this character <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> and the point of view of Virginia Woolf <pause dur="0.2"/> as author <pause dur="0.3"/> and as agent controlling the discourse overall <pause dur="0.9"/> and i would argue that she is saying something <pause dur="0.3"/> radically different <pause dur="0.4"/> from what the 
biographer says <pause dur="0.7"/> and that the gap between them at times is a great gulf <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> i might say a little bit more about how she does that <pause dur="0.2"/> later on <pause dur="0.2"/> <vocal desc="sniff" iterated="n"/><pause dur="2.2"/> okay <pause dur="0.8"/> so that's talking about <pause dur="0.6"/> biography and <pause dur="0.2"/> the role of the biographer as a <pause dur="0.2"/> perhaps a major character in the novel <pause dur="1.7"/> i want now just to think a little bit about <pause dur="0.4"/> parody <pause dur="1.4"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> and consider other types of parody in the novel apart from this main one of of the biographer <pause dur="1.0"/> and not just dwelling on Virginia <pause dur="0.5"/> Woolf <pause dur="0.4"/> née Stephen <pause dur="0.4"/> as # an undutiful daughter <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="1.3"/> just sort of broadening it out a bit <pause dur="1.4"/> now i think there's a further parody of the biographical conventions <pause dur="0.8"/> through the illustrations <pause dur="0.5"/> which are included in the text <pause dur="0.4"/> and again just to remind you i've <pause dur="0.3"/> put a couple of those <pause dur="0.5"/> on the sheet here <pause dur="1.6"/> and again i'm going to read from Hermione Lee <pause dur="0.6"/> who i do think is Virginia Woolf's perfect <pause dur="0.4"/> biographer and i'm trying to say that <pause dur="0.2"/> with absolute seriousness i really do recommend <pause dur="0.5"/> you read her work <pause dur="1.7"/> so <pause dur="0.3"/> Hermione Lee says <pause dur="0.8"/> <reading>from the outset <pause dur="1.5"/> Virginia envisaged 
Orlando <pause dur="0.9"/> as an illustrated book <pause dur="0.5"/> the pictures with an index and acknowledgements were part of the paraphernalia of the fake biography <pause dur="1.2"/> there were to be portraits of Sackville ancestors <pause dur="0.6"/> for Orlando as a young man <pause dur="1.1"/> photographs of Vita <pause dur="0.6"/> for Orlando as a woman <pause dur="1.1"/> and a portrait of Orlando's lost love <pause dur="0.3"/> the Russian princess Sasha <pause dur="0.8"/> this would be Angelica <pause dur="0.2"/> now a ravishing nine year old <pause dur="1.5"/> Virginia and Vita went together to Knole <pause dur="0.3"/> to choose Sackville <pause dur="0.2"/> ancestors <pause dur="1.0"/> Virginia made Vita pose <pause dur="0.3"/> as a voluptuous Lely for the photographer Lenare</reading> <pause dur="0.9"/> and then we get in parentheses what Vita thought about it she says <pause dur="0.8"/> <reading>i was miserable <pause dur="0.4"/> draped <pause dur="0.2"/> in an inadequate bit of pink satin <pause dur="0.3"/> with all my clothes slipping off <pause dur="0.6"/> but V was delighted and kept <pause dur="0.2"/> diving under the black cloth of the camera to peek at the effect</reading> <pause dur="1.4"/> then the <vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/> Hermione Lee goes on <pause dur="0.9"/> <reading>Vanessa and Duncan then decided to join in <pause dur="1.2"/> and Vita <pause dur="0.4"/> even more miserable and feeling like</reading>
quote <reading>an unfortunate victim</reading> <pause dur="0.3"/> end quote <pause dur="0.4"/> <reading>was made to sit inside a huge frame <pause dur="0.4"/> while they took endless photographs <pause dur="0.9"/> and Virginia sat reading and commenting <pause dur="0.4"/> on all the obituary notices <pause dur="0.2"/> in that day's Times <pause dur="0.6"/> and made them all giggle <pause dur="1.4"/> Vita was indeed <pause dur="0.3"/> being framed</reading> <pause dur="0.4"/> <vocal desc="sniff" iterated="n"/><pause dur="1.8"/> so if one considers <pause dur="0.3"/> the portraits <pause dur="0.5"/> and photographs <pause dur="0.2"/> for a moment and i don't know if you did consider them whilst reading the <pause dur="0.2"/> the novel <pause dur="1.0"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> i think the interesting thing apart from the fact that they often are the paraphernalia of biographies <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.9"/> is that photographic theory <pause dur="0.6"/> might tell us that <pause dur="0.5"/> the camera never lies <pause dur="0.8"/> # that the fascinating fact <pause dur="0.3"/> about the photographic image <pause dur="0.5"/> is that it <pause dur="0.2"/> is always literal <pause dur="0.9"/> it is never figurative <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> that is it can never <pause dur="0.3"/> function as a metaphor <pause dur="0.9"/> because it is a literal record of its subject <pause dur="0.6"/> and i have to say in in in those remarks i am very indebted to to Barthes who i <pause dur="0.5"/> # whose # work on on photography i think is great i don't actually <pause dur="0.5"/> can't remember what the English title is it's La 
Chambre Claire <pause dur="0.2"/> in French <pause dur="0.3"/> the # <pause dur="0.8"/> light chamber would be a exact translation <pause dur="0.5"/> # <vocal desc="sniff" iterated="n"/> <pause dur="1.8"/> so <pause dur="2.4"/> if we are interested in <pause dur="0.3"/> indelible truth <pause dur="0.9"/> the light chamber where patterns of light are registered on light sensitive film <pause dur="0.5"/> is about the closest we can get to recording <pause dur="0.5"/> the actuality <pause dur="0.8"/> of one particular moment in time <pause dur="1.7"/> yet after that image has been captured and printed <pause dur="0.4"/> or even during the process of development itself <pause dur="0.6"/> it is vulnerable to manipulation <pause dur="1.0"/> so the lively Vita felt <pause dur="0.3"/> miserable <pause dur="0.4"/> trapped and framed <pause dur="0.6"/> by the process of being the photographic model <pause dur="0.9"/> and <pause dur="0.5"/> i think it's significant that Virginia felt the need <pause dur="0.5"/> to repeatedly gaze at her <pause dur="0.4"/> through the camera lens <pause dur="0.5"/> # while also reading <pause dur="0.2"/> obituaries <pause dur="0.7"/> which after all <pause dur="0.3"/> are if you want the ultimate form of biography <pause dur="0.6"/> the life written <pause dur="0.4"/> just after death or often prepared at the point of <pause dur="0.3"/> death for publication in the Times the next day <pause dur="0.5"/> so it's a kind of death writing <pause dur="0.3"/> if you want <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="1.1"/> so <pause dur="0.3"/> even if <pause dur="0.9"/> the camera <pause dur="1.0"/> and the 
photographic image is literal <pause dur="0.6"/> and true <pause dur="1.1"/> and true to its subject <pause dur="0.6"/> the model <pause dur="0.6"/> is manipulated as Vita was <pause dur="0.3"/> and in her case she's manipulated <pause dur="0.5"/> to dress up in skimpy clothes <pause dur="0.3"/> to present a different version of herself <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> and i've put a couple of the <pause dur="0.3"/> the photographs of her on the sheet <pause dur="0.4"/> where i think she's very much being made to <pause dur="0.3"/> dress up <pause dur="0.7"/> you know she's she's dressing up to play a part <pause dur="0.7"/> # <vocal desc="sniff" iterated="n"/> <pause dur="0.7"/> and of course she is then further <pause dur="0.7"/> fictionalized by the context <pause dur="0.2"/> within which the photograph is placed in the text <pause dur="1.0"/> the images of Vita Sackville-West in Orlando A Biography <pause dur="0.4"/> become <pause dur="0.9"/> fictionalized as images of this <pause dur="0.2"/> totally fantastic subject <pause dur="0.7"/> # or should that be <pause dur="0.3"/> fantasized <pause dur="0.3"/> by Virginia Woolf <pause dur="0.5"/> as images of her <pause dur="0.3"/> fictionalized fictional subject <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> either way the indelible <pause dur="0.7"/> print of truth <pause dur="0.7"/> is now through Virginia Woolf's playfulness and manipulations <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> a very kind of slippery concept <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> it's it's an image this <pause dur="0.4"/> footprint of truth <pause dur="0.5"/> whose meaning i think keeps slipping between 
different levels of signification <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> so is this just an elaborate joke <pause dur="0.5"/> the butt of the humour being <pause dur="0.4"/> Virginia Woolf's father <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> so an obituary to the late Victorian man of letters and his culture <pause dur="1.1"/> is it a homage to Vita it was described by <trunc>s</trunc> by some people at the time as <pause dur="0.3"/> the longest love letter in the English language <pause dur="1.9"/> # <pause dur="1.1"/> is it a very <pause dur="0.4"/> ambiguous flirtation with the English aristocracy <pause dur="0.5"/> by <pause dur="0.4"/> an avowedly socialist and feminist writer <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> i think the parodying of biographical conventions <pause dur="0.4"/> opens up all of these possibilities <pause dur="0.5"/> # in the reading of the text and of course it's that playfulness which allows <pause dur="0.4"/> Virginia Woolf to do all those things <pause dur="1.7"/> how am i doing for time <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="3.6"/> the <pause dur="1.8"/> the second <pause dur="0.2"/> of my <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> extracts excuse me i'm my voice is going <pause dur="2.7"/> <event desc="drinks" iterated="n"/> <vocal desc="sniff" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.7"/> the second of my extracts is from the start of chapter five <pause dur="1.1"/> and <pause dur="0.5"/> beneath it i have put <pause dur="0.6"/> probably <pause dur="0.4"/> totally illegible <pause dur="0.2"/> i apologize for that but just to draw it to your attention <pause dur="1.3"/> the first 
chapter of Charles Dickens' Bleak House <pause dur="1.0"/> if you remember chapter five <pause dur="0.6"/> is the point when we've just got into the nineteenth century <pause dur="1.6"/> so <pause dur="0.8"/> what i want to suggest <pause dur="0.9"/> is <pause dur="2.3"/> that <pause dur="0.2"/> throughout Orlando <pause dur="0.9"/> Virginia Woolf <pause dur="0.5"/> parodies <pause dur="0.5"/> the style the literary style of the <pause dur="0.3"/> historical period she's talking about <pause dur="0.7"/> so that <trunc>i</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> in chapter five when we get into the nineteenth century <pause dur="0.4"/> she quite self-consciously deliberately <pause dur="0.4"/> parodies <pause dur="0.2"/> the prose of Dickens <pause dur="1.0"/> <vocal desc="cough" iterated="n"/> i don't know if i've got time just to read you <pause dur="1.0"/> a little of that <pause dur="3.4"/> <reading>the great cloud which hung not only <pause dur="0.2"/> over London but over the whole of the British Isles <pause dur="0.6"/> on the first day of the nineteenth century <pause dur="0.3"/> stayed or rather <pause dur="0.3"/> did not stay <pause dur="0.6"/> for it was buffeted about constantly by blustering gales long enough to have <pause dur="0.5"/> extraordinary consequences <pause dur="0.3"/> upon those who lived beneath its shadow <pause dur="1.4"/> a change seemed to have come over the climate of England <pause dur="0.7"/> rain fell frequently <pause dur="0.7"/> but only in fitful gusts which were no sooner over than they began again</reading> <pause dur="1.0"/> 
and then she moves from that <pause dur="0.2"/> to <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> a kind of developing of the metaphor of dampness <pause dur="0.9"/> dampness # in all its possible kind of workings and connotations <pause dur="0.4"/> is an elaborately <pause dur="0.4"/> developed over at at least two pages and i won't go into all that now 'cause that would be <pause dur="0.4"/> perhaps tedious in a lecture <pause dur="0.5"/> # <vocal desc="sniff" iterated="n"/><pause dur="1.9"/> but it is very similar to what Charles Dickens does <pause dur="0.3"/> at the start of Bleak House <pause dur="0.4"/> where he takes <pause dur="0.4"/> again a kind of # a <pause dur="0.3"/> climate metaphor this time <pause dur="0.4"/> fog <pause dur="1.1"/> # the great London smog <pause dur="0.7"/> and <pause dur="0.7"/> develops it into a metaphor <pause dur="0.4"/> for the workings of <pause dur="0.4"/> # Chancery the court of Chancery the Lord Chancellor <pause dur="0.9"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> and again starts by what appears to be possibly <pause dur="0.4"/> realistic description <pause dur="0.6"/> but then moves into <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> a kind of fantastical <pause dur="0.5"/> mode which totally leaves realism behind <pause dur="0.6"/> i mean one of the things one can <pause dur="0.4"/> perhaps say about <pause dur="1.0"/> Virginia Woolf is that she's writing <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="1.1"/> in a modernist tradition and that one might try and define modernism as <pause dur="0.5"/> coming after nineteenth century social realism and therefore <trunc>b</trunc> <pause dur="0.6"/> having as its its # <pause dur="1.0"/> its style that of antirealism <pause dur="0.6"/> 
# and yet i think what one can see here <pause dur="0.7"/> is that in parodying Dickens <pause dur="0.6"/> # she's not <pause dur="0.8"/> parodying something which is not already there Dickens himself often moves off into fantastical <pause dur="0.4"/> and kind of gothic <pause dur="0.4"/> # elements as ways of making a comment on the social situation <pause dur="0.9"/> so that's another kind of parody <pause dur="1.0"/> which goes on <pause dur="0.5"/> throughout this <pause dur="0.6"/> this novel and again something you might want to do in more detail on your own or in seminar <pause dur="0.3"/> is kind of work out <pause dur="0.3"/> what other prior texts are being <pause dur="0.2"/> parodied by Virginia Woolf <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> but i do want to to mention the fact <pause dur="0.5"/> and that's over the page on the sheet <pause dur="2.1"/> that <pause dur="1.1"/> she also parodies herself <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> she parodies <pause dur="0.9"/> the <pause dur="0.4"/> Time Passes <pause dur="0.6"/> section <pause dur="0.5"/> of To the Lighthouse <pause dur="0.4"/> which is the novel <pause dur="0.2"/> which i said at the start is based on her childhood <pause dur="0.4"/> kind of summers spent <pause dur="0.2"/> at Talland House <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> has # <pause dur="0.6"/> an elaborate first section where <pause dur="0.4"/> the comings and goings in the house are described at length <pause dur="0.4"/> and then moves into a short middle section called <pause dur="0.3"/> Time Passes <pause dur="0.4"/> where the whole of the Great 
War is kind of dealt with in a few pages <pause dur="0.4"/> and including you know <pause dur="0.5"/> people <pause dur="0.2"/> kind of dying on battlefields <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> the <trunc>miss</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> Mrs Ramsey character <pause dur="0.5"/> dying and so on <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> and again i've just taken a small amount for the sheet to give you a kind of a feel for it <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="1.4"/> it's it's <pause dur="1.4"/> it it's that sense of trying to capture <pause dur="0.4"/> the passing of time <pause dur="0.5"/> kind of skimming over the top of it rather telling <pause dur="0.4"/> # details as you <pause dur="0.4"/> might normally <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> so <pause dur="0.5"/> my fifth extract <pause dur="1.1"/> is from the Time Passes section of To the Lighthouse <pause dur="0.3"/> <reading>night after night summer and winter <pause dur="0.3"/> the torment of storms <pause dur="0.5"/> the arrow-like stillness of fine weather <pause dur="0.4"/> held their court without interference <pause dur="0.7"/> listening had there been anyone to listen <pause dur="0.4"/> from the upper rooms of the empty house <pause dur="0.7"/> only gigantic chaos <pause dur="0.2"/> streaked with lightning could have heard <pause dur="0.3"/> tumbling and tossing as the winds and waves <pause dur="0.2"/> disported themselves like the amorphous bulks of leviathans <pause dur="0.8"/> whose brows are pierced by no light of reason mounted one on top of another and lunged and plunged in the darkness 
or the daylight <pause dur="0.3"/> for night and day month and year ran shapelessly together <pause dur="0.5"/> in idiot games until it seemed as if <pause dur="0.3"/> the universe were battling and tumbling <pause dur="0.3"/> in brute confusion <pause dur="0.3"/> and wanton lust <pause dur="0.2"/> aimlessly <pause dur="0.3"/> by itself</reading> <pause dur="0.6"/> well i tried to read that with a slight sense of how easy it might be <pause dur="0.5"/> to parody that slightly breathless <pause dur="0.4"/> style <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> which is in effect what Virginia Woolf does in what i put on as the fourth extract <pause dur="0.2"/> on the sheet <pause dur="0.5"/> <reading>it was now November after November comes December <pause dur="0.3"/> then January February March and April after April comes May June July August follow <pause dur="0.4"/> next is September <pause dur="0.4"/> then October and so behold here we are back at November again <pause dur="0.4"/> with the whole year accomplished</reading> <pause dur="0.7"/> # <vocal desc="sniff" iterated="n"/><pause dur="1.7"/> but clearly there you know it's the poor biographer <pause dur="0.5"/> who she's she's turning into a kind of butt at her sense of humour <pause dur="2.2"/> and i do think there may be behind this again a kind of serious <pause dur="0.2"/> philosophical point but <pause dur="0.2"/> i'll come to that in a minute <pause dur="0.5"/> okay so that's just to alert 
you to different kinds of parody <pause dur="0.8"/> in the text <pause dur="0.4"/> and i'm not going to kind of carry on <pause dur="0.2"/> talking about that <pause dur="0.5"/> now because i want to talk about <pause dur="0.3"/> the whole issue of writing history <pause dur="0.9"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> before we finish <vocal desc="sniff" iterated="n"/><pause dur="1.0"/> okay so my next <trunc>sish</trunc> section is about history <pause dur="1.4"/> <vocal desc="cough" iterated="n"/> <pause dur="0.2"/> <vocal desc="sniff" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.9"/> and <pause dur="2.9"/> i just want to quote you again something i quoted you earlier <pause dur="0.3"/> and just listen to it carefully <pause dur="0.8"/> <reading>Vita was the latest in a line of the noble Sackvilles <pause dur="0.4"/> whose history she had lovingly written a few years before Orlando <pause dur="0.6"/> in Knole and the Sackvilles nineteen-twenty-two <pause dur="0.6"/> on which Woolf drew extensively <pause dur="0.3"/> for her background to the novel</reading> <pause dur="1.5"/> so i quoted that to you that earlier in the lecture as a quick way <pause dur="0.5"/> of providing some background information about Vita Sackville-West <pause dur="0.9"/> and about the fact that she had an aristocratic family background <pause dur="1.0"/> however <pause dur="0.4"/> i want to come back to the quotation <pause dur="1.6"/> and think about the exact phrasing which Rachel Bowlby uses here <pause dur="0.9"/> she

history we can ever know <pause dur="0.3"/> is actually the second <pause dur="0.5"/> historiography <pause dur="1.0"/> <trunc>th</trunc> the telling of the past <pause dur="0.3"/> shaping <pause dur="0.4"/> an account <pause dur="0.5"/> telling a story about it <pause dur="0.5"/> using a variety of sources to build up <pause dur="2.3"/> to build up what <pause dur="0.5"/> an accurate <pause dur="0.2"/> account of the past <pause dur="0.5"/> an <pause dur="0.3"/> as accurate a picture as possible <pause dur="0.6"/> or <pause dur="0.7"/> you know <pause dur="0.4"/> my interpretation of events as opposed to somebody else's interpretation of events <pause dur="0.9"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> arguably even when we try to build up as accurate a picture as possible <pause dur="0.4"/> inevitably <pause dur="0.4"/> all we actually do is give <pause dur="0.4"/> you know <pause dur="0.4"/> our interpretation of events my own interpretation of events <pause dur="0.9"/> # <pause dur="1.3"/> so in the nineteenth century <pause dur="2.7"/> historians tended to believe that political history was more valuable than other kinds of history <pause dur="0.6"/> that the stories of nations could be told <pause dur="0.4"/> through the exploits of famous men <pause dur="0.4"/> military leaders rulers <pause dur="0.5"/> ambassadors diplomats whatever <vocal desc="sniff" iterated="n"/><pause dur="1.0"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> and in fact there was a whole series called Story of Nations which <pause dur="0.6"/> i don't suppose anyone here is <pause dur="0.2"/> is kind of old enough to 
remember <pause dur="0.5"/> but anyway <pause dur="0.6"/> <vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/> <pause dur="0.2"/> but there are other ways of telling stories of the past which might concentrate on <pause dur="0.8"/> the daily existence of very ordinary people <pause dur="0.9"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> and in fact that approach to historical studies <pause dur="0.4"/> didn't really begin to be developed until <pause dur="0.4"/> around the time that Virginia Woolf was writing <pause dur="0.4"/> Orlando <pause dur="1.1"/> # the first issue of Annales came out in nineteen-twenty-nine <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> and this was a French journal which was the focus <pause dur="0.6"/> for a new trend <pause dur="0.3"/> in historical studies <pause dur="0.4"/> pioneered i think mainly by <trunc>hi</trunc> <pause dur="0.3"/> French historians <pause dur="0.6"/> and which led eventually to <pause dur="0.2"/> choosing my favourite <pause dur="0.3"/> # text like # Le Roy Ladurie's <pause dur="0.3"/> Montaillou <pause dur="0.2"/> Village <pause dur="0.2"/> Occitan <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> which came out in nineteen-seventy-five # <pause dur="0.6"/> Montaillou # <pause dur="0.7"/> Occitan Village <pause dur="0.3"/> from <pause dur="0.3"/> # twelve-ninety-four to thirteen-twenty-four takes just a very short <pause dur="0.3"/> time span <pause dur="0.3"/> and writes about what happens in the village in those rather turbulent times <pause dur="0.6"/> # <vocal desc="sniff" iterated="n"/> <pause dur="0.9"/> Knole and the Sackvilles <pause dur="0.6"/> tells us from its 
title <pause dur="0.8"/> that it is a story of a stately home <pause dur="0.6"/> and its illustrious family <pause dur="1.2"/> Montaillou <pause dur="0.4"/> Village Occitan on the other hand <pause dur="0.3"/> is about a small peasant village <pause dur="0.9"/> and its inhabitants at a turbulent moment in the history of the region <pause dur="0.3"/> and one of the things it talks about is the <pause dur="0.4"/> the the Countess who lives there and and her kind of <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> her amour but it's only one of the things it's not the central focus <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="1.1"/> so as so often in her writing <pause dur="1.1"/> by critiquing the style and the underlying <pause dur="0.3"/> ideological assumptions <pause dur="0.5"/> of late Victorian and Edwardian culture <pause dur="1.2"/> Virginia Woolf exhibits a kind of prescience <pause dur="0.7"/> of later twentieth century trends <pause dur="0.3"/> and literary developments <pause dur="0.4"/> because she's kind of on the cusp of seeing where things need to go next <pause dur="0.8"/> so what Woolf critiques <pause dur="0.6"/> and parodies in Orlando <pause dur="0.5"/> is essentially <pause dur="0.5"/> the Whig version of history <pause dur="1.4"/> i would say that this has an <pause dur="0.4"/> an optimistic <pause dur="0.2"/> assumption <pause dur="0.3"/> that history is a steady <pause dur="0.4"/> upward progress <pause dur="0.3"/> towards the present moment <pause dur="0.6"/> which is seen as the pinnacle <pause dur="0.5"/> of achievement <pause dur="1.0"/> and it's only to 
be bettered <pause dur="0.3"/> by the future achievements of the human race <pause dur="0.7"/> so it might intend to be implicitly <pause dur="0.4"/> self-congratulatory and self-affirming <pause dur="1.0"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> and one of its assumptions is indeed that history is <pause dur="0.3"/> the history of mankind <pause dur="0.5"/> of the deeds of great men <pause dur="1.4"/> but not necessarily apart from a few honourable exceptions <pause dur="0.3"/> of great women <pause dur="0.2"/> or women at all <pause dur="0.6"/> # so in British history <pause dur="0.8"/> # at the time that that Virginia Woolf was was writing <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.8"/> the honourable <pause dur="0.2"/> kind of exceptions might include <pause dur="0.5"/> # Boudicca <pause dur="0.2"/> Boadicea <pause dur="1.1"/> Queen Elizabeth the First <pause dur="0.5"/> who becomes a kind of mythologized in Victorian culture <pause dur="0.6"/> Queen Victoria herself is kind of mythologized while she's still alive <pause dur="0.6"/> and possibly you get kind of Nell Gwyn <pause dur="0.2"/> selling oranges <pause dur="0.5"/> # and getting a passing mention as as <pause dur="0.2"/> Charles the Second's mistress <pause dur="1.6"/> so <pause dur="0.2"/> i think one of the aspects of <pause dur="0.2"/> Orlando's sex change <pause dur="1.1"/> is the effect it has on a historical <pause dur="0.7"/> narrative <pause dur="0.7"/> # and in a way Virginia Woolf is asking the question <pause dur="0.3"/> does it make a difference <pause dur="0.7"/> 
would it alter our perspective substantially <pause dur="0.7"/> if history were routinely <pause dur="0.3"/> her story <pause dur="0.4"/> as well <pause dur="0.9"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> so i believe this is one of the questions Virginia Woolf wishes to raise here <pause dur="0.9"/> again i've given you a couple of small <pause dur="0.4"/> extracts <pause dur="0.4"/> extracts six and seven <pause dur="0.7"/> where we have the biographer in again <pause dur="0.7"/> <reading>to give a truthful account of London society <pause dur="0.3"/> at that or indeed at any other time <pause dur="0.4"/> is beyond the powers of the biographer <pause dur="0.7"/> or the historian <pause dur="1.0"/> only those who have little need of the truth <pause dur="0.3"/> and no respect for it <pause dur="0.6"/> the poets and the novelists can be trusted to do it <pause dur="1.4"/> for this is one of the cases where the truth <pause dur="0.6"/> does not exist <pause dur="1.1"/> nothing <pause dur="0.8"/> exists <pause dur="0.7"/> the whole thing is <pause dur="0.8"/> a miasma <pause dur="1.1"/> a mirage</reading> <pause dur="2.4"/> <unclear>i think</unclear> he's having a rather kind of bad day this biographer i think at this stage <pause dur="1.6"/> # <pause dur="0.8"/> and then again a few pages later <pause dur="0.4"/> they're both <pause dur="0.3"/> quotes from chapter four <unclear>to</unclear> when we're in the eighteenth century <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="1.8"/> he says <pause dur="0.3"/> <reading>as that is not a question that can engage the attention of a sensible man <pause dur="0.3"/> let us <pause dur="0.2"/> who enjoy the immunity of all 
biographers and historians from any sex whatsoever <pause dur="0.6"/> pass it over <pause dur="1.0"/> and merely state that Orlando <pause dur="0.3"/> professed <pause dur="0.4"/> great enjoyment in the society of her own sex <pause dur="0.7"/> and leave it to the gentlemen to prove as they are very fond of doing <pause dur="0.3"/> that <pause dur="0.4"/> it is impossible</reading> <pause dur="2.1"/> so both these quotes are as i say are from chapter <trunc>f</trunc> <pause dur="0.3"/> four when we're in the eighteenth century <pause dur="0.6"/> and in both Virginia Woolf <pause dur="0.6"/> elides the biographer and the historian <pause dur="0.6"/> suggesting that their's are very similar activities <pause dur="0.6"/> namely trying to get at <pause dur="0.2"/> the truth <pause dur="0.8"/> by scrutinizing a variety of secondary sources <pause dur="2.7"/><vocal desc="cough" iterated="n"/> <pause dur="0.7"/> but also suggesting that this is you know an impossible <pause dur="0.4"/> task in a way <pause dur="1.1"/> now this is at a stage in the text <pause dur="0.9"/> where Orlando vacillates <pause dur="0.3"/> between genders <pause dur="0.4"/> on a daily basis <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> but i don't want to <pause dur="0.2"/> kind of as i say talk about that in great detail now <trunc>t</trunc> talk about all those shifts in sexuality gendered identity <pause dur="0.5"/> the clothes and so on <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.9"/> what i do want to to just draw your attention to <pause dur="0.6"/> is the ways in which <pause dur="0.4"/> arguably <pause dur="0.3"/> Virginia 
Woolf <pause dur="1.0"/> also shifts and vacillates <pause dur="0.4"/> in the text here <pause dur="2.4"/> so <pause dur="0.2"/> to begin with i suggested when talking about the biographer <pause dur="0.6"/> that we should differentiate between <pause dur="0.4"/> this perplexed biographer <pause dur="0.2"/> historian figure <pause dur="0.5"/> and Virginia Woolf the author <pause dur="0.3"/> who lurks somewhere behind and beyond the text <pause dur="0.3"/> doing her best to make us all giggle <pause dur="0.4"/> at the biographer <pause dur="0.5"/> and historian and his limitations <pause dur="1.4"/> but in chapter four arguably <pause dur="0.7"/> in fact arguably throughout <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> she's also a presence in the text <pause dur="0.8"/> a distinct voice <pause dur="0.4"/> that's kind of <pause dur="0.7"/> moves in and out so sometimes it's the biographer and sometimes it's this other <pause dur="0.7"/> arch <pause dur="0.2"/> voice <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="1.5"/> and i think <pause dur="0.9"/> she her voice destabilizes our reading <pause dur="0.7"/> of the novel <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> so we can't read it as if it were just written by the biographer it's not that straightforward <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> she is the poet and novelist <pause dur="0.5"/> gesturing towards <pause dur="0.4"/> other kinds of knowledge <pause dur="1.4"/> other ways of <trunc>compremen</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> comprehending his <pause dur="0.5"/> or her <pause dur="0.4"/> stories <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> and i think she's a kind of <pause dur="0.5"/> androgynous or possibly female consciousness <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> which suggests that the biographer who 
assumes that masculinity is synonymous with universal truth <pause dur="0.5"/> is missing something <pause dur="0.9"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> so <pause dur="0.4"/> i mean i think if one feels kind of worried and anxious reading this text <pause dur="0.4"/> this is partly because <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> what Virginia Woolf is doing is precisely trying to to throw you <pause dur="0.5"/> and throw your assumptions about you know <pause dur="0.2"/> where you think you are <pause dur="0.9"/> # <pause dur="1.1"/> Gerda Lerner <pause dur="0.5"/> an American <pause dur="0.3"/> historiographer of women's history <pause dur="0.6"/> has commented <pause dur="0.7"/> and i'm sorry i'm <trunc>g</trunc> you know moving into American 'cause i was kind of where i'm really based <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> <reading>the key to understanding women's history <pause dur="0.6"/> is in accepting <pause dur="0.5"/> painful though it may be <pause dur="0.8"/> that it is the history <pause dur="0.4"/> of the majority <pause dur="0.5"/> of the human race</reading> <pause dur="0.9"/> so Virginia Woolf i think toys with the reader <pause dur="0.4"/> trying to tease out this recognition <pause dur="0.6"/> without quite stating it as emphatically as Gerda Lerner <pause dur="0.2"/> would for our generation which is a <pause dur="0.3"/> post-war <pause dur="0.4"/> generation <pause dur="0.3"/> <vocal desc="sniff" iterated="n"/> <pause dur="3.6"/> i want to mention briefly # just a few other aspects of Orlando <pause dur="0.4"/> as a kind of meditation on on history <pause dur="0.5"/> 
and historiography <pause dur="1.4"/> now the first is that i said that Orlando is a kind of critique a parody of the Whig version of history <pause dur="1.2"/> but we also get <pause dur="0.4"/> as it were <pause dur="0.3"/> the alternative <pause dur="0.2"/> to the Whig version of history <pause dur="0.5"/> and it's personified in the figure of Nick Greene <pause dur="1.4"/> the poet and man of letters <pause dur="0.6"/> who occurs in the Elizabethan era <pause dur="1.2"/> and reoccurs in modern times <pause dur="0.6"/> and if you recall <pause dur="0.7"/> he's always disaffected with the present age <pause dur="1.4"/> as an Elizabethan poet <pause dur="0.3"/> he prefers the classics <pause dur="0.8"/> and as a modern critic <pause dur="0.4"/> he abhors contemporary writing <pause dur="0.6"/> and harps back to the Elizabethan era <pause dur="0.6"/> as a glorious period in English literature <pause dur="0.6"/> its <pause dur="0.3"/> golden age <pause dur="0.6"/> now i've not given you this quotation i don't think but just to remind you <pause dur="0.4"/> when # <pause dur="1.6"/> Orlando meets him <pause dur="0.2"/> in London <pause dur="0.3"/> in the kind of the modern times <pause dur="1.2"/> <reading>ah he said heaving a sigh which was yet comfortable enough <pause dur="0.2"/> ah my dear lady <pause dur="0.3"/> the great days of literature are over <pause dur="0.4"/> Marlowe Shakespeare Ben Jonson <pause dur="0.3"/> those were the giants <pause dur="0.4"/> Dryden Pope Addison <pause dur="0.5"/> those were the heroes <pause dur="0.6"/> all <pause dur="0.4"/> all are 
dead now <pause dur="1.6"/> and whom have we left us <pause dur="0.6"/> Tennyson Browning Carlyle <pause dur="1.1"/> he threw an immense amount of scorn into his voice <pause dur="0.7"/> the truth of it is he said pouring himself a glass of wine <pause dur="0.4"/> that all our young writers are in the pay of booksellers <pause dur="0.2"/> they turn out any trash that serves to pay their tailor's bills <pause dur="0.7"/> it is an age he said helping himself to hors d'oeuvres <pause dur="0.5"/> marked by precious conceits and wild experiments <pause dur="0.5"/> none of which the Elizabethans would have tolerated for an instant</reading> <pause dur="1.5"/> so rather than believing that <pause dur="0.4"/> history is the story of the ascent of man <pause dur="0.3"/> to higher and higher peaks <pause dur="0.5"/> Nick Greene subscribes to the belief that <pause dur="0.3"/> history is all downhill <pause dur="0.6"/> moving <pause dur="0.4"/> further and further away from a <pause dur="0.4"/> putative golden age <pause dur="0.9"/> and Woolf indicates the kind of subjectivity <pause dur="0.5"/> and the fallacy <pause dur="0.5"/> in this analysis by having him <pause dur="0.4"/> glorify <pause dur="0.2"/> in modern times <pause dur="0.3"/> the exact same literary period <pause dur="0.3"/> which he was so dismissive about <pause dur="0.5"/> at the time in Elizabethan times <pause dur="1.3"/> okay one further <pause dur="0.4"/> reflection i think i have time for <pause dur="0.9"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> is 
that <pause dur="3.3"/> Orlando <pause dur="0.4"/> is both <pause dur="1.5"/> a fantastical <pause dur="0.9"/> biography a fantastical history of <pause dur="0.2"/> the lives and times of <pause dur="0.3"/> Orlando <pause dur="1.7"/> and as i say also a history of <pause dur="0.7"/> the English literary imagination and its succeeding styles <pause dur="0.4"/> which is perhaps the only proof we have <pause dur="1.5"/> and this is highlighted by Orlando's poem <pause dur="0.4"/> The Oak Tree <pause dur="0.8"/> which survives the centuries to win a literary prize in modern times <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> and it's also <pause dur="0.4"/> there in Woolf's parodying different literary styles <pause dur="1.0"/> <vocal desc="cough" iterated="n"/> <pause dur="0.5"/> but <pause dur="0.6"/> the general point i want to make is that <pause dur="2.2"/> and it applies both to history and literary history <pause dur="0.4"/> we tend to think of history <pause dur="0.6"/> in terms of <pause dur="0.3"/> periods <pause dur="0.2"/> and also to think of literary history in terms of <pause dur="0.4"/> periods which become <pause dur="0.3"/> synonymous or interchangeable with descriptions <pause dur="0.2"/> of style <pause dur="0.6"/> so in the course of this lecture <pause dur="0.6"/> i've referred to the Elizabethan era <pause dur="0.4"/> the eighteenth century the nineteenth century late Victorian culture modern times <pause dur="0.5"/> with a fairly confident assumption <pause dur="0.5"/> that when i use these terms they 
kind of mean something you have kind of clusters of associations which build up a picture <pause dur="0.6"/> of sort of snapshot picture of the these times <pause dur="0.8"/> but i think the terms are deceptive <pause dur="1.4"/> and they're a very shorthand way of indicating how time passes <pause dur="0.6"/> and how that passage of time affects cultures <pause dur="0.8"/> in actuality the passage of time from the Elizabethan era to the eighteenth century <pause dur="0.4"/> is not a handful of photographic images <pause dur="0.5"/> a succession of imagined snapshots <pause dur="0.5"/> but is a continuous <pause dur="0.3"/> fluid process <pause dur="0.4"/> the passage of time from seventeen-ninety-nine to eighteen-hundred <pause dur="0.8"/> similarly was fluid <pause dur="0.4"/> even if we speak of <pause dur="0.5"/> the eighteenth century as <pause dur="0.5"/> the time of the Enlightenment the age of reason <pause dur="0.4"/> and then the nineteenth century as the Victorian era <pause dur="0.9"/> # and <trunc>victu</trunc> <trunc>vic</trunc> <pause dur="0.5"/> and Virginia Woolf <pause dur="0.9"/> born into late Victorian culture <pause dur="0.4"/> didn't wake up one morning <pause dur="0.4"/> in nineteen-hundred <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> to discover that somehow she and everything around her had transformed <pause dur="0.4"/> overnight had metamorphosed like a kind of butterfly out of a <pause dur="0.4"/> 
you know pupa <pause dur="0.8"/> so <pause dur="0.3"/> i think this is why in her other writing <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> she is famously known as writing stream of consciousness <pause dur="0.4"/> style <pause dur="0.5"/> which is trying to capture the fluidity of the process rather than fix it <pause dur="0.5"/> in snapshots <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> and stream of consciousness is actually a translation of a French term <pause dur="0.3"/> <distinct lang="fr">élan vital</distinct> <pause dur="0.4"/> which is introduced # by the philosopher Henri Bergson <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.9"/> and in fact <distinct lang="fr">vital</distinct> is that word again <pause dur="0.3"/> Vita </u><gap reason="break in recording" extent="uncertain"/> <u who="nf0062" trans="pause"> if we look at the text of Orlando i <trunc>bo</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> A Biography <pause dur="0.6"/> # i think we find that most of the time <pause dur="0.5"/> she's <pause dur="0.6"/> not doing stream of consciousness <pause dur="0.3"/> because she is doing this kind of satire this parody this critique <pause dur="0.7"/> and one of the things she parodies <pause dur="0.3"/> is precisely our tendency <pause dur="0.5"/> to frame historical periods <pause dur="0.5"/> so at the end of chapter four she writes <pause dur="0.3"/> and i've given you that as the eighth extract <pause dur="0.4"/> # i don't think i'm going to give it to you all now <pause dur="0.7"/> <reading>Orlando could remember even now the smell of tortuous Elizabethan highways <pause dur="0.4"/> on a hot night <pause dur="0.4"/> in the little rooms and narrow pathways of 
the city <pause dur="0.4"/> now <pause dur="0.2"/> she leaned out of her window <pause dur="0.6"/> all was light <pause dur="0.3"/> order <pause dur="0.3"/> and serenity <pause dur="1.4"/> there was a faint rattle of a coach on the cobbles <pause dur="0.3"/> she heard the faraway cry of the night watchman <pause dur="0.4"/> just twelve o'clock on a frosty morning</reading> <pause dur="0.7"/> and then i'll skip a bit <pause dur="0.5"/> <reading>with the twelfth stroke of midnight <pause dur="0.4"/> the darkness was complete <pause dur="0.7"/> a turbulent welter of cloud covered the city <pause dur="0.7"/> all was darkness all was doubt all was confusion <pause dur="0.4"/> the eighteenth century was over <pause dur="0.5"/> the nineteenth century <pause dur="0.2"/> had begun</reading> <pause dur="0.3"/> so the eighteenth century is <pause dur="0.5"/> all was light <pause dur="0.2"/> order and serenity <pause dur="0.6"/> and then as soon as you get the last stroke of midnight <pause dur="0.3"/> all was darkness all was doubt all was confusion <pause dur="0.3"/> clearly there's a critique <pause dur="0.8"/> of the ways in which we talk about historical <pause dur="0.2"/> times <pause dur="1.3"/> so what do we conclude from all this <pause dur="2.0"/> one of Virginia Woolf's <pause dur="0.2"/> recurring preoccupations <pause dur="0.6"/> is to do with her own situation as a woman of letters in patriarchal culture <pause dur="0.9"/> and she returns again and again to note <pause dur="0.4"/> the difference it makes to be a woman in a patriarchy <pause dur="0.9"/> and she can 
be witty and scathing about this <pause dur="1.0"/> but <pause dur="0.2"/> one of the benefits of her position <pause dur="1.3"/> is that she cannot <pause dur="0.2"/> take for granted all the things <pause dur="0.4"/> which a man of letters whether he be historian biographer <pause dur="0.4"/> editor <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> critic publisher poet or novelist <pause dur="0.3"/> just <pause dur="0.2"/> takes as read <pause dur="0.7"/> so i would argue that Virginia Woolf's lesbian attraction <pause dur="0.6"/> to Vita Sackville-West <pause dur="0.4"/> might well have been a catalyst <pause dur="0.7"/> # the catalyst which <pause dur="0.2"/> decided her to write <pause dur="0.2"/> this <pause dur="0.2"/> jeu d'esprit <pause dur="0.5"/> a satire a whole fantasy <pause dur="0.5"/> and these are all phrases <pause dur="0.4"/> which Virginia uses in her diary as she starts to conceive the project <pause dur="1.0"/> but the the completed work <pause dur="0.2"/> is far more than just this jeu d'esprit <pause dur="0.7"/> through parody <pause dur="0.6"/> Woolf <pause dur="0.2"/> both enacts and then critiques the history and literary history of her culture <pause dur="0.8"/> from <pause dur="0.2"/> as it were a different space <pause dur="0.4"/> now what the diary entry actually says is <pause dur="1.0"/> <reading>no attempt is to be made to realize the character <pause dur="0.5"/> sapphism is to be suggested <pause dur="0.6"/> satire is to be 
the main note <pause dur="0.5"/> satire <pause dur="0.5"/> and <pause dur="0.3"/> wilderness</reading> <pause dur="1.8"/> now you might object that there's not much wilderness <pause dur="0.2"/> in the text <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> and i think literally speaking that's true <pause dur="0.6"/> but conceptually <pause dur="0.2"/> the text is written from if you want the cultural wilderness <pause dur="0.5"/> from the wild spaces of female culture <pause dur="0.5"/> which gazes <pause dur="0.3"/> sceptically on patriarchal culture <pause dur="0.3"/> from the margins <pause dur="0.5"/> now Elaine Showalter in the eighties <pause dur="0.5"/> theorized this wild zone of female culture <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> when trying to talk about a female aesthetic in woman's writing <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> and so that's why next term when i talk about modernism and gender <pause dur="0.4"/> i want to come back to those issues and try and give <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> a more coherent account of of Virginia Woolf's <pause dur="0.3"/> ideas about women's writing <pause dur="0.3"/> and again how it might be applied to a reading <pause dur="0.2"/> of this text <pause dur="0.4"/> sorry i've overrun again by a few minutes
