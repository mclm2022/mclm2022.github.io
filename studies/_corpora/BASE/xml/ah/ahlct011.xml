<u who="nf0059"> just to warn you that # <pause dur="1.0"/> # it's a slightly high-tech <pause dur="0.5"/> performance in that i intend to show slides <pause dur="0.5"/> and it's taken me most of the morning to get the slide projector room open # the chances of that actually appearing at the right moment <pause dur="0.5"/> is fairly slim so bear with me if there's some technical hitches <pause dur="0.3"/> also the Centre for Applied Language Studies is <pause dur="0.3"/> taping this lecture <pause dur="0.3"/> # simply to to to use for <pause dur="0.2"/> language <pause dur="0.2"/> study </u> <u who="om0060" trans="overlap"> language study yes </u><pause dur="0.2"/> <u who="nf0059" trans="pause"> # <pause dur="0.6"/> so # hence slightly more microphones than normal <pause dur="1.6"/> we're looking at representations of Elizabeth the First in this lecture <pause dur="0.5"/> # i've already touched on this on a number of occasions in relation to The Faerie Queene and other lecturers may have touched on it as <pause dur="0.4"/> as well <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> clearly for The Faerie Queene <pause dur="0.6"/> Elizabeth the First is a crucial <pause dur="0.4"/> figure the whole poem <pause dur="0.5"/> # the title of the whole poem <pause dur="0.2"/> The Faerie Queene to some extent reflects on Elizabeth the poem is dedicated to Elizabeth <pause dur="0.4"/> and she dominates the imagination <pause dur="0.4"/> of <pause dur="0.2"/> most courtly poets most poets <pause dur="0.3"/> writing <pause dur="0.3"/> 
for <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> # a middle class or courtly audience # in the period <pause dur="1.1"/> and what i'm going to try and do in this lecture <pause dur="0.3"/> is to some extent explore <pause dur="0.5"/> why that's the case <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.9"/> # some of the preoccupations her subjects <pause dur="0.4"/> # felt when they thought about Elizabeth # as a Queen some of the problems <pause dur="0.3"/> that she presented <pause dur="0.4"/> to # <pause dur="0.3"/> her country <pause dur="0.4"/> # # particularly the imagination of her country rather than the actual government <pause dur="0.3"/> of her country which seems to have been carried out <pause dur="0.4"/> # perfectly happily <pause dur="0.2"/> during the time that she was in charge <pause dur="0.9"/> # and i'll go on to look at <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="1.5"/> instances of her appearance in The Faerie Queene <pause dur="0.4"/> and one or two instances of appearance <pause dur="0.2"/> in other poems so if you've got your # <pause dur="0.5"/> Renaissance anthology with you i'll refer to one or two poems there <pause dur="1.5"/> Elizabeth the First still dominates the imagination <pause dur="0.4"/> # not only i think of people in this country but probably abroad <pause dur="0.4"/> # i didn't get to see the David Starkey <pause dur="0.2"/> television series which i understand has just finished <pause dur="0.4"/> and i hope i don't contradict anything that 
he <pause dur="0.3"/> # says but the fact that <pause dur="0.2"/> # a series of television programmes could have been devoted to <pause dur="0.3"/> Elizabeth in the late twentieth century <pause dur="0.4"/> # as well as a recent film some of you might have seen the recent film <pause dur="0.4"/> # # on Elizabeth the First <pause dur="0.4"/> # for the cinema <pause dur="0.3"/> # is again an indication of the kind of hold <pause dur="0.3"/> she's had <pause dur="0.3"/> on our imagination <pause dur="2.6"/> # <pause dur="1.0"/> we tend to think nowadays # <pause dur="0.2"/> of <pause dur="0.2"/> government to being to a great extent <pause dur="0.5"/> dictated to glamorized by spin doctors <pause dur="0.3"/> but as i hope to show Elizabeth was no <trunc>s</trunc> <pause dur="0.4"/> # slouch in this area herself <pause dur="0.3"/> in the sixteenth century <pause dur="0.4"/> # the government was <pause dur="0.2"/> fairly sophisticated at spinning <pause dur="0.2"/> Elizabeth and Elizabeth was fairly good at it <pause dur="0.3"/> herself <pause dur="0.3"/> so that the consciousness of image <pause dur="0.2"/> of how one appeared <pause dur="0.3"/> to the public at large <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> is evident <pause dur="0.2"/> throughout Elizabeth's reign and # to some extent our own fascination # this fascination with Elizabeth <pause dur="0.4"/> in the in the following centuries including the twentieth century <pause dur="0.3"/> is a tribute to how successful <pause dur="0.2"/> she and her spin doctors <pause dur="0.3"/> were <pause dur="0.4"/> # when i say spin 
doctors of course they weren't professional P-R <pause dur="0.2"/> people but <pause dur="0.3"/> they knew how to manipulate <pause dur="0.3"/> the public pretty effectively <pause dur="1.2"/> and we'll be looking <pause dur="0.3"/> at some of the ways in which they did this <pause dur="5.8"/> on the other hand i mean there's so that there's Elizabeth and her her ministers who are <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> thinking very carefully about Elizabeth's public image how she appeared not only to her own people <pause dur="0.3"/> and to those abroad <pause dur="0.4"/> but there's also <pause dur="0.3"/> a kind of two-way process <pause dur="0.2"/> here <pause dur="0.4"/> in that Elizabeth was the source of all patronage she was the source of power <pause dur="0.4"/> in the nation <pause dur="0.3"/> anybody who wanted power <pause dur="0.4"/> who wanted patronage <pause dur="0.3"/> through the court <pause dur="0.2"/> had to please Elizabeth so there's a two-way process <pause dur="0.3"/> # writers <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> those in search of <pause dur="0.4"/> # advancement at court are going to use a language <pause dur="0.3"/> going to talk about Elizabeth in a way <pause dur="0.2"/> that pleases her <pause dur="0.4"/> so that they are also contributing to the myth <pause dur="0.3"/> to the glamorization <pause dur="0.4"/> # of Elizabeth <pause dur="0.3"/> they know where their bread <pause dur="0.3"/> is buttered and # the language of courtliness is adept at pleasing Elizabeth 
and we'll come back to this <pause dur="0.3"/> # a little bit later on in the lecture <pause dur="0.8"/> first of all just some some facts and and and basic <pause dur="0.5"/> aspects of Elizabeth as Queen <pause dur="0.8"/> she inherited the throne in fifteen-fifty-eight <pause dur="0.5"/> after # an extraordinarily <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="1.6"/> up and down series of reigns her father Henry the Eighth had died <pause dur="0.4"/> back in fifteen-forty-<pause dur="0.3"/>seven <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> leaving the throne to his son who was then under age and who died <pause dur="0.4"/> # not long afterwards <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> Henry the Eighth had as you know <pause dur="0.4"/> begun the English Reformation he had broken away from <pause dur="0.3"/> the Roman Catholic Church and the papacy <pause dur="0.3"/> although <pause dur="0.3"/> the church under Henry the Eighth tended to be a fairly conservative <pause dur="0.4"/> # Roman Catholic-like <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> institution with Roman Catholic <pause dur="0.2"/> Catholic-like <pause dur="0.3"/> doctrine and <pause dur="0.2"/> forms of worship <pause dur="0.7"/> # Henry the Eighth's son was # dominated # by advisers who were much more <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> Protestant in their views and the whole church moved <pause dur="0.3"/> towards a # what was thought of as a kind of extreme Protestantism <pause dur="0.3"/> during the few years of his reign <pause dur="0.6"/> no sooner had the 
church been moved strongly towards Protestant doctrine and worship <pause dur="0.3"/> than # <pause dur="0.2"/> Edward died <pause dur="0.4"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> Mary the First <pause dur="0.5"/> # Henry the Eighth's eldest daughter Mary the First came to the throne <pause dur="0.2"/> she was <pause dur="0.2"/> a a staunch Catholic deeply resented <pause dur="0.4"/> # her father's break from Rome <pause dur="0.5"/> which had been involved # which had had # <pause dur="0.5"/> been part of the <trunc>divo</trunc> his divorce from Mary's mother <pause dur="0.2"/> Catherine of Aragon <pause dur="0.4"/> and she moved the whole <pause dur="0.3"/> church England the church everything back towards <pause dur="0.2"/> a fairly extreme form of Catholicism <pause dur="0.5"/> # no sooner had she done this and burned a few <pause dur="0.3"/> # hundred <pause dur="0.3"/> # Protestants <pause dur="0.2"/> # than she too died <pause dur="0.8"/> so that through much of the middle years of the sixteenth century England had shifted every few years <pause dur="0.3"/> from an extreme form of Protestantism to a an extreme form of Catholicism <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> Elizabeth came to the throne in fifteen-fifty-eight <pause dur="0.4"/> # the younger daughter of Henry the Eighth <pause dur="0.4"/> # in normal <pause dur="0.3"/> # circumstances not someone who would be expected to inherit the throne at all <pause dur="0.3"/> and really an unknown quantity <pause dur="0.3"/> as far as 
many of her subjects <pause dur="0.3"/> were concerned <pause dur="0.6"/> and the question of religion <pause dur="0.4"/> and the question of stability the stability of the kingdom as you can imagine was very much on people's minds is this woman going to be able <pause dur="0.5"/> to keep the the the the <pause dur="0.2"/> the throne stable what's she going to do about religion are we going to be shifted again <pause dur="0.3"/> into a whole series of switchback <pause dur="0.4"/> terms of policy <pause dur="1.2"/> not only <pause dur="0.3"/> was there <pause dur="0.3"/> an understandable anxiety about stability <pause dur="0.2"/> # and the future <pause dur="0.5"/> but the fact that it was another woman on the throne <pause dur="0.4"/> was a cause of deep concern <pause dur="0.4"/> to her subjects <pause dur="0.5"/> as i've already explained to you in previous lectures <pause dur="0.5"/> the <pause dur="0.3"/> Elizabethan assumption <pause dur="0.2"/> of a God-given natural order and of course for them everything in the world was God-given <pause dur="0.3"/> it reflected divine providence <pause dur="0.3"/> and God in their view had designed the world with men in charge that's what <pause dur="0.3"/> men were made for <pause dur="0.2"/> and women were made to be subservient we've already looked at at quotations <pause dur="0.4"/> # where this assumption <pause dur="0.4"/> on <pause dur="0.2"/> # the part of most people men and women 
of course <pause dur="0.3"/> in the period <pause dur="0.3"/> # is expressed <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> the the the the God-given pattern of the world is a patriarchy <pause dur="0.4"/> and my goodness here's another woman in charge <pause dur="0.4"/> # we <trunc>f</trunc> they saw <trunc>h</trunc> what had happened when her sister had been in charge <pause dur="0.3"/> what on earth was this woman <pause dur="0.3"/> going to do <pause dur="0.4"/> and you get some of the sense of <pause dur="0.2"/> appalled <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> # almost inconceivable response to having a woman in charge <pause dur="0.3"/> from the first extract on the sheets that you have <pause dur="1.0"/> if you just look at the handouts <pause dur="1.7"/> do you want one of these too <event desc="passes handout to observer" iterated="n"/></u><u who="om0060" trans="latching"> <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/></u><u who="nf0059" trans="latching"> <vocal desc="laugh" iterated="n"/><pause dur="1.1"/> it's a good bit of Scottish prose so # <pause dur="0.4"/> it's <pause dur="0.2"/> fun to look at <pause dur="0.5"/> this is <pause dur="0.2"/> from # <pause dur="0.2"/> a book <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="1.8"/> sorry my my handout <pause dur="0.4"/> isn't <pause dur="0.5"/> as clear as it should be <pause dur="0.4"/> # in fact extract A <pause dur="0.5"/> is from the book that's listed as <pause dur="0.2"/> B i'm sorry this is my <pause dur="0.5"/> hastily <pause dur="0.5"/> putting the B in the wrong place when i redid this handout this morning <pause dur="0.5"/> # so extract A is from <pause dur="0.3"/> The First Blast of the Trumpet against the Monstrous Regiment of Women a very famous <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> book produced in fifteen-fifty-eight <pause dur="0.4"/> by <pause dur="0.3"/> the Scottish <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> reformer John Knox <pause dur="0.6"/> the first thing 
to be said about this extract is it <pause dur="0.2"/> is one of the most unfortunately timed bit of writing <pause dur="0.4"/> in the history of print <pause dur="0.5"/> John Knox produced this about three months before Elizabeth <pause dur="0.3"/> came to the throne <pause dur="0.4"/> three months before her sister Mary the First died <pause dur="0.6"/> John Knox was an ardent <pause dur="0.4"/> Protestant an ardent reformer <pause dur="0.4"/> and the women he's attacking <pause dur="0.2"/> are the Catholic women <pause dur="0.3"/> on the throne <pause dur="0.4"/> the throne of France <pause dur="0.3"/> and the throne of Scotland Mary Queen of Scots <pause dur="0.3"/> and the throne of England Mary Tudor <pause dur="0.4"/> so that John Knox has his sights on Catholic queens <pause dur="0.3"/> who of course confirm all his prejudices <pause dur="0.2"/> about women on the throne <pause dur="0.5"/> had he known just three months later <pause dur="0.6"/> that Mary was going to die and the Protestant Elizabeth was going to come to the throne he would not have published this <pause dur="0.3"/> he spent <pause dur="0.2"/> the next twenty year of his life years of his life trying to apologize and undo this <pause dur="0.2"/> as far as Elizabeth was concerned but <trunc>adas</trunc> <pause dur="0.3"/> the damage was done and she would not allow him into her kingdom <pause dur="0.4"/> # let alone forgive him for 
ever writing it <pause dur="0.9"/> i want to just pick up a couple of points a couple of moments from this # i won't read the whole thing <pause dur="0.3"/> but if you could look at the first paragraph where my marking in the margin begins and i'll just read that paragraph <pause dur="0.4"/> and the second paragraph <pause dur="1.7"/> <reading>who can denie</reading> says John Knox <pause dur="0.2"/> <reading>but it repugneth to nature <pause dur="0.5"/> that the blind shal be appointed to leade and conduct such as do see <pause dur="1.4"/> that the weake <pause dur="0.2"/> the sicke <pause dur="0.2"/> and impotent persones shall norishe and kepe the hole and strong <pause dur="0.7"/> and finallie that the foolishe <pause dur="0.2"/> madde <pause dur="0.3"/> and phrenetike <pause dur="0.4"/> shal gouerne the discrete <pause dur="0.4"/> and giue counsel to such as be sober of mind</reading> <pause dur="0.8"/> can such things be thought of <trunc>i</trunc> it's it's nonsense to do such things <pause dur="0.7"/> <reading>and such <pause dur="0.3"/> be al women <pause dur="0.3"/> compared unto man <pause dur="0.3"/> in bearing of authoritie</reading> <pause dur="0.8"/> in other words the women <pause dur="0.3"/> are the weak <pause dur="0.6"/> the sick <pause dur="0.2"/> the impotent the foolish the mad and the frenetic <pause dur="0.4"/> and they are taking upon themselves to guide and to lead <pause dur="0.4"/> the whole <pause dur="0.3"/> the sound <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> the strong <pause dur="0.3"/> # and the discreet so this is it's repugneth to nature it is against all conception that such things can happen <pause dur="0.4"/> but such it is to have women <pause dur="0.3"/> on the throne <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> # on the throne <pause dur="0.3"/> # ruling over men <pause dur="0.7"/> 
then he goes on <pause dur="0.5"/> <reading>oh fearefull and terrible are thy iudgementes o Lord <pause dur="0.3"/> whiche thus hast abased man for his iniquitie <pause dur="0.8"/> i am assuredlie persuaded that if any of those men which illuminated onelie by the light of nature <pause dur="0.4"/> did see and pronounce causes sufficient <pause dur="0.3"/> why women oght not to beare rule <pause dur="0.3"/> nor authoritie <pause dur="0.5"/> shuld this day liue and see a woman <pause dur="0.2"/> sitting in iudgement <pause dur="0.4"/> or riding frome parliament in the middest of men <pause dur="0.4"/> hauing the royall crowne upon her head <pause dur="0.4"/> the sworde and sceptre borne before her <pause dur="0.4"/> in signe that the administration of iustice was in her power <pause dur="0.8"/> i am <trunc>sur</trunc> assuredlie persuaded i say <pause dur="0.4"/> that suche a <trunc>shi</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> sight <pause dur="0.3"/> shulde so astonishe <pause dur="0.2"/> men <pause dur="0.2"/> <trunc>th</trunc></reading> # advisers of the past <pause dur="0.5"/> <reading>that they shuld iudge the hole worlde to be transformed <pause dur="0.3"/> into Amazones <pause dur="0.5"/> and suche a metamorphosis and change was made all of the men of that countrie <pause dur="0.4"/> as poetes do feyn <pause dur="0.2"/> was made of the companyons of Vlisses</reading> who were turned of course into beasts <reading><pause dur="0.7"/> or at least that albeit the owtwarde form 
of men remained <pause dur="0.3"/> yet shuld they iudge that their hartes were changed <pause dur="0.3"/> frome the wisdome vnderstanding and courage of men <pause dur="0.4"/> to the foolishe fondnes <pause dur="0.2"/> and cowardise <pause dur="0.3"/> of women</reading> so here you see prejudice in its pure <pause dur="0.3"/> untainted form <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> one of the things i want you to <trunc>d</trunc> to just <pause dur="0.2"/> # draw your attention to <pause dur="1.1"/> # here <pause dur="0.3"/> is that <pause dur="0.5"/> for Knox <pause dur="0.6"/> to have a queen on the throne and remember he's talking about Catholic queens <pause dur="0.2"/> this was printed before Elizabeth came to the throne <pause dur="0.3"/> but nevertheless he sees this as as God's pattern in in a sense <pause dur="0.4"/> # <trunc>i</trunc> he # to be to be # consistent he has to apply this to Elizabeth as well <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> he sees <pause dur="0.4"/> the imposition of a queen on the throne as a form of judgement by God <pause dur="0.5"/> and it indicates that if women are on the throne men are emasculated men are effeminate <pause dur="0.3"/> it is the punishment <pause dur="0.4"/> for effeminate men <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> so that this sort of combination this sort of <pause dur="0.8"/> # thought process <pause dur="0.2"/> of an emasculating women or or sorry a masculine woman <pause dur="0.3"/> a woman in the role of men <pause dur="0.4"/> equals <pause dur="0.2"/> effeminate 
<trunc>me</trunc> # effeminate men <pause dur="0.2"/> emasculated men <pause dur="0.4"/> is a thought process that we'll find over and over again in this period <pause dur="0.3"/> it the two go together <pause dur="0.3"/> and is one reason why <pause dur="0.2"/> there is such a fear <pause dur="0.4"/> of powerful women in the period <pause dur="0.2"/> it inevitably implies <pause dur="0.3"/> the <pause dur="0.2"/> powerlessness the impotence and the feminization <pause dur="0.4"/> of of women and you can see this working <pause dur="0.3"/> very clearly <pause dur="0.4"/> in John Knox's <pause dur="0.4"/> # passage <pause dur="1.8"/> # John Knox's <pause dur="0.2"/> First Blast of the Trumpet <pause dur="0.5"/> had to be answered he was an influential Protestant thinker <pause dur="0.4"/> and this # treatise got well circulated <pause dur="0.7"/> and he's answered and here i'm sorry i put the B in the wrong place and i haven't given you a reference for the second <pause dur="0.3"/> passage <pause dur="0.4"/> # at the bottom of your sheets <pause dur="0.5"/> this is a defence of Elizabeth <pause dur="0.4"/> published by someone called <pause dur="0.4"/> Bishop Aylmer i'll just write that on the board <pause dur="11.4"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="9"/> if you can <pause dur="0.5"/> read my writing A-Y-L-M-E-R <pause dur="0.3"/> Bishop Aylmer <pause dur="0.5"/> and this was <pause dur="0.3"/> commissioned or # approved certainly by <pause dur="0.4"/> # Elizabeth's government <pause dur="0.4"/> # but what's interesting <pause dur="1.2"/> is that # <pause dur="0.5"/> Aylmer who was #

there were problems because she couldn't produce an heir <pause dur="0.8"/> and # <pause dur="0.2"/> England looking back <pause dur="0.2"/> to a period of <pause dur="0.5"/> instability in the mid-sixteenth century and even more to prolonged instability for over a hundred years in the previous century <pause dur="0.6"/> very much wanted an heir wanted the succession to be clear <pause dur="0.4"/> Elizabeth might be a woman but the hope was she would produce a male heir <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> in order to ensure the succession <pause dur="0.4"/> in the future <pause dur="1.4"/> however if Elizabeth # <pause dur="0.6"/> # were to have children there was always the danger of death <pause dur="0.2"/> in childbirth # women often died in childbirth <pause dur="0.3"/> # in this period so wherever you looked <pause dur="0.3"/> if she married if she didn't marry <pause dur="0.3"/> there were huge <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> problem <pause dur="1.2"/> problems <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> for <trunc>e</trunc> Elizabeth and her # <pause dur="0.7"/> # and and her subjects to worry about <pause dur="2.8"/> so Elizabeth is very aware her government is very aware that they have a certain amount of groundwork to cover in order to <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> # produce some faith in her # ability to lead the <trunc>co</trunc> the kingdom effectively <pause dur="0.6"/> we've seen how the <pause dur="0.2"/> government approved of Bishop

continuation of a Protestant <pause dur="0.4"/> dynasty was absolutely crucial <pause dur="0.4"/> to people in England especially her Parliament <pause dur="0.5"/> and you here see her here very deftly <pause dur="0.3"/> answering this in number C <pause dur="1.3"/> <reading>though i am determined in this so great and weighty a matter to defer mine answer till some other time <pause dur="0.4"/> <trunc>b</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> because i will not in so deep a matter wade with so shallow a wit</reading> <pause dur="0.4"/> this is in reply to their petition for her to marry <pause dur="0.4"/> <reading>yet have i thought good to use these few words <pause dur="0.3"/> as well to show you that i am neither careless nor unmindful <pause dur="0.3"/> of your safety in this case <pause dur="0.5"/> as i trust you likewise do not forget <pause dur="0.3"/> that by me <pause dur="0.2"/> you were delivered <pause dur="0.3"/> whilst you were hanging on the bough ready to fall into the mud <pause dur="0.5"/> yet to be drowned in the dung <pause dur="0.5"/> neither yet do you forget the promise <pause dur="0.3"/> which you have here made concerning your duties and your obedience <pause dur="0.3"/> wherewith i assure you i mean to charge you <pause dur="0.6"/> as further to let you understand <pause dur="0.2"/> that i neither mislike of any of your requests herein <pause dur="0.3"/> nor the 
great care that you seem to have of the surety <pause dur="0.3"/> and safety of yourselves in this matter <pause dur="0.9"/> lastly because i will discharge some restless heads <pause dur="0.3"/> in whose brains the needless hammers beat with vain judgement <pause dur="0.4"/> that i should mislike this their petition <pause dur="0.6"/> i say that of the matter and sum thereof i like and allow very well</reading> <pause dur="0.7"/> the petition # just to remind you again was for her to marry <pause dur="0.6"/> <reading>as to the circumstances if any be <pause dur="0.4"/> i mean upon further advice further to answer <pause dur="0.6"/> and so i assure you all <pause dur="0.4"/> that though after my death you may have many stepdames <pause dur="0.4"/> yet shall you never have a more natural mother <pause dur="0.3"/> than i mean to be unto you all</reading> <pause dur="0.8"/> the syntax is difficult for us to follow now it's a sixteenth century syntax and it's a speech <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> but i just want to draw your attention to the very deftness of Elizabeth <pause dur="0.5"/> she reminds them that <pause dur="0.2"/> really their safety depends on her <pause dur="0.3"/> that she has delivered them from a terrible situation <pause dur="0.3"/> you were hanging on the bough she says <pause dur="0.2"/> 
ready to fall into the mud <pause dur="0.4"/> if i look away that's where you'll fall you depend on me she's reminding them <pause dur="0.3"/> of her power <pause dur="0.5"/> she also reminds them of her authority <pause dur="0.5"/> she says i will discharge some restless heads in whose brains the needless hammers beat with vain judgement <pause dur="0.4"/> she doesn't mince her words she disapproves <pause dur="0.3"/> of certain kind of tittle-tattle <pause dur="0.3"/> that's going about <pause dur="0.6"/> but she's so she behaves with the authority of a man here reminding them of their position <pause dur="0.2"/> reminding them of her authority <pause dur="0.5"/> but also she uses a language <pause dur="0.3"/> of <pause dur="0.2"/> female gender <pause dur="0.5"/> that you may have many stepdames she says but you will never have a more natural mother <pause dur="0.3"/> so this balancing of threat <pause dur="0.4"/> and assurance <pause dur="0.2"/> of a language <trunc>o</trunc> # gendered male and a language gendered female <pause dur="0.3"/> is very deftly done indeed <pause dur="1.1"/> her most <pause dur="0.4"/> famous example of this <pause dur="0.3"/> <trunc>mis</trunc> # this deployment <pause dur="0.2"/> of a a gendered male language but drawing on her female <pause dur="0.4"/> body in this # instance <pause dur="0.3"/> is in D the very famous speech <pause dur="0.2"/> that she is reputed to have given <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> at Tilbury <pause dur="0.3"/> as her troops <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> gathered together to defend <pause dur="0.3"/> # England against the Spanish Armada <pause dur="0.4"/> which was on the seas at this point <pause dur="0.4"/> 
and she says # there in the military tamp camp at Milbury <pause dur="0.6"/> Tilbury sorry <pause dur="0.4"/> <reading>i am come amongst you as you see at this time <pause dur="0.4"/> not for my recreation and disport <pause dur="0.4"/> but being resolved in the midst and heat of the battle <pause dur="0.3"/> to live or die amongst you <pause dur="0.4"/> to lay down for my God and for my kingdom and for my people <pause dur="0.3"/> my honour and my blood <pause dur="0.2"/> even in the dust <pause dur="0.6"/> i know i have the body but of a weak and feeble woman <pause dur="0.4"/> but i have the heart and stomach of a king <pause dur="0.3"/> and of a <trunc>kinglan</trunc> king of England too <pause dur="0.3"/> and think foul scorn that Parma or Spain <pause dur="0.3"/> or any of prince of Europe should dare invade <pause dur="0.2"/> the borders of my realm <pause dur="0.4"/> to which rather than any dishonour shall grow by me <pause dur="0.3"/> i myself will take up arms <pause dur="0.3"/> i myself will be your general <pause dur="0.3"/> judge <pause dur="0.3"/> and rewarder <pause dur="0.3"/> are every one <pause dur="0.2"/> of your virtues <pause dur="0.3"/> in this field</reading> so again <pause dur="0.3"/> # sort of # Shakespeare must have felt i wish i could have written that <pause dur="0.4"/> # as well it's a very fine <pause dur="0.2"/> speech playing on her femaleness <pause dur="0.3"/> but <pause dur="0.2"/> claiming that she will take on the character of a man <pause dur="0.2"/> and 
indeed in many ways she already has <pause dur="0.2"/> the character of a man to withstand <pause dur="0.3"/> invasion <pause dur="0.2"/> from without <pause dur="6.6"/> what with the speech at Tilbury indeed both the speeches we've just looked at show how Elizabeth could play on different versions of herself <pause dur="0.8"/> representations of Elizabeth could shift between a number of possibilities <pause dur="0.7"/> at Tilbury <pause dur="0.3"/> the rhetoric of # male military courage <pause dur="1.4"/> Elizabeth playing on herself as the figurehead of an elect Protestant nation confronting the Catholic powers of darkness <pause dur="0.4"/> is exploited <pause dur="0.6"/> but she could also play on her weak and feeble body of a woman needing protection <pause dur="0.3"/> calling on the gallantry <pause dur="0.3"/> of those surrounding her <pause dur="1.3"/> as a woman too <pause dur="0.3"/> she could personify the virtues of England she could make of herself a <sic corr="kind">sind</sic> of <pause dur="0.3"/> personified <pause dur="0.2"/> figurehead <pause dur="0.4"/> for England <pause dur="0.9"/> Gloriana <pause dur="0.5"/> or an embodiment of truth <pause dur="0.4"/> or an embodiment of the true church as in the Cheapside pageant <pause dur="1.0"/> she could represent herself as a virgin wedded to her country <pause dur="0.4"/> or a natural mother to her country <pause dur="0.8"/> but the <trunc>s</trunc> at the same time

of Elizabeth <pause dur="0.4"/> you will find <pause dur="0.5"/> nice illustrations of at least two of the pictures in fact all three of the pictures <pause dur="0.4"/> that # i would have shown to you <pause dur="1.1"/> the first one is the frontispiece of the official translation of the Bible <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> the Bishop's Bible authorized by Elizabeth's government <pause dur="0.4"/> which has a a woodcut frontispiece <pause dur="0.4"/> and the frontispiece represents Elizabeth at the top of the page <pause dur="0.6"/> sitting in her throne actually with her hair <pause dur="0.4"/> down <pause dur="0.3"/> as an unmarried virgin <pause dur="0.5"/> handing out copies of the Bible <pause dur="0.4"/> to her clergy <pause dur="0.2"/> on either side <pause dur="0.4"/> so here we have a visual image of Elizabeth <pause dur="0.4"/> not only in charge <pause dur="0.4"/> but almost in a in a slightly <pause dur="0.8"/> # deified position as though she's the representative of God on Earth <pause dur="0.4"/> handing out the word of God <pause dur="0.3"/> to the male clergymen on either side so a very clear image <pause dur="0.3"/> of this providential <pause dur="0.5"/> Protestant <pause dur="0.3"/> divinely ordained aspect of Elizabeth <pause dur="1.6"/> the second portrait is a portrait called the Ermine portrait and i put these on the board for you <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> which is now at Hatfield House <pause dur="0.8"/> which is an 
image of Elizabeth dressed very soberly in black <pause dur="0.9"/> and she sits at a table <pause dur="0.6"/> and there are two objects beside her <pause dur="0.5"/> emblematic objects telling us about the nature <pause dur="0.2"/> of Elizabeth <pause dur="0.3"/> she's a very <pause dur="0.4"/> she's dressed privately not in coronation robes <pause dur="0.3"/> privately <pause dur="0.3"/> but a very regal <pause dur="0.2"/> figure <pause dur="0.6"/> and the two objects at her side are a sword <pause dur="0.7"/> in its scabbard <pause dur="0.9"/> and a little ermine <pause dur="0.4"/> little you know one of these little ferret <pause dur="0.7"/> creatures a white ferret <pause dur="0.6"/> but it's an ermine it has <pause dur="0.2"/> flecks of black <pause dur="0.5"/> in it <pause dur="0.5"/> # i believe ermines actually have a just a black tail but this actually has <pause dur="0.2"/> flecks of black <pause dur="0.3"/> and little crown round its <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> its throat <pause dur="0.7"/> # the two images <pause dur="0.7"/> very much point to the two bodies if you like of Elizabeth and i'll come back to this idea in a moment <pause dur="0.7"/> Elizabeth's <pause dur="0.2"/> public monarchical self <pause dur="0.4"/> the the the sword in its scabbard it's there to be drawn if she needs it #<pause dur="0.3"/> the sword of justice <pause dur="0.6"/> and the ermine points to her purity as a woman <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> the ermine was thought never to allow its coat to be dirty <pause dur="0.6"/> it would never allow 
its coat to be soiled therefore it was a <pause dur="0.2"/> # commonly an image of <pause dur="0.2"/> virginity of chastity <pause dur="0.5"/> # so we have the two <pause dur="0.3"/> aspects of Elizabeth <pause dur="0.4"/> her female purity <pause dur="0.4"/> and her power <pause dur="0.5"/> beside her arm <pause dur="1.0"/> the third portrait and again you might like to look this up in # it's a very fine portrait some of you may know it <pause dur="0.3"/> it's in the National Portrait Gallery in London <pause dur="0.5"/> is the Ditchley portrait produced in fifteen-ninety-two <pause dur="1.1"/> and this is a fantastic image of Elizabeth <pause dur="0.4"/> as a huge goddess <trunc>fa</trunc> figure <pause dur="0.5"/> standing on England she actually stands in Oxfordshire she's standing on Oxfordshire <pause dur="0.4"/> and she soars hugely above her kingdom <pause dur="0.4"/> with her head <pause dur="0.4"/> in the clouds <pause dur="0.2"/> she's a goddess figure <pause dur="0.7"/> her <trunc>k</trunc> skirt <pause dur="0.2"/> she's dressed in white <pause dur="0.3"/> her skirt encompasses <pause dur="0.2"/> more or less the boundaries <pause dur="0.3"/> of England <pause dur="0.3"/> there's a sort of <pause dur="0.5"/> # <trunc>wan</trunc> if you want to be thoroughly misogynous she's <pause dur="0.3"/> got England firmly under her heel <pause dur="0.4"/> on the other hand the image is one of protection a skirt encompasses her kingdom <pause dur="0.7"/> and she looks towards the west and as she looks 
towards the west the sun <pause dur="0.2"/> comes out in the skies <pause dur="0.6"/> and as she turns her back towards Catholic Europe <pause dur="0.8"/> there's thundering and lightning <pause dur="0.3"/> over <pause dur="0.3"/> Europe behind her so it's a wonderful <pause dur="0.4"/> political image <pause dur="0.2"/> of the power <pause dur="0.3"/> of Elizabeth of her personal <pause dur="0.3"/> role as protectoress of England <pause dur="0.4"/> and she is as much goddess <pause dur="0.2"/> as she is <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> human queen so those are the three images <pause dur="0.3"/> # one can see <pause dur="0.4"/> the this this <trunc>s</trunc> selling if you like the spinning of Elizabeth going on very much in the visual images <pause dur="2.3"/> i talked about the two bodies notion of Elizabeth # and i want to use that just <pause dur="0.2"/> to go on to think about <pause dur="0.3"/> the way The Faerie Queene Spenser uses <pause dur="0.3"/> Elizabeth <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> the two bodies theory is an old legal theory # going right back to the Middle Ages about kings <pause dur="0.3"/> that is that one had a kind of public body <pause dur="0.4"/> a legal body as the representative <pause dur="0.2"/> of the kingdom as the king the legal king <pause dur="0.4"/> # or monarch <pause dur="0.3"/> of the <trunc>k</trunc> of the kingdom <pause dur="0.6"/> and that this legal body could be occupied by a private body individual kings would come and go <pause dur="0.4"/> but the 
institution of kingship <pause dur="0.3"/> went on so you have the public <pause dur="0.5"/> monarchical aspect of the king <pause dur="0.3"/> which didn't always entirely fit with the private individual who was occupying <pause dur="0.4"/> that role at any one given time <pause dur="1.1"/> this notion of the <pause dur="0.3"/> in this case the Queen's two bodies the the body of the monarch and the body of the <pause dur="0.4"/> # of the Queen <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> is deployed in a number of ways in Elizabethan # <pause dur="0.2"/> literature it allows them to some extent to escape her <pause dur="0.3"/> female gender <pause dur="0.5"/> her role as monarch could be <pause dur="0.4"/> a role that transcended her gender it could be a role as king <pause dur="0.4"/> whereas her female <pause dur="0.3"/> private self <pause dur="0.5"/> was # protected if you lake if you like mythologized in her reign <pause dur="0.3"/> by this image of virginity <pause dur="0.2"/> this image of being a quasi-deity <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> a a beautiful <pause dur="0.2"/> young <pause dur="0.2"/> # young girl and of course she remained this beautiful young girl <pause dur="0.2"/> in rhetoric <pause dur="0.3"/> through most of her life <pause dur="2.3"/> Spenser draws on these two aspects of Elizabeth there's monarch and there's private person <pause dur="0.3"/> in that introduction that # <pause dur="0.2"/> dedicatory letter to Raleigh that we've looked 
at on a couple of occasions <pause dur="0.5"/> just to remind you <pause dur="0.2"/> Spenser says <pause dur="0.3"/> in the letter to Raleigh <pause dur="0.6"/> <reading>in that Faerie Queene i mean glory in my generall intention <pause dur="0.4"/> but in my particular <pause dur="0.2"/> i conceiue the most excellent and glorious person of our souereign the Queene <pause dur="0.3"/> and her kingdome in Faerie land <pause dur="0.7"/> and yet in some places else some places else <pause dur="0.3"/> i doe otherwise shadow her <pause dur="0.5"/> for considering she beareth two persons</reading> that's this two <trunc>i</trunc> # these two bodies of the <pause dur="0.2"/> the Queen <pause dur="0.6"/> <reading>she <trunc>consid</trunc> for considering she beareth two persons <pause dur="0.4"/> the one of a most royall queene or empresse <pause dur="0.3"/> the other of a most vertuous and beautifull lady <pause dur="0.6"/> this latter part <pause dur="0.3"/> i doe express in Belphoebe</reading> <pause dur="0.6"/> so Spenser works two <pause dur="0.2"/> at least two images of the Queen <pause dur="0.4"/> into his Faerie Queene <pause dur="0.3"/> the public <pause dur="0.3"/> monarchical Elizabeth Gloriana <pause dur="0.3"/> and the private <pause dur="0.3"/> beautiful <pause dur="0.2"/> chaste lady <pause dur="0.5"/> Belphoebe <pause dur="2.5"/> the Faerie Queene Gloriana figures as we've seen Elizabeth as monarch of England <pause dur="1.8"/> England is conceived of in The Faerie Queene as a kind of 
promised land of Protestantism <pause dur="0.4"/> a land of exceptional blessings <pause dur="0.3"/> a magical fairyland indeed ruled over by its fairy Queen <pause dur="0.6"/> and Spenser in the very idea of The Faerie Queene manages to get this <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> sort of extraterrestrial if you like this almost goddess-like element # that we <pause dur="0.2"/> can also see in other images of Elizabeth <pause dur="0.7"/> he describes her at the very beginning of book one <pause dur="0.2"/> you'll remember as a <reading>goddesse <pause dur="0.2"/> heauenly bright <pause dur="0.3"/> mirrour of grace and maiestie diuine <pause dur="0.3"/> great lady of the greatest isle <pause dur="0.3"/> whose light <pause dur="0.2"/> like Phoebus lampe throughout the world doth shine <pause dur="0.5"/> shed thy faire beames into my feeble eyne and raise my thoughts too humble <pause dur="0.3"/> and too vile</reading> <pause dur="0.4"/> so Elizabeth <pause dur="0.5"/> both as a kind of muse here a goddess figure <pause dur="0.3"/> but also as the embodiment <pause dur="0.2"/> the the the the very embodiment of her country <pause dur="0.3"/> a figure <pause dur="0.2"/> quasi-divine <pause dur="6.0"/> so <pause dur="0.8"/> there's these elements Spenser # these these recognizable elements <pause dur="0.2"/> Spenser figures in the figure of of of Gloriana in the poem <pause dur="0.4"/> but when you think about the actual 
role of Gloriana i mean here we have <pause dur="0.7"/> obvious flattery of the Queen after all she was the patron she was the source of power <pause dur="0.3"/> Spenser was very dependent on her approval <pause dur="0.3"/> in everything he did especially in publication of The Faerie Queene <pause dur="0.8"/> but when you think about the actual role of Gloriana in the poem <pause dur="0.3"/> you begin to see how Spenser even in the very act of praising Elizabeth <pause dur="0.5"/> can insinuate certain kinds of criticisms <pause dur="0.5"/> Gloriana never appears she doesn't do anything <pause dur="0.6"/> what she does <pause dur="0.3"/> is send out her male <pause dur="0.3"/> knights <pause dur="0.2"/> to fight her battles for her <pause dur="0.4"/> she authorizes them <pause dur="0.5"/> she gives them <trunc>po</trunc> she empowers them <pause dur="0.3"/> to go and conquer the world to <trunc>res</trunc> restore Protestantism to fight the dragons <pause dur="0.2"/> and the evil enchanters <pause dur="0.3"/> and so on and so forth it is the men who do the jobs <pause dur="0.4"/> # in <pause dur="0.2"/> The Faerie Queene <pause dur="0.4"/> the one exception is book three but Britomart the knight of book three <pause dur="0.2"/> is not sent out by Elizabeth she's not an agent <pause dur="0.4"/> of Elizabeth she's an ancestress <pause dur="0.4"/> # sorry she's not an agent of Gloriana <pause dur="0.4"/> she's her her 
role is as an ancestress she's not even <pause dur="0.3"/> a queen <pause dur="0.3"/> she's a an ancestress of Elizabeth <pause dur="1.2"/> so that <pause dur="0.2"/> Gloriana's role as defined by The Faerie Queene is one of empowering her male <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> # executors if you like those who actually carry out <pause dur="0.3"/> the the her policy <pause dur="0.4"/> and <pause dur="0.3"/> had the last book of The Faerie Queene ever been written of rewarding them when they come back <pause dur="0.2"/> so her job <pause dur="0.2"/> is to empower and to reward <pause dur="0.5"/> Spenser is here possibly suggesting <pause dur="0.2"/> a role for Elizabeth <pause dur="0.3"/> that she didn't always fulfil <pause dur="1.7"/> one example <pause dur="0.5"/> of # <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> # her frustration # # her <pause dur="0.4"/> repeated frustration of those who did want to go out and conquer the world in her name <pause dur="0.3"/> to carry the Protestant fight <pause dur="0.3"/> to new worlds or back to the old <pause dur="0.2"/> # continental world <pause dur="0.6"/> is her relationship <pause dur="0.2"/> with one of her favourites <pause dur="0.2"/> Sir Walter Raleigh <pause dur="0.2"/> who was a patron <pause dur="0.4"/> of <trunc>e</trunc> of Spenser and whose story is <pause dur="0.2"/> worked into the story <pause dur="0.3"/> of The Faerie Queene <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> her relationship with Raleigh could be repeated <pause dur="0.3"/> in her relationship with so many <pause dur="0.5"/> of her aristocrats especially in the 
fifteen-eighties <pause dur="0.3"/> and fifteen-nineties <pause dur="0.9"/> Raleigh continually <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> suggested enterprises enterprises which would have taken him to the New World <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> in order to <pause dur="0.6"/> colonize or to <pause dur="0.2"/> # rob <pause dur="0.4"/> the the the new world <pause dur="0.5"/> # like many of her other noblemen <pause dur="0.2"/> he continually wanted to be involved in expeditions <pause dur="0.4"/> against Catholic powers whether pirating on the high seas <pause dur="0.3"/> or actually armed <trunc>exibiti</trunc> <trunc>ex</trunc> expeditions <pause dur="0.3"/> to invade <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> parts of the # <pause dur="0.2"/> Catholic continent <pause dur="0.7"/> and continually <pause dur="0.3"/> Elizabeth <pause dur="0.5"/> called him back <pause dur="0.2"/> or would not empower him kept him at home <pause dur="0.4"/> in the court <pause dur="0.3"/> and this is characteristic of her dealing with a great many <pause dur="0.3"/> of her aristocratic <pause dur="0.3"/> noblemen <pause dur="1.3"/> in the end # she also tended to keep them # hanging as far as marriage was concerned she would often not approve <pause dur="0.3"/> of their marrying <pause dur="0.3"/> so they too <pause dur="0.2"/> found it difficult to ensure their dynasties <pause dur="0.3"/> to # to to get heirs <pause dur="0.3"/> # to carry forward their houses <pause dur="0.6"/> in the end Raleigh fell from power <pause dur="0.3"/> because he had to marry secretly in order to <pause dur="0.4"/> # <trunc>produ</trunc> <trunc>c</trunc> preserve his dynasty <pause dur="0.5"/> # 
<trunc>a</trunc> and and continue his house he married secretly Elizabeth found out and threw him into prison <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> and <pause dur="0.4"/> one of the poems that you have <pause dur="0.4"/> in your Renaissance Book of # of Verse <pause dur="0.4"/> number twenty-one on page one-o-two a long poem Ocean's Love to Cynthia <pause dur="0.6"/> is a poem written by Raleigh <pause dur="0.8"/> # as a sort of slightly incoherent it's a difficult poem to read <pause dur="0.2"/> probably deliberately incoherent to suggest the incoherence of his grief <pause dur="0.5"/> written by Elizabeth probably when he was in prison <pause dur="0.3"/> to complain about how she kept him dangling <pause dur="0.4"/> he had tried to serve her all through these years <pause dur="0.3"/> # and she kept him dangling <pause dur="0.5"/> # and just to draw your attention to one <pause dur="0.5"/> small <pause dur="0.2"/> # piece of this poem to illustrate lines sixty-one to sixty-eight <pause dur="0.2"/> this is page one-o-two <pause dur="0.2"/> of your anthology <pause dur="2.0"/> Raleigh says <pause dur="0.2"/> i kept on trying <reading>to seeke new worlds for golde for prayse for glory <pause dur="0.4"/> to try desire to try love severed farr <pause dur="0.6"/> when i was gonn</reading> he says <reading>she sent her memory <pause dur="0.3"/> more stronge than weare tenthowsand shipps of warr <pause dur="0.4"/> to 
call mee back <pause dur="0.4"/> to leve great honors thought <pause dur="0.4"/> to leve my frinds my fortune my attempte <pause dur="0.3"/> to leve the purpose i so longe had sought <pause dur="0.3"/> and hold both cares and cumforts <pause dur="0.3"/> in contempt</reading> <pause dur="0.6"/> he rather tactfully says it was her memory <pause dur="0.2"/> that she sent but more commonly it was a messenger <pause dur="0.4"/> who at times actually called him back when he was on the ship halfway down the Channel <pause dur="0.4"/> on a number of occasions he was called back ignominiously <pause dur="0.3"/> and not allowed to go on these <pause dur="0.3"/> glorifying expeditions to conquer <pause dur="0.4"/> new worlds <pause dur="0.3"/> and defeat the Spanish <pause dur="0.5"/> so that # <pause dur="1.4"/> in a sense we have an implied contrast here <pause dur="0.4"/> between Gloriana's enabling role <pause dur="0.4"/> and Elizabeth's <pause dur="0.2"/> frequent or # especially by the fifteen-eighties and fifties and nineties this perception <pause dur="0.3"/> of her constant frustration <pause dur="0.5"/> # of the ambitions <pause dur="0.3"/> of her aristocratic <pause dur="0.3"/> courtiers <pause dur="1.9"/> so perhaps ostensibly while celebrating Elizabeth here Spenser's poem may take discreet opportunities <pause dur="0.3"/> to provide her with a mirror <pause dur="0.4"/> of how the ideal female monarch <pause dur="0.3"/> ought to behave <pause dur="0.3"/> not 
always coincident <pause dur="0.3"/> with how she does behave <pause dur="1.1"/> there are <trunc>m</trunc> other moments i think where we see discreet moments of criticism <pause dur="0.2"/> of Elizabeth <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> and particularly of Elizabeth's courts and the court culture <pause dur="0.4"/> this <pause dur="0.7"/> culture of adoration <pause dur="0.3"/> of Elizabeth that grew up <pause dur="0.5"/> # during the course of her reign <pause dur="0.4"/> we must remember that when Elizabeth when Spenser published Faerie Queene in fifteen-ninety <pause dur="0.3"/> Elizabeth was fifty years old she was well past childbearing age <pause dur="0.3"/> and she's getting on a bit especially in Elizabethan <pause dur="0.4"/> period <pause dur="0.4"/> but nevertheless this language of personal adoration of beauty <pause dur="0.3"/> of adoration of a a dazzling mistress <pause dur="0.4"/> continues to <pause dur="0.3"/> # dominate the language of the court <pause dur="0.5"/> and Spenser at a number of points <pause dur="0.6"/> # registers his disgust his objection <pause dur="0.3"/> with this courtly culture <pause dur="0.6"/> and perhaps one of those moments <pause dur="0.3"/> is in book one at a point we've already looked at the description of Lucifera's court <pause dur="0.7"/> and i've already pointed out that Lucifera described as a maiden queen a queen of pride <pause dur="0.3"/> sitting on her 
throne <pause dur="0.6"/> is surrounded by a court that looks remarkably <pause dur="0.2"/> like the Elizabethan ones <pause dur="0.5"/> in which the courtiers have ruffs <pause dur="0.5"/> and curled hair <pause dur="0.5"/> and # carry on a language of spitefulness <pause dur="0.5"/> # there's more than a passing resemblance to the contemporary royal court there <pause dur="0.7"/> i'm not suggesting that Spenser's explicitly asking the Queen to compare herself to Lucifera <pause dur="0.6"/> but those i think with any sharpness would see <pause dur="0.3"/> that <pause dur="0.2"/> Spenser is not entirely uncritical admirer <pause dur="0.3"/> of the cult <pause dur="0.3"/> that surrounds Elizabeth <pause dur="0.9"/> another instance is at the very beginning of book three <pause dur="0.5"/> where we come across the court of Malecasta <pause dur="0.2"/> barred chastity <pause dur="0.5"/> obviously a a a a false figure a figure quite different from Elizabeth <pause dur="0.5"/> in some respects <pause dur="0.6"/> but this Malecasta rules her court by insisting <pause dur="0.4"/> that everybody worships only her <pause dur="0.6"/> if the knights approaching the course <pause dur="0.4"/> the court have a mistress of their own <pause dur="0.5"/> they have to fight <pause dur="0.3"/> with her defenders <pause dur="0.4"/> to show that <pause dur="0.2"/> their mistress is better <pause dur="0.3"/> than Malecasta <pause dur="0.7"/> if they are defeated then they have 
to worship Malecasta <pause dur="0.3"/> if they win <pause dur="0.2"/> then they're still forced if they want a night's lodging to worship Malecasta it's a sort of no win <pause dur="0.3"/> situation <pause dur="0.4"/> and again Spenser i think is perhaps suggesting something wrong <pause dur="0.4"/> with the court of his Faerie Queene here <pause dur="0.3"/> which so emasculates <pause dur="0.2"/> so deprives men <pause dur="0.3"/> of their noble honour and courage <pause dur="0.3"/> in order to pursue this <trunc>effemini</trunc> <trunc>infe</trunc> effeminizing <pause dur="0.3"/> worship <pause dur="0.4"/> of the Queen <pause dur="1.9"/> # we saw just a glimpse # i think last week when we were looking at women's writing <pause dur="0.4"/> of # Elizabeth conducting this kind of courtly language <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> with <pause dur="0.4"/> again it was Sir Walter Raleigh <pause dur="0.4"/> # where Sir Walter Raleigh had written <pause dur="0.3"/> her a poem complaining of her treatment to him <pause dur="0.3"/> and she wrote back saying silly pug <pause dur="0.3"/> did you think i disapproved of you <pause dur="0.3"/> what a silly little clown <pause dur="0.3"/> you are and that demeaning language for one of the foremost <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> sort of male courtiers of the period must have been deeply humiliating # and one can see perhaps a reflection of this <pause dur="1.7"/> this 
private Elizabeth this Elizabeth who was thought of as the kind of Petrarchan mistress <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> of all her courtiers <pause dur="0.5"/> # produced this language this this <pause dur="0.4"/> rhetoric indeed poetry of courtly love <pause dur="0.4"/> amongst many courtiers <pause dur="0.3"/> at Elizabeth's <pause dur="0.3"/> # <trunc>a</trunc> <trunc>a</trunc> <trunc>a</trunc> in her court <pause dur="0.4"/> and you can see examples in your anthology numbers eighteen and nineteen <pause dur="0.7"/> the Earl of Essex writing such a poem <pause dur="0.4"/> number thirty <pause dur="0.2"/> in your anthology <pause dur="0.4"/> many courtiers wrote this kind of language <pause dur="0.3"/> of adoration to Elizabeth a courtly love language <pause dur="0.3"/> of adoration to Elizabeth she positively encouraged it <pause dur="0.4"/> at her court <pause dur="1.0"/> and we see Spenser's perhaps rather sour <pause dur="0.5"/> assessment of the effects of this language <pause dur="0.4"/> through the other figure of Elizabeth in The Faerie Queene the figure of Belphoebe <pause dur="0.5"/> who appears in book three book two and book three <pause dur="0.4"/> of The Faerie Queene <pause dur="1.0"/> Belphoebe is a virgin <pause dur="0.3"/> who knows nothing of love <pause dur="0.6"/> but who inspires love <pause dur="0.4"/> in the figure of Timias <pause dur="0.3"/> a squire <pause dur="0.5"/> Timias' name means honour <pause dur="0.9"/> but once he has been infected by love of the beautiful <pause dur="0.2"/> 
chaste Belphoebe <pause dur="0.5"/> Timias gives up his honourable calling he gives up his life as a squire <pause dur="0.6"/> and becomes <pause dur="0.2"/> completely enmeshed in his worship of <pause dur="0.4"/> Belphoebe <pause dur="0.6"/> Belphoebe knows nothing of this she does not recognize it she does not reward his love <pause dur="0.5"/> and gradually through the course of the narrative which goes on to book four of Faerie Queene <pause dur="0.5"/> Timias degenerates from a figure of honour <pause dur="0.4"/> to a kind of wild man in the woods unable to do anything except write sonnets <pause dur="0.2"/> to his mistress <pause dur="0.4"/> # which she takes no notice of <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> i think what Spenser is doing <pause dur="0.5"/> is exploring the destructive effect <pause dur="0.2"/> here <pause dur="0.5"/> # it has been suggested that what he's doing is to some extent reflecting the story of Sir Walter Raleigh in this story of Timias <pause dur="0.5"/> and Belphoebe <pause dur="0.3"/> and it may well be that there are echoes of that historical story <pause dur="0.2"/> in <pause dur="0.3"/> the the # the the mythical one the fictional one that Spenser gives <pause dur="0.5"/> but i think the more general point is that Spenser is <pause dur="0.4"/> through this figure of Belphoebe and her effect <pause dur="0.2"/> on the 
knight honour <pause dur="0.6"/> Timias <pause dur="0.6"/> # exploring the destructive effect of this cult <pause dur="0.2"/> of Elizabeth this cult of worship of Elizabeth <pause dur="0.7"/> which has as its corollary a kind of emasculating <pause dur="0.3"/> effeminating <pause dur="0.2"/> # effeminizing effect <pause dur="0.4"/> on <pause dur="0.3"/> the male courtiers <pause dur="0.2"/> # that surround her <pause dur="5.9"/> so from one point of view this narrative of Belphoebe is praising Elizabeth she's an exceptional figure exceptionally beautiful <pause dur="0.2"/> and certainly chaste <pause dur="0.7"/> but from another perspective the story <pause dur="0.4"/> can again be seen to give shape to a deep-seated masculine anxiety <pause dur="0.4"/> about the effects of a female monarch <pause dur="0.4"/> on the men around her <pause dur="0.8"/> simply by the fact of her gender <pause dur="0.3"/> unwittingly <pause dur="0.4"/> Belphoebe entraps Timias' <pause dur="0.2"/> honour <pause dur="0.6"/> leading him away from his questing masculine vocation <pause dur="0.4"/> to permanent enslavement as her adoring admirer <pause dur="1.1"/> neither Spenser nor Raleigh were for a minute taken in of course <pause dur="0.3"/> by the erotic rhetoric used of the Queen <pause dur="0.4"/> after all <pause dur="0.2"/> she is fifty <pause dur="0.2"/> at least fifty in fifteen-ninety <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> and enslavement # the the the rhetoric was used <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> as a coded 
language of courtly plying for favour <pause dur="0.4"/> # courtly patronage <pause dur="0.7"/> it was a a part of a courtly game of <trunc>comp</trunc> compliment of and dependence on <pause dur="0.3"/> royal favours <pause dur="1.7"/> but as this deadly serious courtly game of compliment <pause dur="0.4"/> could be and frequently was <pause dur="0.3"/> figured as erotic adoration of an ever <trunc>u</trunc> unattainable beautiful mistress <pause dur="0.5"/> so could royal disfavour and rejection <pause dur="0.4"/> be figured as the hopelessness of love for a cruel mistress and this is how it often was figured <pause dur="0.4"/> in the poetry <pause dur="0.9"/> it's a figurative way of speaking about patronage <pause dur="0.8"/> either way <pause dur="0.3"/> the effect on Elizabeth's courtiers and indeed more widely on her male subjects <pause dur="0.6"/> was perceived to be one of a cultivated dependence <pause dur="0.2"/> and subjection <pause dur="0.3"/> of the male by the female <pause dur="0.4"/> that could easily be seen as ignoble <pause dur="0.3"/> dishonourable <pause dur="0.3"/> and emasculating <pause dur="2.5"/> and here again i think we see surfacing that deep-seated fear of female power <pause dur="0.3"/> that we saw right at the beginning in the John Knox <pause dur="0.2"/> quotation <pause dur="0.4"/> in a completely <pause dur="0.4"/> unfictionalized way <pause dur="0.7"/> okay <pause dur="0.4"/> sorry about the slides i don't know what happened <pause dur="1.2"/> # to those but you'll find the pictures as i say in the # Roy Strong book
