that people have <pause dur="1.0"/> which can be found expressed in writers like Bernard Williams who i'll come onto later <pause dur="1.4"/> and # Michael Stocker <pause dur="1.3"/> who i'll also cover later <pause dur="1.9"/><kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="5"/> # <pause dur="1.3"/> first of all a couple of preliminaries <pause dur="1.9"/> right <pause dur="0.3"/> a morally good action for Kant is one that's done solely from duty <pause dur="1.5"/> # <pause dur="1.7"/> now one question one might ask is if you're acting <pause dur="0.9"/> solely from duty if you're helping somebody just from <pause dur="0.5"/> a sense of duty <pause dur="1.8"/> and then whenever you ought to help them you only ever help them from a sense of duty <pause dur="0.6"/> does this mean that you don't really care about them <pause dur="1.5"/> a sort of worry here is <pause dur="0.8"/> that # <pause dur="1.4"/> the very notion of duty <pause dur="1.0"/> suggests <pause dur="0.2"/> or implies conversationally at least <pause dur="0.7"/> the idea <pause dur="0.2"/> that you don't really want to do it <pause dur="0.9"/> right if you do some action out of duty that kind of suggests <pause dur="0.5"/> that you don't want to do it <pause dur="2.6"/> right so you might feel <pause dur="1.1"/> yeah you might want to go and visit <pause dur="0.8"/> your elderly grandfather <pause dur="1.7"/> and do so quite happily <pause dur="1.0"/> then you think about the cases where you do it from duty from a sense of duty <pause dur="0.2"/> go and visit your

negative connotrations <pause dur="0.3"/> connotations doesn't sound quite so contractual <pause dur="0.9"/> you know duty sounds very contractual <pause dur="0.7"/> sounds like the sort of things that <pause dur="0.8"/> you know you're bound by some sort of contract to do <pause dur="0.2"/> they're your duties <pause dur="0.5"/> your duties as <pause dur="0.9"/> a lecturer or whatever </u><pause dur="0.3"/> <u who="sm0149" trans="pause"> can we know that the that the word duty was used in the same way the same context as it is today <pause dur="0.3"/> than <pause dur="0.5"/> than when <pause dur="0.3"/> say Kant was writing </u><pause dur="0.4"/> <u who="nm0146" trans="pause"> right <pause dur="0.3"/> # well i can't tell you the answer to that as a <trunc>ju</trunc> sort of general thesis # <pause dur="0.5"/> about sort of nineteenth <trunc>s</trunc> or eighteenth century Prussia <pause dur="1.1"/> but it is true that Kant didn't for Kant it didn't have <pause dur="0.6"/> this implication so it was a good one point to make <pause dur="0.9"/> but the notion of duty <pause dur="1.0"/> as Kant understood it <pause dur="0.7"/> didn't carry these negative connotations <pause dur="0.8"/> it didn't as we saw <pause dur="0.5"/> i mean i quoted something <trunc>e</trunc> # from Kant <pause dur="0.3"/> # it was either last lecture or the lecture before <pause dur="1.0"/> where he says that actually if you're unhappy in the performance of your duty <pause dur="0.5"/> that rather casts doubt on your virtue <pause dur="1.3"/> 
you know <pause dur="0.7"/> so acting from duty from him mean a virtuous person is one who acts from duty <pause dur="0.8"/> clearly if that's right then somebody who acts from duty <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="1.4"/> mean the concept of duty as it's being used there can't carry these negative connotations of disinclination <pause dur="0.6"/> or burdensomeness <pause dur="0.6"/> and it certainly didn't have that connotation for Kant <pause dur="1.3"/> right <pause dur="1.0"/> so if you can't shed those modern <pause dur="0.4"/> connotations those negative connotations <pause dur="0.5"/> then use some other concept <pause dur="0.6"/> <unclear>right</unclear> don't talk about acting from duty <pause dur="0.4"/> but talk about <pause dur="0.2"/> say doing the right thing just because it's right <pause dur="1.3"/> and rightness doesn't carry those strong negative connotations that duty does even though <pause dur="0.6"/> these concepts <pause dur="0.5"/> are close to being synonyms </u><pause dur="0.8"/> <u who="sm0150" trans="pause"> did Kant <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> was your best possible will <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/></u><pause dur="0.5"/> <u who="nm0146" trans="pause"> your best possible what </u><u who="sm0150" trans="latching"> yes the best possible will <unclear>i mean</unclear> good will </u><pause dur="0.9"/> <u who="nm0146" trans="pause"> well this is what it is to have a good will is to be disposed to act from duty </u><pause dur="0.2"/> <u who="sm0150" trans="pause"> is that <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> about duty <pause dur="0.4"/> what is duty <pause dur="0.6"/> <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> <pause dur="1.0"/> under your eyes <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> under in the circumstances <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> you don't know what your best possible will is <pause dur="0.3"/> <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/></u><u who="nm0146" trans="overlap"> # i don't i don't think you have to have thoughts about your will when you act from duty you've got to have thoughts about what you

and if you're concerned about the morality of your action <pause dur="2.7"/> does this mean that your actions will lack a certain spontaneity <pause dur="0.5"/> 'cause you'll always be worrying about whether you're going to be doing the right thing or not <pause dur="0.9"/> mm <pause dur="9.5"/> well <pause dur="0.2"/> any thoughts <pause dur="0.4"/> got a fifty per cent chance of getting this right </u><pause dur="1.9"/> <u who="sm0150" trans="pause"> some action which seem to attract more worth can be <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> and spontaneous <pause dur="0.4"/> like the man who jumps on the hand grenade to save his comrades <pause dur="0.2"/> it's a spontaneous act </u><pause dur="0.5"/> <u who="nm0146" trans="pause"> right <pause dur="0.2"/> but does it <trunc>s</trunc> been suppose he

that they do is <pause dur="0.2"/> driven by the idea that <pause dur="0.6"/> in order to decide whether what you're doing is permissible <pause dur="0.5"/> you've got to make various complex judgements <pause dur="0.8"/> and typically that will take time <pause dur="1.6"/> # <pause dur="0.9"/> but if you think about other areas of our lives where we're constantly having to make very complex judgements <pause dur="1.4"/> # but have no problem <pause dur="0.2"/> acting spontaneously <pause dur="0.2"/> on the basis of those judgements <pause dur="1.1"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> we can see that there's no conflict here <pause dur="0.7"/> and what i'm thinking of is <pause dur="0.4"/> you know driving a car <pause dur="0.3"/> right <pause dur="1.4"/> right <pause dur="0.2"/> when you're driving in a car <pause dur="0.8"/> you're making hundreds <pause dur="0.6"/> of <pause dur="0.6"/> judgements about how you should sort of respond you know and whether so and so's going to pull out on you whether <pause dur="0.5"/> some pedestrian might run out whether there's a dog up there not on the lead whether he's going to pull out whether the person's braking in front of you how hard you should brake <pause dur="0.7"/> you know <pause dur="0.2"/> traffic coming at you from all directions <pause dur="0.4"/> traffic lights signs all these things you've got to make judgements <pause dur="0.5"/> all various very complex judgements about <pause dur="0.9"/> # and 
you've got to <trunc>re</trunc> react very quickly <pause dur="1.5"/> right so it's a complex business any of you # who's learning to drive at the moment <pause dur="1.0"/> anybody here learning to drive <pause dur="1.2"/> guess you're already drivers <pause dur="1.2"/> anybody who's learning to drive know how horrible it is <pause dur="1.0"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> so when you start out you got to think explicitly about these things <pause dur="0.4"/> and of course you can't react very quickly because you're <pause dur="0.7"/> you know you're having to think about everything <pause dur="0.5"/> you know in a very mechanical way <pause dur="1.0"/> but the point is that the better you are you become at this the more skilled you become at driving <pause dur="1.1"/> the more internalized <pause dur="0.5"/> these judgements are the more spontaneous they are you're still making those very complex judgements <pause dur="0.4"/> but it's kind of like second nature to you <pause dur="1.2"/> it only slows you down <pause dur="0.2"/> it only means that you can lack spontaneity <pause dur="0.5"/> when you're a sort of novice <pause dur="1.5"/> but the more skilled you are at driving <pause dur="0.2"/> the quicker you internalize <pause dur="0.3"/> those judgements <pause dur="0.6"/> # they're still going on they're still being made <pause dur="1.0"/> but when 
you see somebody's brake lights come on in front of you you've not got to think to yourself <pause dur="0.5"/> # ah you know is he braking or has he just turned his lights on <pause dur="0.3"/> ah hang on if he's <pause dur="0.4"/> both lights go on i've got to push this middle pedal down <pause dur="0.4"/> you know if you had all those thoughts you already hit him <pause dur="0.6"/> before you do anything <pause dur="0.8"/> # you just react straight away <pause dur="0.8"/> but all of those judgements are going on all those complex judgements are going on <pause dur="2.9"/> now i see no reason why it couldn't be just like that in the moral case <pause dur="0.7"/> when you're a moral novice <pause dur="1.1"/> right # right <pause dur="0.2"/> you got your <pause dur="0.3"/> moral L-plates on <pause dur="0.9"/> right and you're struggling away you think oh well this consideration pulls me that way and that consideration <pause dur="0.5"/> and # <pause dur="0.3"/> you know this this this this and # okay i think i should do that <pause dur="1.2"/> right when you're having mechanically to go through some process of <pause dur="0.5"/> moral deliberation in that way <pause dur="0.6"/> then sure <pause dur="0.4"/> as a moral novice <pause dur="0.3"/> you're going to your action's going to lack spontaneity <pause dur="0.3"/> just like <pause dur="0.5"/> the reactions of a learner driver are

really 'cause they're not the main worries <pause dur="1.0"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> with the notion of acting from duty <pause dur="1.2"/> the main worry that comes from this has been put forward by <pause dur="0.8"/> Michael Stocker <pause dur="0.9"/> and Bernard Williams <pause dur="4.5"/> i'll start with Michael Stocker and it's the the worry that <pause dur="0.6"/> the motive of duty's in some way alienating <pause dur="2.0"/> okay so this is what i'm going to focus on in the rest rest of the lecture <pause dur="1.4"/> # i'll just give you a quote <pause dur="1.2"/> # <pause dur="1.3"/> as to why Michael Stocker thinks that acting from duty <pause dur="1.4"/> might be <pause dur="0.3"/> # alienating <pause dur="0.9"/> what he thinks it might alienate you from is your friends and loved ones <pause dur="1.1"/> right so the worry here is that morality as Kant conceives it <pause dur="0.5"/> seems to stop you entering fully into relations of friendship <pause dur="0.5"/> and love <pause dur="0.2"/> I-E these valuable but non-moral relationships <pause dur="1.3"/> and he gives the example of a guy who's hospitalized <pause dur="0.9"/> and his <pause dur="0.3"/> well he somebody he thinks is his friend Smith <pause dur="0.2"/> they're always Smith <pause dur="1.1"/> # comes and visits him <pause dur="1.2"/> right so i'll just quote from Stocker here <pause dur="1.1"/> <reading>right you're very bored and restless and at loose ends <pause dur="0.4"/> 
when Smith comes in once again <pause dur="0.9"/> you're now convinced more than ever that he's a fine fellow and a real friend <pause dur="0.3"/> taking so much time to cheer you up <pause dur="0.5"/> travelling all the way across town <pause dur="0.2"/> and so on <pause dur="1.6"/> you're so effusive with your praise and thanks he protests he always tries to do what he thinks is his duty <pause dur="0.6"/> what he thinks will be best <pause dur="0.9"/> you at first thinks he <pause dur="0.2"/> think <pause dur="0.2"/> he's engaging <pause dur="0.4"/> in a polite form of self-deprecation <pause dur="0.6"/> relieving a moral burden <pause dur="1.1"/> but the more you two speak <pause dur="0.4"/> the more clear it becomes <pause dur="0.3"/> he was telling the literal truth <pause dur="0.8"/> but it's not essentially because of you that he came to see you <pause dur="0.5"/> not because you're friends <pause dur="0.4"/> but because it was his duty <pause dur="0.2"/> perhaps as a fellow Christian or Communist or whatever <pause dur="0.7"/> or simply because he knows of no one <trunc>a</trunc> more in need of cheering up <pause dur="0.7"/> and no one easier to cheer up</reading> <pause dur="1.8"/> unquote <pause dur="0.6"/> that's from Michael Stocker <pause dur="0.7"/> The Schizophrenia of model <pause dur="0.2"/> Modern Ethical Theories <pause dur="1.7"/> right so you imagine somebody who thinks <pause dur="0.5"/> doing something <pause dur="0.6"/> out of friendship <pause dur="1.2"/> and you 
discover that he's not actually doing it out of friendship he's just saying well look you know <pause dur="0.7"/> this is what i think i ought to do and i really strive to do what i ought to do <pause dur="0.7"/> # it just happens <pause dur="0.4"/> that visiting you in hospital <pause dur="0.9"/> is something i think morality requires and it's because of that that i'm coming to visit you <pause dur="3.0"/> not because you're my friend <pause dur="0.6"/> or because i'm worried about you <pause dur="1.9"/> right but because <pause dur="0.6"/> morality requires this of me <pause dur="2.5"/> 
right <pause dur="0.2"/> now if you <pause dur="1.1"/> i mean if Kant's account of moral worth meant that you got to be like this person like Smith <pause dur="3.8"/> then it does seem as though you're not going to be able to at least fully engage <pause dur="0.7"/> with non-moral relations of friendship and love <pause dur="1.4"/> loving relations 'cause morality <pause dur="0.5"/> you know you'll be always be doing things for the wrong reasons <pause dur="1.9"/> you'll be doing it because morality requires you to <pause dur="0.7"/> not because you know <pause dur="0.4"/> this person's your mate <pause dur="0.5"/> and he's bored <pause dur="2.1"/> # </u><u who="sm0154" trans="latching"> # i don't know just surely <pause dur="0.7"/> in <pause dur="0.5"/> # maybe he's deciding that morality i don't know your it's your duty to go see this person <pause dur="0.2"/> you still have to choose which person you're going to see and you choose that person because he's your friend </u><pause dur="0.8"/> <u who="nm0146" trans="pause"> # </u><pause dur="0.5"/> <u who="sm0154" trans="pause"> as as opposed to </u><u who="nm0146" trans="overlap"> yes </u><u who="sm0154" trans="overlap"> the person lying next to him that you don't know </u><pause dur="0.5"/> <u who="nm0146" trans="pause"> yeah <pause dur="0.7"/> yes but suppose 
# <pause dur="1.0"/> you did it not because he's your friend but because you feel you ought ought <pause dur="0.2"/> you know morally <trunc>r</trunc> morality requires you <pause dur="0.7"/> to help someone <pause dur="0.5"/> and you might yeah it's much easier to you know to help your friends than it is some stranger who doesn't know you <pause dur="0.6"/> you know going to cheer him up much more you know <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> than if i impose myself myself on some stranger <pause dur="0.7"/> okay <pause dur="0.4"/> who may not like me <pause dur="1.6"/> # <pause dur="1.0"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> yeah some of the <trunc>example</trunc> i mean <pause dur="0.2"/> part of the quote says that # <pause dur="0.6"/> you know he chooses to go and visit <pause dur="0.6"/> you know his friend <pause dur="0.3"/> not 'cause he's his friend but because he's a fellow Christian or a fellow Communist <pause dur="0.4"/> or something like that <pause dur="0.7"/> not because he's in <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> his friend <pause dur="1.0"/> but it may be because he's his friend he knows that he needs cheering up <pause dur="0.4"/> and he's very easy to cheer up <pause dur="0.8"/> so you go for something you're pretty sure is going to work <pause dur="1.2"/> but that seems <pause dur="0.9"/> to be the wrong sort of reason to go and visit your friend in hospital <pause dur="6.5"/> right so i'm just sort of <pause dur="1.0"/> but i think you're right that there's something 
fishy about this <pause dur="0.7"/> and it stems partly from the first point i raised at the beginning of the lecture <pause dur="0.9"/> that it's making it look as if you're concerned with the morality of your action <pause dur="0.5"/> that will sort of take over and push out all other concerns <pause dur="0.9"/> but that's just the worry that Stocker's <pause dur="0.2"/> has <pause dur="1.0"/> thinks it's sort of <pause dur="1.5"/> # <pause dur="0.9"/> has this <pause dur="1.0"/> sort of dominating <pause dur="0.9"/> influence that once morality as Kant conceives of it <pause dur="0.5"/> gets in on the picture all other values are going to be pushed out <pause dur="7.8"/><kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="5"/> right now the <pause dur="0.5"/> the way to respond to this # and i here follow <pause dur="0.2"/> # Marcia Baron <pause dur="1.6"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> on this i mean all of the reading for this is in the # <pause dur="0.3"/> the reading list for the <pause dur="0.5"/> the lecture on the course handout <pause dur="1.5"/> the way to deal with this is actually to locate what it is that's disturbing about this particular case <pause dur="2.3"/> and once you've located where it is what you want to do is <pause dur="0.5"/> you know <pause dur="1.1"/> if the <trunc>le</trunc> if you find in locating what's disturbing about this <pause dur="0.5"/> it turns out that what's disturbing is his motivation Smith's motivation <pause dur="1.2"/> then <pause dur="2.1"/> 
you know that will cast doubt on Kant's picture of <pause dur="0.2"/> a morally good person <pause dur="1.1"/> but if it turns out to be somewhere else <pause dur="0.7"/> then it may not be that he's acting in this way <pause dur="0.6"/> 'cause he's a Kantian good-willed individual <pause dur="0.9"/> may just be because he's insensitive cold <pause dur="0.5"/> or something else but that's not Kant's fault <pause dur="2.0"/> right <pause dur="1.1"/> and the two things that Marcia Baron locates <pause dur="0.5"/> is wrong with him his A his <trunc>b</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> # his behaviour <pause dur="1.1"/> right the fact that he's so cold and uncaring he must realize that saying <pause dur="0.3"/> well i i'm not coming here to see you because i care about you <pause dur="0.5"/> i'm coming here just because i feel morally required to <pause dur="0.5"/> he must realize that's going to upset his friend <vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" dur="1"/> <pause dur="0.4"/> or if he doesn't then he's # <pause dur="0.7"/> he's suffering from some other vice namely complete and <pause dur="0.3"/> sort of <pause dur="0.9"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> complete <pause dur="0.7"/> # insensitivity <pause dur="1.2"/> to others even <pause dur="0.2"/> even <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> people who seem to be his close friends <pause dur="2.6"/> what's wrong with <pause dur="0.3"/> what he <trunc>do</trunc> # <pause dur="0.4"/> with this situation <pause dur="0.7"/> is his actual behaviour <pause dur="0.4"/> his coldness his insensitivity <pause dur="0.8"/> his thoughtlessness <pause dur="2.3"/> okay <pause dur="0.4"/> but <pause dur="0.5"/> this 
is focusing on <pause dur="0.2"/> the way the things he says <pause dur="0.5"/> and <pause dur="0.4"/> his thoughtlessness <pause dur="0.8"/> and his insensitivity <pause dur="0.6"/> and none of those things are focusing on motivation <pause dur="1.5"/> i mean if <pause dur="0.9"/> i mean <trunc>morali</trunc> if his motivation is a concern for the morality of his actions <pause dur="1.7"/> it'd be very peculiar if he thought that morality required him <pause dur="0.7"/> to be cold <pause dur="0.2"/> insensitive <pause dur="0.7"/> indifferent <pause dur="1.7"/> # distant <pause dur="0.7"/> and all of these other things <pause dur="1.9"/> surely he doesn't think that <pause dur="1.6"/> so in acting in this <trunc>co</trunc> even if he does have no feelings for his friend at all <pause dur="0.6"/> it seems that morality would require him not to show that <pause dur="0.8"/> right you don't wear a great big placard saying i don't really care about you but <pause dur="0.5"/> you know i've got to come so here i am <pause dur="0.5"/> trying to cheer you up <pause dur="3.8"/> right so that the first thing that we locate is <trunc>a</trunc> what he actually <pause dur="0.7"/> does and says <pause dur="0.8"/> and certain <pause dur="0.3"/> vices that these <pause dur="0.3"/> his actions <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> express <pause dur="1.0"/> it doesn't seem to cast <pause dur="0.2"/> # for come to focus <pause dur="0.3"/> on the motive of duty <pause dur="0.2"/> the motive of duty's just doing <pause dur="0.8"/> the right thing because you think it's right <pause dur="0.7"/> but morality in no way 
requires him to be cold and indifferent <pause dur="0.8"/> in this very peculiar way <pause dur="2.6"/> another thing that's disturbing here <pause dur="0.6"/> is his lack of genuine concern for his friend <pause dur="1.4"/> there's well i'm not coming here because i care about you i'm coming here just because <pause dur="0.6"/> morality requires me to come here <pause dur="0.9"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> and i know that you're a bit miserable <pause dur="0.6"/> and are pretty easy to cheer up so here i am <pause dur="0.2"/> trying to cheer you up <pause dur="3.4"/> there's nothing as i said at the beginning there's nothing about <pause dur="0.4"/> duty as such or the thought <pause dur="0.3"/> or a concern for the morality of one's action <pause dur="0.8"/> the means <trunc>w</trunc> that one must lack a genuine concern <pause dur="1.3"/> for other people or for one's friends or for one's loved ones <pause dur="2.6"/> mm <pause dur="0.7"/> now since the motive of duty doesn't make Smith act as he does in fact <pause dur="0.5"/> the motive of duty should make him act in quite a different way <pause dur="1.1"/> even if he doesn't care about his friend especially if he doesn't care about his friend <pause dur="2.3"/> and since it's not responsible that sort of motivation is not responsible <pause dur="0.7"/> for the apparent lack of concern he has for his friend <pause dur="1.3"/>

is that the motive of duty rules out other motives <pause dur="1.1"/> that if you act from duty you can't act from friendship <pause dur="0.2"/> or love <pause dur="2.6"/> right <pause dur="1.3"/> so the worry here is that other other <pause dur="0.2"/> motivations get pushed out <pause dur="0.8"/> and since those other motivations are constitutive of what it is to enter into these valuable non-moral relationships <pause dur="1.0"/> if they're pushed off the scene by the motive of duty <pause dur="1.0"/> then it means then being moral will stop you fully engaging <pause dur="0.7"/> in non-moral but nonetheless valuable relationships <pause dur="2.0"/> that's the first worry <pause dur="1.2"/> the second is <pause dur="0.9"/> # <pause dur="0.8"/> that the <trunc>moti</trunc> that if you always act from duty <pause dur="1.1"/> then you'll <pause dur="0.4"/> be motivated by explicitly moral thoughts about what you should and shouldn't do about what's permissible <trunc>w</trunc> about <pause dur="0.4"/> what's not permissible <pause dur="0.6"/> in situations when that's quite inappropriate <pause dur="1.4"/> # and the example very famous example Bernard Williams gives <pause dur="1.7"/> is of a situation <pause dur="0.7"/> where <pause dur="0.2"/> you know your ship sunk <pause dur="0.6"/> you're on the lifeboat <pause dur="0.8"/> and you've got a choice between saving your wife <pause dur="0.7"/> and saving some stranger <pause dur="1.7"/> # <pause dur="0.8"/> and he 
has this example of a Kantian good-willed agent <pause dur="0.8"/> who's <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> motivated to save his wife <pause dur="0.2"/> not just because she's his wife <pause dur="1.2"/> but because she's his wife <pause dur="0.2"/> and because it's permissible to save your wife in preference to a stranger <pause dur="0.6"/> so <pause dur="0.4"/> you know the sort of motivation there is partly moral it's a <pause dur="0.2"/> a thought about the moral permissibility of his action <pause dur="2.1"/> and he says that you know <pause dur="0.2"/> some <pause dur="0.5"/> for example his wife <pause dur="0.7"/> may have thought <pause dur="0.2"/> that the thought that she is his wife would be sufficient <pause dur="0.6"/> to get him to save her <pause dur="1.1"/> # the moral thought seems to be <pause dur="0.5"/> as # Bernard Williams famously put it one thought too many <pause dur="2.7"/> it's not clear what's quite so disturbing there but # <pause dur="0.6"/> i'll deal with these points <pause dur="0.8"/> # in order <pause dur="4.8"/> now once again # <pause dur="0.2"/> Barbara Herman <pause dur="1.5"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> well it's the first time i've <trunc>menti</trunc> Barbara Herman and <pause dur="0.2"/> Marcia Baron <pause dur="0.7"/> tried to deal with this and they tried to deal with this <pause dur="0.8"/> first objection by distinguishing between primary and secondary motives <pause dur="4.2"/> they say that duty can function <pause dur="0.2"/> both as a primary motive <pause dur="0.6"/> and as a secondary 
motive <pause dur="0.8"/> and that once you distinguish these and realize that a <trunc>mo</trunc> a Kantian morally good person <pause dur="0.6"/> doesn't always have to have duty as a primary motive <pause dur="1.3"/> then sometimes other primary motives can come in and that's perfectly okay <pause dur="0.4"/> other motives could be friendship or love <pause dur="0.2"/> or whatever <pause dur="2.3"/> what is the primary secondary motive distinction <pause dur="1.4"/> well a primary motive is what you and i <pause dur="0.2"/> ordinarily think of as somebody's motives <pause dur="0.5"/> it's <pause dur="0.4"/> to act from some primary motive <pause dur="0.7"/> is to act from a consideration that you would cite if somebody asked you why did you do that <pause dur="1.1"/> right <pause dur="1.2"/> and your answer might be quite simple mightn't you <pause dur="0.2"/> why did you pull that woman out of the water <pause dur="0.4"/> the answer might just be <pause dur="0.3"/> well because she's my wife <pause dur="1.6"/> and # that might be it <pause dur="0.9"/> right in that case <pause dur="0.7"/> your primary motive is just the thought <pause dur="0.2"/> that she's my wife <pause dur="1.5"/> or it might be <pause dur="0.6"/> more complicated might be <pause dur="0.4"/> what motivates you might be a thought she's my wife and the thought that it's permissible to save my wife in preference to <pause dur="0.4"/> a stranger in 
such situations <pause dur="2.1"/> right so primary motives are just the specific reason you'd cite <pause dur="0.5"/> in support of your action <pause dur="3.6"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> in a specific # situation <pause dur="1.0"/> it's the reason why you did what you did the specific reason for doing <pause dur="0.4"/> that specific <pause dur="0.3"/> <trunc>s</trunc> action <pause dur="4.0"/> now secondary motives or <pause dur="0.7"/> are are more like regulative principles <pause dur="1.2"/> which needn't always function as primary motives <pause dur="0.2"/> though sometimes they might <pause dur="3.1"/> for duty to function as a secondary motive <pause dur="0.9"/> is just for <trunc>y</trunc> # certain counterfactuals to be true <pause dur="1.5"/> right <pause dur="0.8"/> for example <pause dur="0.5"/> for duty to function as a secondary motive <pause dur="1.4"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> would just entail <pause dur="0.5"/> that if you thought your action was wrong <pause dur="0.5"/> you wouldn't do it <pause dur="1.6"/> right so your actions are regulated by a concern <pause dur="0.8"/> for the morality of your action <pause dur="1.6"/> and that may just imply <pause dur="1.1"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> that if you thought <pause dur="0.8"/> that your action was wrong you wouldn't do it <pause dur="0.5"/> or alternatively a subjunctive conditional <pause dur="0.4"/> you'll # <pause dur="0.5"/> you'll only well it's the conditional statement that if <pause dur="1.1"/> you'll only do some act if you 
think it's permissible <pause dur="5.3"/> now if to have duty as a secondary motive just means <pause dur="0.5"/> that if you only just means that if you thought your action were wrong you wouldn't do it <pause dur="1.0"/> as long as you don't think it's wrong <pause dur="0.4"/> duty needn't not figure as a primary motive <pause dur="0.8"/> it need not figure <pause dur="0.4"/> amongst the reasons you would cite <pause dur="0.8"/> for doing a particular action <pause dur="5.2"/> you presumably you've got all sorts of regulative principles all sorts of secondary motives <pause dur="0.6"/> right you might have a <trunc>s</trunc> a sort of self-interested regulative motive <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> principle namely if some action's going to kill you <pause dur="0.2"/> you won't do it <pause dur="2.7"/> right <pause dur="0.3"/> but does that mean that thoughts about your own <pause dur="0.6"/> you know <pause dur="0.3"/> death <pause dur="1.3"/> are always going to figure in your motivations well no <pause dur="1.1"/> you know if he asked you well why did you come in here today you might say well <pause dur="0.4"/> to hear the lecture <pause dur="0.7"/> it wouldn't be to hear the lecture and because you were sure that you weren't going to die if you came in here <pause dur="0.6"/> right <pause dur="0.6"/> even though if you thought you were going to die if 
you came in here you wouldn't come <pause dur="0.3"/> i take it <pause dur="0.3"/> you're not that keen to learn Kant <pause dur="0.7"/> right <pause dur="0.5"/> learning Kant were fatal <pause dur="0.8"/> then you'd <pause dur="0.4"/> i take it be happy to be ignorant <pause dur="3.8"/> right so even if you've got these regulative second order <pause dur="0.3"/> not second order secondary motives <pause dur="1.0"/> it doesn't mean that they're always going to be <pause dur="0.2"/> <trunc>f</trunc> # <pause dur="0.7"/> figure in your in the thoughts that act as your primary motives <pause dur="1.3"/> it just means that your action is regulated in a certain way <pause dur="0.5"/> and that'd mean you'd have no <pause dur="0.9"/> implication <pause dur="0.9"/> that you have thoughts with a certain content <pause dur="0.5"/> about your own eventual death or <pause dur="0.5"/> you know in the Kantian case about duty <pause dur="5.0"/> okay so is that is you get a a sort of basic idea of the primary-secondary motive <pause dur="0.5"/> distinction <pause dur="0.5"/> one is a particular consideration for doing <pause dur="0.5"/> or reason you have for doing a particular action <pause dur="1.0"/> the other is more of a general principle regulating <pause dur="0.7"/> the sorts of actions you're going to do <pause dur="1.2"/> you might have a <trunc>regula</trunc> you know i'll do this as long as it's not self-destructive <pause dur="0.8"/> 
right <pause dur="0.3"/> that might be it <pause dur="0.5"/> but in doing some particular action one of the reasons you would cite for why you did it would not be <pause dur="0.4"/> 'cause you <pause dur="0.2"/> didn't think it was going to destroy you you wouldn't have thoughts about your own destruction <pause dur="0.5"/> for the most part <pause dur="0.7"/> unless you thought there was some very good reason for thinking something's going to be dangerous <pause dur="1.8"/> similarly if your secondary motive is duty <pause dur="0.5"/> that just means <pause dur="0.6"/> so long as you don't think the action is wrong <pause dur="1.2"/> sorry you just means that you wouldn't do some action if you thought it was morally wrong <pause dur="1.2"/> that needn't imply that every time you act <pause dur="0.6"/> you've got a <trunc>th</trunc> a moral thought <pause dur="0.5"/> as a primary motive <pause dur="1.4"/> it need not actually impinge on your moral <trunc>deliberatio</trunc> # <pause dur="0.2"/> in your deliberation about why you should do particular actions <pause dur="7.6"/> that <trunc>o</trunc> is that okay <pause dur="1.9"/> questions on that </u><pause dur="0.6"/> <u who="sm0153" trans="pause"> <gap reason="inaudible" extent="2 secs"/> <pause dur="0.6"/> probably draw that out from the meaning </u><pause dur="0.3"/> <u who="nm0146" trans="pause"> # </u><u who="sm0153" trans="latching"> <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/><pause dur="1.7"/> <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> </u><pause dur="0.9"/> <u who="nm0146" trans="pause"> oh i don't see why <pause dur="0.3"/> well actually Kant doesn't talk about motives very much </u><u who="sm0153" trans="latching"> no </u><pause dur="0.2"/> <u who="nm0146" trans="pause"> he talks about inclinations incentives <pause dur="0.4"/> well 
actually inclination's just a particular sort of <pause dur="0.6"/> incentive <pause dur="0.4"/> talks about <distinct lang="de">triebfedern</distinct> <pause dur="0.6"/> # which gets translated as # incentives <pause dur="0.9"/> and he talks about maxims <pause dur="0.7"/> so he actually very seldom talks about motives he <trunc>say</trunc> <trunc>a</trunc> one place he distinguishes motives from <pause dur="0.4"/> # incentives <pause dur="0.7"/> but it's just one of these many places where Kant makes a distinction just forgets about it straight away <pause dur="1.0"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> and what does most of the work in Kant actually is maxims principles of action <pause dur="0.9"/> and they're not <pause dur="0.6"/> primary motives although they'll be picking out the sorts of things <pause dur="0.7"/> which # would count as motives for you counts as reasons for you <pause dur="1.0"/> so i think <pause dur="0.2"/> mean you're right Kant doesn't actually make this distinction himself <pause dur="0.7"/> but it's a a distinction that fits very neatly into the Kantian framework <pause dur="0.4"/> of practical rationality <pause dur="4.6"/> but # no <trunc>y</trunc> there is nowhere where he makes this distinction <pause dur="2.7"/> # that's not a problem i mean there's two ways you can go you i mean <pause dur="0.3"/> as long as it fits neatly into the Kantian framework <pause dur="0.9"/> then this could be a 
way he <pause dur="1.0"/> # this would be a <trunc>w</trunc> # a legitimate way for Kant to respond <pause dur="0.5"/> the fact that he doesn't respond in this way or <unclear><trunc>s</trunc></unclear> say these things is not really the point <pause dur="0.5"/> with all of these figures historical figures <pause dur="0.7"/> we're really considering how defensible their position is <pause dur="0.7"/> and even if they don't have a response to a particular criticism 'cause it wasn't made at that time <pause dur="0.4"/> or they just didn't think of it <pause dur="0.8"/> the real issue's whether they could respond <pause dur="1.8"/> # <pause dur="1.0"/> so <pause dur="0.5"/> i don't mean <pause dur="0.3"/> i don't think you need get too worried about that <pause dur="1.3"/> this is a perfectly decent way for somebody who's sympathetic to Kant <pause dur="0.6"/> to respond to the Williams style objection <pause dur="5.6"/><kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="15"/> okay well once we've got <pause dur="2.5"/> this distinction up and running <pause dur="4.3"/> it's easy to see how you can apply it to Williams' objection <pause dur="0.9"/> about how <pause dur="0.7"/> duty seems to push out other motives <pause dur="3.1"/> remember <pause dur="0.4"/> the first worry you had was that <pause dur="0.5"/> once duty gets on the scene it <trunc>pu</trunc> it all <pause dur="0.3"/> i mean you can't act from friendship <pause dur="0.6"/> or 
from love <pause dur="0.7"/> and hence can't fully engage in those non-moral relations <pause dur="2.7"/> well once you've got duty as a primary and secondary motive on <pause dur="0.7"/> # established <pause dur="1.0"/> then <pause dur="0.2"/> you can see that there's plenty of room for non-moral motives to get in <pause dur="1.8"/> at the primary level at primary as primary motives for a a Kantian good-willed agent <pause dur="1.6"/> right <pause dur="0.4"/> to do something from friendship <pause dur="1.3"/> from a a for a Kantian <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> good-willed individual <pause dur="0.7"/> would just be for friendship to be their primary motive <pause dur="1.0"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> and although they're they'll have duty still as a secondary motive <pause dur="0.7"/> that just means that they'll do <pause dur="0.6"/> they'll act from the primary motive so long as it doesn't prompt them <pause dur="0.5"/> to do something they believe is wrong <pause dur="1.6"/> right so <pause dur="0.2"/> any sort of non-moral <trunc>rela</trunc> # motive can get in at the primary level <pause dur="1.4"/> and the agent may act just from that motive <pause dur="2.2"/> all it means <trunc>i</trunc> for duty to act as a secondary motive <pause dur="0.8"/> is <pause dur="0.6"/> for them to regulate the sorts of actions they'll do from those non-moral motives at the primary level <pause dur="1.3"/> # in a certain way <pause dur="0.2"/> namely they won't 
act <pause dur="0.5"/> from those motives if those motives <pause dur="0.4"/> point them towards doing something wrong <pause dur="5.4"/> okay <pause dur="0.2"/> so is it clear how that works <pause dur="1.5"/> have to <trunc>mo</trunc> get a bit of a move on 'cause i'm running out of time here <pause dur="2.0"/> okay let me move on quickly to the final point i wanted to make which is the second part of Williams' objection <pause dur="0.9"/><kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="7"/> this is about <pause dur="2.1"/> whether <pause dur="2.2"/> a Kantian good-willed agent can <pause dur="0.2"/> would would have too many moral thoughts explicitly moral thoughts <pause dur="1.5"/> and exactly the same <pause dur="0.6"/> point could be made with the primary-secondary <pause dur="0.6"/> motive distinction <pause dur="3.4"/> i mean a Kantian good-willed agent doesn't have to have an explicit thought at the primary motivating level <pause dur="0.7"/> about duty <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="1.3"/> in saving his wife in preference to a stranger he doesn't his motive his first <pause dur="0.7"/> his primary motives don't have to be <pause dur="0.6"/> A <pause dur="0.2"/> well because she's my wife and B <pause dur="0.4"/> 'cause it's morally permissible <pause dur="0.3"/> to save my wife in preference to a stranger in situations like this <pause dur="0.4"/> at the primary level <pause dur="0.7"/> the motivating thought could be solely a thought about 
his wife <pause dur="1.1"/> and his concern for her <pause dur="1.4"/> nonetheless he's still a Kantian good-willed agent <pause dur="0.6"/> 'cause his action is regulated <pause dur="0.5"/> by duty at the second <pause dur="0.6"/> as a secondary motive <pause dur="0.8"/> what that means is <pause dur="0.5"/> he'll save his wife <pause dur="0.3"/> just 'cause she's his wife <pause dur="0.5"/> unless <pause dur="0.8"/> saving her would involve <pause dur="0.3"/> doing something he takes to be wrong <pause dur="3.0"/> okay <pause dur="0.2"/> that this is morally permissible to save my wife <pause dur="1.1"/> now you make think even that's <pause dur="0.9"/> too <pause dur="1.0"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> restrictive or <pause dur="0.2"/> sort of inappropriate having duty at the the <pause dur="0.2"/> as a regulative principle <pause dur="0.5"/> it's still <pause dur="0.5"/> there's something inappropriate about that <pause dur="0.9"/> but at that point i think the Kantian just dig their heels in and say well <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="1.0"/><kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="7"/> that there's nothing objectionable <pause dur="0.2"/> about duty <pause dur="0.5"/> as a secondary motive <pause dur="3.8"/> and to make that clear <pause dur="1.1"/> you know just consider <pause dur="0.3"/> somebody who <trunc>d</trunc> who <pause dur="0.2"/> is whose actions aren't regulated by duty as a secondary motive <pause dur="0.9"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> they're just motivated at the primary level <pause dur="0.2"/> by a concern for their wife <pause dur="1.7"/> that means <pause dur="0.2"/> that <pause dur="0.6"/> no matter <trunc>w</trunc> whether this action is right or wrong <pause dur="0.6"/> or whether they 
think it's right or wrong they're going to save their wives <pause dur="0.5"/> so you know just imagine a situation <pause dur="0.5"/> in which the only way you can save your wife <pause dur="0.4"/> is by throwing two kids off the lifeboat <pause dur="0.9"/> so you think oh great <pause dur="0.6"/> out they go <pause dur="1.0"/> wife in <pause dur="1.0"/> right <pause dur="1.1"/> 
well in such a situation like that <pause dur="0.2"/> as <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="1.0"/> Barbara Herman clearly points out <pause dur="0.6"/> this seems like a case where the the the individual has one thought too few <pause dur="1.2"/> right <pause dur="0.2"/> rather than one thought too many <pause dur="0.7"/> it seems if saving a wife involves doing something like that <pause dur="0.5"/> then you should <pause dur="0.3"/> pause to think well you know is this really <pause dur="0.6"/> <trunc>sh</trunc> okay <pause dur="0.6"/> to do this <pause dur="1.3"/> right <pause dur="1.8"/> # <pause dur="0.8"/> right and but <pause dur="0.2"/> you know being willing to pause to think about whether you should do this action <pause dur="0.4"/> in situation where it looks as though the only way you can do <pause dur="0.6"/> what a motive of love or friendship prompts you to do <pause dur="0.9"/> is by doing something that looks like it's wrong <pause dur="0.8"/> i mean that sort of moral regulatively <pause dur="0.2"/> regulative function <pause dur="0.9"/> doesn't seem at all 
objectionable it doesn't stop you <pause dur="0.5"/> spontaneously reacting <pause dur="0.3"/> to the <trunc>c</trunc> # the needs of your loved one <pause dur="0.5"/> or the concerns of your friend <pause dur="0.9"/> doesn't mean you've got to <pause dur="0.8"/> in some way not care about them <pause dur="1.0"/> all it means is <pause dur="0.6"/> that <pause dur="0.5"/> you won't do anything for them no matter what it is <pause dur="0.9"/> right there'll be a limit <pause dur="0.7"/> to the <trunc>s</trunc> # <pause dur="1.4"/> to what <trunc>frien</trunc> you'll think that friendship will permit you <pause dur="0.4"/> or will allow you to do <pause dur="1.6"/> okay right i'll stop there <pause dur="1.4"/> handouts at the front <pause dur="0.8"/> anybody who wants the <pause dur="0.4"/> leaflets on the philosophy weekend they'll be here as well
