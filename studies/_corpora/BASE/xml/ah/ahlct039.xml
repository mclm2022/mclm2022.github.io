<u who="nm0183"> right we've got a lot of material to cover <pause dur="0.3"/> in today's lecture so # <pause dur="0.5"/> it's best i make a start straight away <pause dur="0.7"/> i'll try and speak <pause dur="0.3"/> as clearly as possible and # <pause dur="0.4"/> go at a reasonable pace <pause dur="0.4"/> as you may have gathered today's lecture's being <pause dur="0.3"/> filmed <pause dur="0.4"/> so i'd be immensely grateful if people could look as <trunc>m</trunc> # more enthusiastic <pause dur="0.5"/><vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" n="ss" dur="1"/> and more keen than they usually do <pause dur="0.7"/><vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" n="ss" dur="1"/> i know this will be difficult but <pause dur="0.7"/><vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" n="ss" dur="1"/> do try <pause dur="1.7"/><vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" n="ss" dur="2"/> # the most important thing is that you laugh at my jokes <vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" n="ss" dur="2"/> but # <pause dur="1.3"/> as you know they are few and far between <pause dur="1.0"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> okay if anybody wants to take out their pocket mirror for a last <pause dur="0.5"/><vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" n="ss" dur="1"/> look at their face <pause dur="0.2"/> here's your chance <vocal desc="sniff" iterated="n"/> no <pause dur="0.3"/> okay <pause dur="0.3"/> <trunc>w</trunc> let's start <pause dur="0.5"/> # what we're going to do today in today's lecture <pause dur="0.2"/> today's lecture's divided into two main parts <pause dur="1.1"/> the first part <pause dur="1.0"/> we'll look at some of the <pause dur="0.4"/> essential aspects <pause dur="0.5"/> of meditation six <pause dur="0.2"/> and the second part <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> we'll examine <pause dur="0.8"/> # Descartes' notorious mind body dualism <pause dur="0.4"/> okay so it's divided into two main parts <pause dur="1.4"/><vocal desc="sniff" iterated="n"/> it's in meditation six that Descartes seeks to bring everything together <pause dur="0.8"/> and to harmonize <pause dur="0.4"/> 
all the different elements <pause dur="0.5"/> of his analysis so far <pause dur="0.9"/> okay so this really is the kind of <pause dur="0.2"/> crowning point the <pause dur="0.2"/> summation of the entire meditations <pause dur="1.8"/><vocal desc="sniff" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.9"/> Descartes believes that he now <pause dur="0.2"/> enjoys a limited certainty <pause dur="1.0"/> okay at this point <pause dur="1.2"/> he thinks he's now attained a limited certainty <pause dur="1.8"/> he's sure <pause dur="0.5"/> that God exists <pause dur="0.7"/> he's sure that God exists <pause dur="0.7"/> and he trusts <pause dur="0.2"/> geometry <pause dur="0.3"/> he trusts geometry <pause dur="2.1"/> because God <pause dur="0.7"/> guarantees the truth of things <pause dur="0.6"/> that are perceived clearly and distinctly <pause dur="0.9"/> okay he trusts geometry because God guarantees the truth of things <pause dur="0.7"/> that are perceived clearly and distinctly <pause dur="5.7"/> so i'm just going to hand out <pause dur="0.5"/> some more of these <pause dur="1.0"/><event desc="passes out handouts" iterated="y" dur="3"/> sheets <pause dur="0.9"/> can you take that please <pause dur="1.8"/><vocal desc="sniff" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.9"/> so at the beginning of the meditation <pause dur="0.9"/> we have a key quote okay this is the <pause dur="0.8"/> point where Descartes says he's now going to extend his analysis <pause dur="1.0"/> beyond the realm of the intellect <pause dur="0.2"/> and reconnect the mind to matter <pause dur="0.7"/> he says <pause dur="0.4"/><vocal desc="sniff" iterated="n"/> i'll just <pause dur="0.3"/> read from this # passage <pause dur="1.9"/><event desc="drinks" iterated="n"/> he says <reading>now that i know that God exists <pause dur="0.3"/><vocal desc="sniff" iterated="n"/> i have the means of acquiring a perfect knowledge of an infinitude of things <pause dur="0.9"/> not only those which relate to God and other intellectual matters <pause dur="1.0"/> but also those <pause dur="0.4"/> which pertain to corporeal nature <pause dur="0.7"/> in 
so far <pause dur="0.2"/> as it is the object of pure mathematics</reading> <pause dur="1.6"/><event desc="drinks" iterated="n"/> i'll say that last sentence again because that's the crucial part of the quote <pause dur="0.7"/> okay so he says <pause dur="0.2"/> <reading>i have <pause dur="0.5"/><vocal desc="sniff" iterated="n"/> # the <trunc>ap</trunc> capacity of acquiring a perfect knowledge of things not only of intellectual things <pause dur="1.5"/> but also those which pertain to corporeal nature</reading> <pause dur="0.8"/> to bodily or material nature <pause dur="0.4"/> <reading>in so far as it is the object of pure mathematics</reading> <pause dur="0.2"/><vocal desc="sniff" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.4"/> so that sentence is revealing in <pause dur="1.0"/> in two respects <pause dur="1.1"/><vocal desc="sniff" iterated="n"/> firstly it indicates <pause dur="0.2"/> quite clearly that Descartes' now going to <trunc>ex</trunc> extend his analysis <pause dur="0.7"/> to another realm of substance <pause dur="0.2"/> entirely <pause dur="0.5"/> <trunc>oth</trunc> that is substance other than intellectual substance <pause dur="0.6"/><vocal desc="cough" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.8"/> he's going to <trunc>ens</trunc> extend it to nature and to matter <pause dur="1.5"/> and secondly he says <pause dur="0.3"/> he's going to extend it <pause dur="0.8"/> and create a knowledge of the material world in so far it is <trunc>i</trunc> as it is the object <pause dur="0.3"/> of pure mathematics <pause dur="1.8"/> okay now also the question we might ask is to what extent is Descartes going to bend <pause dur="0.4"/> nature so as to suit a mathematical model <pause dur="0.7"/> to what extent is he going to impose <pause dur="0.7"/> # an alien mathematical 
<trunc>mo</trunc> model on an resistant matter <pause dur="0.2"/> but he himself believes that the two will correspond <pause dur="0.8"/> okay so that's one of the main things that's going on in this meditation <pause dur="0.5"/> to <pause dur="0.6"/> arrive at <trunc>comp</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> complementary theories of mind and of matter <pause dur="1.1"/> okay this is <pause dur="0.2"/> perhaps one of the crucial aspects of Descartes' meditations one of the distinctive aspects <pause dur="0.5"/> that he believes we can have a correspondence between the mind and matter <pause dur="0.3"/> so he's going to <trunc>ve</trunc> develop complementary theories of mind and of matter in this meditation <pause dur="2.1"/><event desc="drinks" iterated="n"/><vocal desc="sniff" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.3"/> now meditation five <pause dur="1.2"/> has reached the conclusion that corporeal things if they exist <pause dur="0.7"/> okay this is the previous meditation has reached the conclusion that corporeal things <pause dur="0.2"/> if they exist <pause dur="0.4"/> are geometrical in nature <pause dur="0.5"/><vocal desc="sniff" iterated="n"/> and hence quantifiable <pause dur="0.4"/> they're geometrical in nature <pause dur="0.4"/> and hence quantifiable <pause dur="1.6"/><vocal desc="sniff" iterated="n"/><pause dur="1.2"/> what does he mean by this he means that they have shape <pause dur="0.4"/> size position <pause dur="0.6"/> shape size position motion <pause dur="0.2"/> and number <pause dur="1.7"/> and these are all properties he believes that can be expressed in mathematical terms <pause dur="0.6"/> these are all 
properties that can be expressed <pause dur="0.5"/> in mathematical terms <pause dur="1.9"/> they have these properties <pause dur="1.2"/> if they exist <pause dur="0.4"/> they have these properties these <pause dur="0.6"/> material objects if they exist <pause dur="1.0"/> the task in meditation six is to show that they do in fact exist <pause dur="0.5"/><vocal desc="sniff" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.2"/> the task is to show <pause dur="0.4"/> that these geometrical objects do in fact exist <pause dur="1.2"/> that is corporeal things have geometrical properties <pause dur="3.0"/><vocal desc="sniff" iterated="n"/><pause dur="2.2"/> now one of the other main things that's taking place in meditation six <pause dur="1.2"/> as i say it's the point where <pause dur="0.9"/> Descartes brings to a summation the whole of the meditations but there also takes place <pause dur="1.1"/> a significant or major reversal <pause dur="0.6"/> of the entire argument so far <pause dur="0.7"/> it takes place an entire reversal of the argument so far namely <pause dur="0.4"/> a reversal of doubt <pause dur="1.5"/><vocal desc="sniff" iterated="n"/> so that many of the operations <pause dur="0.7"/> many of the operations that were commenced <pause dur="0.2"/> in meditation one <pause dur="1.6"/> are now deemed <pause dur="0.2"/> says Descartes we can now deem them <pause dur="0.3"/> to be risible <pause dur="0.2"/> or laughable <pause dur="0.8"/> many of the operations many of the experiments or hypotheses we conducted <pause dur="0.6"/> in meditation one can deem to be risible or laughable he says <pause dur="1.8"/><vocal desc="sniff" iterated="n"/> for example <pause dur="0.6"/> the things which in the past i 
took to be certain <pause dur="0.8"/> for example the things which in the past i took to be certain <pause dur="2.3"/> beliefs and principles <pause dur="0.8"/> but which turned out to be illusory or false <pause dur="1.2"/> were he says and <pause dur="0.2"/> we can now recognize that those things were simply things that i did not perceive clearly and distinctly  <pause dur="1.0"/> okay they were simply things <pause dur="0.5"/> that i did not perceive clearly and distinctly <pause dur="0.5"/> so i can now appreciate he says at this point that anything in the past <pause dur="1.0"/> which i held to be certain and true but which turned out to be false or illusory <pause dur="0.2"/> i can now recognize <pause dur="1.0"/> okay with the benefit that the journey the progress i've made and the discovery of knowledge i can now recognize <pause dur="0.8"/> that they were based <pause dur="1.2"/> # on principles or ideas that were not clear <pause dur="0.3"/> clear and distinct <pause dur="1.6"/><vocal desc="sniff" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.4"/> so for example Descartes says we can now abandon or jettison the dreaming hypothesis <pause dur="0.8"/> we can now abandon or jettison <pause dur="0.2"/> that hypothesis we no longer have to take it seriously <pause dur="3.4"/><vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.4"/> why simply because we're now he says in the realm of the pure mind <pause dur="0.9"/> we've emancipated the mind <pause dur="0.6"/> from the 
contamination of the senses <pause dur="0.5"/> or the deception <pause dur="0.8"/> # that our senses are subject to <pause dur="0.9"/> we're in the realm of the pure mind <pause dur="0.3"/> and therefore we're not subject <pause dur="0.3"/> any longer to that <pause dur="0.2"/> kind of deception <pause dur="0.5"/> we're no longer subject to the same kind of deception <pause dur="7.4"/><event desc="drinks" iterated="n"/><vocal desc="cough" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.2"/> okay what i'm going to do now is <pause dur="0.3"/><vocal desc="sniff" iterated="n"/> follow Descartes' deduction <pause dur="0.7"/> of the existence of material things <pause dur="0.8"/> okay how does he proceed <pause dur="0.3"/> in his deduction <pause dur="1.0"/> of the existence of material things <pause dur="1.9"/><event desc="drinks" iterated="n"/> now i should stress <pause dur="1.3"/> that what i'm going to say <pause dur="0.3"/> or what Descartes has to say <pause dur="0.3"/> may not be readily clear and transparent it's a very <pause dur="0.3"/> dense and convoluted part <pause dur="0.4"/> of the meditation <pause dur="0.5"/> so what i suggest <pause dur="1.0"/> i mean what i've done here is to try and break it down <pause dur="0.4"/> into three key components what i suggest is that people follow up the argument themselves <pause dur="0.5"/> by reading the crucial passages that i'm drawing upon <pause dur="0.4"/> after the <trunc>lect</trunc> after the lecture <pause dur="0.3"/> and before next week's seminar <pause dur="0.5"/> and the the page references <pause dur="0.4"/> are pages fifty-four to fifty-five <pause dur="0.3"/> in the Cambridge <trunc>edit</trunc> University Press edition of the 
meditations <pause dur="0.8"/> okay what i'm going to say now in this <pause dur="0.3"/> key paragraph <pause dur="0.4"/> split into three key points or components <pause dur="1.0"/> is taken from <pause dur="0.3"/> those pages fifty-four to fifty-five <pause dur="0.9"/> firstly point A we can say # <trunc>d</trunc> <pause dur="0.5"/> point A of Descartes' deduction <pause dur="2.6"/> i am a thinking substance he says <pause dur="0.3"/> i am a thinking substance that's what primarily and essentially i am <pause dur="2.2"/><event desc="drinks" iterated="n"/> i am a thinking substance <pause dur="1.2"/><vocal desc="sniff" iterated="n"/><pause dur="1.5"/> and i can clearly and distinctly conceive of myself <pause dur="0.6"/> i can clearly and distinctly conceive of myself <pause dur="0.4"/> in separation from other things <pause dur="0.8"/> okay i can clearly and distinctly <pause dur="0.5"/> conceive of myself <pause dur="0.6"/> in separation from other things <pause dur="0.2"/> such as my body <pause dur="0.2"/> for example <pause dur="1.0"/><vocal desc="cough" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.8"/> in other words i can isolate <pause dur="0.4"/> or bracket off <pause dur="0.4"/><vocal desc="sniff" iterated="n"/> an essential component <pause dur="0.2"/><vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.2"/> of my existence namely <pause dur="0.3"/> this thinking substance <pause dur="2.8"/><vocal desc="sniff" iterated="n"/> now reflecting on myself reveals that i have a passive faculty <pause dur="0.8"/> Descartes says reflecting on myself <pause dur="0.5"/> reveals <pause dur="0.4"/> or reflecting on what it is to be a thinking thing reveals that i have a passive faculty <pause dur="1.0"/> for receiving ideas <pause dur="1.5"/><vocal desc="sniff" iterated="n"/> okay there's a receptivity <pause dur="1.0"/> to the <unclear>cogita</unclear> <pause dur="0.2"/> i have a <trunc>pa</trunc> and this is a passive faculty says Descartes <pause dur="0.6"/> for <pause dur="0.2"/> receiving ideas <pause dur="0.7"/> this is the faculty <pause dur="0.3"/> of 
perception <pause dur="0.2"/> this is the faculty of perception <pause dur="4.4"/> now Descartes then goes on to say that this <pause dur="0.3"/> passive faculty <pause dur="0.7"/> this passive faculty <pause dur="0.3"/> of perception would be <pause dur="0.5"/> inert <pause dur="1.0"/> it would be inert <pause dur="1.2"/> if there was not also <pause dur="0.4"/> if there was not also <pause dur="0.4"/> an active faculty <pause dur="1.1"/> an active faculty to set it in operation <pause dur="0.8"/> to set it in operation <pause dur="1.1"/> okay so there's a passive faculty <pause dur="0.4"/> a receptive faculty of perception <pause dur="0.6"/> but this requires to be put into operation <pause dur="0.7"/> an active faculty <pause dur="3.2"/><vocal desc="sniff" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.2"/> okay now point B <pause dur="0.5"/> that's point A point B <pause dur="0.8"/> Descartes argues that this latter <pause dur="0.2"/> faculty <pause dur="0.6"/> this latter faculty the active faculty <pause dur="1.4"/> is not essential to me <pause dur="0.8"/> is not essential to me <pause dur="0.4"/> as a thinking thing <pause dur="1.9"/><vocal desc="sniff" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.4"/> okay it's not essential to me as a thinking thing <pause dur="4.9"/><event desc="drinks" iterated="n"/> since if it was he says it would pertain to my will <pause dur="0.9"/> if it was an essential <pause dur="0.6"/> aspect of me it would pertain to my will <pause dur="0.3"/> and therefore i could control it <pause dur="0.6"/><vocal desc="sniff" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.2"/> i could control it and that's what Descartes' arguing we cannot do <pause dur="0.7"/> on an initial foundation <pause dur="2.6"/> this is going to become clearer <pause dur="0.6"/> as the <pause dur="0.3"/> paragraph unfolds <pause dur="2.3"/> it cannot pertain to my will  
he says <pause dur="0.2"/> this faculty cannot pertain to my will <pause dur="0.5"/> since ideas <pause dur="0.6"/><vocal desc="sniff" iterated="n"/> are often produced against my will <pause dur="1.7"/> ideas or images <pause dur="1.4"/> that <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> come alive in my head <pause dur="0.3"/> are often produced <pause dur="0.3"/> against my will he says <pause dur="1.3"/> okay they'd often come <pause dur="0.5"/> when i'm not anticipating or expecting them <pause dur="0.6"/><vocal desc="sniff" iterated="n"/><pause dur="3.5"/> so he reaches the conclusion <pause dur="0.4"/> as the key part point B of his deduction <pause dur="0.6"/> he reaches the conclusion <pause dur="0.6"/> that this <pause dur="0.4"/> faculty must reside in a substance <pause dur="0.7"/> this faculty must reside in a substance that is different from me <pause dur="3.5"/><vocal desc="cough" iterated="n"/><vocal desc="sniff" iterated="n"/> okay so we've got a thinking substance that's the first part <pause dur="0.3"/> point of the deduction <pause dur="0.5"/> the second point is to deduce the idea <pause dur="0.6"/> or the sorry the claim <pause dur="0.4"/> that there's another substance <pause dur="0.3"/> a second substance and this substance <pause dur="0.4"/> is different from me <pause dur="1.9"/><vocal desc="sniff" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.9"/> now point C is to try and locate <pause dur="0.4"/> the identity <pause dur="0.6"/> of this other substance <pause dur="1.1"/> point C of the deduction is to try and locate <pause dur="0.3"/> the identity of this other substance <pause dur="2.4"/><vocal desc="sniff" iterated="n"/><pause dur="3.1"/><event desc="drinks" iterated="n"/><vocal desc="sniff" iterated="n"/><pause dur="1.3"/> Descartes does this by arguing that we can infer <pause dur="2.4"/> we can <trunc>fer</trunc> its we can infer its identity <pause dur="0.7"/> by examining the operations <pause dur="1.7"/> of <pause dur="0.3"/> this faculty <pause dur="0.9"/> we can infer its identity by examining <pause dur="0.2"/> its 
operations namely <pause dur="1.4"/> the ideas that are produced in the imagination <pause dur="0.2"/> namely the ideas <pause dur="0.6"/> that are produced in the imagination <pause dur="2.9"/><vocal desc="sniff" iterated="n"/><pause dur="1.4"/> now Descartes says <pause dur="0.2"/> now says something which is already outlined <pause dur="0.6"/> in meditation three <pause dur="0.2"/> namely that these ideas <pause dur="0.3"/> must possess objective reality <pause dur="0.6"/> their status must be an objective one <pause dur="1.6"/> these ideas <pause dur="0.2"/> that are produced in the imagination by an external substance <pause dur="0.6"/> they must have objective status <pause dur="1.4"/> and they must have causes <pause dur="0.7"/> they must have causes with greater or equal formal reality <pause dur="0.7"/> they must have causes with equal <pause dur="1.2"/> or greater formal reality <pause dur="4.4"/><vocal desc="sniff" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.3"/> and he says the only substances that satisfy this constraint <pause dur="0.8"/> the only substances that satisfy this constraint <pause dur="0.3"/> are three <pause dur="0.9"/> firstly bodily substance <pause dur="1.8"/> secondly mental substance and thirdly God <pause dur="0.3"/> there are three substances that satisfy this constraint <pause dur="1.7"/> that is that a <pause dur="0.3"/> objective reality and which must have causes with greater or equal formal reality <pause dur="1.0"/> firstly bodily substance secondly mental substance and thirdly God <pause dur="2.9"/> now <pause dur="0.2"/> Descartes argues that God does not equip equip us <pause dur="1.6"/> with the material to recognize <pause dur="0.2"/> God does not equip us <pause dur="0.4"/> 
with the material to recognize the latter two <pause dur="1.1"/> as the immediate cause of ideas <pause dur="0.2"/> he does not equip us with the material to recognize the latter two <pause dur="0.5"/> mental substance and God <pause dur="0.3"/> as the immediate cause the immediate <pause dur="0.4"/> the first or spontaneous cause <pause dur="0.5"/> of those ideas <pause dur="4.4"/> what we find he says what we find is that we are strongly inclined <pause dur="0.7"/> here the key word is inclined we are strongly inclined he says <pause dur="0.6"/> to believe <pause dur="0.3"/> that it's bodies <pause dur="0.8"/> other than our own <pause dur="0.9"/> mind substances or bodies other than our own mind which produce <pause dur="0.2"/> the images <pause dur="0.7"/> that take place within our mind <pause dur="0.3"/> through the imagination <pause dur="3.9"/><event desc="drinks" iterated="n"/> and he says <pause dur="1.7"/> adding another crucial component to his argument <pause dur="0.5"/> that we can be sure of this <pause dur="0.2"/> we can be sure of this <pause dur="0.4"/> of the truth of this claim <pause dur="0.9"/><vocal desc="sniff" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.6"/> that there are bodies outside of us producing images in our own mind <pause dur="0.5"/> we can be sure of this because God is not a deceiver <pause dur="0.2"/> which he believes he has clearly <pause dur="0.4"/> and conclusively established <pause dur="1.0"/> God is not a deceiver <pause dur="2.7"/><vocal desc="sniff" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.8"/> so even though <pause dur="0.3"/> i mean <pause dur="0.7"/> there's a kind of paradox there even though God <pause dur="0.3"/> is not the 
immediate cause of ideas in this instance says Descartes <pause dur="0.8"/><vocal desc="sniff" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.5"/> he does play the role of guaranteeing <pause dur="0.6"/> that we're not going to be <trunc>con</trunc> ultimately deceived <pause dur="0.4"/> about <pause dur="1.1"/> the nature of those ideas <pause dur="0.8"/> that they come to us spontaneously <pause dur="1.0"/> upon our receptive faculty <pause dur="1.0"/> # through bodily substances <pause dur="1.0"/> so he says the causes of images of things the final <pause dur="0.4"/> conclusion he reaches <pause dur="0.4"/> is that the causes of images of <pause dur="0.2"/> images of things <pause dur="0.4"/> belong to the category of bodily substance <pause dur="0.6"/> the causes of the images of things <pause dur="0.5"/> belong to the category of bodily substance <pause dur="0.7"/> and hence he says <pause dur="0.8"/> perhaps a bit too quickly <pause dur="0.6"/> in his final deduction bodies therefore exist <pause dur="2.5"/><vocal desc="sniff" iterated="n"/> let's try and unpack that <pause dur="0.4"/> # a bit more <pause dur="0.2"/> to try and make it a bit clearer <pause dur="0.4"/> but clearly obviously the important <pause dur="0.8"/> move that's taking place is that Descartes' trying to deduce the existence <pause dur="0.2"/> of an external substance an extended or corporal substance <pause dur="0.4"/> which is radically different and distinct from <pause dur="0.5"/> his own substance <pause dur="0.3"/> as an intellectual substance <pause dur="1.7"/> in effect what Descartes is doing is making an <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> a distinction an important distinction <pause dur="0.2"/> between the modes of things <pause dur="0.6"/><vocal desc="sniff" iterated="n"/> 
he's making an important distinction between the modes of things <pause dur="0.6"/> and the thing itself <pause dur="2.2"/> okay he's making an important distinction between the modes of things <pause dur="0.9"/> and thing itself <pause dur="1.7"/><vocal desc="sniff" iterated="n"/><pause dur="1.2"/><vocal desc="sniff" iterated="n"/><pause dur="1.4"/> so our intellectual faculty for example our intellectual faculty <pause dur="0.3"/> synthesizes it synthesizes <pause dur="0.6"/> the material <pause dur="0.2"/> that is presented to it <pause dur="1.1"/> synthesizes the material <pause dur="0.2"/> or the information that is presented to it <pause dur="1.6"/><vocal desc="cough" iterated="n"/><pause dur="3.2"/><event desc="drinks" iterated="n"/> and in this regard the most important <pause dur="0.3"/><vocal desc="sniff" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.5"/> # function of the intellect is to make judgements <pause dur="0.5"/> is to make judgements <pause dur="1.0"/> about the information <pause dur="0.5"/> it is <pause dur="0.2"/> receiving <pause dur="2.8"/><vocal desc="sniff" iterated="n"/><pause dur="2.3"/> now Descartes then argues that there are also other <trunc>f</trunc> faculties in operation <pause dur="0.9"/> there are other faculties in operation and here <pause dur="0.3"/> his usage of faculties is quite curious <pause dur="0.7"/> okay because what he means are things like <pause dur="0.3"/> change in positions <pause dur="0.4"/> when he says there are faculties other than this intellectual faculty <pause dur="0.3"/> this <pause dur="0.4"/> faculty that synthesizes information <pause dur="0.4"/> says there are other faculties <pause dur="1.7"/> like changing positions and assuming different shapes <pause dur="0.8"/> okay these kind of # capacities Descartes calls <pause dur="0.4"/> 
faculties <pause dur="1.6"/> changing position <pause dur="0.2"/> and assuming shapes <pause dur="0.5"/> which is what bodily <pause dur="0.4"/> corporeal objects he says do all the time <pause dur="0.8"/> but they do not involve he says this is the key point he makes they do not involve these operations <pause dur="0.7"/> do not involve any intellectual act <pause dur="1.7"/><vocal desc="cough" iterated="n"/><pause dur="1.0"/><vocal desc="sniff" iterated="n"/> they do not involve any intellectual act and therefore <pause dur="0.9"/> it follows for him <pause dur="1.1"/><vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.6"/> that they have to be understood <pause dur="0.2"/> as residing in some other <pause dur="0.3"/> substance <pause dur="0.6"/> namely a corporeal <pause dur="0.7"/> or extended substance <pause dur="0.7"/> if they don't involve any intellectual act <pause dur="0.2"/> then they don't belong to the mind the mental substance <pause dur="0.3"/> therefore they belong to another substance <pause dur="0.9"/> the corporeal <pause dur="0.4"/> or extended substance <pause dur="5.5"/><vocal desc="sniff" iterated="n"/> now let us note what Descartes is doing in trying to prove the existence <pause dur="0.6"/> of a material world <pause dur="0.8"/> okay and there's two key aspects <pause dur="0.6"/> to what's going on <pause dur="0.3"/> in his argument <pause dur="0.3"/><vocal desc="sniff" iterated="n"/> there's two key aspects firstly <pause dur="2.2"/> his certainty his certainty the certainty that he's trying to develop <pause dur="0.6"/> that material things do in fact exist <pause dur="0.9"/> that material <trunc>fa</trunc> things do in fact exist <pause dur="0.8"/> is due <pause dur="1.2"/> his 
certainty that material things do in fact exist is due <pause dur="0.4"/> to reflecting <pause dur="0.2"/> on the kind of capacity <pause dur="0.6"/> he thinks sense <trunc>mus</trunc> sense perception must be <pause dur="1.0"/> okay so his certainty that material things do in fact exist is due <pause dur="1.3"/><vocal desc="sniff" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.3"/> to his reflecting on the kind of capacity <pause dur="0.5"/> which he thinks sense perception <pause dur="0.2"/> must be <pause dur="0.2"/> the kind of capacity <pause dur="0.6"/> that sense perception must be <pause dur="2.8"/><event desc="drinks" iterated="n"/><vocal desc="sniff" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.9"/> he notices as i've already said that sensible ideas come into existence <pause dur="0.4"/> against his will <pause dur="0.6"/> he notices that sensible ideas come into existence <pause dur="1.2"/> sorry come into <trunc>hi</trunc> his consciousness <pause dur="0.4"/> against his will <pause dur="0.6"/> sensible ideas come into existence and come <trunc>int</trunc> enter his consciousness <pause dur="0.4"/> against his will <pause dur="2.5"/> so this means or this shows he <trunc>s</trunc> he argues <pause dur="1.1"/> this shows he argues that his capacity <pause dur="0.4"/> for sense perception <pause dur="0.6"/> the capacity he has <pause dur="0.5"/> for sense perception <pause dur="2.9"/><vocal desc="sniff" iterated="n"/> is set into operation <pause dur="0.2"/> by something <pause dur="0.2"/> outside of his consciousness <pause dur="0.7"/><vocal desc="sniff" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.4"/> his capacity <pause dur="0.9"/> <trunc>per</trunc> sense perception <pause dur="0.3"/> is set into operation by something outside his consciousness <pause dur="0.5"/> and hence which is distinct from his mind <pause dur="1.3"/> okay <pause dur="1.3"/><vocal desc="sniff" iterated="n"/> set into 
operation by something outside of his consciousness <pause dur="0.2"/> and which can therefore be claimed to be distinct <pause dur="0.4"/> from the mind <pause dur="7.0"/><vocal desc="sniff" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.2"/> he is conscious he says of the effects he is conscious of the effects of the operation <pause dur="0.8"/> of this active faculty he's conscious of the operation <pause dur="0.7"/> of this active faculty <pause dur="0.3"/> namely the ideas that it produces <pause dur="1.3"/> he's conscious of that operation <pause dur="1.0"/> and therefore he says he can infer <pause dur="0.4"/> from <pause dur="0.2"/> the existence of those ideas <pause dur="1.7"/> he can infer <pause dur="0.4"/> from the existence of those ideas the existence of material things <pause dur="0.7"/> which have the power <pause dur="0.2"/> which have the power to produce <pause dur="0.2"/> certain ideas within us <pause dur="2.1"/><vocal desc="sniff" iterated="n"/> okay so he says from being conscious of the active operation <pause dur="2.1"/> <trunc>o</trunc> sorry from the operation of that active faculty namely that it produces in us certain ideas <pause dur="0.7"/> he can infer from the existence <pause dur="0.5"/> of those ideas the existence of material things which have the power <pause dur="0.8"/> to produce those ideas <pause dur="0.5"/> that's the first <pause dur="1.0"/> key aspect 
now comes the second one <pause dur="0.5"/> which is crucial for modifying what he's just <pause dur="0.2"/> claimed <pause dur="0.5"/> the second one <pause dur="1.3"/> what he cannot do <pause dur="0.3"/> he says what he cannot do <pause dur="1.0"/> is to safely draw conclusions about the nature <pause dur="0.9"/> what he can't do is to safely draw conclusions about the nature <pause dur="0.4"/> of material things <pause dur="0.7"/> from the ideas <pause dur="0.4"/> that arise under their influence <pause dur="0.5"/> okay that's the key point i'll say it again <pause dur="0.4"/> what he cannot do is to safely <trunc>co</trunc> draw conclusions about the nature the specific <pause dur="0.6"/> detailed nature <pause dur="0.9"/> he cannot draw conclusions about the specific detailed nature of those material things <pause dur="1.1"/> from the ideas that arise under their influence <pause dur="1.4"/> okay so he can <trunc>co</trunc> contemplate the ideas <pause dur="0.3"/> that are being produced in his mind <pause dur="0.7"/> he's aware that his mind is thinking <pause dur="0.4"/> he's aware that his mind is being activated by something outside of itself but what he cannot then do <pause dur="0.7"/> in any simple sense <pause dur="1.1"/> is to grasp <pause dur="0.4"/> or understand the nature <pause dur="0.9"/> the detailed nature of those material things which are producing the ideas within his mind <pause dur="1.2"/><vocal desc="sniff" iterated="n"/> so this is the point for example the this is the point that he's making <pause dur="0.8"/> when he says that corporeal 
things this is the point he is making <pause dur="0.6"/> when he says in meditation six <pause dur="0.7"/> that <reading>corporeal things <pause dur="1.2"/> are perhaps</reading> this is the quote he says <reading>are perhaps not exactly <pause dur="0.4"/> what we perceive by the senses</reading> <pause dur="1.9"/><vocal desc="sniff" iterated="n"/> corporeal things are not exactly <pause dur="0.8"/> what we perceive by the senses <pause dur="1.3"/> <reading>since this comprehension <pause dur="1.7"/> by the senses <pause dur="0.2"/> is in many cases obscure <pause dur="0.2"/> and confused</reading> <pause dur="2.2"/> okay so these corporeal things <pause dur="0.6"/> this is what he means he says <pause dur="0.4"/> corporeal things are perhaps not exactly what we perceive <pause dur="0.9"/> by the senses <pause dur="0.7"/> since they <trunc>c</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> this comprehension by the senses is in many cases or instances <pause dur="0.3"/> obscure and confused <pause dur="1.2"/><vocal desc="cough" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.2"/><vocal desc="sniff" iterated="n"/> so what Descartes' got to try and do is to <pause dur="0.2"/> <trunc>extr</trunc> <pause dur="0.4"/> extrapolate <pause dur="0.4"/> from the information the mind is receiving <pause dur="0.6"/> he's got to try and extrapolate what is clear and distinct <pause dur="0.9"/> therefore making a separation between what is clear and distinct <pause dur="0.4"/> from what is obscure <pause dur="0.3"/> and confused <pause dur="0.3"/> and this is what's motivating his move in the direction <pause dur="0.5"/> of a certain geometrical precision <pause dur="0.4"/> about the essential nature of objects <pause dur="1.0"/> which is not going to be revealed to us simply through sensory perception <pause dur="3.3"/><event desc="drinks" iterated="n"/><vocal desc="sniff" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.6"/> okay so in order to have reliable thoughts about nature <pause dur="0.9"/> or the components of nature <pause dur="0.8"/> we have to rely not on what we sense <pause dur="0.7"/> but <pause dur="0.2"/> on what we conceive <pause dur="0.5"/> in order to 
have reliable <pause dur="0.6"/><vocal desc="sniff" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.2"/> knowledge <pause dur="0.3"/> of nature we have to rely <pause dur="1.1"/> on what not on what we sense but on what we conceive that is <pause dur="0.8"/> we have to rely on the understanding <pause dur="0.2"/> or the pure intellect <pause dur="2.5"/> now for Descartes <pause dur="0.4"/> as i've indicated this means having recourse <pause dur="0.3"/> to the realm of the clear and the distinct <pause dur="0.8"/> which is the realm for him of pure mathematics <pause dur="1.5"/> we have to have recourse to the realm <pause dur="0.3"/> of the clear and the distinct <pause dur="0.4"/> that is the realm of pure mathematics <pause dur="1.1"/><vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.2"/><vocal desc="sniff" iterated="n"/> in other words what we'll be concerned with <pause dur="0.3"/> in our theory of knowledge or our epistemology what we'll be concerned with <pause dur="1.6"/> is what is general to things trying to identify what is general to things <pause dur="0.4"/> as opposed to what is particular about <pause dur="2.2"/> in short as i <pause dur="0.7"/> <trunc>al</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> already # <pause dur="0.7"/> repeated a number of times our attention will be focused on those primary qualities <pause dur="0.7"/> of objects not on the secondary qualities <pause dur="1.7"/><vocal desc="sniff" iterated="n"/> things like shape size and motion <pause dur="0.9"/> as opposed to things like sound <pause dur="0.7"/> taste and pain <pause dur="1.6"/><vocal desc="sniff" iterated="n"/> for example he says we can be sure <pause dur="0.5"/> we can be sure <pause dur="0.6"/> of <pause dur="0.2"/> <trunc>ge</trunc> our general principles of the sun <pause dur="0.4"/> we can be sure of our general principles of the sun <pause dur="0.7"/> namely that it 
has a <trunc>cer</trunc> certain shape and size <pause dur="0.9"/> and that it is # it exists <pause dur="0.2"/> extended in space <pause dur="0.5"/> this kind of knowledge <pause dur="0.6"/> is <pause dur="0.4"/> knowledge <pause dur="0.3"/> that is certain <pause dur="1.5"/><vocal desc="sniff" iterated="n"/> as for things like sounds <pause dur="0.3"/> and pain he says <pause dur="0.6"/> these seem to pertain to matter <pause dur="0.2"/> as for things more secondary qualities like sound and pain <pause dur="0.4"/> sound and pain <pause dur="0.4"/> these seem to pertain to matter he says <pause dur="1.1"/> in virtue only of the particular <pause dur="1.2"/> sensibilities <pause dur="0.6"/> of our own existence as human beings <pause dur="1.0"/> okay those secondary qualities of things <pause dur="0.3"/> seem to pertain to matter only in virtue <pause dur="0.8"/> of the particular or peculiar sensibilities <pause dur="0.7"/> of ourselves <pause dur="0.7"/> as human beings <pause dur="0.8"/><vocal desc="cough" iterated="n"/><vocal desc="sniff" iterated="n"/> and do not exist independently <pause dur="0.2"/> they do not enjoy an independent existence <pause dur="2.5"/> now let's be clear about what Descartes' saying there <pause dur="0.8"/> clearly he's saying there is some basis in objects <pause dur="0.3"/> there is some basis <pause dur="0.5"/> in objects <pause dur="0.4"/> for me to have experiences <pause dur="0.3"/> of colour <pause dur="0.5"/> sounds <pause dur="0.2"/> smells and taste <pause dur="0.4"/> clearly there is some basis <pause dur="0.3"/> in objects for me to have those <pause dur="0.4"/> subjective experiences <pause dur="3.7"/><event desc="drinks" iterated="n"/> experiences of colour sound <pause dur="0.2"/> smell taste and so on <pause dur="1.7"/> but <pause dur="0.2"/> the point 
he's making is that we cannot be sure <pause dur="1.0"/> on the evidence of sense experience <pause dur="0.4"/> what that basis is <pause dur="0.4"/> we cannot be sure <pause dur="0.2"/> on the evidence of sense perception <pause dur="0.8"/> what that basis is <pause dur="4.9"/><vocal desc="sniff" iterated="n"/><pause dur="6.8"/> what we can be sure of <pause dur="0.2"/> says Descartes <pause dur="0.6"/> is that bodies have general properties what we can be sure of <pause dur="0.4"/> is that bodies have general properties <pause dur="1.3"/> and that they can be discovered by the mind <pause dur="0.7"/> independently of the senses <pause dur="1.3"/> okay what we can be sure of is that bodies have general properties <pause dur="0.3"/> all bodies have <pause dur="0.5"/> general properties that can be discovered by the mind <pause dur="0.5"/> working <pause dur="0.5"/> independently of the senses <pause dur="2.6"/><vocal desc="sniff" iterated="n"/><pause dur="5.3"/><event desc="drinks" iterated="n"/><vocal desc="sniff" iterated="n"/><pause dur="1.5"/> now the key question to ask obviously <vocal desc="sniff" iterated="n"/> is whether there are such things the key question to ask <pause dur="0.3"/> of Descartes' argument <pause dur="0.2"/><vocal desc="sniff" iterated="n"/> is obviously whether there are such things as geometrical objects <pause dur="1.1"/> the key question to ask is whether there are such things <pause dur="0.4"/> as geometrical objects <pause dur="1.6"/><vocal desc="cough" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.4"/> which apply <pause dur="0.5"/> which apply to concrete <pause dur="0.4"/> empirically identifiable <pause dur="0.5"/> bodies <pause dur="0.3"/> and not just to abstract figures <pause dur="1.3"/> okay do these geometrical <pause dur="1.4"/> <trunc>ide</trunc> # objects and the ideas we have of them <pause dur="0.5"/> do they apply to concrete <pause dur="0.5"/> empirically 
identifiable and often complex <pause dur="0.5"/> bodies <pause dur="0.3"/> and not just to abstract figures <pause dur="1.3"/><vocal desc="sniff" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.2"/> in other words how do we know that we're not simply imposing <pause dur="0.3"/> upon <pause dur="1.3"/> a more complex reality <pause dur="0.8"/> simply our own geometrical <pause dur="0.3"/> prejudices <pause dur="0.9"/> some need that we have <pause dur="1.4"/> to have <pause dur="0.6"/> a neat and tidy conception <pause dur="0.4"/> or understanding of reality <pause dur="2.2"/> okay <pause dur="0.6"/><vocal desc="cough" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.3"/> how do we know that it's not ultimately <pause dur="1.5"/> part of our own subjective make-up <pause dur="0.3"/> just like the secondary qualities <pause dur="1.5"/> okay now if <trunc>tha</trunc> <trunc>i</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> if we can sustain that argument <pause dur="0.5"/> then Descartes' whole position is placed into peril <pause dur="0.9"/> simply 'cause it means we haven't got over <pause dur="0.3"/> what he wants us to overcome <pause dur="0.2"/> namely <pause dur="0.3"/> subjectivism <pause dur="0.2"/> solipsism <pause dur="0.3"/> and the whole doubt <pause dur="0.4"/> that he's opened up the whole question of doubt <pause dur="0.4"/> that he's opened up <pause dur="0.3"/><vocal desc="sniff" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.5"/> it also calls into question <pause dur="0.8"/> his need and desire <pause dur="0.5"/> to arrive at a non-biologically based <pause dur="0.4"/> conception <pause dur="0.4"/> of science or knowledge <pause dur="0.4"/> a non-biologically based <pause dur="0.3"/> conception of science or knowledge in other words <pause dur="0.8"/> a conception of knowledge which would be <pause dur="0.8"/> species <trunc>spe</trunc> specific it would be

austere <pause dur="0.3"/> understanding of the world <pause dur="0.7"/> its attempt to exclude <pause dur="0.4"/> from scientific knowledge <pause dur="0.2"/> sense based properties <pause dur="0.7"/> results in very austere <pause dur="0.4"/> conception or understanding of the world <pause dur="0.2"/> which is reduced to essentially <pause dur="0.6"/> the properties of extension <pause dur="0.2"/> and motion <pause dur="0.5"/> that <pause dur="0.4"/> is essentially <pause dur="0.5"/> what the world is according to Descartes <pause dur="0.5"/> so it's reduced <pause dur="0.5"/> to extension and motion it gives us a very austere conception of the world <pause dur="1.7"/><vocal desc="sniff" iterated="n"/> now later philosophers after Descartes <pause dur="0.7"/> people like Leibniz and Locke <pause dur="0.3"/> added more <pause dur="1.1"/> primary qualities <pause dur="1.3"/> notions of force <pause dur="0.2"/> and solidity for example <pause dur="1.0"/> but even though they added a few more <pause dur="0.6"/> primary properties <pause dur="0.4"/> they still argued they still agreed with Descartes <pause dur="0.6"/> they still agreed <pause dur="0.3"/> with Descartes <pause dur="0.4"/> that ultimately reality <pause dur="0.3"/> was made up of very simple components <pause dur="0.2"/> or simple properties <pause dur="1.3"/> and that any complexity that the world has <pause dur="0.4"/> is merely <pause dur="0.3"/> a surface phenomena <pause dur="1.2"/> okay so even though <pause dur="0.4"/> the list of <trunc>pro</trunc> primary properties was extended by later philosophers <pause dur="0.2"/> after Descartes such as Locke and Leibniz <pause dur="0.4"/> they still agreed with him <pause dur="0.8"/> that in 
essence the world <pause dur="0.6"/> was composed of simple <pause dur="0.8"/> natures <pause dur="0.6"/> or one or two <pause dur="0.4"/> essential components <pause dur="0.3"/> and therefore any complexity of the world <pause dur="0.7"/> # that we perceived in the world was an entirely surface phenomena <pause dur="1.9"/><vocal desc="sniff" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.3"/> now Descartes' <pause dur="0.2"/> desire to reduce the world <pause dur="0.5"/> to a few essential <pause dur="0.3"/> features <pause dur="0.6"/> Descartes' desire <pause dur="0.2"/> to reduce the world to a few essential features <pause dur="0.5"/> is all part of his ambition <pause dur="0.4"/> it's all part of his ambition <pause dur="1.0"/> to know the world as it is in itself <pause dur="0.3"/> to know the world <pause dur="0.8"/> as it is in itself that is independently <pause dur="0.3"/> of his particular constitution <pause dur="1.5"/> independently of his particular <pause dur="0.5"/> constitution <pause dur="0.2"/> that is as Descartes <pause dur="0.7"/> was an embodied person <pause dur="0.4"/> living in a particular society <pause dur="0.3"/> at a particular point in time with a certain history and memory <pause dur="0.6"/> and with a certain biology <pause dur="0.4"/> it's all part of his ambition <pause dur="0.2"/> to transcend <pause dur="0.3"/> that <pause dur="0.4"/> particularity of constitution <pause dur="2.0"/><vocal desc="sniff" iterated="n"/><pause dur="1.6"/> and he says to do this we've got to subtract from our view of the world we've got to subtract to do this <pause dur="0.8"/> he says we find it necessary to subtract from our view of 
the world whatever <pause dur="1.0"/> is contributed <pause dur="0.6"/> by our biology whatever is contributed by our biology <pause dur="1.0"/> we've got to subtract from that <pause dur="0.4"/> whatever's contributed by our biology so it's an incredible sort of ambition <pause dur="0.6"/> that Descartes' <pause dur="0.4"/> undertaken <pause dur="0.9"/> to arrive at <pause dur="0.2"/> the conception of <trunc>so</trunc> science that he's <pause dur="0.5"/> he wants to arrive at <pause dur="1.5"/><vocal desc="sniff" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.6"/> okay so both # # in substance is a very bold move but also because of its boldness it makes his position very vulnerable <pause dur="1.1"/><vocal desc="cough" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.9"/><vocal desc="sniff" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.3"/> okay what i want to do now is to turn to the second part of the lecture and offer some <pause dur="0.3"/> reflections or some insight and then reflections <pause dur="0.6"/> on <pause dur="0.2"/> Descartes' notorious dualism of the mind and the body <pause dur="0.5"/> okay <trunc>per</trunc> perhaps the # <pause dur="1.6"/> the thing that Descartes or Cartesian philosophy <pause dur="0.6"/> is most <pause dur="0.4"/> # renowned for <pause dur="0.5"/> for advocating a strict separation <pause dur="0.6"/> of mind and body <pause dur="3.4"/> a principle task of meditation six <pause dur="0.3"/> a principle task of meditation six is to show that material things exist <pause dur="1.6"/><vocal desc="sniff" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.5"/> material things exist <pause dur="0.2"/> but that they are not in themselves as they appear <pause dur="0.7"/> to the senses <pause dur="0.8"/> okay so a principle task <pause dur="0.3"/> of that final meditation <pause dur="1.2"/> as we've just seen is to show that 
material things material things exist but they <pause dur="0.5"/> but that they are not <pause dur="0.3"/> in themselves <pause dur="0.3"/> as they appear <pause dur="0.5"/> to our senses <pause dur="1.7"/> so that the sense based view of nature or matter <pause dur="0.6"/> requires correction by a superior understanding <pause dur="0.5"/> the sense based view of matter <pause dur="0.4"/> requires correction and modification <pause dur="0.4"/> by a superior understanding <pause dur="0.9"/><vocal desc="sniff" iterated="n"/><pause dur="1.0"/> now Descartes <pause dur="1.4"/> in the rest of the meditation then goes on to make the same kind of claims <pause dur="0.5"/> about the self <pause dur="0.5"/> about the identity of the self <pause dur="0.9"/> what he'll do <pause dur="0.2"/> is to talk about the self <pause dur="0.4"/> in two modes he'll talk about the self in two modes firstly <pause dur="0.9"/> he'll offer a sense based understanding of the self and show that that's deficient <pause dur="0.6"/> and then he'll offer <pause dur="0.4"/> a <trunc>m</trunc> well he called it <pause dur="0.2"/> takes to be a superior rational <pause dur="0.4"/> rational or reason based conception of the self <pause dur="0.8"/><vocal desc="sniff" iterated="n"/><pause dur="2.5"/> okay so there's a certain isomorphism there between what Descartes' just said <pause dur="0.6"/> about material bodies and now what he's going to say about his own body <pause dur="1.5"/><vocal desc="sniff" iterated="n"/><pause dur="1.8"/> he says i feel myself to be he says i feel myself to be a mixture <pause dur="0.8"/> or an intermingling <pause dur="0.2"/> of a body and a mind i feel that's what i feel myself to be <pause dur="0.9"/><vocal desc="sniff" iterated="n"/> a mixture or a <trunc>hin</trunc> 
intermingling of mind and body <pause dur="0.8"/> but what he wants to show or argue <pause dur="0.5"/> is that this is not in fact the case <pause dur="0.2"/> what there is is a union <pause dur="0.7"/> there's a union not an intermingling a union of two distinct <pause dur="0.2"/> components <pause dur="1.7"/><vocal desc="cough" iterated="n"/><pause dur="1.3"/><vocal desc="sniff" iterated="n"/><pause dur="1.4"/> more than that <pause dur="0.2"/> not only <trunc>w</trunc> does he want to argue that the mind and body<pause dur="0.4"/> are two distinct components but he also wants to argue <pause dur="0.7"/> that only the mental component <pause dur="0.9"/> is essential <pause dur="0.7"/> to a self <pause dur="0.5"/> to what it means to be a self <pause dur="0.2"/> only the mental component <pause dur="0.4"/> is essential <pause dur="2.8"/><event desc="drinks" iterated="n"/><vocal desc="sniff" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.2"/> okay so the sense based <pause dur="0.2"/> conception of the self <pause dur="1.5"/> what i feel <pause dur="0.2"/> myself to be and what i perceive <pause dur="0.4"/> that i have a head <pause dur="1.1"/> # feet <pause dur="1.4"/> and so on all of this <pause dur="0.3"/> forms <pause dur="0.3"/> the inessential self for Descartes <pause dur="0.9"/> okay all of this this what i <pause dur="0.2"/> what i perceive <pause dur="0.2"/> through my senses to be my body <pause dur="0.3"/> forms the inessential self he says <pause dur="4.7"/> okay even though this body belongs strictly to me and is the site <pause dur="0.4"/> even though this body belongs strictly to me <pause dur="0.5"/> and is the site of all my affections and appetites <pause dur="0.9"/><vocal desc="sniff" iterated="n"/> the site of all my appetites and affections the source of my pleasure and pain <pause dur="0.4"/> he says 
it forms the inessential <pause dur="0.5"/> part <pause dur="0.3"/> of what i truly am <pause dur="0.2"/> the inessential part <pause dur="0.4"/> of what i truly am <pause dur="3.8"/> in other words <trunc>be</trunc> because we cannot rely on the senses we cannot also rely <pause dur="0.3"/> on this sense based conception of the self <pause dur="0.5"/> to arrive <pause dur="0.2"/> at an adequate conception of the self <pause dur="0.9"/> okay if in fact we cannot rely on the senses <pause dur="0.6"/> which is what the meditations has tried to demonstrate <pause dur="0.3"/> conclusively <pause dur="0.2"/> up to this point <pause dur="0.4"/> we cannot rely on the sense based conception in order to arrive <pause dur="0.5"/> at a true identity <pause dur="0.3"/> of the self <pause dur="1.0"/> and this is true he says in the case of both external sensations of the body <pause dur="0.5"/> this is true in the case of both external sensations of the body <pause dur="0.3"/> and internal <trunc>sen</trunc> sensations <pause dur="0.4"/> he makes that distinction <pause dur="0.5"/> between external sensations of the body <pause dur="0.3"/> and internal sensations <pause dur="1.5"/> so external sensations <pause dur="0.4"/> will be things like that are dependent upon the stimulation <pause dur="1.0"/> things that are dependent on the stimulation of our sense organs <pause dur="0.6"/> such as our eyes and our ears and our nose <pause dur="1.5"/> these produce beliefs about <pause dur="0.6"/> the sizes and shapes of things <pause dur="1.6"/> as seen from various distances but 
are always subject to illusion <pause dur="0.5"/> okay those external sensations <pause dur="0.3"/> are subject to illusions <pause dur="0.4"/> those sensations <pause dur="0.4"/> which are dependent upon the stimulation of my sense organs <pause dur="1.0"/> which give me certain ideas of the shapes and positions of things in relation to various distances but produce illusions <pause dur="0.4"/> like looking at the sun <pause dur="0.2"/> just looking at it <pause dur="0.2"/> and thinking it's <pause dur="0.3"/> a very small object <pause dur="0.8"/> but there are also internal sensations says Descartes <pause dur="0.4"/> such as pain <pause dur="0.6"/> which we can locate in a part of the body <pause dur="0.5"/> internal sensations such as a pain <pause dur="0.4"/> in a part of the body <pause dur="0.8"/> all of these <pause dur="0.3"/> sensations <trunc>int</trunc> external and internal <pause dur="0.2"/> belong to the inessential self <pause dur="1.7"/><vocal desc="sniff" iterated="n"/><pause dur="1.6"/> so what he does now is is to introduce <pause dur="0.5"/> a reason based <pause dur="0.3"/> self <pause dur="1.4"/> he introduces the idea of a reason <pause dur="0.3"/> based self which is designed to show <pause dur="1.2"/> that the mind and body <pause dur="0.2"/> can be separated <pause dur="0.7"/> and seen to be distinct <pause dur="0.6"/> components <pause dur="0.6"/> can be seen to be distinct components <pause dur="3.7"/><vocal desc="sniff" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.2"/> now what Descartes does is to acknowledge <pause dur="0.2"/> <trunc>e</trunc> <pause dur="0.3"/> even though he says we can't have reliable we can't form <trunc>r</trunc> <pause dur="0.6"/> we can't base reliable knowledge <pause dur="0.5"/> on our sense based self he does acknowledge or 
concede <pause dur="1.5"/> that the sensory information we receive <pause dur="1.0"/> plays an important role <pause dur="0.2"/> in our survival <pause dur="0.6"/> the sensory information we receive <pause dur="0.2"/> and act upon <pause dur="0.4"/> plays an important role he says in our survival <pause dur="0.9"/> but it's limited <pause dur="0.3"/> to our biological constitution <pause dur="0.9"/> so his argument there is in fact quite close <pause dur="0.5"/> strangely enough <pause dur="0.4"/> to <pause dur="0.4"/> more later nineteenth century Darwinian ideas <pause dur="0.6"/><vocal desc="sniff" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.2"/> about <pause dur="0.6"/> our <pause dur="0.4"/> # senses and faculties <pause dur="0.4"/> evolving over time <pause dur="0.3"/> in accordance with <pause dur="0.2"/> the needs <pause dur="0.6"/> the <trunc>n</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> the needs we have as an animal <pause dur="0.2"/> to adapt <pause dur="0.3"/> to changes in circumstances <pause dur="0.9"/> Descartes acknowledges that point <pause dur="0.4"/> and says <pause dur="0.5"/> that that's what our senses do they enable us to survive <pause dur="1.0"/> they respond to certain situations <pause dur="0.6"/> and provoke certain responses <pause dur="0.6"/> okay gives us a sense of danger <pause dur="0.4"/> or warning for example <pause dur="1.5"/> but he says they are not sufficiently clear and distinct <pause dur="0.5"/> they are not sufficiently clear and distinct <pause dur="2.0"/> and only teaches what is confused and obscure <pause dur="0.5"/> they only teach what is <trunc>con</trunc> confused and obscure in other words their role <pause dur="0.3"/> if <trunc>y</trunc> <pause dur="0.3"/> one can say <pause dur="0.6"/> is entirely <pause dur="0.3"/> instinctual or instinctive <pause dur="1.7"/> okay the sense based impressions and 
perceptions that we're picking up on <pause dur="1.1"/> have a survival value <pause dur="1.4"/> but they are relative <pause dur="0.3"/> to our biological constitution they play an important role <pause dur="0.3"/> but it's precisely <pause dur="0.4"/> the role that's limited <pause dur="0.6"/> to the <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> evolutionary <pause dur="0.2"/> need to survive <pause dur="1.4"/> and to adapt <pause dur="2.1"/><vocal desc="sniff" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.2"/> okay so it's inadequate <pause dur="0.6"/> Descartes' claim is <pause dur="0.3"/> his claim that he <pause dur="0.3"/> deduces from that is to say that it's inadequate <pause dur="0.5"/> to base a scientific conception <pause dur="0.3"/> of matter or nature <pause dur="2.2"/> on <pause dur="0.9"/> the needs we have to survive and adapt it's inadequate to base <pause dur="0.4"/> a scientific conception of nature <pause dur="0.7"/> on the on the sense based aspects of our self <pause dur="0.2"/> which we need in order to survive and adapt <pause dur="1.2"/> okay scientific investigation cannot be based <pause dur="0.8"/> on this sense based <trunc>concep</trunc> # <pause dur="0.2"/> sense based <trunc>ac</trunc> <pause dur="0.3"/> # aspect of our existence <pause dur="1.2"/><vocal desc="sniff" iterated="n"/><pause dur="1.8"/> now Descartes then develops <pause dur="0.2"/> a crucial premise <pause dur="0.3"/> in his argument he develops a crucial premise <pause dur="0.3"/> in his argument <pause dur="0.4"/> which is designed to <pause dur="0.2"/> separate <pause dur="0.8"/> and make clearly distinct <pause dur="0.6"/> the components of mind and body <pause dur="1.1"/> for example <pause dur="0.2"/> namely he argues that if bodily <trunc>a</trunc> attributes if bodily attributes <pause dur="0.4"/> can be subtracted <pause dur="0.9"/> from the conception of the self 
if bodily attributes can be <pause dur="1.1"/><vocal desc="sniff" iterated="n"/> subtracted <pause dur="1.2"/> from the conception of the self <pause dur="2.1"/> if these bodily attributes <pause dur="0.5"/> can be subtracted <pause dur="1.2"/> from the conception of the self <pause dur="1.6"/> without taking away <pause dur="0.2"/> a clear and distinct conception of the self <pause dur="1.2"/> without taking away a clear and distinct conception of the self <pause dur="1.5"/> then bodily attributes can be regarded as extraneous <pause dur="0.5"/> and inessential to the self <pause dur="0.7"/> okay that's basically the essential premise <pause dur="0.8"/> in the meditation the final meditation regarding the <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> regarding <pause dur="0.5"/> the separability of mind and body and <pause dur="0.2"/> regarding the <pause dur="0.2"/> the <pause dur="0.6"/> need to treat them as distinct <pause dur="0.5"/> components <pause dur="0.8"/> if we can subtract <pause dur="0.2"/> bodily attributes <pause dur="1.5"/><vocal desc="sniff" iterated="n"/> from the conception of self without taking away <pause dur="0.6"/> the idea of the self being clear and distinct <pause dur="0.4"/> then those bodily attributes can be regarded he says as inessential <pause dur="0.6"/> and extraneous <pause dur="0.7"/> to our notion of the self <pause dur="3.2"/> now in answer to the question is it possible to conceive of ourselves <pause dur="0.2"/> in answer to the question <pause dur="0.6"/> is it possible to conceive of ourselves <pause dur="0.5"/> as being devoid <pause dur="0.2"/> of powers of imagination <pause dur="0.6"/> and sensation <pause dur="0.6"/> and yet still <pause dur="0.3"/> have a sense of self <pause dur="0.5"/> Descartes' 
answer is yes <pause dur="0.2"/> it is possible <pause dur="1.8"/> to <pause dur="0.9"/> regard ourselves <pause dur="0.7"/> as beings devoid of imagination <pause dur="0.5"/> and sensation <pause dur="0.2"/> and still <pause dur="2.5"/> have a sense of ourselves as a self <pause dur="0.5"/> is this still possible <pause dur="0.5"/> Descartes' answer <pause dur="0.3"/> is is yes <pause dur="1.8"/> what he argues <pause dur="0.4"/> what he argues on this point <pause dur="0.8"/> is that completeness <pause dur="0.6"/> does not reside in the number of components of a thing <pause dur="1.1"/> the completeness of a thing such as our self <pause dur="0.7"/> does not reside in the number of components <pause dur="0.8"/> or attributes <pause dur="0.4"/> but only in their essential ones <pause dur="1.0"/> okay to have a <pause dur="0.4"/> sense of a completeness of something <pause dur="0.4"/> such as a self <pause dur="0.4"/> does not he says reside in the number of components <pause dur="0.8"/> but rather only in the essential attributes or components of a thing <pause dur="0.4"/> and this is what he's trying to do in his theory of the self he's trying to deduce <pause dur="0.4"/> what are the essential attributes of a self <pause dur="1.5"/> and to isolate them and say if we can extract them <pause dur="0.6"/> from the other components namely bodily components or attributes <pause dur="0.3"/> and if we're still left with something that we can identify <pause dur="0.4"/> as clear and distinct <pause dur="0.3"/> then what we've got is 
what is essential <pause dur="0.5"/> to that thing <pause dur="0.3"/> in this case the self <pause dur="0.5"/> namely thought <pause dur="0.4"/> and consciousness <pause dur="0.3"/> and Descartes believes we can do all of that <pause dur="0.6"/> we can extract <pause dur="0.2"/> or subtract <pause dur="1.2"/><vocal desc="sniff" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.6"/> these essential properties <pause dur="0.7"/> from the bodily attributes and still be left with a clear <trunc>s</trunc> a conception that is clear and distinct <pause dur="2.4"/><vocal desc="cough" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.4"/> now in the final part of the lecture i just want to end on a critical note and then go out with a bang <pause dur="0.7"/> by # reading a passage from Nietzsche <pause dur="0.4"/> # i've resisted all along that i hope you respect from bringing Nietzsche into these lectures <pause dur="0.5"/> but i'm afraid my resistance is now <pause dur="0.6"/> low and # i've brought some Nietzsche in for us to read <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> so we'll end on that point we'll we'll <trunc>re</trunc> we'll finish by reading the passage from Nietzsche <pause dur="0.7"/> but that <pause dur="0.2"/> passage will hopefully follow from what i've now got to say <pause dur="0.5"/> in the final part of the lecture offering some critical reflections <pause dur="0.6"/> on Descartes' <pause dur="0.5"/> curious notion of the self <pause dur="1.8"/><vocal desc="sniff" iterated="n"/><pause dur="1.5"/> what we'll see i mean i'm introducing Nietzsche at this point but in in many respects <pause dur="0.2"/> what Nietzsche has to say about 
the self and the subject <pause dur="0.4"/> # is prefigured in Hume <pause dur="0.3"/> who we're going to look at <pause dur="0.2"/> next week <pause dur="1.0"/> now in response to Cartesianism <pause dur="0.7"/> Hume argues that basically its position <pause dur="0.2"/> amounts to nonsense <pause dur="0.9"/> in short he says <pause dur="0.2"/> this is nonsense <pause dur="0.5"/> a mental substance alone he says is not sufficient <pause dur="0.3"/> a mental substance alone is not sufficient <pause dur="0.5"/> to constitute a self <pause dur="0.7"/> a mental substance alone isolating a mental substance <pause dur="0.4"/> is not sufficient <pause dur="0.2"/> for constituting a self <pause dur="1.5"/><vocal desc="sniff" iterated="n"/> and the idea of a soul <pause dur="0.2"/> which Descartes also wants to develop <pause dur="0.4"/> from this isolation of the soul because if you've isolated the soul from the body then clearly you've isolated something <pause dur="0.5"/> which is immaterial <pause dur="1.0"/> okay which enjoys an a <pause dur="0.2"/> a radically different existence to <pause dur="0.3"/> a bodily existence which is finite mortal <pause dur="0.4"/> and so on <pause dur="1.3"/> he argues the idea of a soul <pause dur="0.7"/> is <pause dur="0.4"/> not scientific <pause dur="0.3"/> but an assumption at best <pause dur="0.2"/> and a piece of superstition <pause dur="0.3"/> at worst <pause dur="1.0"/> okay the idea of a soul <pause dur="0.5"/> is an assumption <pause dur="0.7"/> <trunc>i</trunc> is not scientific but is an assumption at best <pause dur="0.7"/> and <pause dur="0.6"/> a piece of superstition or 
prejudice at worst <pause dur="2.7"/><vocal desc="sniff" iterated="n"/> i mean as we can discuss in the seminars one of the major problems that Descartes faces <pause dur="0.7"/> in <pause dur="0.5"/> arguing for the radical distinctness of mind and body <pause dur="0.6"/> is to try and show how if they are radically distinct <pause dur="0.3"/> they are interconnected <pause dur="0.5"/> how are the mind and body interconnected <pause dur="0.2"/> because surely they have to be <pause dur="1.7"/> and as we'll see his response <pause dur="0.3"/> is an entirely intellectualist <pause dur="0.2"/> response <pause dur="1.2"/> his response is an entirely intellectualist response what do i mean by that <pause dur="0.9"/> well for example <pause dur="0.3"/> he says that apparent bodily sensations <pause dur="0.3"/> such as a pinch in the stomach <pause dur="0.7"/> are not things apart from intellectual events <pause dur="0.9"/> so apparent bodily sensations are really <pause dur="0.2"/> he says intellectual events <pause dur="0.8"/> a special case of thoughts <pause dur="0.4"/> so the pinch in the stomach for him <pause dur="0.3"/> is a desire to eat <pause dur="0.5"/> and this <pause dur="0.7"/> has to be something <pause dur="0.2"/> that the intellect carries out not the body <pause dur="1.8"/><vocal desc="sniff" iterated="n"/><pause dur="1.8"/> now the final key question <pause dur="0.8"/> which will lead us nicely into Nietzsche <pause dur="1.0"/> is to ask whether the fact <pause dur="0.3"/> the fact <pause dur="0.2"/> that we do appear to be able to conceive of ourselves <pause dur="0.3"/> 
independently of our bodies <pause dur="1.1"/> the fact that we do appear to be <pause dur="0.2"/> able to conceive of ourselves <pause dur="0.6"/> independently of our bodies <pause dur="2.4"/> and therefore <pause dur="0.3"/> isolate some essential <pause dur="0.5"/> <distinct lang="fr">moi</distinct> <pause dur="0.2"/> or me <pause dur="0.5"/> might this be an illusion generated <pause dur="0.4"/> might this simply be an illusion <pause dur="0.4"/> generated by our consciousness <pause dur="1.1"/> okay so might the fact <pause dur="0.5"/> that we do appear to be able to conceive of ourselves <pause dur="1.0"/> independently of our bodies might this simply be an illusion <pause dur="0.7"/> generated by our consciousness <pause dur="0.9"/> and therefore nothing true at all <pause dur="1.3"/><vocal desc="sniff" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.2"/> okay i may consider for example my body to be an essential part of my existence <pause dur="0.6"/> but that does not mean that it is <pause dur="0.9"/> okay simply the fact that you consider your body to have been an essential part of your existence <pause dur="0.5"/> doesn't mean that it is <pause dur="1.3"/> illness and disease for example <pause dur="0.3"/> often make us aware <pause dur="0.5"/> well not often but all the time make us aware of the prime importance of our body <pause dur="0.3"/> which for the most time we simply ignore like a machine <pause dur="0.3"/> and assume and hope <pause dur="0.3"/> that it's functioning entirely <pause dur="0.3"/> # smoothly <pause dur="1.4"/> so how is the 
illusion the question we need to ask is how is the illusion of the subject or the self <pause dur="0.4"/> generated <pause dur="0.5"/> if it is an illusion as Hume and Nietzsche will argue <pause dur="0.5"/> how is this illusion <pause dur="0.5"/> generated <pause dur="0.9"/><vocal desc="sniff" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.7"/> in <trunc>whi</trunc> # clearly Descartes on one level is hitting onto something that we can all <pause dur="0.4"/> perhaps immediately recognize that with sense that are our bodies are perhaps inessential <pause dur="0.5"/> and that there's a little sort of homonculus in our heads <pause dur="0.3"/> which is <pause dur="0.3"/> which is our essential identities <pause dur="0.4"/> it's our minds <pause dur="0.4"/> and that's what's essential by us <pause dur="0.6"/> but what Hume and Nietzsche want to # <pause dur="0.6"/> try and the idea they want us to try and entertain <pause dur="0.3"/> is the idea that it might be an illusion <pause dur="0.5"/> generated by consciousness <pause dur="0.8"/> but how what's the mechanism for the generation of this illusion <pause dur="0.3"/> within consciousness <pause dur="0.5"/> well for Hume as we'll see in detail in the <pause dur="0.5"/> coming weeks <pause dur="0.3"/> it's created by the force <pause dur="0.4"/> of our habits <pause dur="0.2"/> and customs <pause dur="0.8"/> our social habits <pause dur="1.1"/> and customs and our mental habits and customs <pause dur="1.3"/><vocal desc="sniff" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.3"/> it simply <trunc>re</trunc> resides in our customary practices <pause dur="2.5"/> which have <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> which have accrued over time <pause dur="0.4"/> and which we 
take to be <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> revealing something true about reality but <trunc>w</trunc> <trunc>m</trunc> which may simply conceal prejudices <pause dur="0.9"/> for Nietzsche the illusion lies <pause dur="0.3"/> in the sedimentations of our grammar <pause dur="0.4"/> and our linguistic conventions the illusion resides in the sedimentations <pause dur="1.1"/> of our grammar and our linguistic conventions <pause dur="0.6"/><vocal desc="sniff" iterated="n"/> as you know Nietzsche was a great Averroist <pause dur="0.6"/> and in one of his most pithy moments he says for example <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> <reading>we will not get rid of God</reading> he says <pause dur="0.5"/> which is clearly <pause dur="0.3"/> what his entire life was designed to do <pause dur="0.7"/> <reading>we will not get rid of God</reading> he says <pause dur="0.4"/> <reading>until we get rid of grammar</reading> <pause dur="0.3"/> we will not get rid of God <pause dur="0.3"/> until we get rid of grammar <pause dur="0.5"/> fantastic quote <pause dur="0.6"/> what does it mean i'll leave you to ponder that <pause dur="0.4"/> okay <pause dur="0.4"/> but # <pause dur="1.0"/> we will not get rid of <pause dur="0.2"/> God until we get rid of grammar now what we're going to do is just <pause dur="0.7"/> end the lecture <pause dur="0.5"/> by reading this passage from Nietzsche's <pause dur="0.4"/> Genealogy of Morality <pause dur="1.2"/> where he tries to expose <pause dur="0.4"/> this illusion of the self or subject <pause dur="0.4"/> and i'll just read it out <pause dur="0.2"/> and then we'll stop <pause dur="1.8"/><event desc="drinks" iterated="n"/><vocal desc="sniff" iterated="n"/> okay it's just a final piece of 
entertainment <pause dur="0.4"/> in the conclusion to the lectures on Descartes <pause dur="1.4"/> okay it's just three lines down we're going to read <pause dur="0.5"/> most of the page on the left-hand side and just stop at the top <pause dur="0.7"/> of the right-hand side page <pause dur="0.2"/> so three lines down <pause dur="0.4"/><vocal desc="sniff" iterated="n"/> Nietzsche says <pause dur="0.2"/> <reading>there is nothing strange <pause dur="0.2"/> about the fact</reading> i i hope this just gives you some food for <trunc>thou</trunc> thought over the # <pause dur="0.3"/> weekend <pause dur="0.5"/> he says this # <reading>there is nothing strange about the fact <pause dur="0.2"/> that lambs bear a grudge <pause dur="0.3"/> towards large birds of prey <pause dur="1.1"/> but that is no reason to blame the large birds of prey for carrying off the little lambs <pause dur="0.7"/> and if the lambs say to each other <pause dur="0.2"/> these birds of prey are evil <pause dur="0.5"/> then whoever <trunc>i</trunc> is least like a bird of prey <pause dur="0.2"/> and most like its opposite a lamb <pause dur="0.4"/> is good isn't he <pause dur="0.9"/> then there is no reason to raise objections <pause dur="0.5"/> to this setting up of an ideal <pause dur="0.5"/> beyond the fact that the birds of prey will view it <trunc>som</trunc> <pause dur="0.5"/> view it somewhat derisively <pause dur="0.6"/> and perhaps say <pause dur="0.6"/> we don't bear any grudge at all towards these good lambs <pause dur="0.2"/> in fact we love them <pause dur="0.4"/> nothing is tastier <pause dur="0.3"/> than a tender lamb <pause dur="1.1"/> 
this is just <trunc>abs</trunc> as absurd</reading> okay so Nietzsche's point is a kind of culinary point but now he's off <pause dur="0.2"/> going on to make a philosophical one <pause dur="0.7"/> he says <reading>it's just as absurd <pause dur="0.3"/> to ask strength <pause dur="0.5"/> not to express itself as strength <pause dur="0.5"/> not to be a desire to overthrow crush become master <pause dur="0.5"/> to be a thirst for enemies resistance and triumphs <pause dur="0.4"/> as it is to ask <pause dur="0.2"/> of weakness <pause dur="0.3"/> to express itself as strength <pause dur="1.0"/> a quantum of force <pause dur="0.4"/> is just such a quantum of drive will action <pause dur="0.4"/> in fact it is nothing but this driving willing and acting <pause dur="0.5"/> and only the seduction of language <pause dur="0.4"/> in the fundamental of <trunc>r</trunc> <pause dur="0.3"/> errors of reason that are petrified in it <pause dur="0.5"/> which construes and misconstrues all actions as conditional upon an agency <pause dur="0.5"/> a subject <pause dur="0.7"/> can make it appear otherwise <pause dur="0.7"/> and just as the common people separates lighting from its flash <pause dur="0.4"/> and takes the latter to be a deed <pause dur="0.4"/> something performed by a subject <pause dur="0.2"/> which is called lightning <pause dur="0.6"/> popular morality separates strengths <pause dur="0.4"/> from the manifestations of strengths <pause dur="0.4"/> as though there were an 
indifferent substratum <pause dur="1.3"/><vocal desc="sniff" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.2"/> behind the strong person which had the freedom to <unclear>manifest</unclear> strength or not <pause dur="0.5"/> but there is no such substratum <pause dur="0.3"/> there is no being behind the deed <pause dur="0.5"/> its effect and what becomes of it <pause dur="0.4"/> the deer <pause dur="0.3"/> the doer</reading> sorry the deer <pause dur="0.4"/> i'm on this # food # <trunc>poi</trunc> aren't i <pause dur="0.2"/> <reading>the doer</reading> <pause dur="0.2"/> i'm obviously anticipating what i'm going to have for tea tonight <vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" n="ss" dur="1"/> but anyway <pause dur="0.4"/> <reading>the doer <pause dur="0.4"/> is invented</reading> i have a very rich existence # i'll have you know <pause dur="0.6"/><vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" n="ss" dur="1"/> i eat deer every night <pause dur="0.4"/> <reading>the doer is invented as an afterthought the doing is everything</reading> <pause dur="0.6"/> okay <reading>the doing is everything basically the common people double a deed <pause dur="0.5"/> and when they see lightning they make doing a deed out of it <pause dur="0.3"/> they posit the same event <pause dur="0.2"/> first as cause <pause dur="0.3"/> and then as effect</reading> <pause dur="0.5"/> so Nietzsche's saying there <pause dur="0.2"/> there is only the one event <pause dur="0.3"/> there's no cause and effect <pause dur="0.2"/> there's no subject and object no subject <pause dur="0.5"/> or substance as subject <pause dur="1.3"/> this is the final part now <pause dur="0.4"/> <reading>the scientists do no better <pause dur="0.4"/> when they say force moves <pause dur="0.2"/> force causes and such like <pause dur="0.5"/> all our science in spite of its coolness and freedom from emotion <pause dur="0.5"/> still 
stands exposed to the seduction of language <pause dur="0.4"/> and has not ridded itself of the changelings foisted upon it <pause dur="0.4"/> the subjects <pause dur="0.2"/> for example the atom <pause dur="0.5"/> just such a changeling likewise the Kantian thing in itself <pause dur="0.5"/> no wonder then</reading> he says <pause dur="0.3"/> <reading>if <pause dur="0.2"/> the entrenched secretly smouldering emotions of revenge and hatred <pause dur="0.4"/> put this belief to their own use <pause dur="0.4"/> and in fact do not defend and believe more passionately <pause dur="0.4"/> than the strong <pause dur="0.3"/> are free to be weak <pause dur="0.2"/> and the birds of prey <pause dur="0.3"/> are free to be lambs <pause dur="0.4"/> in this way they gain the right <pause dur="0.3"/> to make the birds of prey <pause dur="0.2"/> responsible <pause dur="0.5"/> for being <pause dur="0.4"/> birds of prey</reading> <pause dur="1.6"/> profound <pause dur="0.6"/> quotation i hope you agree <pause dur="0.3"/> and basically Nietzsche's point is that it's only the weak <pause dur="0.4"/> who need to believe in a self or a subject <pause dur="0.5"/> and i'll leave you with that thought
