<u who="nm0075"><kinesic desc="overhead projector is on showing covered transparency" iterated="n"/> # a very warm welcome to the # <pause dur="0.2"/> year one drama option <pause dur="1.5"/> nice to see so many faces <pause dur="0.6"/> quite surprised to see such a big group actually <pause dur="0.4"/> # my name is <gap reason="name" extent="2 words"/> and i work in the French department of the Modern Languages Unit here at the University of <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> <pause dur="0.2"/> and also at <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> University <pause dur="0.6"/> so it's a great pleasure to be here this morning <pause dur="0.2"/> to speak to you about # twentieth century drama <pause dur="9.4"/> i'd like to begin now by just giving you an idea of some of the # things i'm going to be talking about in this lecture <pause dur="0.6"/> and <pause dur="0.6"/> if we briefly refer to # <pause dur="0.5"/><kinesic desc="reveals covered part of transparency" iterated="n"/> the first schema which is on the on the board <pause dur="1.6"/> # there's no need to copy this down actually but <pause dur="0.4"/> if you notice # on this schema it's a fairly basic <pause dur="0.2"/> and fairly # <pause dur="1.4"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> inaccurate view really of what a a theatrical text actually consists of <pause dur="0.3"/> # in the particular <trunc>th</trunc> schema that you have # <pause dur="0.8"/> we begin with # the author <pause dur="0.5"/> who actually writes the play <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> and <pause dur="0.3"/> this obviously in turn <pause dur="0.2"/> leads to the text <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> the characters within the 
text <pause dur="0.4"/> # speak using language <pause dur="0.2"/> and that actually is received by the by the audience so it's a pretty sort of unilinear <pause dur="0.2"/> fairly # <pause dur="0.3"/> fairly sort of # uninteresting account of what actually happens in twentieth century plays <pause dur="1.1"/> now # there are some problems with this and one of the main problems actually is that # <pause dur="0.8"/> some of the words are very <pause dur="0.9"/> <event desc="students enter room" iterated="n" n="ss"/> okay can can you hurry up and sit down as soon as possible please <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.8"/> some of the words are <pause dur="0.3"/> quite overused and not very accurate in terms of # what actually happens in a play <pause dur="0.7"/> for example <pause dur="0.2"/> looking at the author <pause dur="1.0"/> who actually <pause dur="0.4"/> who actually writes the play <pause dur="0.6"/> # is it the author <pause dur="0.2"/> or is it the director <pause dur="0.8"/> so <pause dur="0.3"/> we have a problem of authorship <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> and # we don't really know who actually <trunc>r</trunc> is responsible for the play as we as we see it <pause dur="0.9"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> secondly # <pause dur="1.3"/> how can the director if we assume that the author <pause dur="0.3"/> is replaced by the director <pause dur="0.2"/> how can the director remain faithful <pause dur="0.3"/> to the # <pause dur="0.3"/> the <pause dur="0.8"/> to the author's intentions <pause dur="0.2"/> that's 
the second <pause dur="0.2"/> sort of big problem with this actually <pause dur="1.7"/> thirdly <pause dur="0.4"/> is the problematic status of language <pause dur="0.4"/> so one of the big problems there <pause dur="0.2"/> is that # <pause dur="0.3"/> verbal language <pause dur="0.2"/> or words are one way of conveying meaning in a play <pause dur="0.5"/> but <pause dur="0.7"/> as you will know from your own experiences of twentieth century plays <pause dur="0.2"/> there are many other ways of # <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> <trunc>pr</trunc> producing communication <pause dur="0.2"/> which don't actually depend on language <pause dur="0.3"/> so you have for example mime gesture <pause dur="0.8"/> # stage effects that kind of thing <pause dur="0.4"/> so <trunc>t</trunc> to view to view verbal language <pause dur="0.2"/> as a a sole means of communication in a play <pause dur="0.5"/> is quite inaccurate <pause dur="0.2"/> in the sense that # <pause dur="0.2"/> directors and playwrights will actually come <trunc>ac</trunc> come across many other ways of # <pause dur="0.2"/> dealing with # <pause dur="0.2"/> communication <pause dur="1.4"/> finally <pause dur="0.2"/> and perhaps the most problematic area of this schema <pause dur="0.2"/> is the <pause dur="0.3"/> # is the audience <pause dur="1.4"/> the problem with this diagram <pause dur="0.3"/> is that the audience is right at the bottom <pause dur="0.2"/> and is seen as a kind of passive <pause dur="0.4"/> and # <pause dur="0.4"/> very quiet sort of recipient of the the drama <pause dur="0.4"/> in other words # when you go and see a play <pause dur="0.4"/> # the 
audience basically receives the action <pause dur="0.5"/> and presumably interprets it <pause dur="0.2"/> interprets the action in some way <pause dur="0.3"/> but <pause dur="0.6"/> # one of the problems with this is that it denies the very # active <pause dur="0.6"/> participatory role of the audience in the <pause dur="0.7"/> in the play itself <pause dur="1.2"/> so these are some # rather # major problems with twentieth century # drama <pause dur="0.2"/> if we look at it simply # in this very basic way <pause dur="0.8"/> # what i'd like to propose this morning <pause dur="0.3"/><kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="15"/> and the aim of the lecture <pause dur="0.4"/> is # to try to revise <pause dur="0.3"/> this very # <pause dur="0.7"/> this fairly monotonous scheme <pause dur="0.3"/> # into a slightly more dynamic picture <pause dur="0.4"/> which could <pause dur="0.5"/> look something like this <pause dur="2.6"/> so you have a kind of reciprocal relationship <pause dur="0.2"/> between director and audience <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> the director is at the centre of the play <pause dur="0.6"/> so <pause dur="0.2"/> the director will basically decide # <pause dur="0.2"/> # how the play is actually seen by the audience <pause dur="0.7"/> nevertheless the audience will not receive the drama passively <pause dur="0.2"/> but will participate <pause dur="0.2"/> in the drama <pause dur="0.5"/> okay so # <pause dur="0.5"/> in in if you like the audience is challenged 
to actually respond <pause dur="0.2"/> to what the director does <pause dur="2.1"/> at the sides of the diagram you have for example author and text <pause dur="1.0"/> i'm actually putting author and text at the side of the diagram <pause dur="0.2"/> because <pause dur="0.4"/> this morning i hope to show that # <pause dur="0.2"/> the author <pause dur="0.6"/> and the text <pause dur="0.3"/> of drama <pause dur="0.3"/> is actually secondary <pause dur="0.3"/> to # the director and the audience <pause dur="0.5"/> in other words the the kind of question that we should be asking <pause dur="0.2"/> is not <pause dur="0.5"/> what did Shakespeare intend to say <pause dur="0.2"/> or what did # Beckett intend to say <pause dur="0.4"/> when he wrote this this piece of this piece of drama <pause dur="0.4"/> rather <pause dur="0.2"/> what we ought to be looking at is how do we actually interpret <pause dur="0.3"/> what was actually said <pause dur="0.6"/> i think that's quite a big difference which <pause dur="0.2"/> at first is rather # disturbing <pause dur="0.3"/> but secondly <pause dur="0.2"/> # becomes quite a lot more challenging when we're looking at drama <pause dur="6.4"/> <kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="4"/> so my plan for this morning <pause dur="0.2"/> can basically be divided into four parts <pause dur="0.6"/> in the first part <pause dur="0.2"/> i'd like to look in more detail <pause dur="0.2"/> at the rise of <pause dur="0.2"/> importance 
of the spectator <pause dur="0.2"/> in twentieth century drama <pause dur="0.2"/> with particular reference to French drama of course <pause dur="1.7"/> in the second part <pause dur="0.2"/> i'd like to question the central <pause dur="0.4"/> <trunc>th</trunc> # area of language in <pause dur="0.6"/> # drama <pause dur="0.6"/> and i'd like to show that language means far more than just words <pause dur="0.3"/> there's another kind of dramatic language <pause dur="0.2"/> which actually has far more importance <pause dur="1.0"/> the third area i'd like to talk about <pause dur="0.2"/> is the rising importance of the drama <trunc>o</trunc> of the director in drama during the # <pause dur="0.3"/> the the prewar and post-war period <pause dur="0.6"/> # again i'm going to discuss this with particular reference to French drama <pause dur="0.3"/> although a lot of what i say will be <pause dur="0.2"/> # quite general also <pause dur="0.3"/> and would obviously apply to <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> # plays in other nationalities also <pause dur="0.5"/> finally <pause dur="0.2"/> i'm going to have a a very brief look at the word character <pause dur="0.6"/> # this will be the shortest of my sections <pause dur="0.4"/> # i haven't got a lot to say about it <pause dur="0.2"/> but i want to # try to challenge the way we look at character <pause dur="0.4"/> # sometimes we <trunc>s</trunc> we tend to see characters <pause dur="0.2"/> as # real people <pause dur="0.9"/> # real <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> characters sort of 
behaving in a kind of a very sort of # <pause dur="0.2"/> a very true to life fashion <pause dur="0.3"/> i want to try and question that a little bit <pause dur="0.3"/> and hopefully to give you some ideas for when you study your your subsequent texts <pause dur="2.4"/> one particular <pause dur="0.2"/> one particular dramatist that i shall be referring to throughout the lecture <pause dur="0.2"/> is # Antonin Artaud <pause dur="1.4"/> Artaud # was born in Marseilles in <pause dur="0.2"/> nineteen # sorry in eighteen-ninety-six <pause dur="0.2"/> and # he's <pause dur="0.4"/> quite a marginal figure in twentieth century drama <pause dur="0.2"/> from some standpoints <pause dur="0.4"/> # there are not many books written about him <pause dur="0.4"/> but in fact <pause dur="0.4"/> # one of the books that i'm going to mention quite a lot this morning Le Théâtre et son Double <pause dur="0.6"/> the theatre and its double <pause dur="0.4"/> is actually an attempt to subvert <pause dur="0.2"/> and to revise the rules of drama <pause dur="0.5"/> and so it lends itself very well to the revision <pause dur="0.6"/> # that i'm actually going to be proposing this morning <pause dur="1.7"/> so i will devote probably # about # <pause dur="0.2"/> ten minutes or so <pause dur="0.4"/> to each stage of the lecture <pause dur="0.5"/> # giving you some information that you'll be able to note down <pause dur="0.6"/> # 
finally <pause dur="0.4"/> i shall leave about five minutes before the end # to allow time for any questions which <pause dur="0.2"/> you may have <pause dur="4.1"/> is the structure of the lecture clear to you <pause dur="1.2"/> you're happy about how we're going from here <pause dur="6.6"/> so my first category then <pause dur="0.6"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> by far the longest category that i i'm going to be talking about this morning <pause dur="0.3"/> # is the whole area of spectator and audience <pause dur="2.1"/> the twentieth century theatre <pause dur="0.2"/> could be described as a time when the spectator <pause dur="0.4"/> came into being <pause dur="0.3"/> as an active <pause dur="0.3"/> member <pause dur="0.3"/> of the dramatic production <pause dur="3.5"/> you may have noted # in previous studies that Aristotle <pause dur="0.4"/> in his Poetics <pause dur="0.7"/> # viewed <pause dur="0.4"/> the <pause dur="0.2"/> spectator very much in a kind of passive <pause dur="0.6"/> and fairly # <pause dur="0.3"/> # receptive role in drama <pause dur="1.0"/> of course Aristotle talked about things like <pause dur="0.2"/> catharsis <pause dur="0.8"/> # catharsis is the purging <pause dur="0.2"/> of emotions <pause dur="0.5"/> when you attend a play <pause dur="0.6"/> so that <pause dur="0.2"/> # by experiencing the full emotions of a dramatic text <pause dur="0.3"/> # the spectator <pause dur="0.2"/> will be able to kind of go home refreshed at the end of it <pause dur="0.4"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> # his or her life will be improved as a result <pause dur="0.4"/> so it 
wouldn't be correct to say that # classical drama <pause dur="0.2"/> paid no attention at all to the spectator <pause dur="3.0"/> on the other hand <pause dur="0.5"/> in the twentieth century <pause dur="0.5"/> # almost all reactions to the classical theatre <pause dur="0.3"/> involve in some measure # <pause dur="0.2"/> the primary importance of the spectator <pause dur="0.3"/> in the creative <pause dur="0.3"/> dramatic process <pause dur="3.7"/> in French drama <pause dur="0.6"/> one of the strongest early reactions <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> to # <pause dur="0.2"/> the negative position of the audience came from Antonin Artaud <pause dur="3.8"/> for Artaud <pause dur="0.7"/> the theatre <pause dur="0.4"/> had become much too consumerist in nature <pause dur="1.0"/> and this idea # is # very strong in his writing <pause dur="2.1"/> his most famous work <pause dur="0.3"/> is <pause dur="0.3"/> Le Théâtre et son Double <pause dur="0.6"/> written in nineteen-thirty-eight <pause dur="1.8"/> this is a series of # <pause dur="0.3"/> published essays <pause dur="0.6"/> which criticize the <pause dur="0.5"/> stasis and the status quo <pause dur="0.3"/> of <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> of theatre at the time <pause dur="1.7"/> theatre should be challenged <pause dur="1.0"/> it should shake the audience <pause dur="0.3"/> with a series of imagined feelings <pause dur="1.2"/> disclosing # <pause dur="0.3"/> depths of the unconscious <pause dur="1.3"/> so what Artaud proposed <pause dur="0.2"/> instead of the <pause dur="0.2"/> the existing model which was # Aristotelian in nature <pause dur="0.2"/> what Artaud proposed <pause dur="0.2"/> was what 
he called a a theatre of cruelty <pause dur="3.0"/> cruelty <pause dur="0.2"/> for Artaud <pause dur="0.5"/> could involve # <pause dur="0.6"/> violent or aggressive acts on the stage <pause dur="0.8"/> however <pause dur="0.3"/> it also involved <pause dur="0.2"/> challenging the conventions <pause dur="0.3"/> and the niceties of everyday existence <pause dur="0.9"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> to allow the audience # to experience the thrill <pause dur="0.4"/> of <pause dur="0.3"/> # being alive <pause dur="0.2"/> the the the problem of of existence <pause dur="0.2"/> with all its sort of ups and downs <pause dur="0.2"/> and # this was what # Artaud felt <pause dur="0.2"/> # the spectator should be experiencing <pause dur="0.4"/> in <pause dur="0.5"/> # attending a play <pause dur="2.0"/> if you like # it's the kind of contradictory feelings # <pause dur="0.2"/> # you know the <trunc>f</trunc> feeling that something is sort of both # positive and negative but these things exist at the same time <pause dur="0.2"/> within oneself <pause dur="2.3"/> Artaud wrote an essay called # <pause dur="0.4"/> Le Théâtre et la Peste <pause dur="0.7"/> so # theatre and plague <pause dur="2.4"/> in this essay <pause dur="0.2"/> Artaud drew an analogy <pause dur="0.2"/> and a comparison <pause dur="0.2"/> between theatre and plague <pause dur="2.9"/> both these events <pause dur="0.2"/> Artaud thought <pause dur="0.5"/> should bring about the # <pause dur="0.2"/> the collapse <pause dur="0.2"/> of normal <pause dur="0.3"/> social hierarchy <pause dur="2.4"/> the condition of the plague victim <pause dur="1.0"/> # was reflected <pause dur="0.4"/> in <pause dur="0.3"/> the position of the actor on 
stage <pause dur="0.8"/> but also <pause dur="0.4"/> in the audience who was watching <pause dur="1.9"/> if you like <pause dur="0.2"/> the audience was seen to be very much contaminated <pause dur="0.6"/> and infected <pause dur="0.6"/> by the action on stage <pause dur="0.5"/> not a nice feeling <pause dur="0.4"/> not a pleasant feeling <pause dur="0.5"/> but then again # <pause dur="0.2"/> theatre shouldn't be pleasant or nice <pause dur="0.2"/> theatre should be # challenging <pause dur="0.5"/> and should <trunc>exer</trunc> should sort of expose the horrible side of existence <pause dur="3.6"/> theatre is like an epidemic <pause dur="0.6"/> it sort of <pause dur="0.3"/> makes you # infected and then it's very difficult to become cured afterwards <pause dur="0.7"/> # so the disturbance <pause dur="0.2"/> and the # the problematic emotions that people experience continue long after <pause dur="0.2"/> the play is actually finished <pause dur="2.3"/> in the first quotation <pause dur="0.2"/> # which i'll read for you <pause dur="0.2"/> the # <pause dur="0.2"/> <trunc>th</trunc> this comes from Artaud's book <pause dur="0.2"/> and it actually # <pause dur="0.4"/> # gives voice to this connection between # theatre and plague <pause dur="0.6"/> <reading><distinct lang="fr">il y a dans le théâtre</distinct> <pause dur="0.3"/> <distinct lang="fr">comme dans la peste</distinct> <pause dur="0.4"/> <distinct lang="fr">quelque chose</distinct> <pause dur="0.3"/> <distinct lang="fr">à la fois de victorieux</distinct> <pause dur="0.4"/> <distinct lang="fr">et de vengeur</distinct> <pause dur="0.9"/> <distinct lang="fr">cet incendie spontané que la peste allume où elle passe</distinct> <pause dur="0.3"/> <distinct lang="fr">on sent très bien qu'il n'est autre chose</distinct> <pause dur="0.2"/> 
<distinct lang="fr">qu'une immense</distinct> <pause dur="0.2"/> <distinct lang="fr">liquidation</distinct></reading> <pause dur="1.7"/> so strong language <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> the plague <pause dur="0.3"/> brings about <pause dur="0.2"/> <distinct lang="fr">une liquidation</distinct> <pause dur="0.3"/> a strong sort of liquidation <pause dur="0.2"/> a sort of dissolving <pause dur="0.4"/> of sort of everyday concepts of existence and their replacing <pause dur="0.2"/> with much stronger <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> # sort of views about life <pause dur="3.9"/> so important was the spectator to <trunc>an</trunc> Antonin Artaud <pause dur="0.3"/> that <pause dur="0.4"/> also in Le Théâtre et son Double <pause dur="0.6"/> he suggested <pause dur="0.5"/> an <trunc>i</trunc> an ideal theatre <pause dur="0.4"/> which actually # <pause dur="0.2"/> surrounded the audience <pause dur="0.8"/> # who were seated on <pause dur="0.2"/> pivotal stools <pause dur="0.2"/> so you had the audience actually <pause dur="0.2"/> # raised in the middle of the platform <pause dur="1.5"/> # and you had the action <pause dur="0.4"/> going on around it <pause dur="0.4"/> so if you like it was a complete reverse <pause dur="0.2"/> of the Shakespearean theatre <pause dur="0.4"/> where you had the actors <pause dur="0.2"/> # in the middle of the stage <pause dur="0.5"/> and the <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> # the audience sitting around it <pause dur="0.2"/> it was a complete subversion of that <pause dur="1.5"/> it may seem very impracticable <pause dur="0.4"/> but in fact <pause dur="0.4"/> this # this was actually done # <pause dur="0.2"/> to quite good effect in the Maison de la Culture <pause dur="0.6"/> # the Maison de la Culture is the equivalent of our repertory 
theatre <pause dur="0.5"/> and in Grenoble <pause dur="0.4"/> this experience was actually tried <pause dur="0.7"/> and # <pause dur="0.2"/> in this particular building for a while at least <pause dur="0.2"/> the stage was encircled by the audience <pause dur="3.7"/> so <pause dur="0.2"/> Artaud # seems to go beyond # simple fascination <pause dur="0.2"/> with the show's magic <pause dur="1.1"/> so the theatre has to lose its kind of magical appeal <pause dur="0.2"/> as being a slice of life <pause dur="0.7"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> the theatre needs to look towards <pause dur="0.7"/> its effect <pause dur="1.5"/> as # Artaud said # <pause dur="0.2"/> the aim of theatre was to reforge the links <pause dur="1.0"/> the chain of a rhythm <pause dur="0.2"/> when <trunc>aud</trunc> audiences saw their own real lives in a show <pause dur="1.5"/> so in other words # the audience's aim <pause dur="0.2"/> was to actually see # <pause dur="0.2"/> things that they were experiencing <pause dur="0.2"/> # sort of within the theatre <pause dur="1.1"/> far from being estranged by the action <pause dur="0.5"/> they needed to feel totally sucked in <pause dur="0.2"/> by what was actually going on <pause dur="1.9"/> in short then <pause dur="0.3"/> theatre <pause dur="0.3"/> for Artaud <pause dur="0.2"/> was a disquieting <pause dur="0.5"/> rather than a comforting experience <pause dur="9.9"/> i'd like to move on to my second category now <pause dur="0.2"/> which is all about language <pause dur="3.6"/> in the <pause dur="0.4"/> Western philosophical tradition <pause dur="0.8"/> # which governs most of the way in

absolute <pause dur="0.6"/> but it's kind of relative # a lot depends on how we use it <pause dur="0.2"/> and how we're caught up with the flow of language <pause dur="2.1"/> but Artaud <pause dur="0.2"/> # coming back to our # <pause dur="0.2"/> our friend # <pause dur="0.2"/> who we're going to be talking about a lot this morning # <pause dur="0.2"/> for Artaud language <pause dur="0.3"/> has also been given too much importance in the theatre <pause dur="1.3"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> and there's a need says Artaud <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> to give # emphasis to other things <pause dur="0.2"/> apart from verbal language <pause dur="2.1"/> what kind of things does Artaud suggest <pause dur="0.2"/> in terms of language of the theatre <pause dur="1.2"/> well <pause dur="0.3"/> he wrote some manifestos <pause dur="0.3"/> which actually outline in quite a lot of detail <pause dur="0.2"/> the # <pause dur="0.5"/> the areas which he wants to see developed in the theatre <pause dur="1.2"/> some of these are as follows <pause dur="0.5"/> lighting <pause dur="2.1"/> he wants to see # <pause dur="0.2"/> what he describes as oscillating lights <pause dur="0.3"/> so lights which kind of switch on and off <pause dur="0.4"/> which create special effects <pause dur="1.1"/> musical instruments <pause dur="2.3"/> traditional costumes <pause dur="2.6"/> and accompanied with these <pause dur="0.4"/> # a kind of bareness of the theatre <pause dur="0.8"/> in other words # <pause dur="0.2"/> <trunc>theatri</trunc> theatrical decor <pause dur="0.2"/> shouldn't actually be <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> sort of beautiful 
and elaborate <pause dur="0.2"/> on the other hand it should be simple <pause dur="0.3"/> so you might have sort of whitewashed walls <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> very plain decor # <pause dur="0.2"/> this particular lecture theatre springs to mind as a <pause dur="0.2"/> as an example of what Artaud might have intended <pause dur="0.7"/> okay # <pause dur="0.2"/> # a very sort of <pause dur="0.3"/> <trunc>l</trunc> # a very small amount of of of of decoration <pause dur="2.0"/> gestures <pause dur="1.2"/> gestures were also important <pause dur="0.6"/> it wasn't it didn't just matter what people said <pause dur="0.8"/> but it mattered what people did <pause dur="0.4"/> how did people move on stage <pause dur="0.7"/> and Artaud observed <pause dur="0.2"/> # the Balinese theatre <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> Balinese theatre <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> so # the Balinese theatre <kinesic desc="writes on transparency" iterated="y" dur="3"/> i'll just spell that <pause dur="0.2"/>  # <pause dur="3.0"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> in <pause dur="0.2"/> the nineteen-thirties <pause dur="0.2"/> and discovered that the way they moved <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> # was # quite <pause dur="0.6"/> odd <pause dur="0.3"/> in a way <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> they used quite sort of sharp jerky movements <pause dur="0.3"/> in what they were doing <pause dur="0.3"/> and Artaud <pause dur="0.2"/> thought this might actually be quite a nice thing to # <pause dur="0.2"/> integrate into the theatre <pause dur="3.2"/> and similarly at the same time # <pause dur="0.3"/> there's the avoidance of # <pause dur="0.2"/> of articulated language <pause dur="0.5"/> so all 
these special effects <pause dur="0.2"/> have an equal place in theatre <pause dur="0.2"/> as well <pause dur="2.1"/> Artaud's prescriptions # <pause dur="0.2"/> gave rise to what might be described as total theatre <pause dur="3.7"/> total theatre means a theatre which actually <pause dur="0.2"/> incorporates <pause dur="0.4"/> sort of all different <pause dur="0.2"/> aspects of the production <pause dur="0.7"/> so <pause dur="0.2"/> # the kind of the primacy of language <pause dur="0.2"/> which is present maybe in texts like # <pause dur="0.2"/> Molière's plays or Racine's plays <pause dur="0.3"/> which are based around pretty much around language really <pause dur="0.4"/> although action is important too <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> all those things become important <pause dur="0.2"/> # when we're dealing with a twentieth century play <pause dur="3.1"/> one example in British # culture <pause dur="0.2"/> which is very interesting <pause dur="0.2"/> is # <pause dur="0.4"/> Peter Shaffer's play <pause dur="0.2"/> the The Royal Hunt of the Sun <pause dur="0.8"/> some of you may know it <pause dur="0.2"/> which deals with the # <pause dur="0.5"/> conquistadors # <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="1.2"/> # and their relationship to the Incan civilization <pause dur="0.6"/> now Peter Shaffer <pause dur="0.2"/> as Artaud <pause dur="0.6"/> # uses the idea of total theatre <pause dur="0.4"/> so what you get <pause dur="0.2"/> is a kind of amalgam <pause dur="0.4"/> of all different kinds of prescriptions <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> you get sort of musical instruments <pause dur="0.8"/> special effects <pause dur="0.2"/> very bare 
stage <pause dur="1.2"/> there is language of course <pause dur="0.9"/> but <pause dur="0.2"/> there's a lot of gesture <pause dur="0.8"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> i think if you watched a <pause dur="0.2"/> if you watched # <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> a sort of modern production of The Royal Hunt of the Sun <pause dur="0.2"/> i think you might actually see that # some of the prescriptions <pause dur="0.2"/> are pretty similar <pause dur="0.3"/> to what Artaud was saying in <pause dur="0.2"/> Le Théâtre et son Double <pause dur="1.7"/> it's important to bear in mind <pause dur="0.2"/> when we're talking about language <pause dur="0.4"/> it's important to bear in mind that <pause dur="0.2"/> not all <pause dur="0.3"/> directors <pause dur="0.3"/> and not all playwrights <pause dur="0.2"/> dealt with language in the same way <pause dur="0.4"/> i think Artaud is <pause dur="0.3"/> suggesting a kind of escape from <pause dur="0.5"/> the <pause dur="0.2"/> kind of control of language if you like <pause dur="0.6"/> however <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> other people do things quite differently <pause dur="0.2"/> so Ionesco <pause dur="0.4"/> who you're going to be studying later in the course <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> seems to break with # language <pause dur="0.6"/> # he uses language <pause dur="0.2"/> in a kind of absurd and # <pause dur="0.3"/> # mismatched way <pause dur="0.4"/> so <pause dur="0.2"/> # characters do communicate with each other <pause dur="0.2"/> through language <pause dur="0.5"/> but <pause dur="0.2"/> # in ways which surprise us <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> through their kind of very their very absurdity <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="1.7"/> Sartre who you'll also be studying <pause dur="0.2"/> 
# <pause dur="0.3"/> i think # Sartre <pause dur="0.2"/> very much believes in the # in the importance of language <pause dur="0.4"/> but Sartre will # appropriate language for <pause dur="0.2"/> political effects <pause dur="0.4"/> as we know from our <pause dur="0.2"/> # immediate experience with Sartre <pause dur="0.2"/> he's a political dramatist as much as anything <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> conveying political messages <pause dur="0.3"/> therefore language needs to be important <pause dur="0.2"/> language is quite central <pause dur="0.5"/> so it wouldn't be correct to say that Artaud's # <pause dur="0.2"/> prescriptions for language <pause dur="0.2"/> are adopted by all the playwrights that you're actually going to be studying <pause dur="0.4"/> however <pause dur="0.2"/> it does cast a new light on what's happening in the <pause dur="0.2"/> in the theatre <pause dur="0.4"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> # it places the # the theatre into # <pause dur="0.4"/> into into a very different perspective <pause dur="3.0"/> one of the criticisms <pause dur="0.2"/> i'll just deal with this before moving on <pause dur="0.2"/> one of the criticisms with # Artaud's idea that <pause dur="0.4"/> # verbal language <pause dur="0.2"/> that you could get away with verbal language <pause dur="0.9"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> is that # <pause dur="0.4"/> verbal language is always there in the background <pause dur="0.6"/> in a sense it's <trunc>actu</trunc> it's actually impossible to escape <trunc>u</trunc> from using language 
altogether <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> i think people have tried it in the theatre <pause dur="0.2"/> but it's almost impossible to get away with that kind of # <pause dur="0.2"/> that kind of # <pause dur="0.3"/> thing <pause dur="0.2"/> so what's happening then really <pause dur="0.3"/> is that Artaud is proposing something <pause dur="0.4"/> here <pause dur="0.2"/> which can never be achieved entirely <pause dur="0.5"/> and so <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> in almost all plays <pause dur="0.3"/> even plays <pause dur="0.2"/> which # <pause dur="0.2"/> you could describe as belonging to the Theatre of the Absurd <pause dur="0.2"/> language is <pause dur="0.2"/> is always there in the background it doesn't always make sense <pause dur="0.5"/> but it is basically a problem <pause dur="1.7"/> before we move on # <pause dur="0.2"/> i'd like to <pause dur="0.2"/> make a transition by referring to the second quotation <pause dur="0.6"/> which <pause dur="0.2"/> i think # clarifies what Artaud's # views are about non-verbal language <pause dur="1.8"/> <reading><distinct lang="fr">ce langage objectif</distinct></reading> <pause dur="0.3"/> so he described # <pause dur="0.2"/> setting scenes # <pause dur="0.2"/> colours <pause dur="0.3"/> costumes and things as <distinct lang="fr">langage objectif</distinct> <pause dur="0.2"/> it's a kind of objective rather than subjective language <pause dur="0.3"/> <reading><distinct lang="fr">ce langage objectif</distinct> <pause dur="0.2"/> <distinct lang="fr">rend enfin</distinct> <pause dur="0.3"/> <distinct lang="fr">l'assujettissement</distinct></reading> <pause dur="0.5"/> the subordination <pause dur="0.3"/> okay <pause dur="0.2"/> <reading><distinct lang="fr">l'assujettissement</distinct> <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> <distinct lang="fr">intellectuel au langage</distinct> <pause dur="0.8"/> <distinct lang="fr">en donnant le sens d'une intellectualité nouvelle</distinct> <pause dur="0.4"/>

Craig <pause dur="6.6"/> <kinesic desc="writes on transparency" iterated="y" dur="2"/> wrote a prophetic <pause dur="0.2"/> # a prophetic statement in nineteen-eleven <pause dur="0.7"/> which said that <reading>the director <pause dur="0.6"/> would eventually become the complete <pause dur="0.6"/> creative artist of the theatre <pause dur="3.1"/> bringing together <pause dur="0.2"/> and mastering <pause dur="0.3"/> all the different expressive idioms of the stage</reading> <pause dur="3.5"/> that was a very early that was a very early comment <pause dur="0.2"/> okay nineteen-eleven <pause dur="0.2"/> the director would be the complete creative artist <pause dur="0.4"/> of the future <pause dur="1.8"/> bringing together and mastering <pause dur="0.9"/> all the different expressive idioms <pause dur="0.6"/> of the stage <pause dur="4.8"/> this is one kind of statement which shows us <pause dur="0.2"/> how important <pause dur="0.2"/> the director is going to become <pause dur="0.3"/> in twentieth century theatre <pause dur="0.3"/> but there were other statements which occurred later on <pause dur="0.4"/> which were also important <pause dur="0.2"/> for example Roland Barthes <pause dur="0.8"/> some of you may have heard of Roland Barthes <pause dur="3.7"/> <kinesic desc="writes on transparency" iterated="y" dur="3"/> Roland Barthes # <pause dur="0.4"/> declared # <pause dur="0.2"/> in # <pause dur="0.9"/> # in the twentieth century that # <pause dur="0.3"/> there was <pause dur="0.5"/> what he called a death of the author <pause dur="1.9"/> 
okay so # <pause dur="0.2"/> the death of the author <pause dur="0.2"/> means that the author of a text <pause dur="0.2"/> is not sacrosanct <pause dur="2.3"/> faithfulness to the original <pause dur="0.7"/> is not the primary concern therefore <pause dur="0.5"/> when adapting <pause dur="0.2"/> # works <pause dur="1.2"/> from the past <pause dur="0.3"/> so this is where for example in the Royal Shakespeare Company <pause dur="0.2"/> some modern productions have actually attracted a lot of criticism <pause dur="0.2"/> so for example <pause dur="0.2"/> you get # <pause dur="0.3"/> # Shylock in The Merchant of Venice perhaps riding around on a motorbike <pause dur="0.5"/> or something like that <pause dur="0.3"/> and people say well you know <pause dur="0.2"/> # how dare they do that you know <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> that that's this is totally unfaithful to the Shakespearean original <pause dur="0.5"/> but some people <pause dur="0.2"/> in twentieth century drama will say well that doesn't matter <pause dur="0.2"/> because it's the director's interpretation <pause dur="0.3"/> that actually matters <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> so you find often that # <pause dur="0.2"/> that modern <pause dur="0.2"/> productions of Shakespeare or Racine or Molière <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> are pretty much criticized <pause dur="0.2"/> for being # <pause dur="0.2"/> anachronistic <pause dur="1.0"/> # in other words # applying sort of modern principles <pause dur="0.2"/> # to old texts <pause dur="0.2"/> when those concepts were not actually 
available <pause dur="4.5"/> the climate of Paris at the time is also very important <pause dur="1.0"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> directors in particular in Paris <pause dur="0.2"/> were responsible for decentralizing the theatre <pause dur="1.5"/> for moving theatre away from state control <pause dur="0.4"/> towards # <pause dur="0.2"/> private <pause dur="0.3"/> control <pause dur="0.7"/> a little bit like our repertory theatre theatres in this country <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> they receive grants but what they do is very much up to them <pause dur="1.7"/> in Paris a lot of directors saw the theatre <pause dur="0.2"/> almost as a kind of basic human right really <pause dur="1.1"/> # it wasn't just pleasure but everybody had the right to go to the theatre <pause dur="0.5"/> # theatre shouldn't be expensive and prohibitive to the audience <pause dur="0.2"/> but should actually encourage people to attend <pause dur="0.6"/> far from being a luxury <pause dur="0.3"/> the <trunc>theatri</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> the theatre was actually seen as being pretty much central to human existence at the time <pause dur="2.4"/> let's trace briefly some of the important players # in the development of # <pause dur="0.3"/> the director throughout the twentieth century <pause dur="3.2"/> one particular figure who you will actually # see <pause dur="0.2"/> now and again <pause dur="0.2"/> is somebody called Jacques Copeau <pause dur="11.1"/><kinesic desc="writes on transparency" iterated="y" dur="5"/>

people <pause dur="0.2"/> in in real life <pause dur="5.3"/> so # this is described as verisimilitude <pause dur="0.7"/> verisimilitude <pause dur="0.8"/> # or <distinct lang="fr">vraisemblance</distinct> <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> in the French classical theatre <pause dur="3.2"/> <kinesic desc="writes on transparency" iterated="y" dur="1"/> it would help if my pen worked <pause dur="1.5"/> <event desc="changes pen" iterated="n"/><kinesic desc="writes on transparency" iterated="y" dur="5"/> <distinct lang="fr">vraisemblance</distinct> <pause dur="2.0"/> that <trunc>w</trunc> that you could <trunc>y</trunc> <pause dur="0.6"/> that was a joke actually so you were supposed to laugh then <pause dur="1.1"/><vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" n="ss" dur="1"/> okay <pause dur="0.2"/> not a good actor i'm afraid <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> okay <pause dur="0.2"/> so # <distinct lang="fr">vraisemblance</distinct> # <pause dur="0.2"/> # the sort of verisimilitude <pause dur="1.2"/> however <pause dur="0.3"/> # not # <pause dur="0.3"/> okay i mean <pause dur="0.2"/> so <trunc>thi</trunc> this is the kind of classical view of character <pause dur="0.3"/> but i think it's important to recognize when we're studying Ionesco # Beckett and and <pause dur="0.2"/> and possibly also Sartre <pause dur="0.3"/> although i think Sartre perhaps to a lesser extent <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> character <pause dur="0.4"/> the the word character has been pronounced dead <pause dur="0.7"/> by many writers <pause dur="4.0"/> for example <pause dur="0.2"/> a lot of writers # see characters basically as language <pause dur="1.0"/> rather than <pause dur="0.2"/> as # real flesh and blood individuals <pause dur="0.4"/> like ourselves <pause dur="1.4"/> 
what what are characters <pause dur="0.3"/> well basically characters <pause dur="0.2"/> are sort of words on a page <pause dur="0.4"/> perhaps <pause dur="0.4"/> this is one theory of characters <pause dur="0.6"/> i think it's a contentious theory and i think <pause dur="0.2"/> you know we may decide that characters are real characters and they do have real emotions <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> so i'm not particularly pressurizing you to think one way or the other <pause dur="0.2"/> i think the the debate is quite interesting <pause dur="4.2"/> but i think we have to recognize that <pause dur="0.2"/> when we're looking at some plays in the twentieth century <pause dur="0.3"/> # characters are not fully rounded individuals <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> but rather <pause dur="0.2"/> they consist of fragments of language <pause dur="7.2"/> this is again # what Artaud said <pause dur="0.6"/> # in his # Le Théâtre et son Double <pause dur="0.9"/> the fact that # basically # <pause dur="0.2"/> characters <pause dur="0.6"/> # were not really # <pause dur="0.4"/> sort of flesh and blood characters <pause dur="0.6"/> but they they they exterted a kind of power <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> but i think <pause dur="0.2"/> # Artaud wanted to get rid of the psychology <pause dur="0.6"/> which <pause dur="0.2"/> # lay behind the character <pause dur="1.5"/> and he wasn't very keen on the way in which Shakespeare <pause dur="0.4"/> Shakespeare's 
characters <pause dur="0.2"/> # analysed themselves <pause dur="1.2"/> so when Shakespearean characters are facing a sort of predicament of one sort or another <pause dur="0.2"/> # they will tend to sort of <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> go into a kind of process of self-analysis <pause dur="0.2"/> whereby they they explore the whole area of <pause dur="0.2"/> of their of their conscious you know <pause dur="0.2"/> # to be or not to be <pause dur="0.5"/> # it's that kind of thing you know <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> you know <pause dur="0.2"/> but i think Artaud said that this was kind of unnecessary in the theatre <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> we don't want this kind of <pause dur="0.2"/> sort of # thought and this kind of complexity <pause dur="0.2"/> let's just get back down to actions again <pause dur="0.9"/> let's let's <pause dur="0.2"/> let's <pause dur="0.2"/> let's judge characters not so much in terms of what they think <pause dur="0.7"/> as what they do <pause dur="1.0"/> in fact i think that's that's a very very big distinction there <pause dur="2.3"/> something <pause dur="0.2"/> something of this kind <pause dur="0.2"/> <trunc>o</trunc> occurs in <pause dur="0.2"/> what we might call the Theatre of of the Absurd <pause dur="1.3"/> # to which # often Ionesco <pause dur="0.4"/> has been attributed <pause dur="0.6"/> although i don't particularly think that the <pause dur="0.3"/> that the <pause dur="0.2"/> the term Theatre of the Absurd is always a very helpful one <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> Theatre of the Absurd <pause dur="0.2"/> 
being # <pause dur="0.2"/> a recognition <pause dur="0.3"/> that # life has lost all its meaning <pause dur="1.3"/> # <pause dur="1.9"/> i i i think i experienced this feeling very well when i was <pause dur="0.2"/> when i was writing up my PhD thesis <pause dur="0.9"/> # i felt that sort of life <pause dur="0.2"/> life life had lost all its meaning but <pause dur="0.2"/> # and # <pause dur="0.2"/> sometimes when we're writing assignments we think you know # what's the point of all this # so what you do is to get the whisky bottle out and have another drink don't you <pause dur="0.8"/> <vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" n="ss" dur="1"/> okay <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> well except i don't like whisky so i <pause dur="0.2"/> i i tend to sort of i have other things but <pause dur="0.2"/> i think # <pause dur="0.2"/> # <vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" n="ss" dur="2"/> but i think i think the # <pause dur="0.3"/> i i i think the thing i think the Theatre of the Absurd is well how can we how can we go on from this point and life seems to be so ridiculous doesn't it <pause dur="0.4"/> and # so theatre for the <trunc>th</trunc> for the for the absurdist <pause dur="0.2"/> <trunc>f</trunc> for the absurdist writers like Ionesco <pause dur="0.2"/> theatre # <pause dur="0.2"/> is a kind of <pause dur="0.2"/> antitheatre <pause dur="1.7"/> characters behave in totally ridiculous ways <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> at 
the beginning of La Cantatrice Chauve <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> which i think is translated <pause dur="0.2"/> # as The Bald Primadonna <pause dur="0.7"/> some of you may know of by by Ionesco at the beginning of that play <pause dur="0.2"/> you have # for example # <pause dur="0.2"/> two characters Mr and Mrs Smith <pause dur="0.8"/> who are sort of discussing things <pause dur="0.2"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> one of them says right you know it's kind of <pause dur="0.4"/> gives the time <trunc>i</trunc> <trunc>s</trunc> it says like it's ten o'clock in the morning <pause dur="0.5"/> and of course i mean what's the point of saying it because the clock's sort of standing there right in front of you <pause dur="0.2"/> it's the kind of absurd exchange <pause dur="0.2"/> and Ionesco took the the dialogue for La Cantatrice Chauve <pause dur="0.2"/> # from an English textbook <pause dur="0.7"/> when he was learning English <pause dur="0.5"/> he's saying well you know this is a totally sort of absurd textbook <pause dur="0.5"/> how could anybody learn English from this i know i'll write a play about it <pause dur="0.7"/> which is <trunc>act</trunc> <trunc>whi</trunc> <trunc>whi</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> which # was <trunc>w</trunc> was a complete flop actually when it first came out <pause dur="0.3"/> but <pause dur="0.2"/> eventually # became much more popular Les Chaises <pause dur="0.2"/> The Chairs is another one <pause dur="0.2"/> where chairs are sort 
of progressively sort of moving towards the end of the stage <pause dur="0.4"/> until the characters fall off the stage <pause dur="0.6"/> wonderful <pause dur="0.4"/> but but these are not really <pause dur="0.7"/> of course this is this really what happens it might be it might be what happens in some lectures i'm slightly out of touch with # <pause dur="0.2"/> with sort of university # lectures at the moment so <pause dur="0.2"/> # this may well be what happens <pause dur="0.2"/> you know people fall off chairs and all sorts of things but <pause dur="0.2"/> # i think basically # <pause dur="0.2"/> # this is pretty absurd stuff isn't it really <pause dur="1.4"/> # <pause dur="2.0"/> another example <pause dur="0.2"/> of Samuel Beckett in a play <pause dur="0.2"/> # Samuel Beckett in a play called # La Dernière Bande which is translated fetchingly as Krapp's Last Tape <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> so # La Dernière Bande <pause dur="0.2"/> # where the character # basically is suffering from # constipation because he's eaten too many bananas <pause dur="0.8"/> <vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" n="ss" dur="1"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> so # what's this got to do with real life well it's it's just a a kind of escape isn't it it's the characters <pause dur="0.8"/> i mean they're they're we might not 
recognize very much of ourselves in characters on the other hand <pause dur="0.3"/> we what we do what we do feel is that <pause dur="0.2"/> the <trunc>charac</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> # the characters do <pause dur="0.4"/> communicate in some way <pause dur="0.4"/> and language <pause dur="0.6"/> is not the way perhaps that we would use language <pause dur="0.4"/> but on the other hand <pause dur="0.2"/> it reveals something about our sort of inner selves doesn't it <pause dur="1.1"/> i would say perhaps just as a kind of # <pause dur="0.2"/> as as a kind of final thing on character <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> we have to look also at the actor <pause dur="0.6"/> or the actress <pause dur="0.2"/> that lies behind the mask <pause dur="2.5"/> because the actor <pause dur="0.4"/> is not particularly subservient to the character now <pause dur="0.7"/> in other words # <pause dur="0.3"/> i mean # <pause dur="0.4"/> one of the one of the big preoccupations of actors in the past has been to say well <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> am i actually playing this part faithfully to the original <pause dur="0.2"/> <trunc>i</trunc> is <trunc>i</trunc> is my is my portrayal of Shylock or Portia in The Merchant of Venice <pause dur="0.2"/> is that how Shakespeare would have wanted me to # <pause dur="0.2"/> to portray it <pause dur="0.2"/> but the answer is well <pause dur="0.2"/> does it really matter <pause dur="0.7"/> i mean does it matter if # <pause dur="0.2"/> you know how we actually perform a a role <pause dur="0.4"/> lies # <pause dur="0.2"/> very 
faithfully # against the original i mean we can do it in different ways # somebody who actually # <pause dur="0.3"/> wrote a lot on # <pause dur="0.3"/> on on on actors and <pause dur="0.2"/> the theories of acting <pause dur="0.2"/> was somebody called Jean-Louis Barrault <pause dur="2.7"/> Jean-Louis Barrault <pause dur="9.4"/> <kinesic desc="writes on transparency" iterated="y" dur="5"/> and Jean Jean-Louis Barrault did all sorts of interesting things i mean he <trunc>s</trunc> he suggested for example that actors <pause dur="0.6"/> and actresses <pause dur="0.3"/> should # cultivate the art of <pause dur="0.2"/> double breathing <pause dur="0.9"/> so in other words # <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> the characters have to breathe twice <pause dur="1.3"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> once for # <pause dur="0.6"/> once for themselves and once for the character <pause dur="2.3"/> that's a really strange kind of concept to grasp isn't it <pause dur="0.2"/> the idea of double breathing <pause dur="0.3"/> i mean in the smog of sort of central Birmingham <pause dur="0.2"/> i find it i find it difficult to breathe once never mind twice really <pause dur="0.4"/> but i think you know <pause dur="0.2"/> # this kind of whole concept of sort of breathing is <trunc>i</trunc> is pretty <pause dur="0.4"/> pretty <pause dur="0.4"/> pretty central to what Barrault is doing # <pause dur="0.5"/> so <pause dur="0.8"/> language is a kind of bodily movement <pause dur="1.0"/> <trunc>w</trunc> # so characters 
have to use their bodies in certain ways and use their gestures <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> Barrault spoke of an alchemy <pause dur="1.4"/> so alchemy extracting gold from <pause dur="0.3"/> from solid material <pause dur="0.2"/> so <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> Barrault spoke about an alchemy of the theatre <pause dur="1.0"/> # in which the actor or the actress was was in central position <pause dur="2.9"/> Artaud # <pause dur="0.2"/> used to # <pause dur="0.4"/> exploit his his actors in <pause dur="0.3"/> quite strange ways i mean he used to make them scream at the top of their voices <pause dur="0.9"/> and they used to sort of practise sort of shouting <pause dur="1.0"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> and # <pause dur="0.2"/> it all sounded rather sort of strange and and and problematic really <pause dur="0.2"/> # but noises screams and shouts strange sort of # things # these are are obviously very central to to the kind of thing that Barrault is is coming out with <pause dur="1.4"/> i'd like to conclude now <pause dur="5.0"/><kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="4"/> by hoping that # <pause dur="0.2"/> as a result of the things that i've spoken about this morning <pause dur="0.2"/> the the very # unilinear <pause dur="0.3"/> # structure which i presented with you with at the beginning of the lecture <pause dur="0.2"/> namely author text characters <pause dur="0.2"/> language and audience # <pause dur="0.2"/> i hope you can see that # this is # an ideal <pause dur="0.3"/> but 
rather inaccurate picture <pause dur="0.2"/> of what actually goes on in in twentieth century drama <pause dur="0.4"/> Antonin Artaud <pause dur="0.2"/> was a <pause dur="0.3"/> <trunc>w</trunc> was a watershed in this development <pause dur="0.7"/> he's totally disregarded by some critics <pause dur="0.2"/> i think in a book called Modern French Drama by somebody called David Bradby <pause dur="0.5"/> who i have recommended in your # <pause dur="0.2"/> in your your documentation packs <pause dur="0.2"/> i think Artaud gets <pause dur="0.3"/> maybe a couple of pages mention <pause dur="0.5"/> in a whole book about French drama <pause dur="0.8"/> i think that's perhaps # underestimating <pause dur="0.2"/> Artaud's importance <pause dur="0.2"/> i think Artaud's Théâtre et son Double is central <pause dur="0.3"/> to the <trunc>rev</trunc> to the reversal <pause dur="0.4"/> of this particular paradigm which we're actually actually looking at <pause dur="0.4"/> and i think it does sort of repay quite <trunc>c</trunc> quite careful attention <pause dur="4.3"/> but some people considered that Artaud was rather mad <pause dur="0.2"/> and this particular picture will demonstrate his rather <pause dur="0.2"/> # strange appearance certainly <pause dur="6.0"/> <kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="3"/> so # Artaud near the end of his life <pause dur="0.3"/> Paris nineteen-forty-eight <pause dur="0.3"/> # a rather sort of 
peculiar <pause dur="0.2"/> twisted sort of gnarled character <pause dur="0.4"/> he at this by this stage he'd had many electroshock treatments <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> because of his sort of <trunc>in</trunc> his supposed insanity <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> # so he had # he had E-C-T treatment for a number of years and he was he was sort of sent to asylum in a place called Rodez <pause dur="0.4"/> # rather unfortunately <pause dur="0.3"/> # had he not been he might have come up with some more interesting <pause dur="0.3"/> things <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="3.7"/> <kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="5"/> characters # <pause dur="0.3"/> these ones <pause dur="2.6"/> <trunc>the</trunc> these characters come from # a play by Jean Genet called # <pause dur="0.3"/> # Les Paravents <pause dur="1.4"/> okay <pause dur="0.3"/> the only reason i'm showing you these is to show how characters <pause dur="0.4"/> are actually sort of made into almost kind of grotesque <pause dur="0.2"/> sort of high comic figures <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> through <pause dur="0.5"/> what they wear <pause dur="0.3"/> so you can see <distinct lang="fr">le gendarme</distinct> the policeman <pause dur="0.7"/> okay # sort of you know puffed out in all his sort of regalia <pause dur="0.2"/> # and # basically i mean it's all # it's all very 
sort of high high drama sort of totally contrived really <pause dur="4.5"/> <kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="6"/> and the the the last one that i'd like to show you is is basically this one it's # <pause dur="0.2"/> it's a picture from # <pause dur="0.7"/> a play by # Paul Claudel called Le Soulier de Satin <pause dur="0.5"/> # Paul Claudel worked in quite close <trunc>col</trunc> # collaboration with Jean-Louis Barrault <pause dur="0.4"/> so it actually shows you you know the the dynamism <pause dur="0.5"/> which # <pause dur="0.2"/> # actresses are # <pause dur="0.2"/> # sort of captured sort of through through Barrault's training so again high drama <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> and # <pause dur="0.2"/> <trunc>r</trunc> revises to an extent the kind of expectations that we have <pause dur="1.6"/> i'm looking forward to speaking to you next week # <pause dur="0.3"/> at which time i shall <trunc>f</trunc> i shall focus <pause dur="0.2"/> probably more more particularly on Beckett and Sartre <pause dur="0.2"/> i have tried to pack quite a lot into that lecture <pause dur="0.4"/> i hope you don't mind <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> and # <pause dur="1.2"/> possibly next week i'll leave a little bit more time for questions so we can deal with anything that might have come up in these <pause dur="0.2"/> in these lectures <pause dur="0.2"/> thank you very much for your attention
