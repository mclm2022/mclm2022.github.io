<u who="nm0001"> after this # little performance <pause dur="1.0"/> something very historic happened today <pause dur="0.4"/> i went down to Oxford University <pause dur="0.6"/> to examine as the external examiner <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> a D-Phil <pause dur="0.7"/> on Black British writing from Equiano to <pause dur="0.6"/> # <vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.3"/> Linton Kwesi Johnson <pause dur="0.9"/> and this was <trunc>ver</trunc> i felt very historic <pause dur="0.2"/> because # <pause dur="1.2"/> it was a student of mine an ex-student of mine who was in your class the M-A class <gap reason="name" extent="2 words"/> <pause dur="0.9"/> and # there we were at Oxford University the centre of <pause dur="0.9"/> of # scholarship <pause dur="0.2"/> <vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.7"/> # a man of colour or as i prefer to call myself a Paki <pause dur="0.5"/> # <vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" dur="1"/> examining <pause dur="0.4"/> another man of colour whom we <pause dur="0.3"/> jocularly call a Paki <pause dur="0.6"/> on a Paki subject <pause dur="0.9"/> and i really felt <pause dur="0.2"/> terribly historic yes <pause dur="0.4"/> and it was such a brilliant dissertation <pause dur="0.8"/> that # <pause dur="0.2"/> it <trunc>wa</trunc> it was # passed <pause dur="0.3"/> without qualification <pause dur="0.7"/> so <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> was my friend i dragged him right away he's got a gown on and you know in Oxford to be examined <pause dur="0.4"/> the external examiner can dress up <pause dur="0.4"/> # turn up like a slob which 
was what i did <pause dur="0.6"/> # but the internal examiner has to wear <pause dur="0.7"/> a gown <pause dur="0.5"/> a bow tie <pause dur="0.4"/><kinesic desc="moves hands round head demonstrating mortar board" iterated="n"/> the # <pause dur="0.5"/> the # <pause dur="0.2"/> you know <pause dur="0.5"/> the fly swatter </u><u who="sm0002" trans="overlap"> a mortar board </u><pause dur="0.2"/> <u who="nm0001" trans="pause"> <vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/> mortar board <pause dur="0.7"/> so as soon as his examination was finished we had a quick glass of wine <pause dur="1.3"/> and # another one <pause dur="0.6"/> and got on a train <pause dur="0.4"/> he's in my office now and some other friends of mine are going to come and meet him and we're going to take him out for a good drink tonight <pause dur="0.6"/> and the legendary curry so you're more than welcome to come along <pause dur="1.0"/> now what i will do now is # <vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.7"/> just say a few things about <pause dur="0.3"/> why i write <pause dur="0.2"/> about slavery <pause dur="0.6"/> by saying something about Guyana <pause dur="1.9"/> Guyana is a <vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.8"/> in many ways <pause dur="0.7"/> a marginal country <pause dur="1.2"/> marginal in the sense or peripheral peripheral <pause dur="0.5"/> in that it's one of the most <pause dur="0.3"/> southernly <pause dur="0.6"/> of <pause dur="1.5"/> British colonies <pause dur="1.4"/> it's seven-and-a-half-thousand miles away <pause dur="1.0"/> # <pause dur="1.1"/> it's it's and if and London was the centre of the empire <pause dur="0.5"/> or of the universe 
which it was <pause dur="0.5"/> Guyana was seriously at the periphery <pause dur="0.5"/> of it <pause dur="0.5"/> being seven-and-a-half-thousand miles away <pause dur="0.8"/> maybe a thousand-and-a-half miles south of <pause dur="0.2"/> Jamaica <pause dur="1.1"/><vocal desc="cough" iterated="n"/> it's marginal <pause dur="0.3"/> in another sense <pause dur="0.4"/> in that we do actually physically live <pause dur="0.4"/> most of us in the margins <pause dur="0.7"/> of the sea <pause dur="0.2"/> and the land most of us live in a very narrow strip <pause dur="0.6"/> of coastal land sometimes <pause dur="0.3"/> a mile deep sometimes seven or eight miles deep <pause dur="0.7"/> and we <trunc>ha</trunc> we we we we live in this <pause dur="0.3"/> very thin strip of land <pause dur="0.5"/> # behind us is the <pause dur="0.4"/> the great Amazonian jungle <pause dur="0.2"/> and in front of us is the <pause dur="0.6"/> stormy Atlantic <pause dur="1.0"/> and it's a very <pause dur="0.2"/> precarious existence because <pause dur="0.7"/> the # <pause dur="0.3"/> because the <pause dur="0.5"/> the <pause dur="0.2"/> Atlantic is not <pause dur="0.2"/> the blue Caribbean sea <pause dur="0.5"/> it is a <pause dur="0.3"/> dirty brown muddy <pause dur="0.4"/> brown tea brown horrible <pause dur="0.7"/> # coastal water <pause dur="0.6"/> # threatening to look at <pause dur="0.5"/> # largely because of the <pause dur="0.5"/> the mud washed down by the <pause dur="0.2"/> by the <pause dur="0.5"/> in the Amazon and the <pause dur="0.7"/> the # <pause dur="0.2"/> the great Amazonian <pause dur="0.3"/> flow towards the sea that takes all the mud with it <pause dur="0.3"/> so for <pause dur="0.2"/> twenty thirty miles outside of Guyana's <pause dur="0.4"/> Guyana's coastline is is muddy water <pause dur="0.5"/> yeah <pause dur="0.2"/> 
shark infested very dangerous dangerous currents <pause dur="0.9"/> and <trunc>a</trunc> and behind is as i said is the Amazonian jungle still pristine in Guyana <pause dur="0.6"/> which is not a place # it's not like an English garden <pause dur="0.2"/> obviously it's # <pause dur="0.3"/> it's a place of dread and darkness <pause dur="0.6"/> it's a place you we don't venture into <pause dur="0.8"/> it's a kind of space of # <pause dur="0.4"/> it's a kind of epistemological space almost it's it's the area of darkness <pause dur="0.9"/> you don't go walking in a jungle <pause dur="0.3"/> you know <pause dur="1.0"/><vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" n="ss" dur="1"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> and of course <pause dur="0.5"/> the waters from the from the Amazonian jungle wash down into the sea <pause dur="0.8"/> and then you have the <pause dur="0.4"/> the waters of the Amazon washing up <pause dur="0.5"/> we're we're we're # <pause dur="0.4"/> we live a perilous existence in in the sense that # <pause dur="1.1"/> Guyana is # below sea level <pause dur="1.5"/> and <pause dur="0.6"/> therefore subject to <pause dur="0.5"/> constant flooding <pause dur="1.6"/> and i can't swim <pause dur="0.7"/> so it becomes even more perilous you know <pause dur="1.0"/> # it's a marginal place also in the sense that <pause dur="0.4"/> you can't really be authoritarian in Guyana <pause dur="1.5"/><vocal desc="sigh" iterated="n"/> you see <pause dur="0.3"/> in the rainy season <pause dur="1.5"/> when it rains and it rains <pause dur="0.4"/> we have a rainforest <pause dur="0.4"/> and you know what a rainforest is <pause dur="0.5"/> 
when it rains and it rains the valleys get flooded <pause dur="0.9"/> the valleys get flooded <pause dur="0.8"/> the <trunc>v</trunc> the valleys get flooded up to fifty sixty feet of water <pause dur="0.8"/> the trees <pause dur="0.4"/> get flooded up to their necks <pause dur="0.8"/> up to the leaves <pause dur="1.1"/> the animals in certain parts of Guyana <pause dur="0.3"/><vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/><pause dur="1.1"/> in the rainy season <pause dur="0.7"/> the animals <pause dur="1.7"/> cougars and the monkeys <pause dur="0.3"/> migrate <pause dur="0.9"/> to dry land <pause dur="0.7"/> what was dry land becomes <pause dur="0.7"/> almost a seascape <pause dur="1.0"/> and <pause dur="1.1"/> the animals migrate <pause dur="1.0"/> and fish <pause dur="1.3"/> all kinds of sea creatures great otters <pause dur="1.2"/> come in where the animals <pause dur="0.3"/> used to walk <pause dur="0.7"/> so what used to be land suddenly becomes seascape <pause dur="0.9"/> and of course when the rain ends <pause dur="1.0"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> the fish bugger off to wherever fish go to <pause dur="0.8"/> and the animals come back <pause dur="0.5"/> so basically the land is inherently unstable <pause dur="0.6"/> you can't have authority you can't have authoritarian fascist structures in Guyana <pause dur="0.4"/> 'cause the land <pause dur="1.0"/> is inherently <pause dur="0.8"/> unstable <pause dur="1.0"/> it becomes <pause dur="0.3"/> a seascape <pause dur="0.4"/> in the rainy season <pause dur="1.0"/> and all these things filter into our imaginations <pause dur="0.2"/> i don't mean myself but <pause dur="0.3"/> all of us as Guyanese <pause dur="0.9"/> and if it 
is that we are probably <pause dur="0.8"/> the least nationalistic people <pause dur="0.7"/> in the West Indies <pause dur="0.4"/> it's because of the nature of the landscape <pause dur="1.3"/> now being peripheral <pause dur="1.1"/> being marginal <pause dur="0.7"/><event desc="picks up book" iterated="n"/> is for us a source of strength <pause dur="0.7"/> because you see <pause dur="1.5"/> not a not a source of grievance <pause dur="0.5"/> it's only until you're at the periphery <pause dur="1.7"/><kinesic desc="tilts book" iterated="y" dur="5"/> that you can tilt the plane of the centre <pause dur="0.7"/> you know when you're in the periphery <pause dur="0.6"/> yeah that's the centre <pause dur="1.0"/><kinesic desc="indicates centre of book" iterated="y" dur="10"/> when you're in the centre you're settled you're fat <pause dur="0.6"/>you're <trunc>s</trunc> you're you're you're <pause dur="0.6"/><kinesic desc="hits book" iterated="n"/> you're stuck right <pause dur="0.7"/> you're canonical <vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" dur="1"/><pause dur="0.3"/> you're imprisoned you're anchored <pause dur="0.6"/><kinesic desc="tilts book" iterated="y" dur="18"/> when you're at the periphery <pause dur="0.7"/> you can tilt the plane of the centre <pause dur="0.4"/> you know <pause dur="0.9"/> as i said to you before right <pause dur="0.9"/> you could you could you could affect all kinds of movements through language <pause dur="0.7"/> through carnival <pause dur="0.4"/> through rioting <pause dur="0.6"/> through whatever <pause dur="0.3"/> you know you could actually <pause dur="0.8"/> you know with a bit more you 
could actually <pause dur="0.4"/><kinesic desc="drops book" iterated="n"/> and the cannon has gone you know <pause dur="0.5"/> so being peripheral <pause dur="0.8"/> should be a source of strength to us <pause dur="0.7"/> and is a source of strength in terms of our writing <pause dur="0.9"/> now <pause dur="0.4"/> John Gilmore was there <pause dur="0.6"/> and i'm going to read a passage about the classics and i just wanted to say something about the classics <pause dur="0.6"/> the way that we as peripheral people <pause dur="0.4"/> came to <pause dur="0.4"/> the core of Western civilization <pause dur="0.4"/> now we came to it through very debased ways <pause dur="0.6"/> we <trunc>u</trunc> we used you know in the eighteenth century as you know <pause dur="0.5"/> we used to be called Nero and Caesar and <pause dur="1.2"/><vocal desc="sigh" iterated="n"/> you know Plato <pause dur="0.9"/> Aristotle <pause dur="1.0"/> i wrote # in my first novel i wrote # # i went to school with a boy called Caesar <pause dur="1.2"/> when i was <pause dur="0.2"/> when i was a child i went to school with a boy called Caesar <pause dur="0.9"/> # <vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.8"/> he used to sell mangoes <pause dur="0.4"/> on a Saturday <pause dur="0.7"/> he was very poor <pause dur="1.0"/> # so i wrote about it <kinesic desc="indicates book" iterated="n"/> in in this first novel about Caesar selling mangoes on a Caribbean pavement <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="1.8"/> yeah we came to the classics in very debased ways <pause dur="0.5"/> but then # <vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/> 
as Gilmore's # research shows <pause dur="1.0"/> eventually we <trunc>re</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> we end up # <pause dur="1.9"/> revisualizing <pause dur="1.4"/> or # <pause dur="0.4"/> you know <trunc>re</trunc> reconceptualizing the classics <pause dur="0.5"/> in the works of say Omeros <pause dur="1.4"/> in Walcott <pause dur="0.3"/> the <pause dur="0.2"/> the triumph of Walcott winning the Nobel prize in ninety-two <pause dur="0.5"/> was exactly this creolization of the classics <pause dur="0.6"/> this revisualization of it so that <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.8"/> on the five-hundredth anniversary of <pause dur="0.4"/> Columbus <pause dur="2.5"/><event desc="drinks" iterated="n"/> we were able to <pause dur="0.7"/> we were able to enrich the classics <pause dur="0.3"/> by going beyond the pillars of Hercules <pause dur="0.9"/> in poetry <pause dur="1.5"/> # <pause dur="2.2"/> but # we came to language in peculiar ways <pause dur="0.4"/> now i'm going to read a passage about coming to language <pause dur="1.6"/> oh one last thing why do i write about slavery <pause dur="3.3"/> well <pause dur="0.7"/> you can't come from Guyana <pause dur="1.3"/> which has this admixture of different peoples <pause dur="0.4"/> where your own culture <pause dur="1.0"/> where your own language the language we speak at home <pause dur="0.7"/> is # <pause dur="2.2"/> is impregnated <pause dur="0.9"/> with <pause dur="1.4"/> aspects of the African experience <pause dur="0.9"/> slavery i always think of as <pause dur="0.7"/> the defining and the shaping and <pause dur="0.2"/> parent experience of the Caribbean <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="1.4"/> first the Amerindians the idea of eradication then 
the Africans and then the Indians <pause dur="0.5"/> so you can't live in <trunc>guy</trunc> you can't be a Guyanese <pause dur="0.5"/> without # <pause dur="0.7"/> without consideration of the theme of slavery <pause dur="0.2"/> in whatever form <pause dur="1.0"/> i remember # <pause dur="1.8"/> being braced up in some conference in London by <pause dur="0.4"/> a very ignorant Jamaican <pause dur="0.6"/> who said to me <pause dur="0.2"/><shift feature="voice" new="mimicking Jamaican accent"/> well why don't you just write about your Indian people <shift feature="voice" new="normal"/><pause dur="0.5"/> being Jamaican you know kind of question you field <pause dur="0.8"/> and # <vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" dur="2"/> # by the way i do apologize # i <trunc>sh</trunc> i should say a pseudo-Jamaican a Rastafarian Black British <pause dur="0.3"/> who wanted to be a Jamaican <pause dur="0.9"/> fine so i went away and i did exactly what she wanted me to do i wrote a whole book called Coolie Odyssey <vocal desc="laugh" iterated="n"/> right <pause dur="0.9"/> but of course # <pause dur="0.4"/> you see <pause dur="1.1"/> i've always thought <pause dur="1.4"/> and there are kind of <unclear>urien</unclear> underpinnings to this <pause dur="0.5"/> that <pause dur="1.9"/> ancestry is not a matter of blood merely <pause dur="0.8"/> if ancestry was just a matter of blood <pause dur="0.3"/> then <pause dur="0.5"/> half of you are Eskimos <pause dur="0.9"/> yes <pause dur="0.6"/> or Aborigines <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> ancestry can't just be defined by <pause dur="0.5"/> by by blood heritage ancestry is also a matter of culture <pause dur="1.3"/> and in a Guyanese context the 
African Guyanese if ever there's an African Guyanese <pause dur="0.7"/> is # as much Indian as i am African <pause dur="1.2"/> in terms of culture <pause dur="0.5"/> terms of cultural ancestry i have no <unclear>debt to pay</unclear> <pause dur="0.6"/> and i'm no longer defensive about these things yeah <pause dur="0.6"/> # anyway i want to read this passage about # <pause dur="0.2"/><vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/><pause dur="1.0"/> here is <pause dur="0.3"/> <trunc>th</trunc> this is set in the nineteenth century a novel called <pause dur="0.9"/> The Counting House <pause dur="1.4"/> # <pause dur="1.3"/> and by the way i use the word nigger and coolie <pause dur="0.2"/> liberally <pause dur="1.0"/> # <pause dur="4.9"/> it's about ten minutes so after five minutes you can <pause dur="0.3"/> go off if you want <pause dur="0.6"/> # here is a woman called # Miriam <pause dur="0.7"/> an African <pause dur="0.8"/> this is just after slavery <pause dur="0.7"/> # an African <pause dur="0.3"/> African Guyanese # <pause dur="1.3"/> servant woman <pause dur="1.1"/> who was a senior servant <pause dur="0.2"/> in the # in the # <pause dur="0.4"/> great house <pause dur="1.0"/> and then a younger servant a younger girl called # Rohini <pause dur="0.3"/> Indian <pause dur="0.5"/> who's come <pause dur="0.5"/> who's come later <pause dur="0.6"/> and # the two of them <pause dur="0.3"/> and there's a kind of power relationship going on between them as to who is <pause dur="0.3"/> who is the <pause dur="0.6"/> who is the more ancient servant <pause dur="1.3"/> the <trunc>g</trunc> and the <trunc>g</trunc> family are called the Gladstone family <pause dur="0.3"/> yeah <pause dur="0.2"/> 
<reading>the Gladstone family cemetery <pause dur="0.6"/> a plot <pause dur="0.3"/> laid with lawn <pause dur="0.2"/> and adorned with urns of hibiscus and frangipani <pause dur="0.6"/> was Miriam's favourite retreat <pause dur="0.8"/> it was within the compound of the great house <pause dur="0.4"/> surrounded by a high wall of Suffolk brick <pause dur="0.4"/> especially shipped over from England <pause dur="0.7"/> neither nigger <pause dur="0.3"/> nor goat <pause dur="0.9"/> could idle in to graze <pause dur="0.5"/> for the entrance was barred <pause dur="1.2"/> by an <trunc>i</trunc> iron gate <pause dur="1.7"/> of all the workers in the plantation <pause dur="0.2"/> including the gardeners who tended the plot <pause dur="0.2"/> only she had the key <pause dur="0.7"/> a special favour from Gladstone <pause dur="0.7"/> to wander among the white dead <pause dur="0.5"/> to unwrap her bundle of fruit <pause dur="0.3"/> and picnic in their presence <pause dur="0.5"/> and when the sun was sluggishly hot <pause dur="0.6"/> to lean up against them <pause dur="0.6"/> this was her special privilege <pause dur="0.9"/> the white gravestones glared at her she closed her eyes and held her breath <pause dur="0.4"/> pretending to be the last corpse <pause dur="0.7"/> the effort of suppressing her breath made sweat <pause dur="0.6"/> rush to the surface of her skin <pause dur="0.4"/> she let out the air in a loud wheeze and cackled to herself <pause dur="0.5"/> at the thought of her livingness <pause dur="0.6"/> fuck-arse dead

i think <pause dur="0.3"/> <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> about this the Zong case where <pause dur="0.5"/> all of the slaves was thrown overboard <pause dur="0.7"/> # and their insurance value was reclaimed <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="1.5"/> and of course i can i think i'm right in saying that <pause dur="0.5"/> a whole lot of slaves <pause dur="0.5"/> African enslaved people <pause dur="0.6"/> many more died probably <pause dur="0.8"/> # after the abolition of slavery <pause dur="0.9"/> than during well perhaps you can't count it but you know because it was illegal <pause dur="0.6"/> and you got a pirate ship and a whole lot of slaves going to Hispaniola <pause dur="0.6"/> and a British <trunc>frig</trunc> frigates are chasing you down <pause dur="0.3"/> you just chuck your cargo right it's like <pause dur="0.2"/> dumping cocaine <pause dur="0.5"/> basically right <pause dur="0.9"/> so # <pause dur="0.5"/> anyway Turner <pause dur="0.4"/> did this fantastic painting <pause dur="0.6"/> i mean a <trunc>m</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> big i mean it's as big as # it's big <pause dur="0.2"/> yeah <pause dur="0.7"/> and in the middle of it <pause dur="0.2"/> is a ship <pause dur="1.3"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> caught in a storm <pause dur="0.7"/> and you know that Turner is brilliant at storms right so the ship is caught in a storm it's caught between the immensities of sea and sky <pause dur="0.8"/> and and the <trunc>s</trunc> the sky is absolutely <pause dur="0.4"/> livid and and # <pause dur="0.2"/> purple and <pause dur="0.7"/> you know crimson <pause dur="1.0"/> bloody sky there's a 
bloody sea <pause dur="0.4"/> right <pause dur="0.8"/> it's enormously <pause dur="0.2"/> passionate and # <pause dur="0.6"/> at the time it was called the sublime style <pause dur="0.2"/> yeah <pause dur="0.4"/> but it's an enormously passionate # storm <pause dur="1.0"/> so the sea is caught the the ship is caught in a storm in the mid-ground <pause dur="1.4"/> in the foreground <pause dur="0.7"/> there are these two little black legs peeping out of the water <pause dur="1.1"/> # <vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.8"/> very important footnotes in British history <pause dur="1.0"/> yeah <pause dur="0.9"/> perhaps <pause dur="0.8"/> some of the most important footnotes in British history but they're <pause dur="0.3"/> they're very much footnotes in the painting <pause dur="0.7"/> couple of black legs sticking out <pause dur="0.2"/> of the water <pause dur="1.0"/> and there's some <pause dur="0.2"/> some kind of <pause dur="0.2"/> kind of a <pause dur="1.4"/> neo-Gothic <pause dur="0.9"/> fish coming to gobble them up <pause dur="0.8"/> now those black legs are the Africans who drowned drowned head first right <pause dur="0.8"/> or in the painting they're drowned head first all i do really <pause dur="0.8"/> was # <pause dur="0.5"/> you know i just wanted to write a <pause dur="0.4"/> a poem about this painting <pause dur="0.7"/> was to awaken the dead African <pause dur="1.2"/><vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/><pause dur="2.7"/> and # <pause dur="1.4"/> to give him a longing <pause dur="0.9"/> for <pause dur="1.6"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> land <pause dur="0.9"/> memory <pause dur="1.0"/> # land 
family <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="3.2"/> # so <pause dur="0.2"/> basically what i do is <pause dur="0.8"/> in a sense it's like Pincher Martin <pause dur="0.2"/> you know that novel <pause dur="0.6"/> by # <pause dur="1.2"/> Golding <pause dur="0.8"/> where a dead person is awakened <pause dur="1.0"/> so <pause dur="0.5"/> i do a Pincher Martin with the African <pause dur="1.3"/> he's awakened <pause dur="0.4"/> he's been dead for about three-hundred years <pause dur="0.6"/> no he's been dead for about # eighteen-forty to today <pause dur="0.4"/> hundred-and-fifty years <pause dur="0.5"/> so he's now awakened <pause dur="0.8"/> so <pause dur="0.3"/> when you've been dead for a hundred-and-fifty years <pause dur="0.6"/> what do you remember what do you long for <pause dur="0.8"/> you know in this in this poem he doesn't he doesn't even have language he <pause dur="0.4"/> he he tries to recover a sense of the language <pause dur="1.2"/> after a while he even doubts he's a man <pause dur="1.0"/> he's been dead for so long <pause dur="0.7"/> and the sea has transformed him <pause dur="1.0"/> so halfway through the poem he thinks perhaps he's a woman <pause dur="0.7"/><vocal desc="laugh" iterated="n"/><pause dur="1.0"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> so these are passages in which # <pause dur="0.7"/> this is the first passage is <pause dur="0.7"/> where he awakens as it were <pause dur="1.1"/> # the other part of the poem is that a dead <pause dur="0.4"/> and a # is it dead it's # aborted no not <trunc>abor</trunc> stillborn a stillborn <pause dur="0.6"/> a stillborn child <pause dur="1.0"/> is thrown overboard as well <pause dur="0.8"/> not in the 
Turner painting <pause dur="0.2"/> but in another painting <pause dur="0.3"/> in another ship <pause dur="0.9"/> and another century <pause dur="0.7"/> and the whole poem is about the movement of this stillborn child <pause dur="0.4"/> towards this awakened African <pause dur="1.4"/> and # explores the possibility of some kind of connection across time across paintings <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> between a possibility of a relationship between this # <pause dur="0.7"/> stillborn child <pause dur="0.3"/> and this # <pause dur="0.3"/> awakened dead African <pause dur="0.5"/> so obviously it's a bloody crazy poem <pause dur="0.7"/> and what i really wanted to do was not to write about slavery <pause dur="0.6"/> 'cause you see to write about slavery <pause dur="1.3"/> is to evoke guilt <pause dur="0.6"/> automatically <pause dur="1.0"/> yeah <pause dur="0.6"/> it's like to write about the Holocaust <pause dur="0.4"/> it's automatically <pause dur="0.8"/> if i if i wrote about the Holocaust and did a reading in Germany <pause dur="1.1"/> even if i'm writing shit <pause dur="0.9"/> yeah <pause dur="0.9"/> the Germans will listen silently <pause dur="0.9"/> yeah <pause dur="0.6"/> so because i live in the West <pause dur="1.1"/> i didn't really want to write about slavery <pause dur="0.9"/> because you <pause dur="0.2"/> <trunc>y</trunc> <pause dur="0.3"/> because your writing can suffer <pause dur="0.8"/> you know <pause dur="0.9"/> because people don't <trunc>e</trunc> <pause dur="0.3"/> people don't impose a set of literary criteria <pause dur="0.4"/> that they might impose on say # <pause dur="1.5"/> i 
can't even think of an English writer <pause dur="0.2"/> but you know an English writer <pause dur="0.3"/> yeah <pause dur="0.6"/> and i didn't want to write <pause dur="0.5"/> slavery in a in a in a direct way that's why i wrote about the painting <pause dur="0.6"/> anyway this is # <pause dur="1.7"/> this is where he kind of misses his mother or tries to recreate <pause dur="0.5"/> a sense of mother <pause dur="2.0"/> so i'll read about three or four passages and <pause dur="0.4"/> and as i said the idea was to write about the sea i thought what i will do instead of writing about slavery <pause dur="0.4"/> write about the sea because the sea <pause dur="0.5"/> in the same way as the <pause dur="0.2"/> stories collide into each other <pause dur="0.4"/> in in the poem so <pause dur="0.3"/> you know that that was meant to reflect the <pause dur="0.5"/> the kind of the way the sea <pause dur="0.4"/> moves <pause dur="0.3"/> things crashing into <pause dur="0.8"/> crashing into each other <pause dur="1.0"/> <reading>the sea has brought me tribute from many lands <pause dur="0.8"/> chests of silver <pause dur="0.7"/> barrels of tobacco <pause dur="0.5"/> sugarloaves <pause dur="0.5"/> swords with gleaming handles <pause dur="0.4"/> crucifixes set in pearls which <pause dur="0.3"/> marvelled at <pause dur="0.5"/> but with the years grown rusty and mouldy <pause dur="0.4"/> abandoned <pause dur="0.4"/> cheap and counterfeit goods <pause dur="0.5"/> the sea has mocked and beggared me for centuries <pause dur="0.6"/> 
except for scrolls in different letterings <pause dur="0.4"/> which before they dissolve <pause dur="0.6"/> i decipher as best i can <pause dur="1.0"/> these and the babbling of dying sailors <pause dur="0.4"/> are my means to languages <pause dur="0.3"/> and the wisdom of other tribes <pause dur="0.7"/> now the sea has delivered a child <pause dur="0.4"/> sought from the moon <pause dur="0.3"/> in years of courtship <pause dur="0.6"/> when only the light from that silent full eye saw me <pause dur="0.4"/> whilst many ships passed by indifferently <pause dur="0.2"/> she hides behind a veil <pause dur="0.3"/> like the brides of our village <pause dur="0.3"/> but watches me <pause dur="0.2"/> in loneliness and grief <pause dur="0.3"/> for that vast space <pause dur="0.3"/> that still carries my whisper to her ears <pause dur="0.3"/> vaster than the circumference of the sea <pause dur="0.4"/> that so swiftly drowned my early cries in its unending roar <pause dur="0.3"/> there is no land in sight <pause dur="0.3"/> no voice carries from that land <pause dur="0.4"/> my mother does not answer <pause dur="0.3"/> i cannot hear her calling <pause dur="0.3"/> as she did when i dragged myself to the bank of the pond <pause dur="0.4"/> my head a pool and fountain of blood <pause dur="0.4"/> and she runs to me screaming <pause dur="0.5"/> plucks me up with huge hands <pause dur="0.3"/> lays me down on land <pause dur="0.4"/> as the sea promised in early days <pause dur="0.4"/> clasped and pitched me 
sideways <pause dur="0.3"/> in the direction of our village <pause dur="0.3"/> my dazed mind thought <pause dur="0.4"/> across a distance big beyond even Turner's grasp <pause dur="0.8"/> he sketches endless numbers in his book <pause dur="0.5"/> face wrinkled in concentration <pause dur="0.3"/> like an old seal's mouth <pause dur="0.3"/> brooding in crevices of ice for fish <pause dur="0.3"/> like my father counting beads at the end of each day <pause dur="0.4"/> reckoning which calf was left abandoned in the savannah <pause dur="0.4"/> lost from the herd <pause dur="0.3"/> eaten by wild beasts <pause dur="0.3"/> he checks that we are parcelled in equal lots <pause dur="0.3"/> men divided from women <pause dur="0.3"/> chained in fours <pause dur="0.3"/> and children subtracted from mothers <pause dur="0.4"/> when all things tally <pause dur="0.3"/> he snaps the book shut <pause dur="0.5"/> his creased mouth unfolding in a smile <pause dur="0.3"/> as when <pause dur="0.3"/> entering his cabin <pause dur="0.3"/> mind heavy with care <pause dur="0.4"/> breeding and multiplying percentages <pause dur="0.3"/> he beholds a boy <pause dur="0.2"/> dishevelled in his bed <pause dur="0.3"/> for months it seemed to speed me to a spot <pause dur="0.3"/> where my mother waited <pause dur="0.4"/> wringing her hands <pause dur="0.3"/> until i woke to find <pause dur="0.3"/> only sea <pause dur="1.1"/> months became years <pause dur="0.3"/> and i forgot the face of my mother <pause dur="0.3"/> the plaid cloth tied around her neck <pause dur="0.5"/> the scars on her forehead <pause dur="0.3"/> the silver nose which i 
tugged <pause dur="0.2"/> made her start <pause dur="0.3"/> nearly rolling me from her lap <pause dur="0.4"/> but catching me in time <pause dur="0.3"/> and when i cried out in panic of falling <pause dur="0.3"/> pinned me tightly <pause dur="0.3"/> always to her bosom <pause dur="0.8"/> now i am loosed into the sea <pause dur="0.4"/> i no longer call <pause dur="0.3"/> i have even forgotten the words <pause dur="0.5"/> only the moon remains <pause dur="0.4"/> watching and loving <pause dur="0.5"/> across a vast space</reading> <pause dur="1.3"/> and then there's these <pause dur="0.3"/> other passages are about the moon <pause dur="0.3"/> <reading>sometimes <pause dur="0.3"/> half her face grows dark <pause dur="0.3"/> she sulks impatient of my arms <pause dur="0.3"/> all my entreaties grappled in a storm of rain <pause dur="0.4"/> nothing will soothe her then <pause dur="0.4"/> she cries herself to sleep <pause dur="0.5"/> or curves like a sickle that will wake the sky's throat <pause dur="0.5"/> or curls her lip in scorn of me a mere unborn with insufficient cowrie shells <pause dur="0.3"/> when others men <pause dur="0.2"/> substantial <pause dur="0.5"/> bespeak beseech her favours <pause dur="0.3"/> with necklaces of coloured glass to loop around her breasts <pause dur="0.3"/> men of presence <pause dur="0.4"/> neither ghosts nor portent of a past or future life <pause dur="0.4"/> such as i am <pause dur="0.3"/> now <pause dur="0.9"/> sometimes her cheeks are puffed <pause dur="0.5"/> her face lopsided <pause dur="0.4"/> and i think i must have blasted her in some
