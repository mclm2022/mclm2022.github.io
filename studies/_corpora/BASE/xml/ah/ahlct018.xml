<u who="nm0076"> okay <pause dur="2.1"/> what i want to talk to <pause dur="0.2"/> you about today <pause dur="0.2"/> is <pause dur="0.3"/> the <pause dur="0.2"/> so-called Kulturkampf <pause dur="0.6"/> the struggle for culture <pause dur="1.6"/> which </u><pause dur="0.6"/> <u who="sm0077" trans="pause"> we haven't got any handouts </u><pause dur="1.8"/> <u who="nm0076" trans="pause"> they should have been passed round there are lots <pause dur="6.4"/> would be helpful if people rather than sitting on a pile of them actually <pause dur="0.5"/> passed them round <pause dur="0.9"/> # <pause dur="3.1"/> so Kulturkampf the so-called struggle for culture <pause dur="0.4"/> in which <pause dur="1.3"/> Bismarck <pause dur="0.7"/> and the machinery of the newly <pause dur="1.1"/> united German state and in particular Prussia which remains <pause dur="0.6"/> the dominant partner within the newly united German state <pause dur="0.6"/> essentially persecute the Catholic Church <pause dur="1.6"/> now you might ask why <pause dur="0.5"/> this is <pause dur="0.3"/> important why it merits a lecture on its own right <pause dur="1.2"/> and <pause dur="0.4"/> in a sense in the general scheme of things it probably isn't as important as the <pause dur="0.4"/> outbreak of the First World War <pause dur="0.3"/> or the partitions of Poland <pause dur="0.6"/> or the <pause dur="0.4"/> Austro-Prussian war of eighteen-sixty-six or the Franco-Prussian war of eighteen-seventy seventy-one <pause dur="0.9"/> but i think it's very important to look at as a very good example <pause dur="0.6"/> of the sort of problems <pause dur="0.4"/> that were faced by 
the newly united German state problems of shaping identity <pause dur="0.3"/> problems of dealing with what remains a very diverse population <pause dur="1.7"/> i also think it's <pause dur="0.8"/> an interesting subject as a very good example as a good case study <pause dur="1.1"/> highlighting the personality <pause dur="0.4"/> of <pause dur="0.2"/> Bismarck the dominant figure <pause dur="0.5"/> in the first twenty years of the united German state <pause dur="0.2"/> much as he'd been the dominant figure <pause dur="0.6"/> in <pause dur="0.7"/> the previous <pause dur="0.6"/> ten fifteen <pause dur="0.2"/> years <pause dur="0.4"/> in <pause dur="0.3"/> the Prussian state <pause dur="3.5"/> it <pause dur="0.4"/> is a good example of his ability to manoeuvre politically <pause dur="0.5"/> and of his <pause dur="0.5"/> tensions <pause dur="0.2"/> the tensions that exist in his mind <pause dur="0.3"/> between a basic ideological position <pause dur="0.8"/> and <pause dur="0.3"/> a position of political expedience <pause dur="2.0"/> i think it's also important because it locates problems of the new German state <pause dur="0.5"/> more broadly <pause dur="0.9"/> within <pause dur="1.3"/> debates that are going on <pause dur="0.4"/> not only in central Europe but across Europe as a whole <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="2.1"/> the issue of church-state relations <pause dur="0.2"/> is in my opinion more important in the late nineteenth century <pause dur="0.4"/> than any debates over <pause dur="0.3"/> class or the social question <pause dur="0.2"/> what determines people's 
political views is first and foremost <pause dur="0.5"/> in the eighteen-seventies eighties probably eighteen-nineties <pause dur="0.2"/> still primarily <pause dur="0.2"/> religious <pause dur="0.2"/> views <pause dur="1.2"/> and i think the Kulturkampf this struggle between the Catholic Church and the Prussian state <pause dur="0.3"/> is a very clear example of this <pause dur="1.4"/> it shows that the problems faced by <pause dur="0.4"/> the newly united German state are problems that are shared by many other European countries <pause dur="1.4"/> and yet at the same time while it does reveal <pause dur="0.7"/> the similarities between Germany <pause dur="0.5"/> and the rest of the Europe <pause dur="1.0"/> it also can be used to highlight what two <pause dur="0.8"/> eminent historians in the nineteen-eighties described as the peculiarities of German history <pause dur="0.6"/> it highlights that there that Germany in some senses <pause dur="0.3"/> is rather different from other European states the solutions that are taken to deal <pause dur="0.2"/> with the Catholic question <pause dur="0.5"/> are <pause dur="0.4"/> specific <pause dur="0.3"/> to <pause dur="0.3"/> Prussia <pause dur="0.4"/> and <pause dur="1.0"/> to lesser extent Germany as a whole <pause dur="0.8"/> and reveal some of the problems that there are for example <pause dur="0.8"/> with <pause dur="0.6"/> liberalism <pause dur="0.7"/> in <pause dur="0.2"/> Germany <pause dur="0.4"/> that liberalism is a rather 
different phenomenon in Germany from other European countries <pause dur="3.5"/> i'll begin by simply running through the <pause dur="0.3"/> key <pause dur="0.3"/> events <pause dur="0.7"/> of the so-called Kulturkampf the <pause dur="0.8"/> battle for civilization the battle for culture <pause dur="0.2"/> struggle for culture <pause dur="0.6"/> in <pause dur="2.5"/> Prussia and Germany <pause dur="0.5"/> during the eighteen-seventies <pause dur="2.4"/> it should be remembered that in eighteen-sixty-seven <pause dur="1.4"/> it was <pause dur="0.2"/> agreed <pause dur="1.5"/> that <pause dur="1.1"/> in the North German Confederation <pause dur="0.3"/> the newly created North German Confederation <pause dur="1.1"/> religious matters were the preserve of <pause dur="0.4"/> the individual states of the Confederation <pause dur="0.2"/> rather than the Confederation as a whole <pause dur="0.8"/> and this measure is extended <pause dur="0.5"/> to <pause dur="0.4"/> the German Reich when it comes into being in eighteen-seventy-one <pause dur="1.4"/> that the <pause dur="0.9"/> states of Bavaria <pause dur="1.1"/> or WÃ¼rttemburg <pause dur="0.7"/> or Prussia <pause dur="0.6"/> actually maintained their own religious policies there was not an imperial religious policy <pause dur="4.0"/> now in March eighteen-seventy-one <pause dur="1.5"/> the Centre Party <pause dur="0.6"/> which is a party that's emerged <pause dur="0.9"/> amongst <pause dur="0.2"/> Hanoverians <pause dur="0.7"/> after eighteen-sixty-six <pause dur="1.3"/> anxious to minimize the impact <pause dur="0.5"/> of Prussian dominance over the 
Hanoverian state <pause dur="1.4"/> and that has subsequently become a focus for Catholic <pause dur="0.3"/> opposition <pause dur="0.3"/> to the way in which Germany has been united <pause dur="1.3"/> in March eighteen-seventy-one the Centre Party <pause dur="0.2"/> the so-called Zentrum <pause dur="1.8"/> calls in the Imperial Diet <pause dur="0.5"/> that's the <pause dur="0.2"/> whole German Diet <pause dur="1.2"/> for the establishment <pause dur="0.5"/> of <pause dur="0.9"/> basic rights <pause dur="0.4"/> in the constitution <pause dur="2.2"/> now remember that in eighteen-forty-eight forty-nine the liberals in Frankfurt had established a Bill of Basic Rights <pause dur="0.9"/> and this includes <pause dur="0.2"/> the right <pause dur="0.4"/> to freedom of worship <pause dur="3.5"/> this <pause dur="0.9"/> call <pause dur="0.5"/> by the Centre Party <pause dur="0.8"/> for a Bill of Rights <pause dur="0.7"/> is significantly <pause dur="0.3"/> rejected by almost every other <pause dur="0.4"/> political party <pause dur="0.5"/> in the Imperial Diet <pause dur="1.3"/> the National Liberals <pause dur="0.2"/> and the Progressives <pause dur="1.5"/> side with the Conservatives <pause dur="0.7"/> and the two <pause dur="0.2"/> members of the S-P-D the Socialist Party the <trunc>n</trunc> the the nascent Socialist Party <pause dur="0.6"/> in <pause dur="0.2"/> rejecting <pause dur="0.3"/> a Bill of Rights <pause dur="1.5"/> so you have a broad spectrum from the extreme left to the extreme right who also we don't want a Bill of Basic Rights <pause dur="0.3"/> and the reason they do this <pause dur="0.3"/> is they 
see it as special <pause dur="0.2"/> pleading <pause dur="0.5"/> for the interest of the Catholic Church <pause dur="1.0"/> they realize what the Centre Party really wants <pause dur="0.2"/> is a defence of the interests of Catholicism and they feel that this can best be done <pause dur="0.3"/> by defending individuals' rights <pause dur="0.2"/> therefore individuals can <trunc>c</trunc> choose <pause dur="0.3"/> their <trunc>re</trunc> religious affiliation <pause dur="0.2"/> and that can enable them to defend their own church's position within the German Reich <pause dur="1.8"/> so it's rejected by everyone <pause dur="1.0"/> they all gang up on the Catholics <pause dur="2.9"/> in June <pause dur="0.9"/> eighteen-seventy-two <pause dur="3.2"/> a guy named Adalbert Falk <pause dur="0.3"/> his name is on the <pause dur="0.5"/> handout <pause dur="0.8"/> was appointed as Prussian <pause dur="0.3"/> Minister of Culture <pause dur="0.3"/> Education and Church Affairs <pause dur="1.8"/> and the period <pause dur="0.3"/> that's known as <pause dur="0.2"/> the period of Kampfgesetze the period of the struggle <pause dur="1.2"/> against the Catholic Church is well and truly launched <pause dur="2.0"/> legislation <pause dur="0.2"/> aimed <pause dur="0.3"/> at reducing the power influence and autonomy <pause dur="0.2"/> of the Catholic Church <pause dur="0.9"/> is subsequently passed <pause dur="0.5"/> both in the Prussian Landtag <pause dur="1.0"/> both in the Prussian <pause dur="0.2"/> elect assembly <pause dur="0.4"/> and in the Reichstag <pause dur="0.9"/> of <pause dur="0.4"/> the whole of united 
Germany <pause dur="3.6"/> in fact <pause dur="0.3"/> persecution <pause dur="0.3"/> of the Catholics <pause dur="0.4"/> had already begun in a sense <pause dur="1.5"/> the previous year <pause dur="2.3"/> in <pause dur="0.2"/> January eighteen-seventy-one <pause dur="2.0"/> the Catholic section <pause dur="0.6"/> of the Prussian Minister of <trunc>cul</trunc> Ministry of Culture <pause dur="1.4"/> which looked after <pause dur="0.2"/> the interests of the Catholic Church in Prussia remember that Prussia has a significant Catholic population <pause dur="0.2"/> particularly in the Rhineland <pause dur="1.0"/> was abolished <pause dur="0.7"/> in other words the <trunc>ins</trunc> the the section of the Minister of <pause dur="0.4"/> Culture <pause dur="1.0"/> that protects the interests of Prussia's Catholics <pause dur="1.1"/> is done away with <pause dur="3.8"/> the argument being <pause dur="1.0"/> that <pause dur="0.4"/> the <pause dur="3.0"/> Catholic section <pause dur="0.2"/> represented the interests of the church and not the state that it was a special <pause dur="0.3"/> it was a special body <pause dur="0.2"/> just representing <pause dur="0.5"/> a <trunc>mino</trunc> minority a religious minority of the <pause dur="1.6"/> Prussian population <pause dur="1.8"/> what possibly lay behind its <trunc>abol</trunc> abolition however <pause dur="0.6"/> was the fact that its leader obviously a Catholic <pause dur="0.5"/> Albert KrÃ¤tzig <pause dur="1.4"/> was perceived as being pro-Polish <pause dur="1.3"/> and remember that the <pause dur="1.8"/> Minister-President of Prussia <pause dur="1.6"/> Chancellor of the 
New Reich <pause dur="1.0"/> Bismarck <pause dur="0.4"/> is passionately anti-Polish he sees the Poles as a fundamental problem <pause dur="0.3"/> within <pause dur="0.3"/> the Prussian <pause dur="0.2"/> state <pause dur="0.2"/> and indeed within the new united Germany <pause dur="0.3"/> he sees the Poles as enemies of the state <pause dur="1.4"/> he also has a essentially racialist view <pause dur="0.4"/> that the Poles are subhuman remember this quotation that could almost come of the come out of Hitler <pause dur="0.4"/> that it's not the Poles' fault <pause dur="0.8"/> just as it's not the wolf's fault <pause dur="0.3"/> but we shoot the wolf nonetheless <pause dur="0.6"/> he somehow thinks they all are subhuman <pause dur="0.3"/> they're inferior <pause dur="0.3"/> but he sees them as a fundamental challenge <pause dur="0.2"/> to the integrity of the Reich <pause dur="0.3"/> and to the integrity of Prussia <pause dur="0.5"/> so <pause dur="0.2"/> the fact that the Catholic section <pause dur="0.4"/> is headed by someone who's sympathetic towards the Poles and the Poles are of course <pause dur="0.4"/> Catholic <pause dur="1.2"/> means that <pause dur="0.3"/> Bismarck is keen to do away with it <pause dur="2.2"/> but the more significant piece of legislation <pause dur="0.4"/> in November <pause dur="0.3"/> eighteen-seventy-one <pause dur="0.9"/> is the Pulpit Law <pause dur="1.8"/> which imposes <pause dur="0.2"/> criminal penalties <pause dur="0.6"/> on priests <pause dur="0.3"/> who are <pause dur="0.2"/> convicted <pause dur="0.4"/> of <pause dur="1.1"/> electioneering through the pulpit <pause dur="0.4"/> in other words priests <pause dur="0.3"/> who preach sermons <pause dur="0.2"/> which are perceived as having a political content <pause dur="0.5"/> can be fined <pause dur="0.4"/> and in extremis <pause dur="0.4"/> sacked or thrown into prison <pause dur="1.1"/> 
and that's a very significant law which i will return to later <pause dur="2.6"/> in eighteen-seventy-two <pause dur="1.8"/> religious control of schools inspectors <pause dur="0.4"/> in Prussia <pause dur="0.5"/> is replaced <pause dur="0.4"/> by state <pause dur="0.7"/> inspectors <pause dur="2.5"/> Prussian schools in other words are removed entirely from clerical control <pause dur="1.2"/> the most powerful of all Catholic orders the Jesuits <pause dur="1.0"/> are banned from establishing institutions in Germany <pause dur="1.5"/> new institutions <pause dur="0.4"/> and individual states in Germany <pause dur="0.3"/> begin a policy of expulsion of the Jesuits <pause dur="2.4"/> almost all the states with Protestant majorities kicked the Jesuits out <pause dur="2.7"/> and then in eighteen-seventy-three the so-called May Laws are launched <pause dur="2.4"/> priests <pause dur="0.2"/> who had formerly Catholic priests who had formerly trained in seminaries <pause dur="1.8"/> are now forced to study <pause dur="0.2"/> first of all at a state Gymnasium a state grammar school and then <pause dur="0.2"/> at a <pause dur="0.3"/> state-run <pause dur="0.2"/> university <pause dur="1.3"/> in other words <pause dur="0.4"/> whereas 
previously the church had very considerable influence <pause dur="0.2"/> over <pause dur="1.6"/> the <pause dur="0.8"/> educational establishment <pause dur="0.2"/> of the schooling <pause dur="0.2"/> of people in Prussia particularly in Catholic areas <pause dur="0.4"/> you now have the state <pause dur="0.3"/> controlling <pause dur="0.2"/> the education of priests <pause dur="0.4"/> the positions have been reversed <pause dur="2.3"/> priests <pause dur="0.4"/> have their <pause dur="1.3"/> young impressionable minds <pause dur="0.3"/> controlled <pause dur="0.3"/> by <pause dur="1.0"/> state officials state employers <pause dur="2.5"/> and not only that just in case <pause dur="1.5"/> clergy <pause dur="0.4"/> come out <pause dur="0.5"/> still thinking independently <pause dur="0.9"/> the state is given the right of veto <pause dur="0.3"/> over all appointments <pause dur="0.4"/> to church positions <pause dur="1.6"/> in other words the power of the state over the church is beefed up immeasurably <pause dur="2.7"/> the following year in eighteen-seventy-four <pause dur="1.0"/> civil marriage <pause dur="0.2"/> is introduced <pause dur="2.2"/> and all states <pause dur="0.4"/> in the German Confederation are empowered <pause dur="0.2"/> to expel clergy who they perceive as troublesome <pause dur="6.1"/> the following year <pause dur="0.2"/> the Prussian Landtag <pause dur="1.6"/> suspends <pause dur="0.4"/> subsidies <pause dur="0.2"/> to the church <pause dur="2.3"/> in any diocese <pause dur="0.2"/> where <pause dur="0.2"/> the clergy <pause dur="0.3"/> have been found to criticize the state's legislation <pause dur="1.9"/> and religious orders <pause dur="0.9"/> communities of nuns and friars and monks <pause dur="0.8"/> 
are dissolved <pause dur="0.7"/> except when they're involved in nursing so contemplative and teaching orders <pause dur="1.7"/> get closed down <pause dur="3.3"/> the response to this is widespread Catholic agitation <pause dur="0.2"/> and resistance <pause dur="1.0"/> which leads to <pause dur="0.3"/> the sacking the expulsion and the imprisonment of clergy <pause dur="0.4"/> across the Catholic regions of Prussia <pause dur="1.2"/> and to a lesser extent in some of the other German states <pause dur="0.6"/> by eighteen-seventy-six <pause dur="1.2"/> one-thousand-four-hundred parishes <pause dur="0.3"/> in Prussia had no priests <pause dur="1.1"/> and between eighteen-seventy-six and eighteen-seventy-nine <pause dur="0.7"/> there is a state of <pause dur="0.5"/> to say it's war would be exaggeration but there is a <trunc>s</trunc> a state of <pause dur="0.5"/> incredible <pause dur="0.2"/> hostility <pause dur="0.6"/> between the Catholic Church and Catholic believers on the one hand <pause dur="0.8"/> and the mechanisms of the Prussian state and the Prussian bureaucracy on the other <pause dur="1.3"/> civil disobedience <pause dur="0.3"/> protests <pause dur="0.5"/> widespread hostility <pause dur="5.6"/> suddenly <pause dur="0.5"/> in eighteen-seventy-nine <pause dur="0.8"/> Bismarck <pause dur="0.9"/> changes his position <pause dur="1.3"/> and relents <pause dur="1.0"/> and the vast majority of this legislation <pause dur="0.4"/> is done away with and jettisoned <pause dur="1.4"/> and members of the Catholic Centre 
Party <pause dur="0.8"/> are allowed <pause dur="0.2"/> into government posts <pause dur="1.6"/> so this begs two questions first of all <pause dur="0.3"/> why between eighteen-seventy-one and eighteen-seventy-eight seventy-nine <pause dur="0.6"/> does Bismarck and the new Prussian state <pause dur="0.7"/> basically put the boot in fairly bloody seriously <pause dur="0.5"/> on the Catholic Church <pause dur="0.4"/> and why <pause dur="0.7"/> having <pause dur="0.4"/> attacked the Catholic Church <pause dur="0.3"/> labelled Catholics as enemies both of the Prussian state and the New Reich <pause dur="0.6"/> is there this sudden volte-face <pause dur="1.0"/> this turnaround <pause dur="0.6"/> and this <trunc>abi</trunc> this desire <pause dur="0.2"/> to <pause dur="0.6"/> pacify the Catholics <pause dur="0.2"/> do deals with them <pause dur="0.4"/> even let them into government <pause dur="0.5"/> what's going on here <pause dur="2.2"/> well i think there are a number of ways of looking at the Kulturkampf <pause dur="1.7"/> and one way to see it <pause dur="0.5"/> is simply as part of a <pause dur="0.2"/> historical conflict <pause dur="2.9"/> since the Reformation <pause dur="2.3"/> since the early fifteen-hundreds since Luther first starts causing trouble in fifteen-seventeen <pause dur="1.0"/> Germany <pause dur="0.2"/> had been divided religiously <pause dur="3.6"/> between fifteen-twenty and fifteen-fifty-five <pause dur="0.2"/> scarcely a year went past without some form of religious conflict and 
when i say religious conflict this involves bloodshed <pause dur="0.4"/> this involves major wars <pause dur="1.9"/> by fifteen-fifty-five <pause dur="0.2"/> an uneasy modus vivendi had been established <pause dur="0.9"/> in which basically it's decided that the rulers of Germany's various <pause dur="0.4"/> petty princedoms <pause dur="0.7"/> can decide what religion they want to be whether they want to be Lutheran or Catholic <pause dur="0.4"/> and then unless you live in in in <pause dur="0.2"/> an imperial free city <pause dur="0.5"/> you have to <pause dur="0.9"/> follow the religion <pause dur="0.7"/> of your ruler <pause dur="0.2"/> or get the hell out of the state <pause dur="1.8"/> i mean this does occasionally lead to oddities in which a <trunc>r</trunc> in in which a <pause dur="0.2"/> successor to the throne suddenly says well <pause dur="0.8"/> i think i'm turning Lutheran <pause dur="1.2"/> and the population that's been happily Catholic for the previous <pause dur="0.3"/> twenty thirty years suddenly think <pause dur="0.3"/> oh Christ you know <pause dur="0.4"/> what do we do now do we get out do we stay do we turn Lutheran so there's quite a lot of notional changes <pause dur="0.3"/> where people actually <pause dur="0.2"/> retain <pause dur="1.1"/> basically old religious beliefs and make a sort of <trunc>s</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="1.6"/> a faÃ§ade <pause dur="0.3"/> of <pause dur="0.4"/> holding <pause dur="0.5"/> # a different religious creed <pause dur="0.6"/> 
but essentially by fifteen-fifty-five by the Peace of Augsburg <pause dur="0.4"/> there is <pause dur="0.3"/> an uneasy <pause dur="1.7"/> # modus vivendi in the German states <pause dur="1.8"/> during the Thirty Years War <pause dur="0.6"/> of <pause dur="0.2"/> <trunc>s</trunc> sixteen-eighteen to forty-eight <pause dur="0.8"/> that breaks down <pause dur="0.3"/> largely because of the rise of Calvinism <pause dur="0.7"/> so there are two sorts of Protestant faiths <pause dur="0.6"/> the Calvinists and the Lutherans who don't see eye to eye <pause dur="0.3"/> about the one thing the Lutherans do agree with the Catholics over <pause dur="0.2"/> is hating Calvinists <pause dur="0.6"/> and so there is a breakdown <pause dur="0.2"/> in church-state <pause dur="0.3"/> # there's again a breakdown in religious relations <pause dur="0.3"/> and although you'll find Catholics <pause dur="0.5"/> in alliance with Protestants during the Thirty Years War on occasion <pause dur="0.3"/> there is a strong undercurrent of religious hostility <pause dur="0.5"/> that lasts <pause dur="0.3"/> during the seventeenth century <pause dur="1.6"/> by the eighteenth century <pause dur="0.3"/> there are clear there are no religious wars <pause dur="0.3"/> in Germany any more <pause dur="2.2"/> nevertheless <pause dur="0.2"/> tensions <pause dur="0.5"/> still exist <pause dur="0.2"/> and run very deep <pause dur="0.2"/> between Catholic and Protestant <pause dur="0.5"/> and indeed between different <pause dur="0.3"/> Protestant believers <pause dur="1.4"/> when <pause dur="0.4"/> the <pause dur="0.2"/> two 
Protestant Churches the Lutheran and Calvinist Church are united <pause dur="1.2"/> in <pause dur="0.6"/> Prussia <pause dur="2.0"/> in the eighteen-twenties <pause dur="0.9"/> there is a very marked hostility amongst a lot of Lutherans and Calvinists and many actually leave to set up new communities in the new world because they can't bear to see these two states <pause dur="0.2"/> these two <pause dur="0.3"/> religious <pause dur="1.3"/> sets of beliefs united in a single church <pause dur="0.6"/> but the real tensions by the nineteenth century are basically between Catholic and Protestant <pause dur="3.4"/> so there's a long term <pause dur="1.0"/> historical conflict <pause dur="0.8"/> there's also a shorter term historical conflict which i'll return to in a minute <pause dur="2.6"/> but there's also a tradition of a clash between <pause dur="0.3"/> church and state <pause dur="2.0"/> in Germany <pause dur="0.3"/> in the Middle Ages there'd been a clash between the so-called Guelphs the pro-papal faction <pause dur="0.3"/> and the so-called Ghibellines the pro-imperial faction <pause dur="0.4"/> even before there was a Reformation <pause dur="1.7"/> the civil authorities often resented the power <pause dur="0.6"/> of the ecclesiastical authorities <pause dur="2.9"/> by the eighteenth century <pause dur="0.2"/> there was a new onslaught against

in the courts of <pause dur="0.3"/> central Europe <pause dur="0.8"/> by <pause dur="0.3"/> the mid to late eighteenth century <pause dur="2.3"/> and so there is a tradition of a clash between church and state and if you actually look at the extracts i've given <pause dur="2.7"/> you'll see that Bismarck <pause dur="0.2"/> in eighteen-seventy-three actually decides to <pause dur="0.2"/> legitimate what he's doing <pause dur="1.1"/> he's not telling the truth incidentally <pause dur="0.2"/> but he decides to legitimate what he's doing by saying <pause dur="0.2"/> <reading>it is not a matter of an attack by a Protestant dynasty upon the Catholic Church <pause dur="0.3"/> as our Catholic fellow citizens are being told <pause dur="0.6"/> it is a not a a matter of <pause dur="0.2"/> the struggle between </reading><pause dur="0.3"/> or betweem because i've <trunc>misprin</trunc> mistyped it <pause dur="0.3"/> <reading>between faith and 
unbelief <pause dur="0.5"/> what we have here is an age-old struggle for power <pause dur="0.2"/> as old as the human race itself <pause dur="0.3"/> between kingship and the priestly caste </reading><pause dur="1.0"/> and there is a little bit of truth <pause dur="0.3"/> in this <pause dur="0.6"/> and certainly there is a tradition of church-state tension <pause dur="0.4"/> that <pause dur="0.4"/> runs <pause dur="0.5"/> throughout many of the regimes in central Europe <pause dur="0.5"/> and certainly predates the unification of Germany <pause dur="2.8"/> but i think if you want a real <pause dur="0.4"/> clue <pause dur="0.2"/> to understanding <pause dur="0.2"/> what is going on <pause dur="1.3"/> with the Kulturkampf you need to look at recent <pause dur="0.2"/> historical <pause dur="0.3"/> conflict <pause dur="2.7"/> some historians and an example of this is William Carr in his standard textbook <pause dur="0.2"/> on <pause dur="1.7"/> Germany <pause dur="0.5"/> Modern Germany <pause dur="0.8"/> suggests that eighteen-seventy-two <pause dur="1.1"/> was a new departure <pause dur="0.4"/> that the Kulturkampf was somehow a new <pause dur="0.8"/> trend <pause dur="0.4"/> in politics <pause dur="1.1"/> and in fact <pause dur="0.2"/> this is <pause dur="0.6"/> rubbish <pause dur="1.1"/> it is quite clear <pause dur="0.7"/> that the biggest divisions <pause dur="0.2"/> in German society and politics <pause dur="1.5"/> in the nineteenth century <pause dur="1.4"/> are based along religious <pause dur="0.2"/> lines <pause dur="3.0"/> if you look for example <pause dur="0.3"/> at the voting <pause dur="0.2"/> in the Frankfurt Assembly in eighteen-forty-eight forty-nine <pause dur="1.1"/> the <trunc>didid</trunc>

seen in France <pause dur="0.6"/> under Napoleon the Third there was the fear <pause dur="0.4"/> that <pause dur="0.5"/> the Catholic Church will end # end up educating future elites <pause dur="0.3"/> who will then <pause dur="0.6"/> manage to <pause dur="0.4"/> impose their Catholicism on German society <pause dur="1.0"/> so there's a desire to prevent the <pause dur="0.2"/> Church's <pause dur="0.2"/> role in education <pause dur="1.4"/> and it is quite clear that not only the liberals recognize this but Bismarck <pause dur="0.8"/> who is a fierce Protestant in his religious beliefs <pause dur="2.7"/> is also aware <pause dur="0.2"/> of the need to move with the times <pause dur="0.2"/> and prevent <pause dur="0.4"/> obscurantism in the field of sciences <pause dur="1.4"/> so <pause dur="0.4"/> that partially explains it <pause dur="0.2"/> but <pause dur="0.2"/> i think <pause dur="1.0"/> the real explanation <pause dur="1.7"/> comes from looking at the first key piece of legislation <pause dur="0.7"/> the Pulpit Law <pause dur="2.0"/> the law <pause dur="0.4"/> that forbids <pause dur="0.8"/> Catholic priests <pause dur="2.2"/> on pain of quite heavy penalties in terms of fines or exile or imprisonment <pause dur="1.1"/> forbids them <pause dur="0.6"/> from using the pulpit <pause dur="0.2"/> for electoral purposes <pause dur="0.6"/> for <pause dur="0.3"/> forbids them from <pause dur="0.2"/> discussing <pause dur="1.1"/> political matters <pause dur="0.2"/> when they're sermonizing <pause dur="3.5"/> Margaret Lavinia Anderson <pause dur="1.3"/> in her brilliant <pause dur="0.2"/> biography <pause dur="0.4"/> of the <pause dur="0.6"/> leader of the Centre Party Ludwig Windthorst

the Liberals <pause dur="1.2"/> claimed <pause dur="0.4"/> to represent <pause dur="0.2"/> the <distinct lang="de">Volk</distinct> <pause dur="0.5"/> claimed to represent the German nation <pause dur="4.2"/> but if you actually look at who the Liberals really represent <pause dur="0.7"/> they represent a very narrow elite <pause dur="0.3"/> of middle class professionals <pause dur="0.9"/> your average German does not give a toss <pause dur="0.2"/> about what the National Liberals and Progressives want <pause dur="1.7"/> they're interested about <pause dur="0.3"/> feeding their families <pause dur="0.7"/> they're interested in local politics <pause dur="0.6"/> they might be interested in hammering the French on the battlefield <pause dur="0.9"/> but they are not interested <pause dur="0.7"/> in <pause dur="0.4"/> what the likes of Treitschke <pause dur="0.4"/> or <pause dur="0.2"/> Lasker or Bamberger <pause dur="0.7"/> have to say about <pause dur="0.3"/> legal reform <pause dur="1.0"/> and they certainly don't see <pause dur="0.5"/> the National Liberal Party <pause dur="0.5"/> as <pause dur="0.5"/> their natural party of representation <pause dur="1.9"/> the Liberals had <pause dur="0.2"/> no grassroots support <pause dur="2.5"/> Roman Catholics however <pause dur="0.9"/> can mobilize <pause dur="0.3"/> mass <pause dur="0.2"/> support <pause dur="1.3"/> often anti-national support <pause dur="3.1"/> the Catholic Church <pause dur="0.2"/> has the ability to mobilize <pause dur="0.6"/> huge numbers of voters <pause dur="2.8"/> and the Liberals <pause dur="0.4"/> are quite <pause dur="0.2"/> simply <pause dur="0.4"/> terrified <pause dur="0.4"/> of doing very badly in the elections <pause dur="0.2"/> they claim to be the natural representatives <pause dur="0.4"/> of the new state of the new order <pause dur="0.7"/> but 
in fact in a Germany that is still largely particularist <pause dur="0.9"/> and which is not persuaded by the rhetoric of Prussian domination <pause dur="0.7"/> the Liberals <pause dur="0.7"/> are in a very weak <pause dur="0.2"/> position <pause dur="1.2"/> in terms of how well they'll do <pause dur="0.2"/> in elections <pause dur="2.1"/> Bismarck <pause dur="1.0"/> who wants <pause dur="0.2"/> parliamentary <pause dur="0.3"/> backing <pause dur="1.1"/> in order to legitimate <pause dur="0.7"/> his rather <pause dur="0.3"/> authoritarian style of rule <pause dur="1.8"/> is aware <pause dur="1.2"/> first and foremost <pause dur="0.4"/> that he can use the Kulturkampf he can use the persecution of the Catholics <pause dur="0.3"/> as a way of keeping the Liberals sweet <pause dur="1.8"/> and here you get one of the paradoxes of <pause dur="0.7"/> the nature of <pause dur="0.7"/> German history <pause dur="0.5"/> and that is that the most marked characteristic <pause dur="0.9"/> of <pause dur="0.2"/> German Liberals is a fundamental illiberalism <pause dur="2.0"/> that they are not prepared to let people hold <pause dur="0.3"/> beliefs freely <pause dur="1.4"/> if people have beliefs that they don't find congenial <pause dur="0.3"/> they're prepared to persecute them <pause dur="0.5"/> Bismarck realizes that the Liberals see the Catholics as a threat <pause dur="0.2"/> that the Liberals see the Catholics as obscurantist <pause dur="0.2"/> as medievalist as backward looking <pause dur="0.2"/> and therefore he's prepared to persecute them <pause dur="0.2"/> to 
guarantee Liberal support <pause dur="0.3"/> in <pause dur="1.1"/> Parliament <pause dur="0.2"/> and note <pause dur="0.6"/> not only the Conservatives but the National Liberals and the Progressives <pause dur="0.2"/> and the Socialists <pause dur="0.2"/> all back <pause dur="0.8"/> anti-Catholic legislation <pause dur="2.9"/> he distracts those people from facing other issues <pause dur="0.3"/> by <pause dur="0.2"/> persecuting Catholicism <pause dur="1.8"/> but Bismarck is sharper even than that because he realizes <pause dur="0.4"/> that Catholicism <pause dur="0.8"/> can be <pause dur="0.4"/> a rallying point for discontent <pause dur="4.0"/> the Zentrum <pause dur="3.7"/> is backed by Hanoverian Guelphs by Hanoverians who don't like Prussian rule <pause dur="1.1"/> it's backed by the newly acquired French population of Alsace-Lorraine <pause dur="1.2"/> who have been annexed <pause dur="0.2"/> in the eighteen-seventy seventy-one war <pause dur="1.4"/> they're backed by the Poles <pause dur="0.4"/> and they're backed <pause dur="0.2"/> by <pause dur="0.2"/> Danish <pause dur="0.2"/> secessionists <pause dur="0.3"/> in other words the <pause dur="0.2"/> <trunc>s</trunc> Catholic Centre party <pause dur="0.3"/> becomes the rallying point the focus point <pause dur="0.3"/> for anti-national anti-Prussian sentiment <pause dur="4.7"/> Bismarck <pause dur="0.2"/> also fears <pause dur="1.2"/> that <pause dur="0.8"/> most of the likely enemies of the new German state <pause dur="0.5"/> the Habsburg empire <pause dur="0.6"/> France <pause dur="1.4"/> are actually Catholic powers and that Catholicism might become a 
rallying point for anti-<pause dur="0.6"/>German <pause dur="0.2"/> feeling <pause dur="4.7"/> so he aims to <pause dur="0.2"/> break a potential centre of opposition <pause dur="2.3"/> he acts from the belief that it's necessary to act <pause dur="0.3"/> in a dynamic and aggressive way <pause dur="3.3"/> and he also acts for one other reason <pause dur="1.0"/> Windthorst <pause dur="0.3"/> the leader of the Catholic Centre Party <pause dur="0.8"/> is a man <pause dur="0.7"/> who Bismarck <pause dur="0.6"/> personally <pause dur="0.5"/> hates <pause dur="1.1"/> Bismarck famously said that he could live for any one of three people <pause dur="1.1"/> his king <pause dur="1.0"/> because he honoured <pause dur="0.2"/> and respected <pause dur="0.4"/> and worked for him as <pause dur="0.7"/> his natural ruler <pause dur="0.9"/> his wife because he loved her so much <pause dur="1.2"/> and Ludwig Windthorst because he hated him with such utter passion <pause dur="0.4"/> that that loathing alone <pause dur="0.4"/> would give him enough to live for <pause dur="1.2"/> Windthorst is the anathema of Bismarck <pause dur="0.9"/> Windthorst <pause dur="0.4"/> is <pause dur="0.5"/> a hunchbacked <pause dur="1.0"/> almost blind <pause dur="0.6"/> intellectual <pause dur="0.7"/> Catholic <pause dur="0.4"/> anti-nationalist <pause dur="1.3"/> Bismarck is this man he's this big <pause dur="0.7"/> anti-intellectual <pause dur="0.3"/> hard-drinking <pause dur="0.4"/> hard-eating hard-living huge <distinct lang="de">Junker</distinct> <pause dur="0.8"/> they're chalk and cheese they just don't get on with one another <pause dur="0.8"/> also Windthorst's cousin i believe it is and i can't quite 
remember whether it's a cousin or a brother <pause dur="0.2"/> is the only person to have ever beaten <pause dur="0.3"/> Bismarck in a duel <pause dur="0.5"/> it just adds a little <pause dur="0.5"/> frisson to the relationship <pause dur="1.5"/> but the personal hostility between the two of them <pause dur="0.8"/> increases <pause dur="0.6"/> Bismarck's <pause dur="0.8"/> desire <pause dur="0.3"/> to persecute the Catholics <pause dur="3.5"/> and yet <pause dur="0.8"/> what is the upshot of the persecution of the Catholics <pause dur="2.2"/> rather than destroying them <pause dur="0.3"/> it simply strengthens them <pause dur="0.7"/> in the face of adversity <pause dur="0.4"/> the Catholic vote <pause dur="0.3"/> doubles <pause dur="0.6"/> in eighteen-seventy-four <pause dur="1.4"/> and by eighteen-eighty-one the Catholics control <pause dur="0.4"/> a hundred seats in the Reichstag <pause dur="2.8"/> for the next fifty years <pause dur="0.2"/> they often hold the balance of power <pause dur="0.3"/> and are involved in almost every single parliamentary majority <pause dur="1.1"/> they are the last <pause dur="0.2"/> German <pause dur="0.2"/> party to exist under the Third Reich <pause dur="0.2"/> except for the Nazis <pause dur="0.7"/> they and they they develop a <trunc>ren</trunc> remarkable political durability <pause dur="2.8"/> by eighteen-seventy-six <pause dur="0.8"/> their two chief enemies <pause dur="0.6"/> are Bismarck <pause dur="0.5"/> and the National Liberals all the National Liberals hate <pause dur="0.2"/> the Catholic Party <pause dur="0.3"/> with the exception of two <pause dur="0.4"/> 
Lasker <pause dur="0.3"/> and Bamberger <pause dur="0.8"/> two two of <pause dur="0.2"/> the leadership Lasker and Bamberger <pause dur="0.3"/> can anyone tell me why Lasker and Bamberger alone might have been <pause dur="2.7"/> less reluctant to persecute the Catholics <pause dur="3.8"/> they're both Jews <pause dur="1.8"/> and they realize that persecution of religious minorities is probably not a good thing for Jews to advocate <pause dur="3.5"/> the irony is that <pause dur="0.2"/> in eighteen-seventy-nine Bismarck suddenly backs down <pause dur="1.1"/> why <pause dur="2.3"/> it's quite simple <pause dur="0.8"/> Bismarck begins to get fed up with the National Liberals <pause dur="0.8"/> they won't grant him the money wants he wants <pause dur="0.3"/> to carry on bolstering <pause dur="0.3"/> the Prussian and German armies <pause dur="2.5"/> they are free traders <pause dur="0.4"/> who won't allow him to institute protectionist tariff barriers <pause dur="1.5"/> and moreover <pause dur="0.2"/> by not allowing him to introduce tariff barriers <pause dur="0.6"/> they deny him the possibility of raising revenue <pause dur="0.4"/> from tariff<pause dur="0.9"/>s on the borders of Germany <pause dur="0.3"/> which he can use without parliamentary consent to spend on the army <pause dur="2.5"/> his fiscal policy coupled with his hostility to the anti-militarism of the National Liberals <pause dur="0.4"/> means he begins 
to think i want to be shot <pause dur="0.2"/> of this political group <pause dur="2.2"/> so he has to start looking around for another party to back him <pause dur="0.2"/> in Parliament <pause dur="1.1"/> the Conservatives are there <pause dur="0.7"/> always more or less loyal because they're <distinct lang="de">Junkers</distinct> but <pause dur="0.4"/> not very effectively organized in political terms <pause dur="0.7"/> he needs to maintain the parliamentary majority <pause dur="1.1"/> who's got a quarter of the seats <pause dur="0.4"/> the Centre Party <pause dur="1.6"/> Bismarck's extreme political opportunism <pause dur="1.5"/> means that <pause dur="0.5"/> people who have been the vilified enemies of the German state <pause dur="1.5"/> for the last eight or nine years <pause dur="0.5"/> suddenly become his friends <pause dur="1.9"/> if the Centre Party <pause dur="0.2"/> will back his tariff reform <pause dur="2.0"/> fine <pause dur="0.6"/> he'll do a deal with them <pause dur="1.4"/> he sacks Falk <pause dur="0.5"/> the <pause dur="0.9"/> arch anti-Catholic Minister of Culture <pause dur="0.3"/> and religion <pause dur="2.2"/> he <pause dur="0.6"/> allows exiled clergy <pause dur="0.2"/> to return <pause dur="0.7"/> at a stroke of a pen he gets rid of the May Laws <pause dur="0.4"/> he does keep civil marriage he does not let the Jesuits back in <pause dur="2.3"/> but <pause dur="0.5"/> married to the fact <pause dur="0.9"/> that <pause dur="0.3"/> in eighteen-seventy-eight Pius the Ninth has <pause dur="0.2"/> finally <pause dur="1.3"/> and much to the relief of Catholics as well as non-Catholics 
died <pause dur="0.6"/> and been replaced by the more conciliatory Leo the Thirteenth <pause dur="1.5"/> he <pause dur="1.1"/> suddenly jettisons anti-Catholicism <pause dur="1.3"/> and embarks <pause dur="0.4"/> on <pause dur="0.2"/> a road of conciliation <pause dur="0.5"/> with <pause dur="0.2"/> the Catholic Party <pause dur="1.1"/> i think this gives a remarkable insight into the operations of Bismarck <pause dur="0.2"/> as <pause dur="0.2"/> a <pause dur="1.0"/> politician <pause dur="1.1"/> Bismarck is a man who has <pause dur="0.9"/> broad <pause dur="1.7"/> strategic goals <pause dur="0.7"/> Prussian strength <pause dur="1.2"/> German strength <pause dur="0.9"/> a basically conservative order <pause dur="2.1"/> but in terms of short term strategies <pause dur="0.3"/> he's prepared <pause dur="0.4"/> to <pause dur="0.5"/> move with the wind <pause dur="1.7"/> and it is this readiness <pause dur="0.3"/> to <pause dur="0.6"/> switch his allies <pause dur="0.9"/> change his policies <pause dur="1.0"/> alter his position <pause dur="1.7"/> in order to achieve broader <trunc>g</trunc> goals <pause dur="0.5"/> that actually <pause dur="0.2"/> lies at the heart <pause dur="0.2"/> of his political <pause dur="0.2"/> durability <pause dur="1.5"/> and next week we will <pause dur="0.3"/> actually when we look at Wilhelmine Germany we'll see very much more how <pause dur="0.4"/> Bismarck <pause dur="0.4"/> manages to retain <pause dur="0.6"/> control <pause dur="0.5"/> of the new <pause dur="0.3"/> Reich <pause dur="0.2"/> for so long <pause dur="0.6"/> and creates a legacy <pause dur="0.8"/> that <pause dur="1.1"/> causes major problems for Wilhelmine Germany <pause dur="0.3"/> in the lead-up <pause dur="0.2"/> to the First World War <pause dur="1.0"/> okay remember tomorrow <pause dur="0.2"/> there's a change of room <pause dur="0.8"/> see you all then
