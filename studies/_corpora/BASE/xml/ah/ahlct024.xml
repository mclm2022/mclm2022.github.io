<u who="nm0087"> okay <pause dur="0.8"/> Leopold von Ranke <pause dur="1.5"/> he's dead <pause dur="0.7"/> and he's German <pause dur="0.6"/> but do we need to know more about him <pause dur="0.3"/> well we probably do <pause dur="0.5"/> even though he's not a historian who is read <pause dur="0.2"/> all that much today perhaps more than most historians <pause dur="0.3"/> of that time <pause dur="0.6"/> i should # add at this point by the way before i claim any # <pause dur="0.2"/> credit or otherwise that the lecture i'm about to give is actually the lecture normally given by Dr <gap reason="name" extent="2 words"/> <pause dur="0.4"/> who's kindly given me his lecture notes and <pause dur="0.3"/> while i've added one or two details <pause dur="0.3"/> the # substance of the lecture today <pause dur="0.3"/> is almost all his so # <pause dur="0.3"/> he's with us in spirit and # <pause dur="0.3"/> any questions that you have should probably be directed to him <pause dur="0.3"/> rather than me as he is the # <pause dur="0.4"/> the only begetter <pause dur="0.3"/> of this lecture <pause dur="1.4"/> so # <gap reason="name" extent="2 words"/> actually told me the other day that <pause dur="0.2"/> Ranke <pause dur="0.3"/> some of his writings on diplomatic history in the late nineteenth century <pause dur="0.3"/> is still someone whom he recommend <pause dur="0.3"/> to students to read <pause dur="0.4"/> on various subjects <pause dur="0.2"/> and so it is the case that some of what he's written <pause dur="0.3"/> is still read 
today as history <pause dur="0.5"/> but that's not <pause dur="0.2"/> probably the main reason <pause dur="0.2"/> that <pause dur="0.3"/> we <pause dur="0.2"/> we # we ask you to look at him in this historiography course <pause dur="0.5"/> # in nineteen-ninety-nine <pause dur="1.2"/> other things <pause dur="0.3"/> which owe a lot to his influence perhaps are not so immediately obvious <pause dur="0.4"/> but the fact for instance that you've been studying for most of the last two-and-a-half years in seminar groups <pause dur="0.4"/> and the fact that you've # learned how to use the footnote function on Microsoft Word <pause dur="0.4"/> are indirectly tributes to Ranke <pause dur="0.4"/> who was one of the most important <pause dur="0.4"/> # historians <pause dur="0.3"/> in using these new as they were in the nineteenth century <pause dur="0.3"/> new methods to try and put forward a new <pause dur="0.3"/> scientific type of history <pause dur="0.3"/> getting away from the more sort of romantic and unobjective sort of history <pause dur="0.3"/> that had existed before he didn't invent these methods <pause dur="0.2"/> but he was very influential <pause dur="0.3"/> in popularizing them so # <pause dur="0.3"/> seminars and # footnotes are at least some of the # the legacies of Ranke <pause dur="0.2"/> you might say <pause dur="1.6"/> in the lecture plan that you'll see on the # <pause dur="0.2"/> the 
handout <pause dur="0.6"/> i'll just briefly go through what we're going to <pause dur="0.2"/> go through today first of all <pause dur="0.5"/> we're going to talk a little bit about who Ranke was <pause dur="0.5"/> where he came from what his intellectual background was <pause dur="0.4"/> and why <pause dur="0.2"/> he decided to become <pause dur="0.3"/> a historian <pause dur="1.1"/> we'll then talk a bit about the way in which he studied history which is probably the most important thing you'll take away <pause dur="0.2"/> i hope from the lecture but also from your reading <pause dur="0.2"/> and your seminars <pause dur="0.3"/> on Ranke <pause dur="0.3"/> in other words the ideas that changed the way in which historians <pause dur="0.2"/> think about <pause dur="0.3"/> history <pause dur="0.8"/> we'll talk a bit about the kind of history that went before and therefore what <pause dur="0.2"/> Ranke was # reacting against <pause dur="0.5"/> and then we'll finish off <pause dur="0.3"/> by talking a bit about the dangers <pause dur="0.2"/> with # the methods that Ranke <pause dur="0.3"/> wanted to put forward <pause dur="0.9"/> so that's the # <pause dur="0.2"/> plan for today and <pause dur="0.4"/> if you look at the back of the lecture sheet you can see how we'll <pause dur="0.3"/> map through that <pause dur="2.4"/> Ranke was probably the most prolific and most influential professor of history <pause dur="0.7"/> anywhere in Europe in the 
nineteenth century <pause dur="1.3"/> his ideas lived on into into of the # works of a lot of twentieth century historians <pause dur="0.3"/> including Geoffrey Elton who you may have come across in your reading before <pause dur="0.3"/> relatively conservative British historian <pause dur="0.6"/> although others of his ideas <pause dur="0.2"/> already were beginning to look <pause dur="0.3"/> old hat <pause dur="0.3"/> during the nineteenth century <pause dur="1.0"/> he wrote <pause dur="0.3"/> a lot <pause dur="0.4"/> he lived for ninety years admittedly but <pause dur="0.2"/> even during that time <pause dur="0.4"/> he still managed to publish sixty-three very large volumes of history which is # <pause dur="0.2"/> pretty good going <pause dur="0.6"/> and # <pause dur="0.3"/> in this century <pause dur="0.4"/> six more volumes were published after his death <pause dur="0.3"/> of his lectures <pause dur="0.2"/> diaries <pause dur="0.3"/> and correspondence <pause dur="0.2"/> so there's a great deal of Ranke's writing <pause dur="0.3"/> out there <pause dur="0.4"/> all of which you'll be expected to read of course by the end of next week for the seminar <pause dur="1.7"/><vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" dur="1" n="ss"/> he # for the last fifteen years of his life <pause dur="0.3"/> was blind <pause dur="0.2"/> and he relied on # <pause dur="0.2"/> dictating to <pause dur="0.2"/> scribes who would write down <pause dur="0.3"/> what he was saying <pause dur="0.4"/> including # his nine volumes of Ranke's world history <pause dur="0.3"/> which # <pause dur="0.3"/> oddly enough 
was actually unfinished by his death <pause dur="0.3"/> and only reached the early modern period <pause dur="1.2"/> all of his life <pause dur="0.3"/> he wanted to write <pause dur="0.2"/> world history <pause dur="0.3"/> and here you have this whole kind of stream of thinking which you know about from previous courses <pause dur="0.3"/> the Enlightenment and so on very much influencing <pause dur="0.3"/> people like Ranke <pause dur="0.4"/> everyone trying to find <pause dur="0.3"/> the ultimate knowledge that would let you solve anything the whole sort of <pause dur="0.3"/> # legacy of the # <pause dur="0.2"/> the age of reason there <pause dur="1.2"/> however on his way towards this world history in the previous sort of <pause dur="0.2"/> sixty-odd years <pause dur="0.4"/> Ranke was diverted <pause dur="0.3"/> into writing numerous national histories <pause dur="0.2"/> which were going to be the sort of building blocks for this ultimate universal history <pause dur="0.3"/> that he was planning to write <pause dur="1.2"/> his quality has to be judged <pause dur="0.2"/> by the multivolume works of his mature period <pause dur="0.4"/> and these are the histories of the papacy <pause dur="0.7"/> of Germany in the age of Reformation <pause dur="0.5"/> and also of England and France <pause dur="0.2"/> in early modern times <pause dur="1.5"/> his motto for what he was doing was <pause dur="0.3"/> <distinct lang="la">labor ipse voluptas</distinct> <pause dur="0.4"/> meaning work 
itself <pause dur="0.2"/> is pleasure <pause dur="0.5"/> with the kind of hint that word <distinct lang="la">voluptas</distinct> if any of you sort of done Latin <pause dur="0.4"/> will know that it means sort of kind of <pause dur="0.2"/> pleasure of an almost sort of erotic and sexual kind <pause dur="0.8"/> you may or may not wish to relate that to the fact that he didn't actually get married till he was forty-eight <pause dur="0.5"/><vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" dur="1" n="ss"/> and he used to write letters to his brother <pause dur="0.8"/> about caressing documents in the archives <pause dur="0.3"/><vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" dur="1" n="ss"/> as if they were loved ones <pause dur="0.3"/> now one critic Krieger <pause dur="0.5"/> # put a Freudian kind of spin on this and # other statements he made trying to show that this showed that Ranke was sort of you know <pause dur="0.5"/> # you know getting off with these documents instead of off # with # with his wife <pause dur="0.4"/> but # it is entirely possible of course that he may be making a joke this is something that Freudian critics don't always # <pause dur="0.4"/> take on board <pause dur="1.3"/> and # the critic # Nicholas # i think it's Nicholas Kenyon <pause dur="0.3"/> pointed out in a review of Krieger that <pause dur="0.5"/> quotes <reading>just as Ranke needed to write history for 
self-fulfillment <pause dur="0.3"/> so he needed also to torment himself <pause dur="0.2"/> on his motives <pause dur="0.2"/> for doing so</reading> <pause dur="0.2"/> so a very kind of you know Freudian thing there you know kind of the pleasure and the pain all together <pause dur="0.4"/> and certainly although there must have been pleasure there must have been an awful lot of pain in writing sixty-three <pause dur="0.3"/> fat volumes of history <pause dur="0.4"/> as well <pause dur="1.2"/> the one thing he didn't write a whole volume on ever which is a bit ironic from the point of view of this course <pause dur="0.4"/> is on what he thought he was doing <pause dur="0.3"/> on the nature of history <pause dur="0.5"/> he only wrote fragments about this subject in the prefaces to his main works <pause dur="0.3"/> in some in the lectures he sometimes gave <pause dur="0.3"/> and in occasional essays <pause dur="0.4"/> so we're basically putting together all these other bits of evidence <pause dur="0.2"/> to try and produce a picture <pause dur="0.3"/> of what Ranke actually thought <pause dur="0.3"/> about the way you should write <pause dur="0.2"/> history <pause dur="1.5"/> in that picture <pause dur="0.3"/> there are two main ideas <pause dur="0.2"/> that you need to keep in mind <pause dur="0.7"/> first of all <pause dur="0.6"/> Ranke was not <pause dur="0.2"/> just a <pause dur="0.3"/> fact man he wasn't just 
sitting there writing down you know kind of a narrative of <pause dur="0.3"/> this happened in sixteen-eighty-four and then this happened in sixteen-eighty-five <pause dur="0.3"/> and all that sort of thing <pause dur="0.6"/> he was not <pause dur="0.3"/> just <pause dur="0.2"/> doing that # he was not just doing a sort of political narrative <pause dur="0.9"/> the second point to keep in mind which is <pause dur="0.3"/> related to that <pause dur="0.5"/> is that <pause dur="0.9"/> rather like Karl Marx <pause dur="0.6"/> Ranke <pause dur="0.3"/> had <pause dur="0.3"/> stages as a thinker <pause dur="0.3"/> so there's an early Ranke <pause dur="0.3"/> a middle Ranke <pause dur="0.3"/> and a late Ranke just as people talk about late Marx or <pause dur="0.2"/> early Marx <pause dur="0.8"/> early Ranke is probably up till about eighteen-thirty <pause dur="0.6"/> the mature Ranke is about eighteen-thirty to the early eighteen-sixties <pause dur="0.5"/> and the late Ranke <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> as interpreted by <pause dur="0.3"/> the later Rankeans in other words his pupils <pause dur="0.5"/> was # <pause dur="0.7"/> after the eighteen-sixties until his death <pause dur="1.4"/> now obviously the people who came last people like his students were trying to later suggest that what he believed late in his life <pause dur="0.3"/> was what he believed all of his life sort of airbrushing over the past <pause dur="0.3"/> but we need to actually get 
back and look at what he was saying throughout his life <pause dur="0.3"/> to understand how his thought <pause dur="0.3"/> developed <pause dur="0.7"/> and of course the one thing you cannot expect <pause dur="0.8"/> i'm sure you wouldn't expect <pause dur="0.3"/> is that the man's going to be completely consistent for the entire sixty-odd years <pause dur="0.3"/> that he was writing history <pause dur="0.5"/> 'cause he was constantly rethinking <pause dur="0.2"/> his approach and so you will find <pause dur="0.3"/> contradictions <pause dur="0.3"/> in what he said about history <pause dur="1.4"/> what we can do today <pause dur="0.3"/> is to draw attention <pause dur="0.2"/> to certain themes that preoccupied Ranke <pause dur="0.3"/> throughout his career <pause dur="0.6"/> and occasional glances at the way in which that <pause dur="0.2"/> that changed <pause dur="1.3"/> so we're going to look at the way in which he was a product of his time <pause dur="0.7"/> the nature <pause dur="0.2"/> degree of originality of his contribution <pause dur="0.3"/> to the development of historical studies <pause dur="0.8"/> the philosophical underpinning of his method <pause dur="0.5"/> and the dangers and shortcoming <pause dur="0.3"/> # presented <pause dur="2.7"/> okay <pause dur="0.3"/> let's talk now a bit a ben then about <pause dur="0.3"/> Ranke's life particularly his background <pause dur="1.5"/> he was very largely influenced by his religious upbringing <pause dur="0.3"/> and 
that's important to know <pause dur="0.9"/> as well as that the political events of a century <pause dur="0.5"/> # most of which he experienced 'cause he lived throughout <pause dur="0.7"/> most of the nineteenth century <pause dur="0.6"/> and of course his educational training was important too <pause dur="1.6"/> so first <pause dur="0.4"/> his forefathers in the male line were all Lutheran pastors <pause dur="0.4"/> with the exception of his father <pause dur="0.2"/> who was a lawyer <pause dur="1.0"/> but Ranke himself <pause dur="0.2"/> was not an orthodox Lutheran <pause dur="0.7"/> he disliked the institutions of the contemporary church <pause dur="0.3"/> and its doctrine <pause dur="0.3"/> which at that time was supported by highly <pause dur="0.2"/> rationalist <pause dur="0.2"/> arguments <pause dur="0.2"/> and again this is the legacy of the Enlightenment and so on <pause dur="1.3"/> Ranke was not <pause dur="0.2"/> rationalist in that very strict sense <pause dur="0.2"/> he was more in the sort of mystical tradition pietist you might say <pause dur="0.4"/> saying that you couldn't know God <pause dur="0.2"/> through doctrine <pause dur="0.3"/> you had to know him through history <pause dur="0.7"/> in other words <pause dur="0.4"/> Ranke saw the hand of God <pause dur="0.3"/> at work <pause dur="0.2"/> in <pause dur="0.3"/> history <pause dur="0.3"/> in <gap reason="name" extent="2 words"/>'s notes say <pause dur="0.3"/> rather like Maradona <pause dur="0.2"/> so # so that's the comparison that came to <pause dur="0.2"/> his mind <pause dur="1.5"/> therefore for 
Ranke <pause dur="0.8"/> history was a holy hieroglyph <pause dur="0.4"/> whose deciphering was in effect a sacred priestly type of calling <pause dur="0.6"/> <reading>historical writing</reading> wrote Ranke <pause dur="0.3"/> <reading>is an office which can only be compared to that of the priest</reading> <pause dur="0.8"/> and it was his # <pause dur="0.3"/> in a sense his religious calling really rather more than any of the supposed sexual urges <pause dur="0.3"/> that were sublimated <pause dur="0.2"/> in his work <pause dur="0.2"/> as a historian in other words he wasn't going to become a priest <pause dur="0.3"/> so he but he did decide <pause dur="0.2"/> to become a historian there's two aspects of <trunc>th</trunc> <pause dur="0.4"/> of the same part of his character <pause dur="1.8"/> okay what was going on around Ranke then well his early life <trunc>cons</trunc> coincided <pause dur="0.3"/> with <pause dur="0.2"/> the French Revolution <pause dur="0.7"/> followed of course by Napoleon's invasion of the German states <pause dur="0.3"/> including Saxony <pause dur="0.3"/> where Ranke was born <pause dur="0.8"/> and then of course <pause dur="0.2"/> the Restoration <pause dur="0.3"/> of eighteen-fifteen <pause dur="0.5"/> now all of these events war turmoil revolution and 
so on <pause dur="0.4"/> actually turned him <pause dur="0.4"/> into a very conservative <pause dur="0.2"/> character <pause dur="0.5"/> he had a big <trunc>s</trunc> a great suspicion <pause dur="0.3"/> of <pause dur="0.3"/> Enlightenment ideas which we may think are all about rationality and so on <pause dur="0.3"/> but Ranke saw the result of <pause dur="0.4"/> and he held them responsible <pause dur="0.3"/> for political chaos <pause dur="1.4"/> so <pause dur="0.4"/> he believed therefore in an allegiance to the monarchy <pause dur="0.6"/> and the principle <pause dur="0.2"/> of the balance of power <pause dur="0.4"/> which was of course famously <pause dur="0.3"/> the result <pause dur="0.2"/> of the eighteen-fifteen <pause dur="0.2"/> political settlement and <pause dur="0.2"/> you know the famous <pause dur="0.3"/> thing supposedly is that it kept <pause dur="0.4"/> the broad peace in Europe <pause dur="0.2"/> for ninety-nine years <pause dur="0.2"/> until the outbreak <pause dur="0.2"/> of <pause dur="0.2"/> the First World War <pause dur="0.6"/> and that was fine as far as Ranke went <pause dur="1.7"/> the career of Napoleon <pause dur="0.2"/> who again obviously Ranke had looked at with some interest <pause dur="0.5"/> gave pause for thought <pause dur="0.4"/> that great men could influence <pause dur="0.2"/> the cause <pause dur="0.2"/> # the course <pause dur="0.2"/> of <pause dur="0.3"/> history <pause dur="0.6"/> because Napoleon's defeat <pause dur="0.2"/> showed that forces of continuity <pause dur="0.3"/> were at work in the states and the nations <pause dur="0.3"/> that were able to resist Napoleon's attack <pause dur="0.5"/> but that also history could 
sometimes at least temporarily <pause dur="0.3"/> be diverted from its course <pause dur="0.4"/> by an individual <pause dur="0.2"/> who had sufficient greatness <pause dur="0.3"/> in other words <pause dur="0.2"/> history's always kind of going in a straight line <pause dur="0.3"/> in effect <pause dur="0.4"/> but someone like Napoleon can briefly wrench it to the side <pause dur="0.4"/> and the other forces of order have to sort of work quite hard <pause dur="0.3"/> to bring it back <pause dur="1.7"/> Ranke's drift towards this <pause dur="0.2"/> conservative position was reinforced by the threats posed <pause dur="0.3"/> by the July revolution of eighteen-thirty <pause dur="0.5"/> and the revolutionary outbreaks <pause dur="0.2"/> of eighteen-forty-eight <pause dur="0.5"/> and then of course by the unification of Germany <pause dur="0.3"/> in eighteen-seventy-one <pause dur="0.7"/> at first he had not been in favour of this <pause dur="0.2"/> because it excluded Austria which he thought <pause dur="0.3"/> ought to have been <pause dur="0.2"/> included <pause dur="1.6"/> now because Ranke served the Prussian monarchy in various capacities <pause dur="0.4"/> and had regular correspondence with the king of Bavaria <pause dur="0.3"/> and the foreign ministers of Prussia <pause dur="0.3"/> and Austria <pause dur="0.4"/> and later even with Bismarck <pause dur="0.5"/> Karl Marx <pause dur="0.3"/> once rather contemptuously called him <kinesic desc="makes quotation mark gesture" iterated="n"/> quotes <pause dur="0.3"/> a born 
palace servant <pause dur="0.2"/> in other words kind of a <pause dur="0.2"/> a <trunc>li</trunc> # a lickspittle <pause dur="0.8"/> there's an element of truth <pause dur="0.3"/> in this accusation <pause dur="0.5"/> although it's true <pause dur="0.2"/> also <pause dur="0.2"/> that Ranke <pause dur="0.3"/> turned to the Prussian government <pause dur="0.3"/> mainly because it was willing to give him <pause dur="0.2"/> financial support <pause dur="0.3"/> for his research abroad <pause dur="0.4"/> which his institution <pause dur="0.2"/> the University of Berlin which he was a professor at <pause dur="0.3"/> refused to do <pause dur="0.5"/> nothing much changes if you ever try and get research money out of this university you'd find it # equally hard <pause dur="0.5"/> not that i've yet been # <pause dur="0.4"/> asked to go and # <pause dur="0.4"/> # play lickspittle to Tony Blair and get money in return for it but one can always live in hope <pause dur="0.8"/> so Ranke's loyalty to the Prussian state <pause dur="0.3"/> was not <pause dur="0.2"/> therefore <pause dur="0.2"/> unqualified <pause dur="0.3"/> it was partly to do <pause dur="0.2"/> with their <pause dur="0.2"/> sponsorship of him <pause dur="1.8"/> okay let's think then about <pause dur="0.2"/> what it was that Ranke was studying <pause dur="0.2"/> at university <pause dur="0.6"/> now he had trained as a philologist <pause dur="0.5"/> he applied <pause dur="0.3"/> textual criticism <pause dur="0.3"/> which was something that had been developing since the Renaissance <pause dur="0.4"/> he applied it to the 
study of literature <pause dur="0.4"/> and then <pause dur="0.5"/> moved from literature to taking a textual analysis <pause dur="0.2"/> of the ancient historian <pause dur="0.3"/> Thucydides <pause dur="0.3"/> and then later <pause dur="0.3"/> the works of Martin Luther <pause dur="1.1"/> he only became a historian of the more modern era <pause dur="0.4"/> later on <pause dur="0.6"/> he first of all became a school teacher <pause dur="0.3"/> applying the skills he had learned earlier <pause dur="0.3"/> to modern <pause dur="0.2"/> historical sources <pause dur="0.7"/> he also reacted at this point <pause dur="0.8"/> against <pause dur="0.3"/> what you might call the philosophical school <pause dur="0.3"/> of historians <pause dur="0.3"/> and we'll say a bit more about that later on <pause dur="0.7"/> and also against the Romantic historians <pause dur="0.3"/> of whom the most foremost <pause dur="0.3"/> was <pause dur="0.2"/> the British # writer <pause dur="0.2"/> Sir Walter Scott <pause dur="1.2"/> between about eighteen-ten and eighteen-twenty-three <pause dur="0.4"/> Sir Walter Scott's works swept across Europe <pause dur="0.8"/> and # Ranke disliked intensely <pause dur="0.3"/> the ways in which he saw <pause dur="0.5"/> correctly <pause dur="0.3"/> that Scott <pause dur="0.2"/> had either distorted his sources <pause dur="0.4"/> or relied on them <pause dur="0.2"/> so slavishly <pause dur="0.3"/> that he refused to criticize them and suggest that maybe they weren't telling the absolute truth <pause dur="0.5"/> but <pause dur="0.4"/> were biased in their own way <pause dur="0.4"/> so Ranke was 
attempting to react <pause dur="0.2"/> against that <pause dur="1.8"/> and that brings us to the next section which is to think about what Ranke himself contributed to <pause dur="0.3"/> the historical field <pause dur="1.4"/> well first <pause dur="0.8"/> Ranke insisted on using sources <pause dur="0.3"/> close to the events described <pause dur="0.7"/> and this may obviously you know seem obvious to us now <pause dur="0.3"/> but at the time <pause dur="0.2"/> it really was something <pause dur="0.2"/> of a breakthrough <pause dur="0.8"/> he also insisted on subjecting all sources of whatever period <pause dur="0.3"/> to critical analysis <pause dur="0.5"/> so this in practice meant that he searched very hard to find out if something was a forgery and sometimes you know it was <pause dur="0.6"/> he compared sources with one another so that you'd get a sort of # <pause dur="0.8"/> wider view <pause dur="0.3"/> of one particular period <pause dur="0.5"/> and he also placed his sources in their historical context <pause dur="0.8"/> his first book <pause dur="0.3"/> which was the History of the Latin and Teutonic Nations <pause dur="0.4"/> which only dealt with twenty years from fourteen-ninety-four <pause dur="0.3"/> up to # <pause dur="0.3"/> fifteen-fourteen <pause dur="1.6"/> used <pause dur="0.2"/> mainly <pause dur="0.3"/> contemporary Italian historians of the time <pause dur="0.3"/> including people like <pause dur="0.4"/> Giovio <pause dur="6.4"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="4"/> but at 
the same time as using these <pause dur="0.2"/> contemporary Italian sources <pause dur="0.6"/> he also put out another <pause dur="0.2"/> companion volume <pause dur="0.2"/> which criticized their reliability and pointed out things that he could see were loopholes in what they were saying <pause dur="0.4"/> even at the time <pause dur="0.6"/> and most of Ranke's major books <pause dur="0.2"/> had a similar kind of appendix volume <pause dur="0.3"/> of source criticism <pause dur="0.3"/> critiquing <pause dur="0.3"/> the <pause dur="0.3"/> # materials which he used <pause dur="0.3"/> to actually write the book itself <pause dur="1.7"/> after the first book however <pause dur="0.4"/> Ranke discovered <pause dur="0.3"/> manuscript sources <pause dur="0.4"/> especially the reports of the Venetian ambassadors <pause dur="0.2"/> from all around Europe <pause dur="0.8"/> and he spent years in auction houses and at archives in Germany <pause dur="0.3"/> Venice <pause dur="0.2"/> Rome and elsewhere <pause dur="0.3"/> ferreting out these <pause dur="0.4"/> more immediate sources <pause dur="0.3"/> which had not <pause dur="0.2"/> <trunc>pre</trunc> # which had not passed <pause dur="0.3"/> through the prism <pause dur="0.2"/> of a contemporary <pause dur="0.3"/> chronicler's <pause dur="0.2"/> mind <pause dur="0.3"/> in other words <pause dur="0.2"/> people like Giovio <pause dur="0.2"/> were still one step away from <pause dur="0.3"/> you know the ideal in a sense because <pause dur="0.3"/> they were taking contemporary sources but they were putting their own spin on it <pause dur="0.3"/> whereas these <pause dur="0.2"/> original 
documents from the ambassadors <pause dur="0.3"/> were <pause dur="0.2"/> the real thing written at the time without retrospective knowledge <pause dur="0.4"/> and therefore in a sense the purest kind of source <pause dur="0.3"/> to use <pause dur="0.3"/> and we <trunc>d</trunc> operate many very similar assumptions today <pause dur="0.3"/> when writing history <pause dur="1.5"/> so after about eighteen-thirty <pause dur="0.5"/> a lot of archives which had been closed unto that point # up to that point in Europe <pause dur="0.4"/> began very slowly to open up <pause dur="0.3"/> to <pause dur="0.2"/> historians <pause dur="0.4"/> and Ranke was often able to consult <pause dur="0.3"/> material <pause dur="0.3"/> which had not previously been <pause dur="0.3"/> available <pause dur="0.3"/> to <pause dur="0.2"/> historians <pause dur="1.7"/> he at one point said <pause dur="0.4"/> <reading>God must have an archive <pause dur="0.2"/> in heaven</reading> <pause dur="1.7"/> now he tended to # not be so keen on the more mundane bureaucratic sources <pause dur="0.6"/> # for <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> the # for the for the kind of histories he was writing <pause dur="0.4"/> he was keener on the sort of considered and contrived <pause dur="0.2"/> diplomatic reports <pause dur="0.3"/> the reason being that he thought that foreign observers <pause dur="0.2"/> were actually more qualified than people from a country itself <pause dur="0.4"/> to talk about what was happening there because they had a more sort 
of outside <pause dur="0.4"/> eye <pause dur="0.7"/> he also believed on the same principle <pause dur="0.3"/> that historians should always try <pause dur="0.3"/> and study countries other than their own <pause dur="0.3"/> because they were <pause dur="0.3"/> you know too involved with # the culture of their own place whereas they could look <pause dur="0.4"/> at somewhere else <pause dur="0.2"/> with a much fresher eye <pause dur="2.1"/> what else did he do <pause dur="0.7"/> he developed the methods and the tools of professional <pause dur="0.2"/> history <pause dur="0.8"/> now some of those had been available before <pause dur="0.3"/> such as the editing of texts in other words taking some <pause dur="0.3"/> manuscript source or whatever <pause dur="0.2"/> and publishing edition in which you put sort of side notes and things explaining <pause dur="0.4"/> where it came from who these people were and <pause dur="0.3"/> how to use it <pause dur="0.8"/> also the use of footnotes which i mentioned at the beginning <pause dur="0.4"/> now again he didn't invent these <pause dur="0.3"/> these had been used especially in the previous century the # eighteenth century <pause dur="0.3"/> amongst historians <pause dur="0.3"/> in <pause dur="0.2"/> Göttingen <pause dur="0.3"/> in # <pause dur="0.9"/> in Germany <pause dur="0.5"/> and also by <pause dur="0.2"/> ancient historians <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="9"/> historians of <pause dur="0.5"/> the classical world <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> in # <pause dur="1.4"/> in Germany <pause dur="1.1"/> <trunc>b</trunc> <pause dur="2.2"/> # <pause dur="1.0"/> but Ranke <pause dur="0.4"/> 
was taking a new step by applying these methods <pause dur="0.2"/> for the first time <pause dur="0.3"/> to modern history in other words history since fifteen-hundred <pause dur="0.5"/> and also used them much more systematically <pause dur="0.2"/> than they'd been used before <pause dur="2.1"/> then he also came on to the idea of the research seminar in other words the small group of people <pause dur="0.3"/> swapping <pause dur="0.3"/> great historical thoughts which you know <pause dur="0.2"/> obviously from your own experience <pause dur="0.3"/> here <pause dur="0.7"/> now this kind of seminar again he didn't invent it <pause dur="0.4"/> but it had previously been used mainly for teaching philology in small study groups <pause dur="0.7"/> and it was now used <pause dur="0.2"/> after Ranke <pause dur="0.2"/> for historical studies <pause dur="0.4"/> beginning with meetings which Ranke held <pause dur="0.3"/> in his own house <pause dur="1.2"/> during the course of the century <pause dur="1.0"/> others picked up the baton <pause dur="0.2"/> from <pause dur="0.2"/> Ranke <pause dur="0.5"/> and developed seminars in other universities so the idea that he pioneered <pause dur="0.2"/> then spread out elsewhere <pause dur="0.3"/> throughout the intellectual community <pause dur="0.4"/> of Europe <pause dur="1.0"/> learned journals devoted to history <pause dur="0.2"/> also emerged <pause dur="0.6"/> series of critical editions of documents and texts <pause dur="0.4"/> 
special chairs professorships in history at university <pause dur="0.8"/> the beginning of an academic bookmarket in history <pause dur="0.7"/> and also conferences at which people get together <pause dur="0.4"/> and swap ideas <pause dur="0.4"/> and papers <pause dur="0.2"/> about history <pause dur="0.7"/> these are all developments of the nineteenth century <pause dur="0.3"/> and they # # <trunc>w</trunc> which still underpin professional history today <pause dur="0.3"/> and they all owe a great deal <pause dur="0.3"/> to <pause dur="0.3"/> Ranke <pause dur="1.4"/> in a century when all professionals were beginning to develop their own # <pause dur="0.3"/> expertise <pause dur="0.3"/> Ranke <pause dur="0.3"/> set <pause dur="0.3"/> the standards <pause dur="0.4"/> and this approach <pause dur="0.2"/> had a profound impression on historians <pause dur="0.3"/> in England and America <pause dur="0.4"/> as well <pause dur="2.7"/> now <pause dur="0.4"/> this emphasis on sources and their proper handling <pause dur="0.4"/> is sometimes known by the term <pause dur="0.2"/> scientific history you'll find that <pause dur="0.2"/> in some of your books <pause dur="1.2"/> when you see that though you have to remember <pause dur="0.4"/> that's actually a translation <pause dur="0.4"/> of <pause dur="0.2"/> the German word <pause dur="0.4"/> <distinct lang="de">wissenschaft</distinct> <pause dur="0.4"/> which means <pause dur="0.2"/> not the natural sciences in the sense of physics <pause dur="0.3"/> or chemistry and so on <pause dur="0.4"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="8"/> but means <pause dur="0.5"/> any academic discipline <pause dur="0.6"/> which <pause dur="0.3"/> has its 
own <pause dur="0.4"/> methodology <pause dur="0.4"/> so science is used in a much broader sense <pause dur="0.5"/> # to translate <distinct lang="de">wissenchaft</distinct> <pause dur="0.3"/> than you might expect from its normal use <pause dur="0.4"/> in <pause dur="0.2"/> English <pause dur="3.1"/> Ranke believed in the need for objectivity <pause dur="0.2"/> in two related senses <pause dur="0.5"/> the historian's conclusions <pause dur="0.2"/> had to be of the kind that could be checked against the evidence <pause dur="0.6"/> he also had to preserve his distance from the past <pause dur="0.4"/> and not seek to impose modern standards on it <pause dur="0.8"/> Ranke once wrote <pause dur="0.6"/> <reading>every epoch is directly under God <pause dur="0.5"/> and its value <pause dur="0.3"/> depends not on what comes from it <pause dur="0.4"/> but <trunc>f</trunc> but in its existence itself <pause dur="0.6"/> all generations of mankind <pause dur="0.3"/> are equally justified <pause dur="0.3"/> in the sight <pause dur="0.4"/> of God</reading> <pause dur="0.9"/> therefore <pause dur="0.5"/> what is meant objectivity in practice for instance in his own history <pause dur="0.3"/> was that as a Protestant historian <pause dur="0.3"/> he tried to teach the he tried to treat the popes and the papacy <pause dur="0.3"/> dispassionately <pause dur="0.6"/> although <pause dur="0.2"/> it's still possible when you actually read his history <pause dur="0.3"/> to see 
his prejudices <pause dur="0.2"/> against the Catholic church <pause dur="0.4"/> coming through <pause dur="2.5"/> Ranke was certainly concerned to get the facts right <pause dur="0.4"/> but he was also very much concerned <pause dur="0.2"/> with how you interpret those facts <pause dur="0.6"/> and he insisted on combining accuracy <pause dur="0.4"/> with <pause dur="0.2"/> art <pause dur="0.9"/> he disliked Walter Scott's inaccuracies <pause dur="0.2"/> but he liked his literary style <pause dur="0.7"/> Ranke <pause dur="0.3"/> wanted the big bucks he wanted to write bestsellers for the general public <pause dur="0.3"/> but to have them based <pause dur="0.3"/> on historical veracity <pause dur="0.4"/> and many historians will again tell you today that that's the kind of ideal they'd like to reach whether they <pause dur="0.3"/> do is another matter <pause dur="1.4"/> at the height of his powers Ranke wrote history as drama <pause dur="0.5"/> using all sorts of literary devices such as flashbacks <pause dur="0.3"/> to heighten the sense of excitement <pause dur="1.1"/> when relating political history he didn't try and do a complete narrative A to Z <pause dur="0.3"/> but would take episodes and little stories to illustrate the point <pause dur="0.2"/> he wanted to make <pause dur="0.9"/> he concentrated on what he considered to be <pause dur="0.2"/> significant <pause dur="0.4"/> and his prose operated <pause dur="0.3"/> at three levels <pause dur="0.4"/> the 
events of political history <pause dur="0.4"/> the <trunc>b</trunc> sort of big thread <pause dur="0.5"/> the colourful sort of pen portraits <pause dur="0.2"/> of various characters <pause dur="0.5"/> and then <pause dur="0.2"/> the philosophical reflections <pause dur="0.2"/> that went with it <pause dur="1.0"/> he was much given to writing in terms of the conflict between contrasting trends <pause dur="0.3"/> and their influence <pause dur="0.2"/> on <pause dur="0.2"/> one another <pause dur="0.3"/> in other words continuity versus change <pause dur="0.3"/> the individual versus the community <pause dur="0.4"/> political versus church interests <pause dur="1.2"/> not everyone <pause dur="0.2"/> was an admirer of his style <pause dur="0.6"/> the poet Heinrich Heine <pause dur="0.3"/> called it <pause dur="0.3"/> well cooked mutton with plenty of carrots <pause dur="0.5"/> but Ranke <pause dur="0.4"/> was rarely <pause dur="0.2"/> a dry as a dry as dust historian <pause dur="0.3"/> in other words <pause dur="0.2"/> his concern with scientific accuracy <pause dur="0.3"/> did not mean that he thought he had to write <pause dur="0.2"/> in a boring style <pause dur="2.8"/> the philosophy which underlay Ranke's work was partly a reaction against what he called <pause dur="0.2"/> philosophical history <pause dur="0.5"/> but he also shared <pause dur="0.2"/> some of the assumptions <pause dur="0.2"/> of those <pause dur="0.2"/> he attacked <pause dur="0.9"/> at the same time <pause dur="0.3"/> his historical viewpoint was also shaped <pause dur="0.3"/> by his political <pause dur="0.3"/> and religious <pause dur="0.2"/> outlooks <pause dur="0.9"/> so <pause dur="0.5"/> what was 
he reacting against <pause dur="0.6"/> first of all <pause dur="0.2"/> he was reacting against the mainstream approach <pause dur="0.3"/> of historians <pause dur="0.3"/> who <pause dur="0.3"/> were <pause dur="0.2"/> influenced by <pause dur="0.2"/> the Enlightenment <pause dur="1.4"/> that kind of thinking believed that history <pause dur="0.3"/> was the in effect the working out of certain universal truths <pause dur="0.3"/> about humanity <pause dur="0.3"/> which were the same everywhere <pause dur="0.7"/> and they would believe that the task of the historian was to recognize these universal truths <pause dur="0.3"/> by means of reason <pause dur="0.5"/> and demonstrate their presence in history <pause dur="0.3"/> through selective deployment of the facts <pause dur="0.3"/> in other words <pause dur="0.3"/> you have your basic idea and thesis first and then you <pause dur="0.4"/> cherry pick little facts <pause dur="0.3"/> to try and back this up <pause dur="1.0"/> this was a sort of philosophy of natural law <pause dur="0.3"/> which believed in the idea of progress <pause dur="0.4"/> and saw the past <pause dur="0.3"/> as being mainly important to teach you lessons <pause dur="0.2"/> for the presence <pause dur="0.7"/> and many of its # practitioners emphasized economic <pause dur="0.3"/> and social history <pause dur="1.3"/> now conservatives like Ranke <pause dur="0.3"/> thought all these ideas of progress and everything were terribly dangerous <pause dur="0.3"/> and had given rise to the 
French Revolution <pause dur="0.5"/> and he blamed especially <pause dur="0.3"/> the # <pause dur="0.3"/> the great Enlightenment thinkers we know of <pause dur="0.2"/> Voltaire <pause dur="0.2"/> Montesquieu <pause dur="0.3"/> Diderot <pause dur="0.3"/> and so on <pause dur="0.3"/> the <distinct lang="fr">philosophes</distinct> <pause dur="1.4"/> already in eighteen-twenty-four <pause dur="0.4"/> quite young <pause dur="0.3"/> Ranke had written his famous counterblast <pause dur="0.6"/> he said <pause dur="1.4"/> <reading>history has had assigned to it the office of judging the past <pause dur="0.3"/> and of instructing the present <pause dur="0.3"/> for the benefit <pause dur="0.2"/> of <pause dur="0.2"/> the future <pause dur="0.3"/> ages <pause dur="0.7"/> to such high offices this present work</reading> the book he's writing <pause dur="0.4"/> <reading>does not presume <pause dur="0.4"/> it seeks only to show <pause dur="0.4"/> what <pause dur="0.4"/> actually <pause dur="0.4"/> happened</reading> and this is a key phrase which is # <pause dur="0.7"/> yup <pause dur="0.2"/> down there at the top of your sheet <pause dur="0.3"/> in German <distinct lang="de">wie</distinct> <trunc>ens</trunc> <distinct lang="de">wie es</distinct> <pause dur="0.2"/> <distinct lang="de">eigentlich gewesen</distinct> <pause dur="1.5"/> Ranke wanted to start <pause dur="0.2"/> from the particular <pause dur="0.6"/> in other words specific cases <pause dur="0.3"/> and then from that draw out <pause dur="0.2"/> an idea of the universal <pause dur="0.4"/> not start from some kind of universal view <pause dur="0.3"/> and then go down to it <pause dur="0.2"/> in <trunc>orver</trunc> in order to discover <pause dur="0.3"/> the particular <pause dur="2.0"/> so in this aim <pause dur="0.2"/> Ranke was part of 
a wider movement <pause dur="0.8"/> it didn't just concern history <pause dur="0.2"/> but this anti-movement was known <pause dur="0.3"/> as historicism <pause dur="0.4"/> or # German historian <trunc>j</trunc> # historians just called it historism <pause dur="0.7"/> some critics have said that this word <pause dur="0.2"/> historicism <pause dur="0.4"/> has had so many different meanings in the last century <pause dur="0.4"/> that it's probably best to leave it out because actually a confusing term <pause dur="0.4"/> but it still appears in an awful lot of your books <pause dur="0.3"/> and it has a clear meaning <pause dur="0.3"/> for a particular set of ideas <pause dur="0.3"/> that were prevalent <pause dur="0.3"/> during most of the nineteenth century <pause dur="1.3"/> it has its antecedents <pause dur="0.3"/> in the late Enlightenment <pause dur="0.4"/> as a critique by some Enlightenment thinkers of others <pause dur="0.5"/> in other words Vico's <pause dur="0.3"/> The New Science in seventeen-twenty-three <pause dur="0.4"/> which has the idea that a nation or a society <pause dur="0.3"/> develops through time this idea of progress again <pause dur="0.6"/> or Herder's <pause dur="0.4"/> Also a Philosophy of History <pause dur="0.3"/> seventeen-seventy-four <pause dur="0.5"/> in which he believes that <pause dur="0.3"/> human progress is not a science <pause dur="0.2"/> but an endeavour <pause dur="0.5"/> historical texts can only be understood in context <pause dur="0.3"/> and 
all values <pause dur="0.2"/> are historically <pause dur="0.4"/> conditioned <pause dur="0.5"/> <reading>history may only be understood</reading> <pause dur="0.5"/> he says <pause dur="0.3"/> <reading>through empathy <pause dur="0.3"/> not <pause dur="0.2"/> through <pause dur="0.3"/> reason</reading> <pause dur="2.0"/> now this idea of historicism <pause dur="0.2"/> was practised in the universities <pause dur="0.2"/> at the turn of the eighteenth century and the beginning of the nineteenth century <pause dur="0.4"/> by philologists <pause dur="0.3"/> legal historians <pause dur="0.4"/> and Roman historians <pause dur="0.6"/> and it was expressed as being the nature of the historical discipline <pause dur="0.3"/> shortly before Ranke came on the scene <pause dur="0.4"/> in essays <pause dur="0.3"/> by <pause dur="0.2"/> Wilhelm von Humboldt <pause dur="1.1"/> so what were the chief tenets what were the ideas behind this idea of historicism how do we define it <pause dur="0.8"/> well <pause dur="0.2"/> there are # <pause dur="0.3"/> five or six key points <pause dur="0.9"/> first <pause dur="0.9"/> historicism believed that history <pause dur="0.2"/> differs from the natural sciences <pause dur="0.4"/> in that it studies <pause dur="0.2"/> human actions <pause dur="0.2"/> which display <pause dur="0.2"/> great variety <pause dur="0.5"/> not a pattern <pause dur="0.2"/> which can be established by research <pause dur="0.4"/> because <pause dur="0.2"/> the human will <pause dur="0.2"/> is unpredictable in other words it doesn't work like a scientific experiment <pause dur="1.5"/> two <pause dur="0.5"/> because the human world is in constant flux <pause dur="0.3"/> it cannot be explained by reason <pause dur="0.5"/> only 
by the study <pause dur="0.3"/> of its historical <pause dur="0.2"/> development <pause dur="0.3"/> it's a very clear <pause dur="0.2"/> reaction against the Enlightenment there <pause dur="1.0"/> three <pause dur="0.8"/> states <pause dur="0.6"/> historicism believed <pause dur="0.2"/> states are ends in themselves <pause dur="0.4"/> they are not utilitarian in other word they're not there just to serve the interests of the population of the # the state <pause dur="0.5"/> the aim of the state is to achieve <pause dur="0.2"/> strength and independence <pause dur="0.3"/> in competition <pause dur="0.3"/> with <pause dur="0.3"/> other states <pause dur="1.4"/> all domestic affairs and domestic politics <pause dur="0.3"/> have to be subordinate <pause dur="0.3"/> to foreign policy <pause dur="0.3"/> foreign policy comes first <pause dur="0.8"/> reasons of state have to override everything else <pause dur="0.2"/> as only a strong state can guarantee freedom <pause dur="0.3"/> culture <pause dur="0.3"/> and the rule of law <pause dur="1.5"/> next <pause dur="0.6"/> ethical and moral values are norms for a society <pause dur="0.3"/> but they arise within a particular <pause dur="0.2"/> historical tradition <pause dur="0.5"/> human values are not universal <pause dur="0.4"/> not based on reason <pause dur="0.3"/> but bound by any particular <pause dur="0.4"/> culture <pause dur="0.7"/> therefore <pause dur="0.3"/> political institutions <pause dur="0.3"/> aren't transferable because they're culturally different <pause dur="0.3"/> so you can't transfer for instance French <pause dur="0.3"/> political institutions <pause dur="0.3"/> to 
Germany <pause dur="0.3"/> and again that's a very clear counterblast against people like Napoleon attempting to <pause dur="0.3"/> spread a universal code <pause dur="0.3"/> all over Europe <pause dur="1.5"/> next <pause dur="0.4"/> historicism rejects conceptual thinking <pause dur="0.4"/> in favour of reaching understanding by contemplation <pause dur="0.6"/> intuition <pause dur="0.4"/> and empathy <pause dur="1.9"/> so these views <pause dur="0.2"/> were not limited <pause dur="0.3"/> to the discipline of history by the middle of the nineteenth century <pause dur="0.3"/> the belief was all over Europe <pause dur="0.2"/> that every institution <pause dur="0.3"/> and every human and cultural activity had a history <pause dur="0.4"/> and could only be understood <pause dur="0.3"/> by examination of that history <pause dur="0.4"/> especially in its specific <pause dur="0.3"/> national <pause dur="0.4"/> manifestations <pause dur="0.4"/> so this is obviously part of the big rise in nationalism <pause dur="0.3"/> during the nineteenth century people trying to find their own culture <pause dur="0.4"/> making that history part of it <pause dur="0.3"/> and then examining that <pause dur="1.1"/> as part of that kind of national <pause dur="0.5"/> # national development <pause dur="1.3"/> thereafter <pause dur="0.2"/> there was a revolt against this outlook in disciplines like law <pause dur="0.4"/> and literature <pause dur="0.4"/> which only this revolt only came later <pause dur="0.3"/> to <pause dur="0.3"/> history <pause dur="2.7"/> Ranke <pause dur="0.5"/> and 
other historicists <pause dur="0.3"/> were partly in revolt against <pause dur="0.5"/> idealism <pause dur="0.9"/> this was a set of ideas <pause dur="0.2"/> propounded most systematically <pause dur="0.3"/> by the philosopher <pause dur="0.3"/> Hegel <pause dur="0.6"/> but they also shared <pause dur="0.2"/> some of his assumptions <pause dur="0.5"/> now idealism had nothing to do with being idealistic about the future or whatever <pause dur="0.4"/> it was about <pause dur="0.2"/> ideas <pause dur="0.3"/> not about ideals <pause dur="1.8"/> this Hegelian philosophy <pause dur="0.3"/> was dominant <pause dur="0.3"/> at the University of Berlin again Ranke's own institution <pause dur="0.3"/> in the eighteen-twenties <pause dur="0.8"/> and what Hegel did <pause dur="0.3"/> was to apply <pause dur="0.3"/> dialectical reason <pause dur="0.3"/> later used of course by Marx in a different way <pause dur="0.6"/> applied dialectical reason <pause dur="0.2"/> to deciding what was important in history <pause dur="0.5"/> and insisted on seeing the past <pause dur="0.3"/> through the present <pause dur="0.8"/> for Hegel <pause dur="0.3"/> individuals <pause dur="0.2"/> states and nations <pause dur="0.3"/> were manifestations of abstract ideas <pause dur="0.3"/> which were the only <pause dur="0.2"/> reality <pause dur="0.4"/> and that of course makes him the heir of Emmanuel Kant <pause dur="0.2"/> who was coming up <pause dur="0.3"/> with many of these sort of similar ideas <pause dur="0.2"/> in the late Enlightenment <pause dur="0.2"/> at the end <pause dur="0.2"/> of the eighteenth century <pause dur="1.8"/> now Ranke <pause dur="0.2"/> saw individuals <pause dur="0.3"/> and institutions <pause dur="0.3"/> 
as manifestations of the human spirit <pause dur="0.6"/> but this was an idea <pause dur="0.4"/> that was <pause dur="0.8"/> basically very similar <pause dur="0.3"/> to <pause dur="0.4"/> Hegel's <pause dur="0.3"/> Hegel's big # <pause dur="1.5"/> big idea in effect <pause dur="0.3"/> was # <pause dur="0.3"/> the idea of the # <pause dur="0.5"/> world spirit which <pause dur="0.8"/> supposedly controlled all human progress <pause dur="0.4"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="4"/> which in German <pause dur="0.6"/> is known as <pause dur="1.7"/> <distinct lang="de">geist</distinct> <pause dur="0.6"/> which can be translated as ghost but i think <pause dur="0.3"/> spirit is probably better here <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> and # <pause dur="0.2"/> this idea was adapted again by Marx later on in the century <pause dur="0.4"/> to say that Hegel had a lot of this right but instead of being spirit <pause dur="0.3"/> it was actually class that was the defining factor <pause dur="0.5"/> so <pause dur="0.5"/> this Hegelian idea <pause dur="0.2"/> has a big intellectual hold on many of the thinkers <pause dur="0.3"/> in the nineteenth <pause dur="0.2"/> century <pause dur="1.7"/> Hegel said that in time this spirit <distinct lang="de">geist</distinct> <pause dur="0.2"/> which ultimately derived from God <pause dur="0.4"/> became enshrined <pause dur="0.2"/> in increasingly <pause dur="0.2"/> rational <pause dur="0.2"/> institutions <pause dur="0.7"/> and Ranke <pause dur="0.2"/> in the tradition of <trunc>philo</trunc> philological critique <pause dur="0.3"/> or hermeneutics and <trunc>s</trunc> again that's on your <pause dur="0.2"/> your sheet <pause dur="0.6"/> # said that the spirit <pause dur="0.3"/> manifested 
itself in individual forms <pause dur="0.6"/> individuals <pause dur="0.2"/> states <pause dur="0.3"/> nations <pause dur="0.4"/> cultures <pause dur="0.3"/> and mankind as a whole <pause dur="0.5"/> all of whom all of these could not be grasped by reason <pause dur="0.4"/> but only by studying texts <pause dur="0.3"/> and then applying your intuition <pause dur="0.8"/> ultimately <pause dur="0.3"/> Ranke thought <pause dur="0.6"/> God was the supreme idea <pause dur="0.4"/> or spirit <pause dur="2.3"/> so Ranke shared many ideas with other idealists despite the fact that he was reacting against them to some extent <pause dur="0.5"/> such as # Herder for instance <pause dur="0.4"/> some of these shared ideas with the idealists includes the idea that <pause dur="0.4"/> God is present <pause dur="0.2"/> in <pause dur="0.2"/> all of humanity <pause dur="0.5"/> as and all of history <pause dur="0.4"/> as the tutor of mankind <pause dur="1.0"/> the idea that history is organic <pause dur="0.3"/> that it in other words that it works itself out in the same way that a human life does <pause dur="0.3"/> by a process of development <pause dur="0.2"/> maturity <pause dur="0.3"/> and decline so in effect <pause dur="0.3"/> history is parallel to human lives in that sense <pause dur="0.9"/> he also believed that all states go through a similar cycle of <pause dur="0.2"/> development maturity <pause dur="0.2"/> and decline <pause dur="0.8"/> and he also believed <pause dur="0.2"/> that <pause dur="0.2"/> each historical period has its own spirit <pause dur="0.3"/> <distinct lang="de">geist</distinct> <pause dur="0.5"/> and therefore 
its own <pause dur="0.3"/> value <pause dur="2.3"/> the notion that <pause dur="0.2"/> institutions had this spirit by the way <pause dur="0.2"/> may well have something to do with another <pause dur="0.3"/> idea which flourish # which flourished <pause dur="0.2"/> from the end of the eighteenth century <pause dur="0.3"/> to around <pause dur="0.2"/> eighteen-forty <pause dur="0.4"/> and then came back again <pause dur="0.3"/> at the end of the nineteenth century <pause dur="0.5"/> and this is a relatively <pause dur="0.3"/> little known idea <pause dur="0.3"/> called vitalism <pause dur="0.5"/> and this was an <pause dur="0.7"/> alternative outlook within the natural sciences <pause dur="0.3"/> which argued <pause dur="0.3"/> that a purely mechanical view a scientific <pause dur="0.5"/> rational view <pause dur="0.2"/> of the natural world <pause dur="0.4"/> failed to explain the order <pause dur="0.2"/> which existed <pause dur="0.3"/> in nature <pause dur="0.8"/> because life itself had to be explained <pause dur="0.7"/> living bodies according to vitalism <pause dur="0.2"/> were not merely elements of matter impinging on one another <pause dur="0.6"/> but there had to be some breath of life within them <pause dur="0.2"/> which set them in motion <pause dur="0.4"/> so they would believe that <pause dur="0.3"/> in the human body <pause dur="0.3"/> there's a vital energy in every part of your body <pause dur="0.3"/> which is responsible <pause dur="0.2"/> for its generation <pause dur="0.3"/> nutrition <pause dur="0.4"/> and reproduction <pause dur="0.4"/> and if you look through Ranke's writings 
as you will for the seminar <pause dur="0.3"/> you will see that the adjective vital <pause dur="0.3"/> comes up <pause dur="0.3"/> over and over again <pause dur="0.3"/> in his writings <pause dur="2.4"/> also thinking about <pause dur="0.7"/> Ranke's philosophy <pause dur="0.4"/> it's important to look at that phrase that key phrase i mentioned <pause dur="0.3"/> <distinct lang="de">wie es eigentlich gewesen</distinct> <pause dur="0.3"/> as it really was <pause dur="0.5"/> 'cause it's got a hidden meaning <pause dur="0.3"/> that the English translation doesn't always manage to <pause dur="0.4"/> bring out <pause dur="1.0"/> that's this <pause dur="0.7"/> <distinct lang="de">eigentlich</distinct> <pause dur="0.2"/> in German is an adverb <pause dur="0.3"/> which can equally mean <pause dur="0.4"/> actually <pause dur="0.4"/> or essentially <pause dur="0.3"/> or <pause dur="0.4"/> really <pause dur="1.3"/> now <pause dur="0.5"/> whatever Ranke may have meant when he first used this phrase <pause dur="0.5"/> # polemically against the philosophical historians <pause dur="0.6"/> with time <pause dur="0.2"/> it became apparent that what Ranke was actually trying to do his main purpose <pause dur="0.3"/> was to go behind the mere surface facts <pause dur="0.3"/> to explain <pause dur="0.2"/> far more <pause dur="0.7"/> a grasp of the facts was the initial basis for a deeper understanding <pause dur="0.3"/> of origins <pause dur="0.3"/> causes <pause dur="0.3"/> intentions <pause dur="0.2"/> and interactions in history <pause dur="0.9"/> Ranke held that the ultimate truth <pause dur="0.3"/> can never <pause dur="0.3"/> fully be known in history <pause dur="0.3"/> but only <pause dur="0.3"/> divined <pause dur="1.0"/> history <pause dur="0.2"/> he felt <pause dur="0.2"/> was the 
product of God's purposes <pause dur="0.5"/> Ranke often writes in terms of the hand of God <pause dur="0.2"/> the finger of God <pause dur="0.3"/> or the breath of God <pause dur="0.7"/> these purposes he believed could not be discovered by reason <pause dur="0.4"/> but only intuitively <pause dur="0.2"/> and by empathy <pause dur="1.5"/> he was able to do this or he was able to suggest that this could be done <pause dur="0.5"/> because the spark of God <pause dur="0.3"/> was in every person <pause dur="0.4"/> who can then hope by a process of intuitive understanding <pause dur="0.4"/> to penetrate <pause dur="0.3"/> that divine <pause dur="0.3"/> purpose <pause dur="0.6"/> now this approach <pause dur="0.3"/> doesn't really sound all that scientific i mean not in the terms that we're talking about <pause dur="0.8"/> it's more romantic in a sense <pause dur="0.2"/> it's more subjective than objective <pause dur="0.3"/> and indeed it does have a very mystical <pause dur="0.2"/> type of quality <pause dur="0.5"/> as it <pause dur="0.2"/> equates scholarship in effect with worship <pause dur="0.3"/> remember what we said at the beginning about or what i said at the beginning <pause dur="0.3"/> about <pause dur="0.3"/> Ranke in effect thinking that history was a sort of priestly <pause dur="0.3"/> vocation <pause dur="0.8"/> so in those senses Ranke was not scientific he was not an empiricist <pause dur="0.3"/> in the sense that he believed that <pause dur="0.3"/> only what you 
can see with your own eyes <pause dur="0.2"/> has reality <pause dur="0.5"/> for him <pause dur="0.2"/> all phenomena <pause dur="0.4"/> all historical <pause dur="0.6"/> phenomena <pause dur="0.4"/> were the expression <pause dur="0.3"/> of metaphysical <pause dur="0.3"/> intangible <pause dur="0.3"/> forces <pause dur="2.3"/> okay the last element <pause dur="0.2"/> which shapes Ranke's view <pause dur="0.2"/> of <pause dur="0.2"/> the course of history <pause dur="0.4"/> were his own <pause dur="0.4"/> political views <pause dur="0.9"/> when he was employed between eighteen-thirty-two <pause dur="0.2"/> and eighteen-thirty-six <pause dur="0.3"/> to edit a semi-official journal in Prussia <pause dur="0.3"/> which aimed at supporting the monarchy in Prussia <pause dur="0.6"/> he declared <pause dur="0.4"/> like <pause dur="0.2"/> again sort of # our great leader today <pause dur="0.3"/> that he was advocating a quote third way <pause dur="0.6"/> and his third way <pause dur="0.5"/> was claimed to be between the revolution <pause dur="0.4"/> and reaction <pause dur="0.6"/> something in between <pause dur="0.5"/> he wanted a state that was controlled <pause dur="0.3"/> neither by the great landowning aristocracy of Germany the <distinct lang="de">junkers</distinct> <pause dur="0.4"/> nor by the kind of the ordinary populace <pause dur="0.5"/> but by <pause dur="0.3"/> something in between <pause dur="0.3"/> a bureaucracy <pause dur="0.2"/> which would be loyal to the state <pause dur="0.4"/> and not pursuing their own interests <pause dur="0.2"/> but working for the greater good of the state <pause dur="1.5"/> # Ranke claimed that he wanted to adopt 
new ideas <pause dur="0.4"/> only in so far <pause dur="0.2"/> as they corresponded <pause dur="0.3"/> to the interests of the state <pause dur="0.8"/> in fact he spent most of his period as a journalist attacking # liberals <pause dur="0.5"/> and later on <pause dur="0.3"/> he became even more conservative <pause dur="0.4"/> and only accepted change for instance after the unification of Germany <pause dur="0.2"/> in eighteen-seventy-one <pause dur="0.3"/> when it was obvious that it was a fait accompli anyway <pause dur="0.2"/> and anything he said <pause dur="0.3"/> wasn't going to change it <pause dur="0.4"/> so he became a bit more of a last ditcher by the end you know resisting all change <pause dur="0.2"/> until he absolutely had to accept it <pause dur="2.0"/> as a result <pause dur="0.4"/> his secret of world history <pause dur="0.4"/> the pattern he discerned in modern times <pause dur="0.4"/> was <pause dur="0.5"/> the rise <pause dur="0.2"/> and decline of states <pause dur="0.3"/> with creative forces <pause dur="0.3"/> to advance <pause dur="0.2"/> civilization <pause dur="0.6"/> this was this great <pause dur="0.2"/> underlying pattern through all of history that he saw <pause dur="0.3"/> and which he was pushing <pause dur="0.3"/> in the later part of his work <pause dur="0.3"/> in these great fat books <pause dur="0.9"/> so for instance whereas in medieval times <pause dur="0.2"/> the <trunc>univer</trunc> # the # sorry the unity of Christendom <pause dur="0.3"/> had been preserved by the papacy <pause dur="0.7"/> when the papacy 
declined again this pattern that happened everywhere <pause dur="0.3"/> rise maturity decline <pause dur="0.3"/> so when the papacy declined <pause dur="0.5"/> it was replaced in its turn <pause dur="0.3"/> by nation states <pause dur="0.3"/> which were aided and abetted by the forces of <pause dur="0.2"/> the Reformation <pause dur="1.0"/> a special constructive role <pause dur="0.2"/> in Ranke's history <pause dur="0.3"/> was given <pause dur="0.3"/> to the Latin and Germanic nations in other words generally the western <pause dur="0.2"/> and northern Europeans <pause dur="0.4"/> Ranke was not going to suggest <pause dur="0.2"/> the Slavs <pause dur="0.3"/> and certainly not the non-European peoples <pause dur="0.3"/> had anything to do <pause dur="0.2"/> with this progressive <pause dur="0.2"/> civilizational <pause dur="0.3"/> advance <pause dur="1.3"/> he stated that states developed through external struggle <pause dur="0.5"/> and were harmed by internal conflict <pause dur="0.3"/> so war with other countries in effect is worthwhile <pause dur="0.3"/> but civil wars <pause dur="0.2"/> are harmful <pause dur="1.2"/> states he felt <pause dur="0.2"/> expressed the spirit of nations <pause dur="0.3"/> and in different eras <pause dur="0.3"/> different states had the greater energy <pause dur="0.3"/> and the vital spiritual forces <pause dur="0.4"/> which would enable them <pause dur="0.2"/> to triumph <pause dur="0.2"/> over <pause dur="0.3"/> their rivals <pause dur="1.4"/> at the same time <pause dur="0.3"/> the states of Europe acted in concert <pause dur="0.4"/> to prevent any individual 
state <pause dur="0.3"/> obtaining <pause dur="0.3"/> power <pause dur="0.2"/> which was hegemonic over the others in other words <pause dur="0.3"/> dominant power <pause dur="0.6"/> by the operation of a principle which again is still used today <pause dur="0.4"/> of balance of power <pause dur="0.9"/> the statesman in charge of each state <pause dur="0.2"/> thought Ranke <pause dur="1.6"/> had # a duty <pause dur="0.2"/> to fulfill that state's particular mission <pause dur="0.4"/> which the historian can help him uncover <pause dur="0.4"/> by unravelling <pause dur="0.2"/> how it had developed <pause dur="0.8"/> so by the eighteen-fifties quite late on in his career <pause dur="0.3"/> Ranke had come to believe <pause dur="0.4"/> that the struggle of the secular and spiritual powers <pause dur="0.3"/> that had characterized the period before the French Revolution <pause dur="0.6"/> had been replaced <pause dur="0.3"/> by a new struggle <pause dur="0.3"/> between revolution <pause dur="0.3"/> and counter-revolutionary forces <pause dur="0.8"/> so having started out by rejecting the idea of progress <pause dur="0.3"/> he was really coming to some quite similar sort of idea suggesting that you have these cycles these dialectical cycles which <pause dur="0.4"/> dear old Hegel of course was # talking about before <pause dur="0.5"/> # and as these cycles sort of have thesis and antithesis and move forward <pause dur="0.3"/> eventually <pause dur="0.2"/> 
you progress onwards in history <pause dur="0.4"/> so # <pause dur="0.2"/> he came round in a sense sort of contradicting <pause dur="0.3"/> his earlier thoughts there <pause dur="2.6"/> let's now for # one of the last sections talk about <pause dur="0.3"/> the dangers in <pause dur="0.3"/> Ranke's <pause dur="0.2"/> method the problems with the kind of history <pause dur="0.2"/> that he put forward <pause dur="1.1"/> these dangers which Ranke himself sometimes realized <pause dur="0.2"/> were magnified by later historians who weren't as subtle as he was <pause dur="0.3"/> and took these ideas <pause dur="0.3"/> they had their own political agendas often <pause dur="0.4"/> and they lacked Ranke's caution <pause dur="0.2"/> in historical ability <pause dur="0.3"/> so in a sense we're also criticizing Ranke's heirs here <pause dur="0.2"/> rather than necessarily just Ranke himself <pause dur="1.5"/> okay <pause dur="0.3"/> problem number one <pause dur="0.6"/> with this method of <pause dur="0.2"/> <shift feature="voice" new="mimicking American accent"/>just the facts ma'am <shift feature="voice" new="normal"/> <pause dur="0.4"/> it became very easy <pause dur="0.3"/> to <pause dur="0.2"/> become totally absorbed in the records and the facts <pause dur="0.4"/> and lose sight <pause dur="0.2"/> of the wider interpretation and Ranke did that in his first book which was just you know on <pause dur="0.4"/> twenty years period but it's very very dense and thick <pause dur="0.3"/> and you can't really see the wood for the trees <pause dur="1.4"/> second danger <pause dur="0.9"/> 
was Ranke's <pause dur="0.3"/> in a sense <pause dur="0.2"/> philosophical stroke political position <pause dur="0.3"/> of seeing the state itself as being an ethical good <pause dur="1.1"/> because if you believe that the state is the most important thing not the individual <pause dur="0.5"/> then <pause dur="0.5"/> this <pause dur="0.2"/> can lead you in the direction of glorifying power <pause dur="0.2"/> for its own sake <pause dur="1.0"/> now <pause dur="0.5"/> the <trunc>defi</trunc> # now Ranke had some sort of caution on this <pause dur="0.2"/> he of course had this idea of God and the divine restraint <pause dur="0.3"/> which # Ranke felt that good states would have that they would never go too far 'cause they were run <pause dur="0.2"/> for the benefit <pause dur="0.4"/> # the ultimate benefit of all <pause dur="0.9"/> and he believed also <pause dur="0.3"/> that certain moral standards <pause dur="0.3"/> were timeless and would always apply to states <pause dur="0.6"/> but later historians <pause dur="0.3"/> who had <pause dur="0.3"/> his <pause dur="0.2"/> admiration for the state <pause dur="0.3"/> but did not have his religious convictions <pause dur="0.4"/> abandoned <pause dur="0.2"/> the latter part of the idea so they glorified power <pause dur="0.3"/> without talking about the kind of religious brakes that could be put <pause dur="0.4"/> on abuses of state power <pause dur="0.8"/> so historians such as Treitschke <pause dur="0.5"/> who i think it's # yes it's 
on your sheet as well <pause dur="0.3"/> Treitschke <pause dur="0.2"/> and others <pause dur="0.5"/> saw Prussia <pause dur="0.3"/> and the German state <pause dur="0.3"/> which emerged as the ultimate goal <pause dur="0.3"/> of all <pause dur="0.3"/> history in other words <pause dur="0.3"/> this new sort of Prussian and German nationalism emerging in the late nineteenth century <pause dur="0.4"/> was heavily underpinned <pause dur="0.3"/> by an idea of history <pause dur="0.3"/> which came from Ranke <pause dur="0.3"/> but wasn't exactly what he was saying <pause dur="0.3"/> and it was an idea that the German state was kind of glorious and must be glorified <pause dur="0.3"/> above <pause dur="0.3"/> the interests of individual <pause dur="0.2"/> Germans <pause dur="1.6"/> now <pause dur="0.3"/> Ranke himself <pause dur="0.2"/> did slip <pause dur="0.3"/> in his history of seventeenth century England <pause dur="0.4"/> he played down the role of Parliament <pause dur="0.5"/> and saw the struggles of that century in other words talking about the Civil War period <pause dur="0.6"/> as mainly being religious problems with the papacy <pause dur="0.8"/> and he put <pause dur="0.3"/> much more emphasis in the <pause dur="0.2"/> # the seventeenth century history <pause dur="0.4"/> on England's role in Europe <pause dur="0.3"/> rather than on the constitutional conflicts <pause dur="0.3"/> which is what we think about # the Civil War <pause dur="1.3"/> and of course <pause dur="0.3"/> in contrast to this more liberal German historians of 
the period <pause dur="0.4"/> looked to the achievements of the English parliament and Oliver Cromwell and so on <pause dur="0.3"/> as being a model for their own <pause dur="0.2"/> newly emerging <pause dur="0.2"/> unified <pause dur="0.4"/> country <pause dur="0.4"/> so liberal German historians were looking at <pause dur="0.2"/> the Civil War and thinking you know this is a great example you can get rid of the king you know <pause dur="0.3"/> abuse of power and so on <pause dur="0.3"/> whereas Ranke was saying oh dear no all this civil war very bad idea don't worry about that <pause dur="0.2"/> think about England having power abroad instead and managing to throw its weight around <pause dur="0.3"/> that's a much better way <pause dur="0.3"/> for you to be thinking <pause dur="0.3"/> so there's an aspect of <pause dur="0.3"/> contemporary German politics <pause dur="0.3"/> in the way in which history <pause dur="0.3"/> is being defined <pause dur="1.6"/> a third problem <pause dur="0.3"/> Ranke's view was highly Eurocentric <pause dur="0.6"/> he dismissed the history of China and India <pause dur="0.3"/> because he claimed they had no historians or written sources <pause dur="0.3"/> which were worthy <pause dur="0.3"/> of the name <pause dur="0.8"/> he also took a very narrow view of the bits of Europe that were interesting <pause dur="0.4"/> # in other words again mainly western and northern 
Europe <pause dur="0.4"/> despite <pause dur="0.3"/> the fact that he'd actually written a book <pause dur="0.2"/> on Serbia <pause dur="0.5"/> and on the Ottoman empire <pause dur="0.3"/> early on <pause dur="0.2"/> in his career <pause dur="2.4"/> another problem and Ranke believed that it was wrong to pass judgement on the political actions of the past <pause dur="0.5"/> but nonetheless <pause dur="0.3"/> he was prepared to condemn massacres and other actions <pause dur="0.3"/> which were evil <pause dur="0.3"/> by standards which he held <pause dur="0.3"/> to be <pause dur="0.3"/> universal <pause dur="1.0"/> now we may not <trunc>m</trunc> consider that to be necessarily a bad thing <pause dur="0.3"/> but it was something of a contradiction <pause dur="0.4"/> in method <pause dur="0.6"/> nevertheless <pause dur="0.3"/> by <trunc>j</trunc> # by regarding as justified all actions by states <pause dur="0.2"/> which pursued their own interests <pause dur="0.5"/> he also opened the door <pause dur="0.2"/> to the concept of relativism <pause dur="0.4"/> the view that success <pause dur="0.3"/> is the only criterion that matters that ends justify means <pause dur="0.6"/> and that <pause dur="0.5"/> therefore <pause dur="0.4"/> you cannot see men as evil <pause dur="0.3"/> you can only judge them <pause dur="0.3"/> by whether they succeed <pause dur="0.4"/> or not <pause dur="2.0"/> another problem <pause dur="0.6"/> Ranke deliberately neglected devoting much attention <pause dur="0.2"/> to social and economic trends <pause dur="0.5"/> and did not see how <trunc>overwhelum</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> overwhelmingly important <pause dur="0.3"/> 
they were <pause dur="0.2"/> especially of course in the era of industrialization which was really in full <pause dur="0.2"/> swing <pause dur="0.3"/> when he was working <pause dur="0.8"/> now from his point of view these omissions of social and economic history <pause dur="0.3"/> were explicable <pause dur="0.6"/> because Ranke believed that the strength of the state <pause dur="0.5"/> was to be explained <pause dur="0.3"/> by religion and law <pause dur="0.3"/> not <pause dur="0.2"/> by <pause dur="0.2"/> money <pause dur="0.8"/> social history was in effect irrelevant for Ranke <pause dur="0.3"/> except in so far as social movements <pause dur="0.3"/> detracted <pause dur="0.3"/> from the strength #<pause dur="0.2"/> of the state <pause dur="0.4"/> so social movements in that sense could be important if they were bad and helped to sap a sate's strate's state's strength <pause dur="0.5"/> but he didn't see them <pause dur="0.3"/> as being <pause dur="0.2"/> positive <pause dur="1.8"/> you do find <pause dur="0.2"/> in Ranke's work <pause dur="0.4"/> quite full social analyses <pause dur="0.3"/> of the elite classes in papal Rome for instance <pause dur="0.3"/> all of the German peasantry <pause dur="0.2"/> on the eve of their revolt <pause dur="0.2"/> in fifteen-twenty-five <pause dur="0.6"/> but these were very much subordinated <pause dur="0.3"/> to his account of the political struggle <pause dur="0.3"/> between the papacy <pause dur="0.3"/> and the European powers <pause dur="0.5"/> or between the emperor <pause dur="0.3"/> and the princes in the empire <pause dur="0.4"/> and its 
enmeshing <pause dur="0.3"/> with <pause dur="0.2"/> the Reformation <pause dur="1.4"/> certainly Ranke <pause dur="0.2"/> did not neglect culture <pause dur="0.7"/> that was a key element <pause dur="0.2"/> in the spirit of nations <pause dur="0.2"/> which was harboured <pause dur="0.3"/> by <pause dur="0.2"/> their states <pause dur="1.2"/> so Ranke used the popular pamphlets of the Reformation in Germany <pause dur="0.6"/> discussed French literature <pause dur="0.2"/> as part of Louis the Fourteenth's drive <pause dur="0.3"/> for <pause dur="0.2"/> domination of Europe <pause dur="0.5"/> and the eighteen-thirties he actually published separate histories of art and poetry <pause dur="0.3"/> in Renaissance Italy <pause dur="0.8"/> so <pause dur="0.3"/> in that sense Ranke was certainly a cultural historian <pause dur="0.5"/> as well as a historian of politics <pause dur="0.5"/> but the neglect of most economic and social factors <pause dur="0.3"/> became increasingly anachronistic <pause dur="0.3"/> as the nineteenth century advanced <pause dur="0.3"/> and that meant that some of Ranke's ideas were already outdated <pause dur="0.3"/> by <pause dur="0.3"/> the end of the century in which he lived <pause dur="1.9"/> last flaw <pause dur="2.1"/> by the time <pause dur="0.6"/> of <pause dur="1.0"/> Ranke's death really but certainly his late <pause dur="0.2"/> working period <pause dur="0.9"/> most historians considered that it was no longer adequate to rely on intuition <pause dur="0.3"/> this great idea of empathy and intuition that <pause dur="0.3"/> this sort of 
almost mystical belief that he had <pause dur="0.5"/> it was no longer considered adequate to rely on that <pause dur="0.3"/> for a deeper understanding of the forces at work in history <pause dur="0.8"/> historians <pause dur="0.3"/> while accepting the need to research facts with impartiality <pause dur="0.5"/> looked for their interpretation to other ideas <pause dur="0.3"/> hypotheses <pause dur="0.3"/> concepts <pause dur="0.3"/> and the methodology of the social sciences <pause dur="0.2"/> economics <pause dur="0.3"/> sociology and so on <pause dur="0.2"/> which were beginning to emerge <pause dur="0.3"/> at this time <pause dur="1.9"/> # </u><gap reason="break in recording" extent="uncertain"/> <u who="nm0087" trans="pause"> so # these are some of the # the the areas in which Ranke perhaps fell down either at the time <pause dur="0.3"/> or in retrospect <pause dur="0.2"/> they don't detract from his great contribution <pause dur="0.3"/> but they need to be understood <pause dur="0.4"/> to # <pause dur="0.2"/> see where his ideas have been adapted <pause dur="1.6"/> so to # to 
finish off <pause dur="1.4"/> despite <pause dur="0.2"/> these flaws <pause dur="0.4"/> Ranke <pause dur="0.3"/> either laid the groundwork for <pause dur="0.3"/> or consolidated <pause dur="0.3"/> many of the features of history <pause dur="0.3"/> as a discipline <pause dur="0.3"/> which most historians today regard as being <pause dur="0.2"/> absolutely obvious <pause dur="0.7"/> for instance the need <pause dur="0.2"/> for impartial research and faithfulness to the sources <pause dur="0.3"/> once they've been critically <pause dur="0.4"/> appraised <pause dur="1.0"/> the need for the historian to set aside <pause dur="0.4"/> her or his subjective opinions <pause dur="0.3"/> while seeking empathy with the past <pause dur="1.1"/> an appreciation of the variety of history <pause dur="0.5"/> and an open view <pause dur="0.2"/> about historical development in the future <pause dur="1.0"/> the combination of an academic approach <pause dur="0.2"/> with literary skill <pause dur="0.5"/> so as to make history both reliable <pause dur="0.2"/> and readable <pause dur="0.8"/> and last but not least <pause dur="0.4"/> the view that history is 
an important way <pause dur="0.3"/> to understand <pause dur="0.3"/> humanity <pause dur="0.5"/> now if you think about those four or five <pause dur="0.2"/> factors which are <pause dur="0.2"/> Ranke's contribution <pause dur="0.8"/> i don't think there's very much that seems all that much out of place <pause dur="0.3"/> at the end of the twentieth century <pause dur="0.3"/> and if you understand that <pause dur="0.4"/> then you'll understand quite why Ranke's so influential <pause dur="0.4"/> and why we still ask you to read this <pause dur="0.4"/> now no longer much read <pause dur="0.4"/> <trunc>nin</trunc> # # <pause dur="0.3"/> # historian <pause dur="0.3"/> from Germany <pause dur="0.2"/> of the late nineteenth century <pause dur="0.8"/> okay <pause dur="0.2"/> please do remember to put in your exam forms if you haven't done so please <gap reason="name" extent="2 words"/>'s group don't forget to go to <gap reason="name" extent="2 words"/> <pause dur="0.2"/> thanks # <pause dur="0.3"/> you can <pause dur="0.2"/> head off
