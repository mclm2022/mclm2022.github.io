<u who="nm0061"> lecture might be a rather grand title for what we'll do # today this perhaps will be <pause dur="0.2"/> a few tips <pause dur="0.6"/> perhaps pitched somewhere between # <pause dur="0.6"/> a pep talk and a little bit of the reading of the riot act <pause dur="0.5"/> but it's just to give you <pause dur="0.2"/> a sense a kind of bit of fine tuning <pause dur="0.3"/> for how you might <pause dur="0.2"/> think about the work <pause dur="0.2"/> that you present <pause dur="0.2"/> for us to read <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> for the degree <pause dur="0.6"/> <trunc>pec</trunc> # particularly as opposed to what you might have been doing <pause dur="0.3"/> for A-level there are sort of significant shifts you see <pause dur="0.4"/> so it's no bad thing early on to start thinking about the way things might change <pause dur="0.4"/> and the <pause dur="0.4"/> i will be talking with reference to this i may not actually quote it <pause dur="0.4"/> <kinesic desc="holds up book" iterated="n"/> but <pause dur="0.5"/> afterwards you will be able to read this through and see the connections with <pause dur="0.4"/> what i've been talking about <pause dur="0.9"/> now <pause dur="1.0"/> if you people were going off <pause dur="0.7"/> to study <pause dur="0.4"/> some other <pause dur="0.2"/> subjects around this institution <pause dur="0.4"/> perhaps in engineering or physics or somewhere <pause dur="0.9"/> someone <pause dur="0.2"/> might have the job of wising you up about safety rules <pause dur="0.4"/> 
if you were dealing with <pause dur="0.3"/> expensive and dangerous equipment <pause dur="1.0"/> but actually of course <pause dur="0.2"/> you are the people <pause dur="0.6"/> who are working with the most expensive <pause dur="1.5"/> and the most dangerous <pause dur="0.6"/> the most delicate piece of equipment of anyone in the university <pause dur="0.7"/> because you are the people who are working <pause dur="0.3"/> with language <pause dur="1.3"/> that was a very expensive product <pause dur="0.8"/> and it can do a great deal <pause dur="0.4"/> of harm <pause dur="1.2"/> and part of your job as students of English <pause dur="0.6"/> is to be aware of that <pause dur="0.9"/> to be aware of your own use of language <pause dur="0.7"/> and of course to be critically aware of other people's use <pause dur="0.2"/> of language <pause dur="0.6"/> and of course we read <pause dur="0.7"/> what has come down to us traditionally as some of the great <pause dur="0.3"/> texts of <pause dur="0.2"/> of literature English and European and and American <pause dur="1.5"/> partly of course for their # intrinsic interest that <pause dur="0.2"/> that's the main thing <pause dur="0.4"/> but also because they are the most complex <pause dur="0.7"/> the most concentrated uses <pause dur="0.2"/> of the language <pause dur="0.6"/> and so your interest in the matter doesn't stop <pause dur="0.3"/> as it were <pause dur="0.3"/> at the text that we bound as literary <pause dur="1.1"/> from <trunc>th</trunc> those texts you were 
learning to think about language perhaps in a much broader sense <pause dur="0.4"/> now i will be concerned <pause dur="0.2"/> today to think about your own use of language <pause dur="0.4"/> when you write <pause dur="0.5"/> most of your degree of course will be concerned with your <pause dur="0.3"/> critical and appreciative entry <pause dur="0.2"/> into other people's use <pause dur="0.3"/> of language <pause dur="0.3"/> but there is a <pause dur="0.3"/> an important traffic <pause dur="0.3"/> between them so that's really what we want to think about a little bit today <pause dur="0.3"/> how you yourselves use language <pause dur="0.3"/> in an academic <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> context <pause dur="0.6"/> now we're reading <pause dur="1.1"/> literature <pause dur="0.2"/> and looking at language in the latter part <pause dur="0.4"/> of the twentieth century <pause dur="1.2"/> and one of the things you will become increasingly <pause dur="0.2"/> aware of of course <pause dur="0.3"/> is that the activity <pause dur="0.3"/> of reading literature <pause dur="0.2"/> has itself been differently conceived just as the literature <pause dur="0.3"/> has <pause dur="0.6"/> been differently conceived <pause dur="0.3"/> at at different historical moments <pause dur="0.6"/> and perhaps one very broad <pause dur="0.3"/> # # <pause dur="0.3"/> sort of <pause dur="0.3"/> point of reference that we might put around this <pause dur="1.3"/> is that <pause dur="0.6"/> people often look back now to some <pause dur="0.5"/> period round the turn of the nineteenth into 
the twentieth century <pause dur="0.9"/> and <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> refer to something # # # called by the phrase linguistic turn <pause dur="0.2"/> a linguistic turn <pause dur="0.6"/> and i think what people have in mind by this <pause dur="0.9"/> is of course a big <pause dur="0.2"/> shift a big <pause dur="0.7"/> a big shift in the way of thinking <pause dur="0.2"/> about <pause dur="0.4"/> language <pause dur="0.8"/> and perhaps you might say in very crude terms <pause dur="0.3"/> that <pause dur="0.3"/> despite the complexity and variety of different ways in which <pause dur="0.3"/> human beings have thought about language <pause dur="0.5"/> right the way down till then <pause dur="0.6"/> they perhaps <pause dur="0.2"/> nonetheless stayed somewhat in the same view of language <pause dur="0.3"/> that we see Adam had <pause dur="0.3"/> in the garden of Eden <pause dur="0.6"/> it was God's job to create the world <pause dur="1.3"/> what was thought to distinguish the human traditionally was the possession of language <pause dur="0.6"/> and Adam in the garden <pause dur="0.5"/> gave the names to things <pause dur="0.4"/> okay so that is the the myth <pause dur="0.2"/> so he didn't create the world <pause dur="0.8"/> but he gave the world its names you see <pause dur="0.5"/> now <pause dur="0.2"/> what you might say perhaps <pause dur="0.2"/> happened as we entered into our phase of # of modern culture <pause dur="0.5"/> was the thought that <pause dur="0.9"/> it's not that the <trunc>wor</trunc> <pause dur="0.4"/> the world is <pause dur="0.3"/> out there 
and we stick the labels on it <pause dur="0.8"/> it's actually the activity of naming <pause dur="0.4"/> that creates <pause dur="0.2"/> the world <pause dur="0.3"/> the world is there as existence <pause dur="0.4"/> but it's not there as world <pause dur="0.3"/> or as <pause dur="0.3"/> meaning <pause dur="0.5"/> in other words to put it in a physical image <pause dur="0.4"/> it's sometimes said that if a person blind from birth <pause dur="0.6"/> is suddenly given <pause dur="0.2"/> sight <pause dur="0.7"/> they don't wake up after the operation or the miracle <pause dur="1.0"/> just seeing the world that we see <pause dur="0.7"/> what they see is just a blur <pause dur="0.5"/> of colours <pause dur="0.5"/> because they have to learn to interpret <pause dur="0.4"/> you know # # what is in front of them <pause dur="0.6"/> in other words there's something out there all right <pause dur="0.4"/> but to put it together as world to distinguish one <pause dur="0.4"/> object from another <pause dur="0.2"/> this is actually an activity of language so there's an important sense <pause dur="0.3"/> in which <pause dur="0.3"/> language is prior to world <pause dur="0.6"/> that's what <pause dur="0.2"/> that's what's being <pause dur="0.3"/> thought about there <pause dur="0.3"/> and so all of our <pause dur="0.4"/> activities in looking critically at at language <pause dur="0.2"/> will tend to have <pause dur="0.2"/> that kind of consciousness <pause dur="0.4"/> in it <pause dur="0.5"/> that the whole world we live in as human beings and we're not <pause dur="0.3"/> we're thinking 
even you could <pause dur="0.4"/> that is clearly true at the level of physical objects <pause dur="0.3"/> but <pause dur="0.2"/> it's obviously even more true at the level of cultural formations <pause dur="0.6"/> that these are products in some sense <pause dur="0.3"/> of language and your job is to be more and more <pause dur="0.3"/> critically <pause dur="0.2"/> aware <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> # of all this <pause dur="0.5"/> now <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> that's to put a very broad frame of reference let's sort of move in <pause dur="0.2"/> then a little bit more <pause dur="0.2"/> specifically by varying stages into our topic <pause dur="0.6"/> one thing that i think <pause dur="0.3"/> would be very useful for you <pause dur="0.8"/> would be to <pause dur="0.2"/> learn as it were to appreciate your language <pause dur="0.5"/> and the specificities perhaps of the English <pause dur="0.3"/> language now you're in a department of English <pause dur="0.4"/> and comparative literary studies <pause dur="1.0"/> some of you may be doing a purely English degree <pause dur="0.8"/> but <pause dur="0.3"/> there would be available to you <pause dur="0.6"/> other languages <pause dur="0.5"/> and American <pause dur="0.6"/> English <pause dur="0.6"/> there are other traditions other kinds of language which you could also <pause dur="0.3"/> # you you know you could also take as options et cetera <pause dur="0.4"/> so <pause dur="0.2"/> remember that even if you're doing English <pause dur="0.3"/> there is <pause dur="0.2"/> a <trunc>c</trunc> a comparative <pause dur="0.3"/> dimension 
that helps you to give a focus on your own language <pause dur="0.3"/> it's taken <pause dur="0.3"/> a lot of English people <pause dur="0.7"/> a bit of a while to realize <pause dur="0.4"/> that it may not be entirely an advantage <pause dur="0.5"/> to have as your native language <pause dur="0.3"/> the world <pause dur="0.2"/> lingua <pause dur="0.3"/> franca <pause dur="0.2"/> very convenient for going everywhere and <pause dur="0.3"/> booking hotels and whatnot <pause dur="0.4"/> but it does tend to mean <pause dur="0.2"/> that the English are very often <pause dur="0.2"/> language blind <pause dur="0.4"/> they're not aware of language <pause dur="0.3"/> in the way that people <pause dur="0.2"/> learning the lingua franca from elsewhere <pause dur="0.3"/> # tend to be <pause dur="0.5"/> so internally to your studies <pause dur="0.3"/> in English <pause dur="0.3"/> it would be a good thing to develop something of that comparative <pause dur="0.4"/> awareness <pause dur="0.3"/> now even if you're doing English <pause dur="0.4"/> only <pause dur="2.4"/> there's another sense in which of course you acquire a comparative sense <pause dur="0.2"/> because you are reading the language historically <pause dur="0.6"/> so though you may not be reading American or German or or whatever it is <pause dur="0.3"/> you will be reading <pause dur="0.3"/> earlier forms of the same language <pause dur="1.2"/> and what you # <pause dur="0.2"/> would would find it very useful to do i think <pause dur="0.5"/> would be to always <pause dur="1.0"/> think of the language historically <pause dur="1.0"/> 
if you are looking up # a word 'cause you're not sure how to spell it <pause dur="1.1"/> you should be curious not about how it's spelled <pause dur="0.5"/> but why <pause dur="0.2"/> it's spelled <pause dur="0.5"/> that way <pause dur="0.6"/> you know <pause dur="0.4"/> because that will be part of the history <pause dur="0.6"/> of the word <pause dur="0.4"/> you see <pause dur="0.4"/> so that # <pause dur="1.0"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> there are words which <pause dur="0.4"/> change their meaning <pause dur="1.2"/> over the course of <pause dur="0.2"/> of of the centuries take a word like complacency <pause dur="0.7"/> that's about the worst sin that a modern person can be accused of is complacency <pause dur="0.9"/> and yet in the eighteenth century <pause dur="1.4"/> it <pause dur="0.6"/> referred to something that was <pause dur="0.2"/> # # highly approved <pause dur="0.7"/> a certain sense of <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> <trunc>s</trunc> moral <pause dur="0.2"/> self-approval moral self-consciousness <pause dur="0.3"/> you see <pause dur="0.5"/> a complete <pause dur="0.5"/> change or the word <pause dur="0.2"/> sentimental <pause dur="0.2"/> you see which was one of the great terms <pause dur="0.2"/> of the eighteenth century <pause dur="0.2"/> everyone was rushing to be <pause dur="0.2"/> more sentimental than everyone else it was <trunc>competit</trunc> who could be most <pause dur="0.3"/> sentimental # now of course it's the very bottom of the pit you know to be <pause dur="0.4"/> to be sentimental and that's of course a term with a great importance <pause dur="0.3"/> for literary <pause dur="0.2"/> critical <pause dur="0.3"/> usage not 
just in the text but in the way we <pause dur="0.3"/> we think about the text you see these things are changing <pause dur="0.3"/> or think of gothic <pause dur="0.8"/> and vandal <pause dur="0.4"/> they're really the same thing they're just the people who came and sacked Rome you know <pause dur="0.3"/> but the vandals we now think of as you know the the the urban nuisance <pause dur="0.3"/> the gothic has <pause dur="0.5"/> gone off on some other completely different <pause dur="0.4"/> track completely different set of meanings <pause dur="0.5"/> and so it's not a fixed thing if you want to know what the meaning of the gothic is <pause dur="0.2"/> you have to think of it <pause dur="0.6"/> historically see where it's come from and <trunc>h</trunc> # # # and and how it's been transformed <pause dur="0.6"/> and if it # just at the humble level of <pause dur="0.2"/> spelling <pause dur="0.4"/> you see you may wonder why # <pause dur="0.3"/> # people like me you know get sort of <pause dur="0.3"/> # itchy and worked up at # <pause dur="0.2"/> <trunc>s</trunc> sort of spelling mistakes and whatnot but <trunc>e</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> so if you <trunc>th</trunc> if you get people spelling <pause dur="0.6"/> the word separate <pause dur="0.7"/> as <distinct type="sampa">[sep3:reIt]</distinct> you see <pause dur="0.6"/> now <pause dur="0.2"/> what on earth is going on there <pause dur="0.2"/> <vocal desc="cough" iterated="n"/> <pause dur="0.3"/> it's made up of two Latin words there's <pause dur="0.2"/> section <pause dur="0.2"/> sec there's that bit of 
it <pause dur="0.4"/> and then there's the par the parting the <unclear>part #</unclear> you see <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> so if you spell it with an E you've completely lost its connection you know it's an etymological <pause dur="0.3"/> absurdity you've lost its connection with the <pause dur="0.2"/> the notion of parting you see that is that is that is built into the word <pause dur="0.4"/> so what it's signalling is not just <pause dur="0.3"/> a spelling mistake <pause dur="0.4"/> but it's a whole <pause dur="0.3"/> blankness as it were about the relation of that word to its own history and all the other words that it's <pause dur="0.2"/> it's moving along with <pause dur="0.4"/> and you couldn't plausibly <pause dur="0.2"/> you couldn't plausibly be a real reader of English poetry <pause dur="1.4"/> if you were sort of that word blind you see what i mean <pause dur="0.4"/> so <pause dur="0.4"/> what what i'm suggesting here is <trunc>n</trunc> that that that that spelling and and whatnot isn't just a matter of correctness <pause dur="0.7"/> it's a matter of understanding something about the nature <pause dur="0.4"/> of the language itself so if you have a good etymological dictionary <pause dur="0.7"/> and think of it in terms of roots and <pause dur="0.2"/> historical processes of of of all the words you pick up <pause dur="0.5"/> many of 
them are very interesting <pause dur="0.2"/> just as little microhistories <pause dur="0.4"/> in themselves <pause dur="4.2"/> and of course that begins to <pause dur="0.2"/> to bring us round to # the question then of what actually we mean by correctness <pause dur="1.7"/> because <pause dur="0.5"/> obviously there will be a cadre of people here whose job it is to correct in some sense you know your # your essays <pause dur="0.4"/> including <pause dur="0.4"/> your use of English <pause dur="1.4"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> and it's as well to bring into focus a little bit what one might mean by <pause dur="0.3"/> correctness <pause dur="0.2"/> because i don't think that we do this quite in the spirit <pause dur="0.3"/> of disgusted Tunbridge Wells <pause dur="0.3"/> you know writing about the latest # <pause dur="0.3"/> # # linguistic solecism heard on the # # # on the B-B-C <pause dur="0.4"/> you know <pause dur="0.5"/> because what i've been saying about language <pause dur="0.3"/> in the past <pause dur="0.5"/> must be going on <pause dur="0.3"/> in the present too <pause dur="0.5"/> language <pause dur="0.2"/> isn't <pause dur="0.3"/> fixed <pause dur="1.3"/> and so <pause dur="0.2"/> correctness very often <pause dur="0.5"/> is a kind of # <pause dur="0.4"/> you know nervous conservative tic you know that <trunc>g</trunc> a grid that people want to put over <pause dur="0.4"/> language when the whole nature of language <pause dur="0.3"/> is that it changes <pause dur="0.6"/> you see <pause dur="0.4"/> so the the thrust of what i would want to say to you <pause dur="0.4"/> here is 
not so much <pause dur="0.2"/> that there is a kind of ideal correctness and our common job is to try to <pause dur="0.2"/> defend this you see against <pause dur="0.4"/> change in language <pause dur="0.5"/> what i'm saying rather <pause dur="0.2"/> is that the historical awareness of language that you might have <pause dur="0.3"/> reading things in the past <pause dur="0.4"/> should also be at work <pause dur="0.3"/> in the present you should be curious <pause dur="0.3"/> about <pause dur="0.2"/> what is happening to the language <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> in your day <pause dur="0.2"/> you see <pause dur="0.5"/> so we're not as it were what they call prescriptive <pause dur="0.2"/> grammarians you see we're not coming along <pause dur="0.3"/> with a notion derived largely from Latin grammar <pause dur="0.5"/> which of course is fixed 'cause it's a dead language <pause dur="0.7"/> but what people tried do and you know the grammar school and whatnot the whole force of this in our culture <pause dur="0.4"/> was to try to make English into a dead language <pause dur="0.5"/> but we're not in the business of making it into a dead language you know <pause dur="0.6"/> # but you can obviously all the you know all all all all the political trouble that in a sense that that you know that that would imply once you started to <pause dur="0.3"/> think about it of course in a 
way we'd want it to be a living language <pause dur="0.3"/> but we want to see what's going on in the living language <pause dur="0.3"/> so there's things like # <pause dur="0.5"/> you know people of my age are likely to sort of twitch you know when they hear the word <pause dur="0.2"/> hopefully <pause dur="0.3"/> used as a kind of throat clearer <pause dur="0.2"/> at the beginning of the sentence you know <pause dur="0.2"/> hopefully we'll go <trunc>to</trunc> <pause dur="0.3"/> and all it means is # well we'll probably go you know <pause dur="0.3"/> on the other hand if you say <pause dur="0.7"/> we will travel hopefully <pause dur="0.7"/> i mean <pause dur="0.3"/> that means <trunc>w</trunc> <trunc>w</trunc> we are investing a very fundamental <pause dur="0.7"/> human emotion in this travel that we're going to do <pause dur="0.5"/> you know in other words <pause dur="0.2"/> the objection really to this kind of <pause dur="0.4"/> hopefully we'll do this and that and the other <pause dur="0.3"/> is that it somehow deadened <pause dur="0.7"/> the word when it's used in that <pause dur="0.3"/> context you know it it it's being its meaning <trunc>i</trunc> <trunc>i</trunc> <trunc>i</trunc> <trunc>i</trunc> <trunc>i</trunc> is being bracketed out <pause dur="0.2"/> but you can't say <pause dur="0.5"/> that it's not correct <pause dur="1.2"/> the we've got it really from American usage <pause dur="0.6"/> and i take it they've got it from German the Germans have always said <distinct lang="de">hoffentlich wir</distinct> <vocal desc="mumble" iterated="y" dur="1"/> <pause dur="0.2"/> they they use it as a sentence <pause dur="0.2"/> modified in that way you see <pause dur="0.4"/> so <pause dur="0.3"/> 
# you can't say it's incorrect <pause dur="0.5"/> but you could look at it and think and think about the nature of the usage you see <pause dur="0.3"/> or thinking about words like # <pause dur="0.8"/> disinterested <pause dur="0.9"/> and refute <pause dur="0.7"/> what's going on there <pause dur="0.6"/> you know there's all kinds of <pause dur="0.3"/> organized <pause dur="0.4"/> public debate we have about everything these days you know <pause dur="0.4"/> television and radio programmes and forums set up in universities and whatnot <pause dur="0.2"/> there's all a great <pause dur="0.5"/> # sort of you know activity of democracy but one has to <pause dur="0.2"/> at the same time look at the quality the nature the assumptions of it <pause dur="0.8"/> and of course what's happened to the word disinterested is <pause dur="0.6"/> itself of course very interesting <pause dur="0.5"/> but <pause dur="0.2"/> # that has come down to <pause dur="0.4"/> roughly our generation <pause dur="0.3"/> with a very important distinction between disinterested <pause dur="0.2"/> and uninterested <pause dur="0.4"/> disinterested as impartial <pause dur="0.9"/> and <pause dur="0.6"/> interested as you know <pause dur="0.2"/> taking an interest or perhaps having <pause dur="0.2"/> a certain <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> view on the outcome <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> we expect a judge <pause dur="0.3"/> to be disinterested <pause dur="0.6"/> we don't expect him to be uninterested reading his Beano or something you know while 
the # <pause dur="0.4"/> while the the the talk is going on so there's a very important distinction there <pause dur="0.4"/> but we notice that it's collapsed <pause dur="0.9"/> that more people than not <pause dur="0.2"/> will use the word disinterested to mean <pause dur="0.4"/> uninterested <pause dur="0.9"/> does that tell us anything about the culture <pause dur="0.4"/> we're working in <pause dur="0.7"/> that the very notion the ideal of being disinterested <pause dur="0.2"/> of course in all kinds of ways is <pause dur="0.5"/> <trunc>i</trunc> is worth looking at closely culturally <pause dur="0.6"/> but yet it might still have a certain value as an ideal <pause dur="0.9"/> but rather than look at it <pause dur="0.2"/> critically as an ideal it seems just to be sort of disappearing from the usage you see <pause dur="0.3"/> similarly with the word refute <pause dur="0.7"/> you see because that's also concerned with <pause dur="0.5"/> public debate <pause dur="0.6"/> # to refute <pause dur="0.3"/> means to show the other argument to be erroneous <pause dur="0.2"/> it's to destroy the other argument it's a term from <pause dur="0.3"/> you know logical debate from the the the Middle Ages <pause dur="0.5"/> but it will be used now <pause dur="0.2"/> simply to mean someone got up and said they don't agree <pause dur="1.1"/> <trunc>suppo</trunc> <pause dur="0.3"/> <trunc>y</trunc> she said this and then he got up and he refuted her 
you see <pause dur="0.3"/> or he refuted what <unclear>she</unclear> well it <pause dur="0.3"/> all they mean is he got up and disagreed with her <pause dur="0.9"/> he contested what she said that's not <pause dur="0.3"/> what refute is <pause dur="0.2"/> so refute if you say someone refuted something <pause dur="0.3"/> you've actually exercised a judgement <pause dur="0.3"/> about the force of that argument <pause dur="0.4"/> against the other one <pause dur="0.4"/> you see <pause dur="0.3"/> but again <pause dur="0.3"/> that has rather disappeared <pause dur="0.3"/> from use <pause dur="0.4"/> and of course if you start looking at the way these <pause dur="0.4"/> television debates are staged and organized and whatnot one can see well <pause dur="0.3"/> that makes a certain amount of sense perhaps <pause dur="0.2"/> you know <pause dur="0.4"/> that # <pause dur="0.3"/> <trunc>i</trunc> <trunc>i</trunc> in a way it's the theatre that's more important than the you know the programme's more important <pause dur="0.3"/> than than than than than the outcome <pause dur="0.7"/> so <pause dur="0.7"/> these are ways in which you might # <pause dur="1.3"/> # think a little bit about the language changing in your own time <pause dur="0.6"/> see we're not really ultimately concerned <pause dur="0.2"/> what you decide about your own usage <pause dur="0.3"/> but we would like you <pause dur="0.3"/> to know the consequences the meaning of # # of what you're doing <pause dur="0.9"/> okay so that's a little bit about the notion 
of correctness <pause dur="0.4"/> and the spirit of it okay <pause dur="0.7"/> now let's <pause dur="0.7"/> bring this home a little bit more to think about the practicalities of # of # of writing <pause dur="1.5"/> for academic purposes and this tends to fall into two broad categories doesn't it there's the exam answer <pause dur="0.9"/> and there's the essay <pause dur="1.4"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> very often when you're <pause dur="0.7"/> doing A-level <pause dur="0.5"/> the distinction isn't perhaps too important you know the you get the chance in an exam to put down about three written pages <pause dur="0.5"/> and lots of people can get their <pause dur="0.3"/> pretty much total sum you know of knowledge and reflection on this book <pause dur="0.3"/> you know into that page perhaps you know # # # at A-level <pause dur="0.4"/> but what you will certainly find when you're working at degree level <pause dur="0.2"/> is that you would never be able to fit in <pause dur="0.6"/> everything you've got to say <pause dur="1.0"/> and students are often very frustrated <pause dur="0.4"/> in their third year <pause dur="0.7"/> they put a lot of <pause dur="0.2"/> time and thought and there's all kinds of exciting things going on you know in the Shakespeare course and <pause dur="0.4"/> and then they've got a three hour exam <pause dur="0.5"/> and they can't you 
know they they can't get it all in you see <pause dur="0.6"/> so what a little <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> it's worth thinking a little bit at what the exam is actually trying to do <pause dur="0.6"/> and to distinguish that from what <pause dur="0.2"/> an essay <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> is trying to do <pause dur="0.4"/> and i think <pause dur="0.4"/> <trunc>o</trunc> <pause dur="0.9"/> what's lurking here of course <pause dur="0.3"/> is the <trunc>thi</trunc> is the point that you are doing <vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/> a very important <pause dur="0.7"/> and very real activity that many of you <pause dur="0.4"/> will go on in some form <pause dur="0.3"/> doing in the world afterwards <pause dur="0.9"/> but you're doing it under very artificial <pause dur="0.5"/> circumstances you're doing it to order on certain dates and suchlike so <pause dur="0.4"/> it's the relation between the reality of the activity <pause dur="0.3"/> and the artificiality which is <pause dur="0.5"/> part of the problem the artificiality is there for a purpose <pause dur="0.3"/> just as it there for a purpose in poems <pause dur="0.3"/> it produces <pause dur="0.3"/> a concentration <pause dur="0.3"/> that you wouldn't have <pause dur="0.2"/> you know without that as well as all the practical <pause dur="0.2"/> # reasons about you know doing something <pause dur="0.4"/> together and i think the way to think about exams is perhaps something rather like 
this <pause dur="0.6"/> you tend to go into the exam very often thinking there's some <pause dur="0.6"/> ideal answer <pause dur="0.7"/> or that somehow you've got to pack into a few pages <pause dur="1.3"/> <trunc>w</trunc> what you might have put into <pause dur="0.4"/> <trunc>m</trunc> <trunc>m</trunc> <trunc>m</trunc> <trunc>m</trunc> many thousands of words in an assessed essay you know you're trying to get everything into this <pause dur="0.4"/> little pot you see <pause dur="0.3"/> now i think the way to think about <pause dur="0.5"/> exam answer is perhaps something <pause dur="0.3"/> # rather like this <trunc>i</trunc> <trunc>i</trunc> <trunc>i</trunc> when you go out into the world afterwards <pause dur="1.2"/> let's say you're # <pause dur="0.5"/> acting for a union <pause dur="0.7"/> or <pause dur="0.2"/> you're a teacher <pause dur="0.6"/> you're a lawyer whatever kind of person you are <pause dur="0.3"/> who has <pause dur="0.4"/> a special skill <pause dur="0.7"/> a special body of knowledge enabling you <pause dur="0.7"/> to make informed judgements of things <pause dur="0.8"/> and people will come to you <pause dur="1.0"/> and they'll ask you questions <pause dur="1.2"/> and what they will want <pause dur="0.4"/> is a pretty economical <pause dur="0.3"/> but useful <pause dur="0.3"/> answer <pause dur="0.5"/> that <pause dur="0.2"/> is like a kind of iceberg you know there's a lot there that you know that you don't tell them <pause dur="0.9"/> but you <pause dur="0.3"/> organize that knowledge internally in such a way as to give them <pause dur="0.2"/> what they need from where they're coming from 
whether it's a child in a classroom <pause dur="0.2"/> or <pause dur="0.2"/> or whoever it may be you see <pause dur="0.4"/> and if you think <pause dur="0.3"/> of the exam answer as a kind of practice in doing that <pause dur="0.8"/> and if you think that <pause dur="0.4"/> two or three pages of writing <pause dur="0.7"/> are not too different from a few minutes <pause dur="0.2"/> of speech <pause dur="0.7"/> you perhaps begin to get the feel <pause dur="0.4"/> of how an exam answer <pause dur="0.2"/> works it's not a test <pause dur="0.4"/> of your <pause dur="0.5"/> complete knowledge by putting it all out in the shop window <pause dur="1.0"/> it's a test more of your implicit grasp of the subject <pause dur="0.3"/> by the way in which <pause dur="0.2"/> you angle your knowledge <pause dur="0.2"/> towards the particular question <pause dur="0.5"/> that's been put there <pause dur="0.3"/> see what i mean <pause dur="0.3"/> and when it's in the flesh <pause dur="0.5"/> many of you would do it <pause dur="0.2"/> quite naturally <pause dur="0.6"/> you wouldn't think about it <pause dur="0.5"/> but when you're asked to do it under artificial circumstances <pause dur="0.3"/> you kind of <pause dur="0.2"/> put all that ability on one side <pause dur="0.6"/> and so you you forget you've got it you're looking for something else you see <pause dur="0.3"/> that's as artificial <pause dur="0.3"/> as the situation <pause dur="0.5"/> well i think it's probably true to say <pause dur="0.3"/> that the best exam answers <pause dur="0.6"/> come from the people 
who deal that <trunc>d</trunc> <pause dur="0.3"/> you know answer them as it were most naturally <pause dur="0.7"/> you know who really do treat it <pause dur="0.2"/> as if it were a real question <pause dur="0.6"/> and get on giving it you know a real answer <pause dur="0.5"/> you know and that's what comes over with force <pause dur="0.3"/> and of course part of what you you you then register is that <pause dur="0.6"/> the thrust of your answer is should probably be there in the first paragraph <pause dur="1.3"/> and then there are more bits of <pause dur="1.2"/> possible confusions or counter-arguments or whatever that you need to unpack <pause dur="0.4"/> a little bit before you put it all back to bed again on the third page <pause dur="0.3"/> you know for your # # # for your conclusion <pause dur="0.4"/> but it's the <pause dur="0.2"/> simple thrust <pause dur="0.3"/> of an overall response to a complex question <pause dur="1.0"/> which communicates your awareness of the complexity <pause dur="0.2"/> but doesn't entirely necessarily <pause dur="0.2"/> go into it you see <pause dur="0.2"/> so that's a way of thinking perhaps about # <pause dur="0.4"/> # # exam answers <pause dur="0.3"/> and one of the best things you can do of course to practise for exams <pause dur="0.6"/> is to be <pause dur="0.4"/> as <pause dur="0.2"/> many of you will be <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> is to be active <pause dur="0.4"/> participants <pause dur="0.3"/> in seminars <pause dur="0.8"/> as 
once you get into the way of # # # of using seminars as a kind of <pause dur="0.5"/> instrument this will give you a lot of useful training <pause dur="0.6"/> because we all sit in our heads <pause dur="0.4"/> understanding certain things <pause dur="0.6"/> and it's only when you start to <pause dur="0.2"/> say it or listen to other people <pause dur="0.3"/> you realize that they don't <pause dur="0.2"/> understand this or they understand you know <pause dur="0.7"/> <trunc>i</trunc> <trunc>i</trunc> in some totally different way <pause dur="0.7"/> and you begin to get the feel of what it is that you'd need to do <pause dur="0.5"/> to make what you've understood <pause dur="0.3"/> actually available to the whole group out there to sort of you know <pause dur="0.3"/> to objectify it to meet the various angles from which <pause dur="0.4"/> people might be looking on on ostensibly the same object <pause dur="0.4"/> so i think the kind of # <pause dur="0.4"/> tuning in that you need for for for for good examination <pause dur="0.4"/> is <pause dur="0.3"/> very largely a viva voce one <pause dur="0.4"/> and if you communicate that sense in the in in the answer <pause dur="0.3"/> that <trunc>a</trunc> as it were as if you were in a kind of debate but <pause dur="0.2"/> giving <unclear>your own</unclear> intervention as they say these days <pause dur="0.4"/> that that that's probably the thing that will come over well </u><gap reason="break in recording" extent="uncertain"/> <u who="nm0061" trans="pause"> 
thinking about essays <pause dur="0.2"/> perhaps in some ways these are even more tricky <pause dur="0.3"/> because <pause dur="1.1"/> you invest more time in it <pause dur="1.0"/> and <pause dur="0.3"/> essays are just about long enough by the time you're doing your second and third year essays you know for things if they're going to go wrong <pause dur="0.2"/> you know to go more <pause dur="0.4"/> seriously wrong <pause dur="0.7"/> so let's <pause dur="0.3"/> <vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/> think a little bit about # <pause dur="0.5"/> how you go about essays <pause dur="0.3"/> one thing of course <pause dur="0.7"/> is always the starting point that we've hung on to this word essay <pause dur="0.6"/> i mean we could call it <pause dur="0.2"/> something else <pause dur="0.9"/> but we do hang on to that <pause dur="0.2"/> word we don't call it a paper or something we call it an essay <pause dur="0.7"/> so it hangs on to this <pause dur="0.5"/> root meaning of an attempt <pause dur="0.5"/> having a go <pause dur="0.3"/> at something <pause dur="1.0"/> and of course that will be an important part of your <pause dur="0.7"/> education no one's expecting you <pause dur="1.1"/> to know all about you know the literatures <pause dur="0.2"/> you're reading <pause dur="0.2"/> you are actually in the act of discovering it <pause dur="0.8"/> and the act of discovery is not just the reading of the text <pause dur="0.5"/> but when you try to make sense <pause dur="0.3"/> of your <pause dur="0.4"/> response to that text <pause dur="0.4"/> very often it 
starts as a kind of blur or a gut feeling about this and that <pause dur="0.4"/> and the discovery is very often a discovery of your own response <pause dur="0.6"/> so that the process of <pause dur="0.3"/> writing an essay <pause dur="0.3"/> you know is a process of discovering something <pause dur="0.5"/> you know # # about yourself really <pause dur="0.2"/> but of course in relation to the text it's a kind of dialogue between yourself <pause dur="0.4"/> and the text so hanging on to that <pause dur="0.6"/> notion of an attempt <pause dur="0.2"/> the essay is an attempt at something <pause dur="0.6"/> <trunc>o</trunc> # you know would be quite useful for for for tuning into <pause dur="0.3"/> # # <pause dur="0.4"/> what we're doing here <pause dur="0.9"/> # in the sciences for example <pause dur="0.7"/> when people are doing <pause dur="0.4"/> a PhD <pause dur="1.3"/> they will often refer to the process of what they call <pause dur="0.2"/> writing up <pause dur="0.7"/> are you <pause dur="0.2"/> writing up yet you know this this phrase goes around <unclear>it's going round</unclear> <pause dur="0.5"/> and of course that <pause dur="0.5"/> no doubt makes sense they spend about <pause dur="0.2"/> you know three years whatever it is <pause dur="0.3"/> getting all their <pause dur="0.4"/> # information in from their machines and in in their laboratory <pause dur="0.3"/> and then they have this bit at the end you know where they just <pause dur="0.3"/> write up <pause dur="0.2"/> you know what 
the conclusions were <pause dur="0.4"/> you see <pause dur="0.4"/> well that of course would be a deeply misleading way to look <pause dur="0.6"/> at research or writing in English <pause dur="0.4"/> and it would be as misleading for undergraduates as it would be for <pause dur="0.3"/> PhD research students <pause dur="0.5"/> because they are actually <pause dur="0.4"/> doing their research as it were in the writing <pause dur="0.7"/> 'cause the research is partly <pause dur="0.4"/> into themselves <pause dur="0.5"/> you know and into their way of <pause dur="0.2"/> thinking about <pause dur="0.3"/> the topic <pause dur="0.5"/> 'cause i'll tell you one thing my friends <pause dur="0.3"/> in in the in the topic we work in in the subject of English <pause dur="0.5"/> answers are almost always banal <pause dur="0.5"/> and sort of useless and boring <pause dur="0.4"/> it's understanding the problem <pause dur="0.4"/> that's interesting <pause dur="0.4"/> so when you're doing essays <pause dur="0.2"/> don't feel driven <pause dur="0.4"/> to come up with some sort of <pause dur="0.3"/> you know a <pause dur="0.5"/> conclusion that puts it all to bed you know 'cause usually that that will actually be sort of rather <pause dur="0.3"/> tedious and was already there <pause dur="0.5"/> what actually <pause dur="0.3"/> gets the reader going is if you read something that opens up for you <pause dur="0.2"/> the complexity the difficulty the ambivalence the moving around you 
know of the <pause dur="0.3"/> of of of what's going on in the text that you're looking at <pause dur="0.4"/> so don't feel necessarily driven <pause dur="0.5"/> by <pause dur="0.2"/> <trunc>a</trunc> as it were a need to have a Q-E-D at the end <pause dur="0.5"/> much more interesting <pause dur="0.2"/> to find out what the problems are <pause dur="0.2"/> but to now understand clearly what they are <pause dur="0.7"/> not just to know well it's # you know it's difficult it's problematic <pause dur="0.2"/> but actually to be able to identify <pause dur="0.3"/> why and how it is so <pause dur="0.2"/> that's what will usually give the # # the life <pause dur="0.5"/> to your essay <pause dur="1.7"/> # <pause dur="0.9"/> now the other thing that you need to keep a <pause dur="1.1"/> # a careful eye on is the question as well of time management <pause dur="0.5"/> when you're writing essays <pause dur="0.6"/> we have a policy in the department <pause dur="0.9"/> of giving you at the beginning of your second and third year <pause dur="0.2"/> posted up <pause dur="0.2"/> on the board <pause dur="0.6"/> the <pause dur="0.2"/> dates for all <pause dur="0.2"/> assessed essays that come in over the year <pause dur="0.9"/> sometimes they may be a bit bunched together <pause dur="0.7"/> that doesn't mean that you all have to sit down <pause dur="0.6"/> on the same week and write those essays <pause dur="0.3"/> individually <pause dur="0.2"/> personally <pause dur="0.2"/> you plan your own schedule <pause dur="0.2"/> to see which essays you want to do <pause dur="0.2"/> first 
the point is they <pause dur="0.4"/> you may have three essays coming in within a week of each other <pause dur="0.4"/> it doesn't mean they have to be written <pause dur="0.3"/> within a week of each other <pause dur="0.6"/> now one of the ground rules of all this for all of us <pause dur="0.4"/> is that no one gets more time <pause dur="0.7"/> you know you've got your three-score years and ten as it were of your biblical allotment <pause dur="0.3"/> but you've got twenty-four hours a day you've got sixty <pause dur="0.4"/> # # # you know # # # minutes in the hour you can't change that <pause dur="1.2"/> but some people <pause dur="0.3"/> are better <pause dur="0.5"/> at making the time work better for them <pause dur="0.6"/> to work a bit more <pause dur="0.3"/> on their side <pause dur="0.9"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> and one tip <pause dur="0.3"/> might be for example <pause dur="1.6"/> # if someone asks me to give a talk in a year or so's time i may not really know what i'm going to say <pause dur="1.2"/> # but i will have somewhere or other you know in my anatomy a kind of gut <trunc>f</trunc> feeling or something that that <pause dur="0.3"/> yeah i'll i'll come up you know <pause dur="0.2"/> you know i'll sort of think about that over the year <pause dur="0.7"/> and i may not have time to think about it <pause dur="0.9"/> but i could put a little file on one side <pause dur="1.2"/> and while i'm going about my other 
business whether it's teaching or watching the telly or going shopping whatever <pause dur="0.3"/> all kinds of thoughts flit through your mind <pause dur="0.5"/> and if you've established a certain theme <pause dur="0.3"/> that you've put <pause dur="0.7"/> on the back <pause dur="0.3"/> burner there <pause dur="0.7"/> it will in fact attract things to it <pause dur="0.5"/> so that things that would have passed through your head and out the other side while you were reading <pause dur="0.3"/> you know something unrelated <pause dur="0.6"/> those things that would have been lost <pause dur="0.8"/> can actually sort of collect <pause dur="0.2"/> gradually <pause dur="0.3"/> around this and your theme can sort of <pause dur="0.6"/> build up <pause dur="0.2"/> you know <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> and so that's why we give you these things at the beginning of the year <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> so that you can plan the timing of your essay but also <pause dur="0.5"/> that you can start <pause dur="0.2"/> thinking about them <pause dur="0.4"/> rather than grab at the last minute <pause dur="0.3"/> a topic <pause dur="0.3"/> that you've got to you know give in in <pause dur="0.4"/> two weeks' time or whatever it is <pause dur="0.3"/> if you try to go into each course <pause dur="0.4"/> with an author <pause dur="0.9"/> a theme <pause dur="0.3"/> a question <pause dur="0.2"/> something or other that you think <pause dur="0.2"/> will be your point of interest you know what you're really 
interested in <pause dur="0.4"/> if you identify that at the beginning of the year <pause dur="0.7"/> you'd be quite surprised how often <pause dur="0.3"/> the conversation in seminars and lectures and whatever <pause dur="0.2"/> might just sort of cross over <pause dur="0.3"/> that theme in a way as i say you wouldn't have noticed <pause dur="0.2"/> if you hadn't identified <pause dur="0.3"/> you know your centre of interest first <pause dur="0.5"/> and so even though you're not going to get more time <pause dur="0.7"/> to <pause dur="0.5"/> work on that essay <pause dur="0.7"/> you can give your mind more time <pause dur="0.5"/> and you can give that bit of your mind that's most important which is <pause dur="0.2"/> the less <pause dur="0.3"/> conscious the less willed bit of it <pause dur="1.2"/> to to to you know <pause dur="0.2"/> to let it <pause dur="0.4"/> get on with that job <pause dur="0.6"/> so that's just a few thoughts about time management you might as well # # # # # # # <pause dur="0.2"/> also think as part of time management <pause dur="0.4"/> that <pause dur="0.3"/> you don't really want to be doing that essay at two o'clock <pause dur="0.6"/> the night before <pause dur="0.7"/> you know it's given in <pause dur="0.7"/> # it's as well to try to time yourselves to give it a week or so beforehand <pause dur="0.9"/> so that you can reread it cold <pause dur="0.7"/> because one of the hardest things curiously enough to do is to 
proofread your own work <pause dur="1.5"/> and i remember a <pause dur="0.2"/> a retired professor of this department some years ago remarking on this <pause dur="0.4"/> fact that you work on this book <pause dur="0.5"/> <trunc>k</trunc> God knows how many times you know you've read this <pause dur="0.5"/> typescript you know then it goes off to the publisher and they have professional people who go through it <pause dur="0.2"/> you know line by line very carefully you know and then <pause dur="0.3"/> then comes the day when the postman you know drops the finished book <pause dur="0.4"/> you know through your letter box and you pick it up and there is it you <pause dur="0.3"/> you open it and there's this stupid typo waving and jeering at you and you think <pause dur="0.2"/> how did that get there it's the first thing that you see when you open the book you see <pause dur="0.4"/> # and then you look but yes it was there it was there all the way your eye passes over it <pause dur="0.8"/> because you <pause dur="0.2"/> you're reading what you are expecting to read not what's <pause dur="0.4"/> on the page you see <pause dur="0.3"/> so <pause dur="0.3"/> although it sounds a very simple thing <pause dur="0.2"/> proofread proofreading is actually <pause dur="0.4"/> # something you really have to concentrate on and 
do cold <pause dur="0.3"/> rather than doing it <pause dur="0.2"/> while you're still warm with the subject <pause dur="0.2"/> because the subject will otherwise just read over <pause dur="0.4"/> # # # what's you know on on the text on the page <pause dur="0.3"/> so give yourself some time to <pause dur="0.3"/> to make sure <pause dur="0.3"/> you're coming in <pause dur="0.2"/> properly dressed with your essay <pause dur="0.5"/> okay <pause dur="0.2"/> so that it makes the right impact on the # <pause dur="0.4"/> # # on the reader <pause dur="1.2"/> well the other <pause dur="0.2"/> i mean that's essay writing <pause dur="0.4"/> # <vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/> the other <pause dur="0.4"/> thing that we're thinking about this morning is the question of scholarly practice <pause dur="1.0"/> and <pause dur="0.6"/> here what i particularly want to talk about is the <pause dur="0.3"/> your relation <pause dur="0.9"/> to <pause dur="0.2"/> things that you read <pause dur="1.1"/> while you're getting your thoughts together <pause dur="0.5"/> for your essay <pause dur="0.5"/> you will be reading the primary text <pause dur="0.3"/> but you'll also be trying to get other kinds of historical and scholarly information <pause dur="0.5"/> you'll be trying to read around to see what kind of <pause dur="0.3"/> critical debates you know there have been about this question et cetera <pause dur="0.3"/> and that's quite right you should be bringing <pause dur="0.5"/> # a sense of of 
that <pause dur="0.2"/> informed background <pause dur="0.3"/> to the text that you're reading that that is part of the skill <pause dur="0.9"/> but <pause dur="0.8"/> it's quite a dangerous area it's quite a slippery <pause dur="0.2"/> area <pause dur="0.9"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> what i'm advising you to do is to take very careful notes of what you read <pause dur="0.5"/> because what's important is to be able to distinguish <pause dur="0.4"/> what you're saying <pause dur="0.5"/> from what <pause dur="0.3"/> other people <pause dur="0.3"/> have said <pause dur="0.5"/> if you want to agree with them that's okay <pause dur="0.4"/> but you still have to indicate <pause dur="0.3"/> that that is what you're doing <pause dur="0.4"/> you know <pause dur="0.4"/> of course very often if you're very clear about what other people are saying <pause dur="0.3"/> it will become clearer to you how you've got your own <pause dur="0.3"/> slightly different <pause dur="0.6"/> take on it <pause dur="0.2"/> you know <pause dur="0.4"/> and that there would be a perfectly legitimate a perfectly good <pause dur="0.3"/> kind of undergraduate essay <pause dur="0.5"/> that might have no very <pause dur="0.3"/> personal original <pause dur="0.3"/> # slant to it <pause dur="0.3"/> but which is a very lucid <pause dur="0.6"/> a very <pause dur="0.2"/> just you know very helpful <pause dur="0.3"/> summary of the debate <pause dur="0.6"/> that's been going on out there that would be a perfectly reasonable kind of <pause dur="0.3"/> undergraduate essay that would demonstrate a real <pause dur="0.4"/> kind of 
understanding <pause dur="0.3"/> you see <pause dur="0.5"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> to write that kind of essay of course you have to be very clear <pause dur="0.3"/> about what all these different people <pause dur="0.3"/> have said and that's why it it's a perfectly legitimate <pause dur="0.4"/> kind of essay to do <pause dur="0.4"/> but you can see that there is the danger <pause dur="0.8"/> of <pause dur="0.2"/> reading things <pause dur="0.6"/> or taking notes <pause dur="0.3"/> and they all go into a kind of <pause dur="0.7"/> soup <pause dur="0.3"/> you know # in your mind and then <pause dur="0.2"/> later when it comes to <pause dur="0.3"/> # # writing your essay you're really sort of taking ladlefuls of this <pause dur="0.3"/> soup out not quite sure <pause dur="0.3"/> where it all came from you know what the <pause dur="0.4"/> # what the ingredients were you see <pause dur="0.4"/> now at this point you begin to get into the danger <pause dur="0.3"/> of course of what we call <pause dur="0.2"/> plagiarism <pause dur="0.6"/> which is really <pause dur="0.2"/> passing off other people's work <pause dur="0.3"/> as your own <pause dur="0.2"/> you see <pause dur="0.6"/> and <pause dur="0.8"/> of course i do have to say stern words about <pause dur="0.4"/> the possibility of plagiarism <pause dur="0.3"/> it is my belief <pause dur="0.6"/> that <pause dur="0.6"/> we don't have with you as groups of students going through <pause dur="0.2"/> a kind of serious problem about <pause dur="0.4"/> real plagiarism <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> # i think that is # that's probably the case but it is a 
matter that we have to <pause dur="0.3"/> take seriously for everyone's sake and you will find that the university <pause dur="0.3"/> takes a very serious view of it so that if <pause dur="0.4"/> someone has <pause dur="0.8"/> plagiarized <pause dur="0.2"/> an essay <pause dur="0.4"/> you know they will be treated quite <pause dur="0.5"/> severely and <pause dur="0.2"/> it it will be zero for the work et cetera <pause dur="0.2"/> okay and they they do take quite a stern <pause dur="0.3"/> view of that <pause dur="0.2"/> and it's not left really to our judgement there are university <pause dur="0.3"/> # rules about that so that's the little bit of the <pause dur="0.3"/> riot act you see that i need to <pause dur="0.3"/> make sure that you've # # that you've heard <pause dur="0.3"/> but what i'm really interested in is that most cases <pause dur="0.6"/> of <pause dur="0.2"/> what <pause dur="0.3"/> might come under the heading of plagiarism <pause dur="0.5"/> will probably not be <pause dur="0.3"/> absolutely deliberate cheating <pause dur="0.8"/> but may be bad practice <pause dur="0.7"/> in terms of presenting your work <pause dur="0.4"/> and getting lost as to <pause dur="0.3"/> what you scribbled out as your own notes <pause dur="0.3"/> as a kind of draft <pause dur="0.2"/> and something that you scribbled out from a book <pause dur="0.4"/> # you know and then didn't # # # and then lost the reference or <pause dur="0.2"/> you know it just got <pause dur="0.4"/> assimilated to your own and you 
you forgot that it it was someone else's et cetera <pause dur="0.3"/> there's this whole sort of <pause dur="0.3"/> grey area that you have to keep a <pause dur="0.4"/> have to keep an eye on you see <pause dur="0.4"/> so do keep very careful notes on that <pause dur="0.5"/> and indicate <trunc>w</trunc> <pause dur="0.5"/> <trunc>w</trunc> what you've taken and what you're <pause dur="0.2"/> what you're using <pause dur="0.2"/> you know <pause dur="0.3"/> of course as far as <pause dur="0.8"/> straight plagiarism goes <pause dur="1.9"/> i mean one thing about it is that's it's a <pause dur="1.1"/> it's a folly <pause dur="1.1"/> because <pause dur="1.5"/> as strange as it may seem to you and incredible though it may seem to you most of the people who work in education <pause dur="0.3"/> do actually rather like students <pause dur="0.4"/> and they're rather interested in the subjects that they they do <pause dur="0.4"/> and so <pause dur="0.2"/> actually they're not <pause dur="0.6"/> you know they can't be made happier than by you know giving you know # # giving you the subject teaching you getting you to understand it you see <pause dur="0.5"/> but if you <pause dur="0.4"/> put yourself in a position <pause dur="0.3"/> where you isolate yourself from that <pause dur="0.4"/> process <pause dur="0.4"/> there's nothing they can do about it and they don't know about it <pause dur="0.4"/> so the person who does as it were <pause dur="0.2"/> build these defensive <pause dur="0.2"/> bulwarks by <pause dur="0.4"/> you 
know # plagiarizing essays or whatnot <pause dur="0.3"/> has only in a sense <pause dur="0.2"/> damaged themselves in the first instance you know they've lost the possibility <pause dur="0.4"/> of # # # # of the tutor <pause dur="0.3"/> being able to help them <pause dur="0.2"/> and like most things in life then of course it becomes a <pause dur="0.3"/> a reinforcing <pause dur="0.4"/> cycle <pause dur="0.3"/> they would get more and more nervous about really putting them<pause dur="0.2"/>selves in the hands of the tutor whereas if they'd done that right at the beginning <pause dur="0.4"/> they might have found that it was quite a fruitful <pause dur="0.3"/> relation they develop more confidence and of course it's becomes <pause dur="0.5"/> a virtual cycle you know <pause dur="0.4"/> so it is a folly because it it it it hurts you first <pause dur="0.6"/> but <trunc>o</trunc> but of course it is something more than a folly <pause dur="0.4"/> because <pause dur="0.5"/> it's a crime <pause dur="0.4"/> you know as i said <pause dur="0.3"/> we have <pause dur="0.4"/> regulations and rules <pause dur="0.3"/> and if you break them <pause dur="0.2"/> you know you <pause dur="0.2"/> you you have to be punished <pause dur="0.5"/> but # <pause dur="1.1"/> more than a crime of course it's a sin <pause dur="1.1"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> # because a thing may or not be <pause dur="0.8"/> illegal under any kind of <pause dur="0.3"/> jurisdiction <pause dur="0.5"/> but a sin is something that <pause dur="0.2"/> runs right against and damages the values of <pause dur="0.3"/> 
everything we're here for <pause dur="0.3"/> you know <pause dur="1.0"/> in fact it's more than a sin it's a dishonour <pause dur="1.1"/> # <pause dur="0.8"/> because <pause dur="0.5"/> not just our subject but the whole scholarly community in a certain sense <pause dur="0.7"/> works <pause dur="0.2"/> on a measure of trust <pause dur="0.5"/> even in the sciences <pause dur="0.6"/> which you think of as hard bench <pause dur="0.4"/> you know information <pause dur="0.4"/> no one actually can go around <pause dur="0.3"/> and actually test out <pause dur="0.3"/> all of the things <pause dur="0.3"/> that they have to take in <pause dur="0.4"/> when they're <pause dur="0.2"/> you know developing new <pause dur="0.4"/> theories they work in their own patch <pause dur="0.4"/> and they have in a certain sense <pause dur="0.2"/> to trust <pause dur="0.7"/> what the larger scholarly <pause dur="0.3"/> community you know in their <pause dur="0.3"/> # # in their area is doing <pause dur="0.8"/> so it's # <pause dur="1.0"/> it it it it's because of that trust that we are in a certain sense <pause dur="0.4"/> on our honour <pause dur="0.5"/> to behave properly in these things <pause dur="0.3"/> and the <pause dur="0.2"/> of course the positive way to look at this to put a positive spin on it <pause dur="0.6"/> is rather to think <pause dur="0.3"/> what is the state of the person who <pause dur="0.5"/> you know who who who who who gets into this frame of mind <pause dur="0.3"/> i think we're all <pause dur="0.5"/> rather <pause dur="0.6"/> overcome <pause dur="0.6"/> you know by the massive amount there is <pause dur="0.2"/> to know <pause dur="0.3"/> to understand 
we're all like <pause dur="0.2"/> # you know Isaac Newton on the <pause dur="0.4"/> on the beach there thinking of what there was to know this infinite ocean and he was just <pause dur="0.4"/> picking up the odd stone the odd pebble from the beach you know this is <pause dur="0.3"/> Isaac Newton you know who was a great figure of the eighteenth century <pause dur="0.5"/> knowledge that's how he saw it you know let alone any of us coming along you see <pause dur="0.3"/> so we're it's very easy <pause dur="0.2"/> to feel <pause dur="0.6"/> psychologically overwhelmed you know by what you're doing <pause dur="0.7"/> and maybe a kind of fruitful image to have # # in relation to the scholarly <pause dur="0.5"/> practice is that maybe <pause dur="0.5"/> you know we're all there to put the odd little brick in the odd little stone in the pyramid <pause dur="0.9"/> and we can sort of see the whole <pause dur="0.2"/> pyramid in very rough terms <pause dur="0.4"/> but none of us really can build the whole pyramid by ourselves <pause dur="0.7"/> but what we can do is make sure that that particular stone was laid properly <pause dur="1.4"/> now what that means in scholarly terms <pause dur="0.5"/> is that if you are making a claim based on something else <pause dur="0.3"/> or passing on a judgement from somewhere 
else <pause dur="0.3"/> whatever it is that you're putting into the debate or the pyramid <pause dur="0.4"/> you always indicate <pause dur="0.4"/> who your source is where you got it from <pause dur="1.2"/> and then you leave that for the next stone <pause dur="0.4"/> to sit on <pause dur="0.4"/> as it were <pause dur="0.5"/> now if someone comes along at a later point and says <pause dur="0.4"/> hang on <pause dur="0.3"/> there's something fishy here because that's how <trunc>m</trunc> knowledge moves on <pause dur="0.6"/> you realize that a mistake has been made way down there somewhere <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> and so you go back to try to rethink that but you need the chain you need to be able to get back <pause dur="0.5"/> so what you leave in place <pause dur="0.2"/> is not that you are responsible for the whole pyramid <pause dur="0.3"/> but you're responsible for your brick <pause dur="0.2"/> your stone <pause dur="0.4"/> you've indicated <pause dur="0.3"/> where your sources were <pause dur="0.3"/> and the next person who comes along who wants to check that out <pause dur="0.3"/> can get back to that level <pause dur="0.2"/> and then that level <pause dur="0.3"/> and that level you see what i mean <pause dur="0.5"/> you see <pause dur="0.4"/> and these things <pause dur="0.7"/> <trunc>y</trunc> <trunc>y</trunc> # you know are just a matter of <pause dur="0.3"/> as it were getting the right disciplinary practice <pause dur="1.2"/> but <pause dur="0.2"/> of course big things can hang on them <pause dur="0.5"/> you know there was the 
case of a man called # <pause dur="0.7"/> Sir Cyril Burt who was a kind of educational <pause dur="0.6"/> psychologist sort of in the period <pause dur="0.2"/> after the war used to study <pause dur="0.7"/> twins and things and and and and looking at the question of <pause dur="0.5"/> intelligence and <pause dur="0.5"/> development <pause dur="1.0"/> and of course there's been a big argument through the century <pause dur="0.4"/> about to what extent intelligence is <pause dur="0.3"/> genetically given <pause dur="0.4"/> to what extent what we measure as intelligence <pause dur="0.3"/> is in fact a fact # # # # a response to culture and circumstance <pause dur="1.1"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> <vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/> <pause dur="0.3"/> and of course this man was working at a time <pause dur="0.4"/> when the government was setting up <pause dur="0.2"/> in this country you know that <pause dur="0.6"/> tripartite level if you thought that <trunc>pe</trunc> kids were born <pause dur="0.5"/> already intelligent <pause dur="0.2"/> then it made sense to scoop them out <pause dur="0.5"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> stick them in special schools you know twenty per cent or so or whatever it was you know <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> # that that would make a certain amount of sense if you didn't think <pause dur="0.5"/> that what you measured as intelligence was quite so clearly genetic as that then 
you might <pause dur="0.3"/> hesitate about that sort of thing you see <pause dur="0.4"/> so <pause dur="0.3"/> the the the conclusions about this would be quite important but you see there was a big scandal about this man i mean it's argued both ways i wouldn't <pause dur="0.3"/> take a position on that but you see people found <pause dur="0.4"/> when they started looking into the research <pause dur="0.4"/> that you couldn't actually get back <pause dur="0.4"/> to the sources <pause dur="0.6"/> the statistics were quoted about research on kids you see and whatnot <pause dur="0.2"/> but when you actually tried to get back well who was this <pause dur="0.3"/> researcher who who who who did this and where is the <pause dur="0.4"/> evidence they found that it it tended to sort of <pause dur="0.4"/> run into the sand you see so all kinds of questions were then <pause dur="0.3"/> thrown up <pause dur="0.2"/> about the whole edifice of knowledge and <pause dur="0.3"/> and judgement that was built up <pause dur="0.3"/> there you see <pause dur="0.3"/> and none of us know <pause dur="0.3"/> none of us know really what kind of things <pause dur="0.2"/> at some later point are going to prove to be important <pause dur="0.5"/> but one thing you can do is to go out in the world <pause dur="1.0"/> properly trained in that kind of internal discipline <pause dur="0.5"/> so that 
you're responsible <pause dur="0.4"/> for your own patch <pause dur="0.3"/> okay <pause dur="0.2"/> that's really what # <pause dur="0.3"/> # # <pause dur="0.2"/> we're after <pause dur="0.9"/> # because in a way you see <pause dur="0.2"/> although <pause dur="0.4"/> intellectual life is often a matter of a debate and opponents and arguing with other people <pause dur="0.8"/> the most dangerous person around is always yourself of course <pause dur="0.9"/> # as Cicero said in one of his # # legal orations <pause dur="0.3"/> men will <pause dur="0.4"/> readily believe <pause dur="0.8"/> what they wish to be true <pause dur="0.6"/> and that's what we all do <pause dur="0.2"/> you know we're inclined you know to see much more force in the evidence <pause dur="0.3"/> that supports us <pause dur="0.3"/> you know than the evidence that doesn't et cetera <pause dur="0.4"/> so we need these kind of externally <pause dur="0.3"/> acquired disciplines <pause dur="0.3"/> to protect us not just from the subject and from others <pause dur="0.2"/> but most importantly <pause dur="0.3"/> # from ourselves okay <pause dur="0.5"/> but other than that despite all my # <pause dur="0.2"/> you know # # admonitory tones there <pause dur="0.2"/> of course i i wish you every success in what you're doing over <pause dur="0.4"/> over the next three years <pause dur="0.3"/> okay <pause dur="0.2"/> thank you
