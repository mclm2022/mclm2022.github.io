</u><u who="sm5114"> okay
</u><u who="nm5095"> it's not in my hands it's in yours and you'll have to learn how to do this very quickly because you shall see that the second year and and the third years of this course has their own writing groups and writing societies their own writing magazines and all that and although i can i can i can kind of help you to kick-start at all those things it's not really my job to involve myself to closely in this you got to learn to do to do those things yourself 
</u><u who="sm5115"> okay does anyone play a musical instrument put up your hands please 
</u><u who="nm5095"> who plays a musical instrument

</u><u who="nm5095"> very good
</u><u who="sm5117"> okay # a momentous feeling and a good mistake is how my life will end it's you i dare for you i care and i'm in love with my best friend i fall and you will fall i need i need to work you out for real my lucky star is way too far but you're still here and close to me 
</u><u who="nm5095"> what's your response to that

</u><u who="nm5095"> you were trying to think ahead to what was going to happen next 
</u><u who="sm5115"> i'm afraid i was
</u><u who="nm5095"> and not able to think on the spot that was very good you're using extreme long a long line 
</u><u who="sm5117"> oh yeah okay
</u><u who="nm5095"> yeah there's another # secret with the seminar <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> but you should never do this you should always pick up on the people who're most confident all right 'cause they're easy they always want to be there you know it's like you know you and and it's it's it's easy peasy but you got to do something likely to stun just more random so who's going to be in charge of the seminar now to get another person to read out <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> so you're in charge of the seminar yeah okay teach us choose somebody but bring somehow bring them out

</u><u who="nm5095"> very good # before we take a break i'm going to give give you a very short practical session in how you submit your work to magazines this isn't often done it's usually done with postgraduates not with undergraduates but i'm finding more and more that the the standard of the writing that my own undergraduates are producing is of a publishable standard but because they lack confidence about their own writing they don't often send it out and the other reason why they don't send it out is because they don't know how to # this is how it works in this country this a very boring part of the seminar and i'm afraid it's not going to work on the film but it's important for you guys even though it's boring and i wish somebody had told me this when i was 18 or 19 right when you when you're choosing to submit pieces of work to a magazine or a journal first you have to do you you have to be familiar with with with with the journal you have to know what the journal is like what the magazine is like there's no point in sending a nature poem for instance to Leaf Scientist or the Independent there's no point at all you won't get read or get accepted you have to know which kind of magazines are going to take your poem so how do you go about that step one read the magazines where are they some of them are in the are in the library here now listen # most undergraduates do this when they go into the library you see them doing this they go straight in they swipe their cards they go up to the third floor and they sometimes use some of the books from the OPAC there you shouldn't always do that when you go into the library instead of going straight on on to the lifts turn left turn left against these things there which are the magazine racks those magazine racks contain if you go to the Arts # area about twenty poetry magazines from around the world including things like you might want to write this down Poetry Review Poetry Chicago P-N Review it's called Poetry Nation Review <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> The London Review of Books The Times Literary Supplement The Realtor The London Magazine which is by the way the magazine where Keats was first published still going # that's just a few what i want you to to to do probably between now and and the end of week six is actually to go to that magazine rack find a magazine read them and see which one best suits you now it has to be said that there're hundreds and hundreds of magazines some are small press some are bigger press and if you want to find out all the magazines the place to go to is not our library or any library but a place called the Poetry Library the Poetry Library could you write that down this is an incredibly good resource it's one of the best resources in Europe well it's it's it's certainly one of the best outside a-, America it's in the Royal Festival Hall on the fifth floor of the Royal Festival Hall on the South Bank Centre in London fifth floor Royal Festival Hall now however poor or rich you are either take a train there through all those smashed trees or hitchhike # if you're interested and concerned about poetry that place is heaven it's also a house of heavenly poetic opening hours too it doesn't open at nine and and close at five so it opens at eleven which is good and it closes at eight o'clock at night which is also good now it contains you might want to write this down again every book of contemporary poetry every book of contemporary poetry in English that's been published in the twentieth century two copies of each one for reference that you can't take away and one copy that can be taken away membership is free and the librarian's name there who's in charge of the whole thing is called Mary Enright Mary Enright please please write that down i'm giving you i'm giving you contacts now # she knows me and the work i do and if you go along and you say that you're a student and part of this course she will know exactly what you're talking about and will help you it's a great place to research if you're doing research it's also a very good place to write it doesn't just contain books it contains audio audio and video C-D-ROMs and importantly magazines it contains and takes a sub-, a subscription of every poetry magazine that's published in this country and most of them in America too that's the important thing what i would suggest that you do sometimes maybe as a maybe as a team or i-, individually is going to that library and spend an entire day or two days reading those magazines and see what they feel like everything from Haiku Quarterly if you're into Haiku there's an entire magazine devoted to that to P-N Review which you can get in in the library here to strange things like Psychopoetica really small press weird things there's some very strange magazines out there but often that's where the most valuable and interesting work is taking place 'cause if you write something bizarre sorry i wasn't looking at you there that sort of thing the there bizarre speciously even if you send that to the London Magazine they ain't going to take it because it's slightly conservative in its take-up on poetry it's nothing entirely wrong with that it's just that they want to publish a certain type of poetry the psy-, Psychopoetica say would have no problem with that so just because your work might get rejected from one magazine might not mean that that work is somehow bad or has failed it just means you've sent it to the wrong magazine now that's terribly terribly important now other magazines you should know about too which you probably do on the campus here # one magazine that grew grew out of the programme about two years ago and was run by some students like like yourselves it's called The Moebius let me just write that down on the board i remember what fun we had choosing that title The Moebius which is now a national magazine for poetry and takes submissions from # anybody but which is rather largely dominated by ex-Warwick students has to be said because they they writing about it and the Malacoda have you come across the Malacoda that's a campus-based magazine that's asking for submissions right now and it's run by two students who are second years in your degree # <gap reason="name" extent="2 words"/> and <gap reason="name" extent="2 words"/> and the third one is called The Black Beast the Black Beast now the good things about all these magazines is that they're not just # # amateur productions they actually have quite high  professional standards of production and also and this is something that i very much insist on right from from the beginning they have very high editorial standards too it's actually quite hard to get into but the standard of the work is terribly terribly good as a result now those are those are three magazines on the campus i think you should try and read those two right now this is how you submit writing to magazines you don't submit your life's work nothing is more <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> i've edited my work for # poetry presses too there's nothing more off o-, o-, o-, off-p-, p-, p-, off-putting than somebody submitting a huge volume of inadequate poetry choose your best poems and send no more than four to one magazine at any time if you're not happy with any of those poems don't send those poems because if you're not happy with them the editor certainly won't be either that's just basic common sense # and although it seems like a truism honestly most people who've sent stuff to magazines don't have a clue about this sort of thing they just think that they're geniuses to start off with and would send it in and lots of it too rather than just a kernel of really good work right when you send work you should also also send a short covering letter now i emphasis the word short there it should be no more than two paragraphs you should not make a personal plea for your work your work should speak for itself many people make the mistake of sending a letter which is like sometimes extremely long long winded and very personal and it's not really about their own work it's about themselves and their view of themselves as an artist and frankly that's of no interest i'm sorry but that's of no interest to an editor at all unless you become terribly well known like Mark <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> then journalists might start preying into your personal life and your activity or might be interviewing you at <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> or Cheltenham Literature Festival about your personal life but when it comes to sending new work out your own personality is of no interest the work is short two paragraphs and it should be something like this please find enclosed X number of poems for consideration second paragraph i enclose an S-A-E for their return i enclose an S-A-E for their return because the likelihood is they will be returned to to you but you never know now the S-A-E is a stamped addressed envelope and one of the cardinal sins that many writers and new writers do is not just that they write long letters and submit their life's work but they don't enclose a self-addressed envelope # a publisher of a magazine is under no obligation to read your work or to send it back to you unless you enclose a self-addressed envelope if you're submitting work overseas particularly to America you obviously can't enclose an an American stamp on your envelope therefore you enclose an envelope and what's called an international reply coupon an I-R-C which you can buy in the post office they cost about fifty-P an I-R-C you'll get your work back and you will <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> other rules of the game never submit work by email never submit work by email it's too easy to do these days it's too easy to do and most magazines will not accept submissions by email in fact when i get work sent by e-, email i delete it straight away there's not enough time other things to bear in mind too the long wait you will have to wait for this work to come back allow up to about three or four months for a message to come back as in saying yes or no takes a while why does it take that simply because most magazines are underfunded and 
most most of the editors of these ma-, magazines work for nothing but they do it in the small hours # the London Magazine is a famous magazine it's edited in a shed you know you have to bear those things in mind this magazine is eighteen years old it's edited from a shed now it may have a huge international reputation but it has those constraints upon it so wait and wait and wait do not hassle the publisher or get impatient other rules too poets don't have agents poets do not have agents unless you're a performance poet poets do not have agents that's terrifically important and if people think they can send their work to agents now those people will be snapped up fiction writers use agents because fiction is an engine for creating money i talked about this i think in # in week two big difference between poetry and fiction poetry is not going to earn you any money okay you do it for other reasons you can be Seamus <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> and still be making fifteen-thousand a year he makes money by other means by teaching actually he teaches at # Princeton now don't hassle agents with your poems send it directly to the editors and do not hassle the editors stamped addressed envelope <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> and no more than four poems everything should be typed or word processed and it should all be in one-and-a-half space okay one-and-a-half space so it's clear use a good printer do not use a dot matrix printer <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> or an inadequate typewriter make sure it's really crystal clear and that the poems appear on on the page exactly how you wish the poems to appear sometimes your work will be accepted sometimes it will be rejected how do you cope with rejection how do you cope with rejection
</u><u who="sm5121"> # </u><u who="nm5095"> </u><u who="sm5121"> just do it 
</u><u who="nm5095"> mm there's a a certain thing about those things they're called rejection slips now rejection in this case is not rejection of you as a person it's rejection of your work and most writers not just not just all writers will be rejected at some point from James Joyce to Richards Adams to whoever they've all been rejected most people get <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> for a lucky break Seamus <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> is a very good example of that for a time he was quite anonymous it was only because a friend of his who knew his work well tipped of Favour that he was any good and Favour got in touch with him and he it was just luck it was just a lucky break he could be <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> instead and still be as good as Seamus <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> is you can be invisible and you you can still be good so how do you cope with rejection when that work comes back this is how you send it off that day to another magazine immediately send it off on the same day now the reason to do that you do that is that when you've got work out sent out when you got work out to be considered there's a strange feeling of hope that will be inside of yourself that next day something is going to come through your letterbox and it's going to be something accepting your work make sure that that work that comes back from somebody goes straight out again so you can keep that feeling going the last bit is about vanity presses there are a lot of vanity presses about vanity presses exist to take your work whatever quality dubious or good and publish it and charge you a fee for doing so if anybody ever asks you for money for publishing your work you should not proceed further with the deal do not sign anything do not send in any contract do not get into that area 'cause this is the big warning if you're good and you're published by a vanity press and you then send your work to a reviewer or another editor however good you are the chances are is that A you will not be reviewed and B your work will not be accepted by a mainstream or even a small press ever again because be aware that with a vanity press and a vanity press is in short a corrupt and a corrupting business a vanity press is just for one purpose and that is to make money for itself not to sell your work now vanity presses are often advertised in things like The Times Literary Supplement they say we want war memoirs poetry children's books nobody wants more war memoirs poetry or children's books there are millions of theses things nobody no publisher in their right minds would advertise for more submissions but the <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> will then send their work whatever the quality good or bad to these places and you will get a letter back often within two days saying we think you're outstanding this is fantastic you're the next Keats now we're going to publish you in this anthology which will be leather tooled now to help us with our printing cost could you please send us two-thousand pound now this may this may sound strange but people then do send them and they say no you can you can pay you can pay in thirty pound instalments you sign it away because you're so pleased the next thing you're tied to a contract which is going to mean you're sending out thirty pounds a month for maybe a couple of years you then receive back a leather tooled book which looks absolutely ghastly where all the poems are going to be packed in in a really really intelligible typescript with a letter saying we're sending this book for review to The Independent The Sun The Express The Mail now the only paper that might review poetry is The Independent The Sun doesn't review poetry or literary stuff it doesn't review it neither does The Mail nor The Express but it sounds good and if you don't know this information you may fall for it but The Independent doesn't review vanity press books so what's happened is that you've you've lost two-thousand pounds you've got this book that looks like a book which actually isn't a book and nobody's going to read it apart from you and your own friends and it's about your own vanity now i'm not saying this to be hard up on anybody who's ever got into this what i'm saying is is that you got onto this course because we believe in you as good prospective potential writers or even real writers now if you get into that particular vanity area at an early stage it can destroy you as a writer because you'll get positive feedback which is actually false positive feedback and you'll be paying for it let's take a break come back in ten minutes
</u><gap reason="break in recording" extent="uncertain"/> <u who="nm5095"> hello it just occurred to me during the break now what i was saying about vanity publishing that applies very much here in the U-K and in # and in America which are the two principle markets for poetry # that doesn't hold true in places like Greece or # India or # Russia where quite simply there aren't any presses <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> there are there are some particular presses and in those particular presses you might you might have to pay but it's not va-, it's not actually vanity vanity publishing simply because the presses don't exist so you have to make it up as you go along on the board is the word poetics poetics poetics is a crucial matter that you need to introduce yourselves to as soon as possible it applies not just to yourself as a writer it applies across the board of all your academic studies and it applies to you as a person too poetics is a very loose phrase though # what it means is just like up on up on the board it's the implicit principles the implicit principles of your own writing and that can also mean the implicit principles of yourself as a writer now having written down the two things that are generally important to you as you could you try and write down two things that are important to you as a writer or the writer that you would like to become two things that you imagine are really really crucial to you as a writer now or as the writer that you'd like to become try and look ahead maybe twenty years time and think of yourself as an immaculately turned out super writer with a Noble Prize and think about the principles that you might be hanging on to that you might have now or you might have had but which are going to get battered as the years go by but you need to hold on to them because they're important to you as a writer or to your writing because those my friends are your poetics those are your poetics so why devote an entire lecture to what poetics is because if you actually open a one of these excellent texts like this which is my bible which is The New Princeton Encyclopaedia of Poetry and Poetics you will see that the the chapter on poetics is about that big lots of poets have their own poetics let me just introduce you to some aspects of poetics before i ask you for yours one could be you might want to write this down the choice of what you write about your subject the choice of what you write about you make the choice about what to write about your subject now one of the reason of this as a set text in the Modes of Reading The New Poetry one of the reasons why this is a set text for the Modes of Reading and the Modes of Writing # is because it is it is apparently a divers enough book to illustrate a number of poetics as well if you look into this book you'll find people like Caroline Duffy writing from the point of view of a psychopath a male psychopath now that's a <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> of what poetics means she's chosen a subject and a voice in order just to make a particular point you'll also find poems in here that are intensely political by people like Sean O'Brian you might want to write this down too something by Sean O'Brian which are basically political attacks upon right wing thinking now he's chosen to write those attacks in the forms of poetry he's chosen a subject politics and that's part of his poetics because he cares Sean O'Brian and Caroline Duffy care deeply about the political landscape of the last twenty years another aspect of poetics language language and i don't mean languages as in French Spanish Indian Chinese whatever i mean how you choose the language of your poems whether you choose to say write in a contemporary voice as though you're speaking to people or an example again from The New Poetry <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> who chooses to write in a very colloquial voice now that's a deliberate choice that <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> has made and it's part of his poetics it's to get across to a large number of people using dialect voices i'm going to read you an example of this to see if you can pick up the poetics behind it the implicit principles # have you have you all read the poem that finishes this book which i have very deliberately placed at the end of the book so that people would read it it's called Very Simply Topping Up The Brake Fluid why not open your copy of The New Poetry i'm going to read it out so you don't actually need it in front of you but if you've got it in front of you you've got the trick now i put this on page two-hundred-and-forty which is the last page of this book i put it there to make a statement about what i thought poetry was up to at this moment in time #

 book again as an illustration has anybody here read the poem by # Tom <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> Ten o'clock News let me just try and find it for you is anybody here Scottish excellent have you got a copy of The New Poetry close to you 
</u><u who="sm5098"> aye
</u><u who="nm5095"> great right well go to page seventy please and go to the poem called Unrelated Incidents syntax syntax folks the order of the words the way that words are put together do you think you could handle reading Unrelated Incidents to us
</u><u who="sm5098"> certainly
</u><u who="nm5095"> you have to read i mean look at that poem in front of you Unrelated Incidents it's written in Scots it's written in Scots dialect now i can't do a Scots accent could you handle it
</u><u who="sm5098"> possibly yeah
</u><u who="nm5095"> have a go at the first the first part
</u><u who="sm5098"> how am i supposed to read it
</u><u who="nm5095"> sorry
</u><u who="sm5098"> how am i supposed to read this
</u><u who="nm5095"> # it's it's the language 
</u><u who="sm5098"> no i mean
</u><u who="nm5095"> oh the <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> no oh that you just read it down
</u><u who="sm5098"> (poem in Scots)
</u><u who="nm5095"> yeah okay yes that's fine yeah now why is that poem written in that particular way what do you reckon <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/>
</u><u who="sm5098"> <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/>
</u><u who="nm5095"> what about part three this is the six o'clock news the man said and the reason i'm talking with a B-B-C accent is because you want me to talk about the truth (poem in attempted Scots from here) this is the six o'clock news belt up why is that written in that particular way as you see i really can't do a Scottish accent i just read it i just read it # <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> 
</u><u who="sm5097"> he's talking about language 
</u><u who="nm5095"> yeah he's making a particular statement about about about about the languages and also about the the validity of language too what did the Simon <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> poem do think about the Simon <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> poem again and think about this one the Simon <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> poem is is read out best if you talk like myself or Simon <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> that is you have a northern accent it's written in a northern accent this is written in a Scots accent and it's about it's about the six o'clock news and it's about truth and the way we talk and about language he's using syntax he's disturbing the syntax the order of the words in the way he's writing for a particular point what do you think that point is
</u><u who="sm5124"> # that # things only sound relevant said in a certain accent
</u><u who="nm5095"> mm yeah you also you also have to locate this poem in the time it was written which is probably about the early eighties i mean it's changed now if you listen to the # six o'clock news now or the ten o'clock news there are people on who are indeed Scottish or or Welsh and at this particular point they were they were usually white they were usually # middle class and they had # Received Pronunciation # the idea behind that poem is that is that the way that truth is told in this particular country is usually best received if you're if you're white middle class and you have Received Pronunciation and not if you're Scottish Indian Asian Welsh Irish or whatever now that's changed and that's one of the reasons why this that poem <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> introduce you to the idea that there's a lot of plurality in poetry in the way it can be written and there's a plurality in this country too so it's again syntax for a number of purposes language itself playing with the language but also a political point too couple of other things too voice and persona this is again part of poetics voice and persona persona is when you is when you as you actually probably know if you put on a mask persona is about putting on a mask is when you put on a mask and you write from a completely different point of view you'll be asked to do this quite a lot by <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> writing from from another person's point of view now there's a lot going on here with that particular thing one is # # in terms of <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> there are poems here by Fred <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> as well who was with us # a couple of weeks ago a little late # <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> and <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> Johnson where they they're using a a voice and a persona in a particular way to get across to you and expose what it was like to be a black person in this country in the nineteen-eighties and the nineteen-nineties and still is sometimes i i suggest that you read these and you think about them and you think about your own poetics and the last one i wrote down here is form form that's a kind of poetics too choosing to use form in a particular way <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> from now for four weeks and different forms and trying two different things the choice the choice to write in form is something that you deliberate about you do choose to write in form you know when i say write in a <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> write in a limerick write me a sonnet write me twenty lines of this write me five lines of this i'm asking you to do that in order to practise rather than to produce great works of art but just to practise but some people very deliberately choose not to write in form and example of this here might be something like <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> and again you have to ask yourself no i'll give you a different example i'll give you # Paul <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> Paul <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> is an Irish poet # now the poem that i am going to read to to you is not in form there's there's no form to it at all and he's deliberately chosen not to do so At The Funeral Of The Marriage this is about his divorce at the funeral of the marriage my wife and i passed on either side of the grave our children racing (?) behind it by the way it's on page 60 as the coffin was entered down in the bottomless grave our children stood in a half circle playing on flutes and recorders my wife and i held hands while the mourners wept and the gravediggers unfilled shovelfulls of clay down on top of the coffin we solely walked away accomplices beneath the <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> trees we had a cup of tea in the graveyard cafe across the streets from the gates and discussed the texture of the undertaker's face it's beaten quality as i gazed at my wife i wondered who on earth she was i saw that she was a green-eyed stranger i said to her would you like to go to a film and she said i'd love to go to a film in the back seats of a cinema sorry i would love to go to a film in the back seats of the cinema as we slid up and down in our seats in a frenzy of hugs and clasps the manager courteously asked us not to take off our clothes we walked off urgently through the rain strewn street into a <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> sudden cul de sac and as from the <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> of our bed <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> with sighs and cries we threw our funeral garments to the floor we could hear laughter outside the door there is no noise children love more to hear than the noise of their parents making love oh my darling who on earth are you now that's not written in form at all why do you think it's it's about it's about divorce and getting back together why has he chosen that to be #

</u><u who="nm5095"> he's found some pattern too hasn't he # for the sake of the subject and if you like the the the address that is the person he's speaking to # who is he speaking to oh my darling who on earth are you he says is he speaking to his wife and # the thing the thing i'm trying to get get across to you here is that this is actually quite an extreme poem it's it's talking about an extreme event and often when you're when you're writing in extremism it's called extreme form sometimes lets you down form sometimes just isn't the right thing to be using and free verse is often what a lot of confessional writers use it's worth bearing in mind that now from my point of view i think there's a kind of # something that you can attempt writers such as <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> who are what you'd call confessional poets writing about extreme events doo-, doomed affairs for instance suicide # depression often write in free verse they're pioneers of free verse but as i said to you two weeks ago there's no more to my mind confessional poem than say Dante's The Divine Comedy which is about a personal and real <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> to <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> in order to find his lost love Beatrice and yet that's written in total <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> now six centuries ago or eight centuries ago when Dante wrote that obviously people didn't write in free verse that wasn't the convention these days it is a convention that when you're writing in extremism you use free verse because of the success if you like of the confessional poets convinced a lot of people you might be a generation <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> you might be a generation that might want to think about whether form could once more be regenerated and used in extremism i think it's an interesting area you could go into it's one i'm trying to push the second year at the moment to so they're finding that if they're writing triple sixtiners (<gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/>) about loss they have a lot more impact than say one page in free verse about loss okay my poetics my poetics my own poetics are things like # i think the the language of science and the <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> of science are terrifically important and as important is anything that could be discovered in philosophy or in the arts therefore my own poetry does have a lot of science in it # perception i think one needs to keep at all costs one's perceptions as clear as possible whether that perception is of another person or a political situation or a form for me like my own poetics perceptions is a key being clear being clear and not obscure is also one of my poetics other things more personal i think one should try to be in # in our life and all our lives are in many ways dishonest in various corners in your own poetry you should be utterly honest that's another one of my poetics and probably my last poetics and this is # i was born as a Romany and for me that identity as a Romany is important within my own poetics because i want to speak if you like on behalf of a lot of people who can't write or read but on the other hand i don't want that to obscure my own life entirely i need to you know look after myself too so i have a little struggle there but it's part of my poetics and i explore that a lot in my poetry your poetics <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> what do you think your poetics are or could be

</u><u who="sf5126"> <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/>
</u><u who="nm5095"> do you want to try do you want to attempt something like that now i might i might set an exercise in which you are to try write in in in persona and tell a story just to force you to have a have a go where i'd like you to choose your own persona i spent ? i spent an entire  in the persona of <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> who was dead # for sixty years and obviously in order to inhabit that persona ? i did dreadful dreadful things such as # i i had i had no understanding what it what it would feel like for instance to lie in snow for two hours in the way that he'd been forced by by the K-G-B so i went i lay in snow for two hours to see how it felt
</u><u who="sf5126"> i don't know if i would do that
</u><u who="nm5095"> i mean people do try things out just to see how they feel <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> Maxwell a friend of mine who was who started the writing programme who was with me right at right at the beginning in nineteen-eighty-six # he was under the under the well he read somewhere that the best writing the best poetry got got written got written if you're in a state of mania # and starvation which is not true by the way it it it gets better when your when your belly is full actually so what he did is he starved himself for for # for four days and then he wrote and it was crap that he discovered # and by the way <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> also tells a tells tells a very interesting # story story too which i'm going to tell very quickly because it answers something that <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> and i were talking about during the break which is about one of the key differences between fiction and poetry poetry is a much harder harder genre in which to write well <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> wrote three books of poems # which are published by <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> Books he took a long time over the apprenticeship of these books and he got them right he then turned his hand to write his first novel Blue <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> which <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> and as he put it to me you should try it Dave it's a piece of piss took me it took me it took me six weeks it's just like it's just like taking it's just like taking the brakes off prose is prose is so much easier so much easier so bear that in mind when you're making decisions about genres i think you should try them all out firstly what are your poetics
</u><u who="sm5127"> # double edged and downsided perspective (coughing) in the poetry and clarity and # at the moment # language of belonging
</u><u who="nm5095"> could you say say more about that
</u><u who="sm5127"> # i'm very interested well i'm kind of struggling with the idea of sort of being belonging in sort of all sorts of different # institutions or # just as yourself or why we're doing this and the reasoning behind things i'm very interested in and # i think that will come out quite strongly in poems
</u><u who="nm5095"> yeah
</u><u who="sm5127"> alright
</u><u who="nm5095"> very interesting you can see why all these people are on this course it's a bit like the interview you see i was talking about that again with one of the things that that unites all of you whether you believe this or not is that # you will kind of identify just having a certain condition a certain kind of writerly condition it's very unacademic it's very writerly however which is # sometimes may seem like a certain uncertainty about your own writing # that's a very important quality to have because everyone sort of has that whether they're Doris Lessing or <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> Mandelstein or or you now ask her tonight
</u><u who="sm5127"> i want to try and keep a strong social perspective
</u><u who="nm5095"> mm-hmm
</u><u who="sm5127"> in my own writing and also to be as as personal as i possibly can in different situations 
</u><u who="nm5095"> mm-hmm well make sure you hold on to that 
</u><u who="sm5127"> yeah
</u><u who="nm5095"> okay <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/>
</u><u who="sf5128"> # freedom not just in writing but not having to conform to not having to conform to things that's what <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> do and allowing myself not to know where i want to take a piece of work just letting it letting it take itself somewhere
</u><u who="nm5095"> yes make it give it its own life i mean you have to give it the kiss of life first with your own imagination you just have to swing it onto its own legs one of the things that i i i've got to stand up tonight in front of two-hundred-and-fifty people to make a speech about Doris and i was writing this last night and i was discovering on the internet all sorts of amazing things about her life # such as # she i actually cut them out of the speech because they were too personal but one of the things that that she did she went through two marriages and she actually gave up the marriages because she didn't she found herself kind of being condemned to a particular persona being sucked into a particular persona that's going to eventually rob her of her own identity as a writer and she said that being a writer of the sort that she is had made her a freer person it actually freed her and that she regards herself as a free human being they're very rare by the way free humans and writers <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> are usually quite free human beings and that that freedom # not to conform is not just about about conforming conforming within your own writing it might actually be about conforming within society too but let's not press that button too hard at the moment okay
</u><u who="sm5129"> <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> it's like you can write something that people read then and understand with their ears and not their mind because you know you can write a sentence and then somebody reads it and just reads it for the meaning of the sentence you can just write something that meant totally nothing but somebody will read and just understand it with his heart if you
</u><u who="nm5095"> yeah yeah fascinating # idea too of course what you want is at the same time <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/>
</u><u who="sf5130"> # ideology is very important to me i mean i should the readership should be able to understand what # my ideology is what i'm feeling and also free verse i mean i hate conforming to form i just want everything unrestricted and everything has to fit together i mean when i finish it it has to be appeals to me it doesn't matter if it doesn't appeal to anyone else but i have to be happy with it and
</u><u who="nm5095"> yeah excellent now hold on to those yeah
</u><u who="sm5131"> # <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> rather than sort of just sitting down and thinking that i would be writing # being prepared to experiment with form even if i don't stick myself with them in the end
</u><u who="nm5095"> true 
</u><u who="sm5127"> and being prepared to # <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> out things more rather than just # giving up you know 
</u><u who="nm5095"> yeah yes that means cutting it in into tiny little pieces and and reassemble it from like like a <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> fine good again stick stick with these things <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/>
</u><u who="sf5132"> productivity in a way causing i think it's quite important # either in a personal <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> to a reader or a political outlook in society and also i think on a wide perspective of experience and learning from everything that happens to me in

</u><u who="sf5132"> # expose myself to a lot of different experiences different people and different arts and everything else
</u><u who="nm5095"> yes very <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> yeah
</u><u who="sf5132"> # yeah clarity of perception and expression and i don't know there's like a lot in the world that can bring you away from yourself and if you're writing it writing for me is a way of kind of coming back to just being with myself and exploring things more deeply
</u><u who="nm5095"> mm-hmm nobody's nobody's mentioned emotions really i've noticed but yeah it gets close to emotional truth
</u><u who="sf5132"> # i'll stay keeping my own voice retaining my own voice wherever i am and # knowing my own values and strengths and what i want
</u><u who="nm5095"> mhm very good you should talk to <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> that's that's part of her part it's not and <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/>'s too actually
</u><u who="sm5133"> # i want to write clearly i want my writing to have an effect # and # i want it to speak to i want it to be able to speak to individuals i'm not particularly interested in the idea of speaking to social groups # as i don't necessarily see myself as as one as as part of one already # and so i'm just into that idea and putting my interests into writing # into my writing and the idea of of just movement of # of of of the self and if interests really

</u><u who="sm5136"> and <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> takes it away from where it started of which is really good i like that bit

</u><u who="nm5095"> that's very interesting do you mean celebrate things as well
</u><u who="sm5137"> yeah <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> or attack things purely because i can so to be true to the ideals

</u><u who="sm5141"> form as such i'd rather do free verse and

</u><u who="sm5141"> i'm willing to try that it's just i don't want to be i want to be my own individual as in rather than conform to certain ways 
</u><u who="nm5095"> yeah
</u><u who="sm5141"> write how i want to write and most of it is like more emotional in the sense as about me as a person and more sort of philosophical ideas and 
</u><u who="nm5095"> mm-hmm it's good it's good it's a good it's a good it's a good poetic the wider though the public though is the reason that i that i i give you and the writers that you're working with give you particular exercises which are restrictive is that is to help teach you and develop a facility that's that's the important thing a facility so that you can actually fulfil that poetic of of yours so that when the moment strikes you you'll be equipped to carry it out because otherwise you won't be you'll be you'll be basically splashing around not able to swim so i'm going to set you a final a final exercise which is to # <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> no let's # two there are two there are two exercises one one is # one one will make one of these exercises will make you hate my guts i'm afraid but everybody's done it and it's your turn in The New Poetry on page one-ninety there's a poem by Sean O'Brian Sean O'Brian it's called After the Fall you'll find it on page one-ninety of The New Poetry and # on page one-nine-three there's another poem by Sean O'Brian called Fiction and the Reading Public what's that funny noise

</u><u who="nm5095"> Fiction and the Reading Public i want you to memorise that poem that's the one that's going to make you hate me i want you to memorise that poem Fiction and the Reading Public you'll find that it's easy to memorise because it's in a very strong rhythm got it and with the After the Fall piece what i want you to do is is to do what he's done here which is find a poem in another language you can do this by all sorts of tricks by the way because there'll be translations available translate it or have it translated or just choose a book that's where it's already translated and copy it out and then write an imitation of it write an imitation of that poem write an imitation i want you to imitate it and turn it into your own poem find a poem in a foreign language find a translation of that poem imitate the translation make it into your own poem those are those are the four steps Sean O'Brian takes this poem here by <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> the nineteenth century French p-, poet and he updates it so it's now taking place in the early nineteen-nineties i'm sure if you read this poem you'll find phrases where it says like Mrs Selfridges Sock Shop and <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> this world is not Eastbourne it has no opinions Songs of Praise all sorts of things like this are mentioned in this poem that weren't actually in the <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> poem he's made it his own poem i want you to make your own poem out of something from another language because honeys that's actually what we do all the time when we're writing poetry thank you for your watch it's now twelve-thirty see you tonight Doris Lessing have lots of questions ready </u>
