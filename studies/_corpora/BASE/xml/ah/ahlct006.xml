<u who="nm0051"> # <pause dur="0.4"/> last week i was dealing with the invasions of Julius Caesar <pause dur="0.4"/> and from the point of view <pause dur="0.7"/> of <pause dur="0.4"/> the reasons that he gives <pause dur="0.9"/> for the fifty-five and fifty-four invasions i hope that the main message <pause dur="0.4"/> came across <pause dur="0.8"/> was that he actually does give us some form of reasoning <pause dur="0.6"/> and motivation for his fifty-five <pause dur="0.4"/> invasion <pause dur="1.9"/> even if we have to read between the lines to establish it <pause dur="1.3"/> whereas for the <pause dur="0.3"/> fifty-four invasion <pause dur="0.4"/> there is very little <unclear>concrete</unclear> evidence <pause dur="0.3"/> within his commentaries <pause dur="0.7"/> and the reason for this i think is fairly clear <pause dur="1.6"/> that <pause dur="0.2"/> if he had actually stated <pause dur="0.4"/> when he came to write his <pause dur="0.3"/> commentaries years later <pause dur="0.4"/> if he'd actually stated <pause dur="0.7"/> a motive <pause dur="0.2"/> in coming to Britain that year <pause dur="0.6"/> he could well have found himself in difficulties <pause dur="1.1"/> with a charge of not having achieved <pause dur="0.4"/> that particular aim <pause dur="0.5"/> after all <pause dur="0.2"/> if <pause dur="0.2"/> conquest <pause dur="0.8"/> was his aim then he <pause dur="0.3"/> singularly failed to 
achieve it <pause dur="0.5"/> if economic gain <pause dur="0.3"/> was his aim <pause dur="0.5"/> as it was and certainably <pause dur="0.3"/> was certainly for some of his # <pause dur="0.4"/> companions <pause dur="0.6"/> those extra five ships that went along with him <pause dur="0.3"/> then that too <pause dur="1.1"/> was <pause dur="0.5"/> not forthcoming there was no profit to be made from the fifty-four <pause dur="0.4"/> invasion <pause dur="0.6"/> hence the silence <pause dur="0.3"/> about motivation <pause dur="1.6"/> the relative failure <pause dur="0.5"/> of the fifty-four invasion from the point of view of propaganda and real achievement <pause dur="0.5"/> can also be seen in the reaction that it produced <pause dur="0.3"/> within Rome itself <pause dur="1.0"/> there was no great thanksgiving celebration <pause dur="0.4"/> such as had greeted the fifty-five invasion <pause dur="0.4"/> when there was a twenty <pause dur="0.4"/> day <pause dur="0.5"/> # period <pause dur="0.3"/> of thanksgiving <pause dur="0.9"/> and what evidence we have <pause dur="0.6"/> of the way that the fifty-four invasion was looked at <pause dur="0.7"/> suggests that it was something <pause dur="0.5"/> of <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> a fiasco <pause dur="0.5"/> in the Roman eyes <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> we look for instance in the source book on page thirty-four <pause dur="0.2"/> for the verdict of somebody like Cicero somebody at the heart <pause dur="0.3"/> of senatorial government <pause dur="0.4"/> and you 
can hear <pause dur="0.7"/> the irony <pause dur="0.2"/> in what the <trunc>ap</trunc> absolute sarcasm <pause dur="0.7"/> in the words that he <pause dur="0.3"/> puts in his letters <pause dur="0.3"/> to <pause dur="0.4"/> Atticus his friend <pause dur="0.8"/> he says <pause dur="0.7"/> <reading>it's also become clear that there isn't an ounce of silver in the island <pause dur="0.6"/> nor any prospect of booty except slaves <pause dur="0.9"/> i don't suppose you're expecting any of them to be accomplished in literature <pause dur="0.2"/> or music</reading> <pause dur="0.2"/> in other words <pause dur="0.3"/> pretty poor quality material <pause dur="1.4"/> and then later on he says <pause dur="0.3"/> <reading>the campaign in Britain is complete <pause dur="0.4"/> hostages have been received <pause dur="0.5"/> there's no booty <pause dur="0.8"/> tribute has however been imposed <pause dur="0.3"/> and they're bringing back the arm <pause dur="0.3"/> from Britain</reading> <pause dur="4.0"/> as i said last time <pause dur="0.2"/> Caesar's involvement <pause dur="0.6"/> with Britain after his return from the fifty-four <pause dur="0.8"/> # invasion <pause dur="0.7"/> simply ceased so far as we can tell <pause dur="0.6"/> he had <pause dur="0.4"/> his hands full in Gaul with the great uprising <pause dur="0.2"/> of Vercingetorix <pause dur="0.4"/> and thereafter <pause dur="0.3"/> never had the opportunity <pause dur="0.4"/> to renew <pause dur="0.4"/> any plans he may have had <pause dur="0.4"/> for a third expedition <pause dur="2.4"/> the terms though <pause dur="0.4"/> that 
he'd imposed upon people like Cassivellaunus <pause dur="0.2"/> at the end of the fifty-four campaign <pause dur="0.6"/> do suggest however <pause dur="0.2"/> that Caesar saw <pause dur="0.6"/> that campaign as a preliminary <pause dur="0.5"/> to an eventual Roman takeover <pause dur="1.3"/> the very fact that he imposed tribute <pause dur="1.0"/> is one of the first stages <pause dur="0.9"/> in <pause dur="0.4"/> a Roman takeover of <unclear>an area</unclear> <pause dur="1.2"/> but it was to be <pause dur="0.5"/> something like ninety years <pause dur="1.3"/> before the Romans actually got round <pause dur="0.5"/> to a third <pause dur="0.4"/> and this time successhful successful <pause dur="0.4"/> invasion <pause dur="0.4"/> or conquest <pause dur="0.6"/> now what i want to start doing today <pause dur="0.4"/> is to look at what happened in those <pause dur="0.2"/> ninety years <pause dur="1.0"/> we have to admit that our sources of information are pretty <pause dur="0.2"/> poor <pause dur="1.7"/> if you read one of the handbooks like that by Salway you will get established there <pause dur="0.3"/> a history for the period <pause dur="1.4"/> that is based upon <pause dur="0.2"/> such information as does exist <pause dur="0.8"/> but that information <pause dur="1.6"/> comes from two sources <pause dur="0.5"/> neither of them <trunc>p</trunc> <pause dur="0.5"/> particularly <pause dur="0.7"/> # overflowing with detail <pause dur="0.3"/> or ostensible accuracy <pause dur="1.1"/> there's the literary record <pause dur="0.4"/> that i'll be looking at soon <pause dur="1.0"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> there is <pause dur="0.2"/> 
the coin evidence <pause dur="0.4"/> of developments in coinage <pause dur="0.8"/> within Britain itself <pause dur="0.8"/> because we have to look at this process not only from the point of view <pause dur="0.4"/> of what was happening in Rome <pause dur="0.8"/> that prevented a third invasion <pause dur="0.4"/> until <pause dur="0.2"/> ninety years later and the reign of the emperor Claudius <pause dur="0.4"/> but we have to look at what was going on <pause dur="0.3"/> in Britain as well because in neither case <pause dur="0.8"/> was the situation static <pause dur="2.6"/> certainly from the point of view of the native tribes of south-east Britain <pause dur="0.5"/> immediately after the departure <pause dur="0.5"/> of Caesar <pause dur="0.4"/> there was <pause dur="0.2"/> every <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> incentive <pause dur="0.4"/> on the part of some of them <pause dur="0.4"/> to maintain <pause dur="1.1"/> close and friendly relations with Rome <pause dur="1.5"/> Mandubracius for instance of the Trinovantes <pause dur="0.3"/> had a vested interest <pause dur="0.8"/> in that <pause dur="0.9"/> connection <pause dur="1.0"/> because it was upon the <pause dur="0.2"/> protection <pause dur="0.4"/> of Caesar <pause dur="0.6"/> that he owed <pause dur="0.3"/> his <pause dur="0.3"/> very existence <pause dur="0.4"/> as King <pause dur="0.5"/> of <pause dur="0.2"/> the <pause dur="0.4"/> Trinovantes down in Essex <pause dur="1.7"/> and yet even people like Cassivellaunus <pause dur="1.1"/> shows no signs of having broken the agreement <pause dur="0.6"/> that he made with Caesar <pause dur="1.6"/> but the one thing to bear in mind about such agreements is 
that they are not interstate <pause dur="0.4"/> agreements they're not like present day treaties <pause dur="0.4"/> between one country and another <pause dur="0.7"/> they're agreements between one individual commander <pause dur="0.5"/> and another <pause dur="0.9"/> and any of such an agreement <pause dur="0.4"/> undergoes a radical change when one of those two people dies <pause dur="0.3"/> in other words <pause dur="0.7"/> the treaty <pause dur="0.2"/> the agreement <pause dur="0.3"/> dies with them <pause dur="0.8"/> and this is one of the reasons <pause dur="0.3"/> no doubt <pause dur="0.3"/> that changes <pause dur="0.4"/> didn't come about <pause dur="4.5"/> perhaps the first <pause dur="1.0"/> event <pause dur="0.2"/> that happened which has a bearing upon Romano-British relations <pause dur="0.7"/> is <pause dur="0.2"/> the history of Commius <pause dur="1.3"/> Commius the Atrebate who was so helpful <pause dur="0.5"/> to Caesar in the <pause dur="0.4"/> invasions <pause dur="0.8"/> because during the great Gallic uprising Commius <pause dur="0.5"/> changed sides <pause dur="0.2"/> took the sides of the Gauls <pause dur="0.8"/> and <pause dur="0.3"/> was eventually forced <pause dur="0.6"/> to quit Gaul <pause dur="0.6"/> and become a refugee <pause dur="0.5"/> within Britain where he seems to have <pause dur="0.5"/> set himself up <pause dur="0.5"/> as king <pause dur="0.2"/> among the Atrebates <pause dur="0.2"/> of the Hampshire region <pause dur="1.3"/> and that's one of the tribes <pause dur="0.4"/> that's important <pause dur="0.4"/> for the next <pause dur="0.4"/> ninety years <pause dur="4.4"/> this is where the coin record comes in <pause dur="2.5"/> in those ninety 
years we have a succession of coin issues being produced <pause dur="1.1"/> by a number of dynasts or kings within Britain <pause dur="1.9"/> in no case <pause dur="1.6"/> does that coin actually signify <pause dur="0.3"/> which tribe it came from <pause dur="2.0"/> we're reliant upon that kind of information <pause dur="0.4"/> from looking at the concentration of find spots <pause dur="2.6"/> so this particular series of coins <pause dur="0.4"/> is Atrebatic <pause dur="0.5"/> that particular series of coins <pause dur="0.3"/> belongs to the Catuvellauni <pause dur="0.4"/> that particular series of coins <pause dur="0.3"/> belongs <pause dur="0.3"/> to <pause dur="0.3"/> the Trinovantes and so on <pause dur="0.4"/> but there is a complication <pause dur="0.6"/> in this that has arisen <pause dur="1.0"/> in recent years in fact there are two complications <pause dur="1.2"/> one is that one of the prime <pause dur="0.3"/> characters of the period <pause dur="0.4"/> seems to have changed his name <pause dur="2.0"/> the successor to Commius of the Atrebate <pause dur="0.3"/> has for a long time <pause dur="0.6"/> been known in the handbooks <pause dur="0.2"/> and you'll find it in Salway <pause dur="0.2"/> as <pause dur="0.3"/> Tincommius <pause dur="0.4"/> this was a a restoration <pause dur="0.7"/> of his name <pause dur="0.4"/> based upon what was extant <pause dur="0.3"/> in two sources <pause dur="0.3"/> one of those sources <pause dur="0.3"/> is a copy of <pause dur="0.7"/> the achievements of the emperor Augustus <pause dur="0.4"/> that he himself wrote <pause dur="0.3"/> and which <pause dur="0.9"/> is extant <pause dur="0.4"/> as a monumental <pause dur="0.4"/> 
piece of # <pause dur="0.7"/> epigraphy <pause dur="0.3"/> in Ankara <pause dur="0.2"/> within Turkey <pause dur="0.4"/> but unfortunately <pause dur="0.2"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="8"/> the only letters <pause dur="0.2"/> available <pause dur="1.0"/> are tin or <pause dur="1.9"/> tim <pause dur="2.0"/> and # putting that together with what else was found <pause dur="0.4"/> at the last of the at the end of the last century suggested that <pause dur="0.2"/> here we will have we have <pause dur="0.2"/> evidence of <pause dur="0.4"/> a ruler called Tincommius <pause dur="0.4"/> the similarity with the name of Commius <pause dur="0.4"/> provided an obvious <pause dur="0.5"/> dynastic link <pause dur="1.6"/> with all the coins themselves of this ruler <pause dur="0.3"/> we get as far as Tincom <pause dur="4.2"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="3"/> and that actually seemed to be very good in so far as it <pause dur="0.3"/> took us one stage further but it didn't supply the end of the name <pause dur="0.6"/> in nineteen-ninety-six in Hampshire was found a <pause dur="0.4"/> hoard <pause dur="1.0"/> of coins <pause dur="0.3"/> produced by <pause dur="1.1"/> Tincommius <pause dur="1.0"/> but unfortunately <pause dur="0.4"/> or fortunately rather <pause dur="0.5"/> the name was complete <pause dur="1.2"/> and we now know this character is Tincommarus <pause dur="0.5"/><vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/> which basically translates as big fish <pause dur="0.9"/> an important man obviously <pause dur="1.3"/> so <pause dur="0.7"/> that is one of the problems <pause dur="0.6"/> presented by the coin <pause dur="0.2"/> record sometimes names change <pause dur="1.2"/> 
another problem <pause dur="0.4"/> comes from interpretation <pause dur="0.8"/> of the coin record <pause dur="0.6"/> if you read Salway <pause dur="0.4"/> you'll see the coin record being used <pause dur="0.5"/> for <pause dur="1.4"/> the establishment of a period <pause dur="0.3"/> of <pause dur="0.3"/> aggrandisement <pause dur="0.8"/> on the part of the Catuvellauni of Hertfordshire <pause dur="0.7"/> and the surrounding counties <pause dur="0.6"/> against their eastern neighbours the Trinovantes <pause dur="0.6"/> against their southern neighbours <pause dur="0.6"/> the Cantiaci of Kent <pause dur="0.4"/> and the Atrebates <pause dur="0.5"/> of <pause dur="0.3"/> Hampshire <pause dur="3.4"/> this has recently <pause dur="0.3"/> been put into question <pause dur="0.7"/> by <pause dur="0.5"/> # a numismatist based actually in New York <pause dur="0.8"/> called Van Arsdell <pause dur="1.2"/> and if you read the various sections <pause dur="0.4"/> of his book on Celtic coinage <pause dur="0.5"/> you'll see that he in fact <pause dur="0.3"/> he postulates <pause dur="0.6"/> not conflict <pause dur="0.6"/> between <pause dur="0.2"/> the Catuvellauni <pause dur="0.4"/> and the Trinovantes <pause dur="1.3"/> but an actual coming together <pause dur="0.3"/> of those two <pause dur="0.6"/> peoples <pause dur="0.6"/> into a single unit <pause dur="0.4"/> to explain why we find <pause dur="0.4"/> coins <pause dur="0.3"/> which seem to have been <pause dur="0.2"/> produced by <pause dur="0.4"/> the king of <pause dur="0.2"/> one tribe <pause dur="2.0"/> produced <pause dur="0.3"/> at the capital <pause dur="0.4"/> of the other tribe <pause dur="2.2"/> all this is nicely set out if at some <pause dur="0.7"/> great length <pause dur="0.4"/> by a book by David Braund <kinesic desc="holds up book" iterated="n"/> which i'll put back into the library <pause dur="0.3"/> 
after this lecture <pause dur="0.8"/> it's called <pause dur="0.2"/> Ruling Roman Britain <pause dur="0.3"/> and has a good <pause dur="0.2"/> section on the coinage <pause dur="0.2"/> and <pause dur="0.3"/> on this particular period <pause dur="0.5"/> in particular <pause dur="1.2"/> # <pause dur="1.9"/> my <pause dur="1.4"/> complaint about Braund and about Van Arsdell though is that they tend to be totally <pause dur="0.3"/> literal <pause dur="1.1"/> for instance <pause dur="0.4"/> as we saw last time <pause dur="0.7"/> Cassivellaunus <pause dur="0.9"/> # the <pause dur="0.4"/> main linchpin <pause dur="0.5"/> of the resistance to the <pause dur="0.7"/> fifty-four invasion by Caesar <pause dur="0.5"/> is usually made <pause dur="0.2"/> the king of the Catuvellauni <pause dur="0.6"/> that fact is nowhere mentioned <pause dur="0.2"/> in any of the ancient <pause dur="0.2"/> evidence <pause dur="0.4"/> of the fifty-four invasion <pause dur="0.4"/> and people like <pause dur="0.9"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> Braund <pause dur="0.2"/> and Van Arsdell <pause dur="0.2"/> would <pause dur="0.4"/> question whether it's valid <pause dur="0.6"/> they pooh-pooh the similarity of the name Catuvellauni as the tribe <pause dur="0.3"/> and Cassivellaunus <pause dur="0.3"/> as the individual <pause dur="1.3"/> it's that kind of <pause dur="0.2"/> literalism if it isn't stated in the <pause dur="0.2"/> ancient authorities it can't be true <pause dur="0.3"/> which <pause dur="0.2"/> <trunc>cre</trunc> # causes these people <pause dur="0.3"/> to go too far <pause dur="0.5"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> really <pause dur="0.9"/> to <pause dur="1.0"/> prevent any meaningful establishment <pause dur="0.5"/> of the history <pause dur="0.5"/> of the period <pause dur="0.9"/> but what i want to give you though is first of all the traditional view of what was 
happening within Britain <pause dur="0.4"/> and then we can have a look <pause dur="0.5"/> at <pause dur="0.2"/> the problems <pause dur="0.2"/> created by the new evidence <pause dur="0.7"/> so we go back to Commius <pause dur="0.4"/> who establishes himself <pause dur="0.6"/> in <pause dur="0.7"/> the <trunc>t</trunc> the territory of the Atrebates round about <pause dur="0.2"/> fifty-two <pause dur="0.4"/> B-C <pause dur="0.6"/> he's eventually <pause dur="0.3"/> succeeded by Tincommarus <pause dur="4.1"/> and it's at this point <pause dur="0.3"/> that we get <pause dur="0.2"/> some evidence <pause dur="0.2"/> within the sources for <pause dur="0.3"/> relations with Rome <pause dur="2.1"/> according to our main source who is really Strabo a Greek writer who <pause dur="0.3"/> completed <pause dur="0.4"/> his geographical work and i stress that it is a geographical work <pause dur="1.1"/> # round about A-D twenty <pause dur="1.0"/> we find <pause dur="0.2"/> that <pause dur="1.7"/> from the Roman point of view <pause dur="0.8"/> intervention in Britain was something to be put on hold <pause dur="1.2"/> Strabo says <pause dur="0.2"/> that <pause dur="1.9"/> taxing <pause dur="0.6"/> the exports <pause dur="0.9"/> from the Roman empire into Britain <pause dur="0.2"/> before they left the continent <pause dur="0.5"/> brought in more money <pause dur="1.0"/> than <pause dur="0.7"/> theoretically <pause dur="0.4"/> # an outright takeover of Britain <pause dur="0.4"/> would realize and therefore it just simply wasn't working <pause dur="0.3"/> on economic grounds <pause dur="1.5"/> we also hear <pause dur="2.0"/> of <pause dur="1.6"/> dedications <pause dur="0.9"/> by <pause dur="0.2"/> British kings <pause dur="0.8"/> made <pause dur="0.7"/> to the <trunc>r</trunc> to Rome and its gods <pause dur="0.2"/> on the Capitol hill <pause dur="0.3"/> within Rome itself <pause dur="0.8"/> 
an indication <pause dur="0.3"/> of close and friendly contacts <pause dur="0.3"/> so in this period there were from time to time contacts they were friendly <pause dur="0.5"/> there was obviously something to be gained <pause dur="0.3"/> one way <pause dur="0.4"/> or another <pause dur="0.2"/> for both sides <pause dur="1.6"/> but nevertheless <pause dur="1.5"/> the threat <pause dur="0.7"/> of <pause dur="0.2"/> a Roman invasion of Britain <pause dur="0.9"/> could be <pause dur="0.2"/> a very valuable diplomatic tool <pause dur="1.9"/> and this is why i think we hear <pause dur="0.4"/> of projected <pause dur="0.2"/> expeditions to Britain <pause dur="0.5"/> by Julius Caesar's <pause dur="0.7"/> successor <pause dur="0.4"/> the first emperor Augustus <pause dur="0.8"/> on a number of occasions <pause dur="1.6"/> we hear for instance <pause dur="0.4"/> of a projected invasion <pause dur="0.3"/> in thirty-four B-C from Dio Cassius <pause dur="2.0"/> we hear of another one <pause dur="0.4"/> in twenty-seven B-C <pause dur="0.4"/> another one <pause dur="0.3"/> in twenty-six B-C <pause dur="0.3"/> in each case <pause dur="0.8"/> Dio Cassius alleges that there was something more important happening <pause dur="0.5"/> that <pause dur="0.2"/> diverted Augustus' attention <pause dur="0.3"/> away from Britain <pause dur="1.4"/> a rebellion <pause dur="0.2"/> for instance <pause dur="0.3"/> elsewhere within the empire <pause dur="2.5"/> there's also <pause dur="1.0"/> the idea of <pause dur="0.3"/> a <pause dur="0.2"/> Roman takeover of Britain <pause dur="0.2"/> being kept alive <pause dur="0.4"/> through <pause dur="0.3"/> the non-historical literature <pause dur="0.2"/> of the period <pause dur="1.5"/> poets like <pause dur="0.7"/> Tibullus <pause dur="0.2"/> and Propertius <pause dur="0.5"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> Horace <pause dur="0.8"/> 
all mention from time to time within their <pause dur="0.5"/> writings <pause dur="0.2"/> the possibilities <pause dur="0.5"/> of <pause dur="0.3"/> a Roman <pause dur="0.5"/> intervention <pause dur="0.5"/> within Britain <pause dur="1.3"/> we hear about it <pause dur="0.3"/> shortly before <pause dur="0.2"/> twenty-seven B-C from Tibullus <pause dur="0.9"/> actually in twenty-seven B-C <pause dur="0.4"/> from Propertius <pause dur="0.5"/> the same in the case of Horace <pause dur="1.5"/> Horace mentions it again <pause dur="1.1"/> in the context of twenty-six B-C <pause dur="0.4"/> and again <pause dur="0.2"/> in the context <pause dur="0.4"/> of twenty-three B-C <pause dur="3.1"/> now <pause dur="0.5"/> why <pause dur="0.5"/> would <pause dur="0.6"/> Augustus <pause dur="0.2"/> sanction <pause dur="1.6"/> such overt references <pause dur="0.5"/> within literature <pause dur="2.2"/> people like Horace were court poets <pause dur="0.5"/> what they wrote <pause dur="0.6"/> was sanctioned <pause dur="1.1"/> wasn't <pause dur="0.3"/> a free agent <pause dur="1.2"/> well as i've said <pause dur="1.2"/> there is a diplomatic <pause dur="0.7"/> element here <pause dur="1.3"/> the very threat of a Roman takeover <pause dur="0.5"/> presented to Britain <pause dur="1.3"/> the suggestion <pause dur="0.9"/> that <pause dur="0.4"/> a <pause dur="0.8"/> friendly relationship with Rome <pause dur="0.3"/> was better <pause dur="0.3"/> than a hostile one <pause dur="0.3"/> which would provide the pretext <pause dur="0.6"/> for <pause dur="0.9"/> intervention <pause dur="1.5"/> there was also something for Augustus <pause dur="0.4"/> to gain <pause dur="0.5"/> from such a possible <pause dur="0.4"/> intervention <pause dur="1.8"/> especially in in the early years of Augustus' reign <pause dur="1.7"/> by associating himself <pause dur="2.0"/> with <pause dur="0.2"/> the achievements <pause dur="1.2"/> of Julius Caesar <pause dur="2.1"/> through <pause dur="0.5"/> the fifty-five 
and fifty-four invasions <pause dur="0.2"/> Augustus <pause dur="0.8"/> may well have thought that he was strengthening his own position <pause dur="0.6"/> as the legitimate <pause dur="0.4"/> successor <pause dur="1.3"/> to one of the <pause dur="0.2"/> major figures <pause dur="0.3"/> of the first century <pause dur="0.8"/> # B-C <pause dur="1.9"/> and so from the Roman point of view <pause dur="0.9"/> that kind of thing <pause dur="0.9"/> was something to be <pause dur="0.5"/> kept <pause dur="0.2"/> on the <pause dur="0.7"/> back burner <pause dur="0.2"/> if not on the front burner <pause dur="5.3"/> with time though <pause dur="0.4"/> things <pause dur="0.5"/> did shift <pause dur="4.6"/> it's likely <pause dur="0.6"/> that at some period <pause dur="0.4"/> before <pause dur="1.4"/> A-D seven <pause dur="0.4"/> and we can't put it <pause dur="0.3"/> better than that <pause dur="1.2"/> # Tincommius <pause dur="0.7"/> was forced <pause dur="0.2"/> to leave Britain <pause dur="0.2"/> and to take refuge <pause dur="0.8"/> in <pause dur="0.4"/> Rome or rather <pause dur="0.2"/> let's call him Tincommarus <pause dur="1.2"/> we know this <pause dur="0.2"/> from the evidence <pause dur="0.7"/> of Augustus <pause dur="0.2"/> himself <pause dur="0.4"/> in that <pause dur="0.4"/> monument <pause dur="0.5"/> in Ankara <pause dur="1.8"/> he lists for <pause dur="1.4"/> the period <pause dur="0.3"/> well the last date that we can actually <pause dur="0.4"/> be certain about on the list <pause dur="0.4"/> is <pause dur="0.4"/> # twenty-five B-C <pause dur="0.8"/> but he gives us the list of the <pause dur="0.2"/> of <pause dur="1.0"/> ruling <pause dur="0.2"/> princes and kings <pause dur="0.3"/> who sought refuge with him in Rome <pause dur="1.0"/> and he gives us two British <pause dur="0.2"/> rulers <pause dur="0.9"/> one <pause dur="0.2"/> Dubnovellaunus <pause dur="0.8"/> and the other <pause dur="0.6"/> this <pause dur="0.2"/> Tincommarus figure <pause dur="0.5"/> that we've dealt with <pause dur="4.1"/> i give the the the date A-D seven because that's the 
date that you'll find in the handbooks <pause dur="0.6"/> if you read Van Arsdell <pause dur="0.8"/> he seems to limit <pause dur="0.3"/> Tincommarus' reign <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="1.0"/> between <pause dur="0.6"/> thirty B-C <pause dur="0.4"/> and ten B-C <pause dur="0.8"/> though Van Arsdell's record for <pause dur="0.2"/> dating within his book <pause dur="0.4"/> has been <pause dur="0.5"/> # a matter of some concern <pause dur="0.4"/> to the viewers <pause dur="2.6"/> now what might have caused Tincommarus <pause dur="1.0"/> to leave <pause dur="0.6"/> the territory of the Atrebates and seek refuge <pause dur="0.2"/> with Augustus <pause dur="0.8"/> well there are two possibilities either <pause dur="0.3"/> an external <pause dur="0.4"/> invasion <pause dur="0.4"/> or a palace coup <pause dur="1.4"/> and the fact that he seems to be replaced <pause dur="0.4"/> not by somebody from outside but by another Atrebate <pause dur="0.3"/> this case <pause dur="0.2"/> this case Eppillus <pause dur="0.3"/> suggests that it was a palace coup <pause dur="0.6"/> that # <pause dur="0.7"/> produced the change <pause dur="0.8"/> just as Eppillus <pause dur="0.4"/> seems to have been replaced in time <pause dur="0.7"/> by <pause dur="0.5"/> another figure called Verica <pause dur="1.2"/> now each of these <pause dur="0.6"/> on some of their coins describes himself <pause dur="0.6"/> as son of <pause dur="0.3"/> Commius <pause dur="0.2"/> it has the Latin <pause dur="0.8"/> # tag <pause dur="0.3"/> <distinct lang="la">com</distinct> <pause dur="0.2"/> F <distinct lang="la">com filius</distinct> <pause dur="3.2"/> whether this is actually a dynastic link <pause dur="1.0"/> or whether it's a little bit of fiction <pause dur="0.5"/> in order to establish <pause dur="0.5"/> the legitimacy <pause dur="0.4"/> of their rule <pause dur="0.3"/> nobody knows <pause dur="0.4"/> but it is there <pause dur="0.2"/> and 
it's also significant <pause dur="0.6"/> that the language <pause dur="0.3"/> that starts appearing upon these coins <pause dur="0.6"/> is Latin <pause dur="1.9"/> it's rare that one is getting <pause dur="0.2"/> anything <pause dur="0.9"/> Celtic <pause dur="1.2"/> the only Celtic <pause dur="0.9"/> term that we find <pause dur="0.5"/> on the coins <pause dur="0.6"/> is <pause dur="8.1"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="3"/> that term <pause dur="0.2"/> which seems to be <pause dur="0.2"/> Celtic for <pause dur="0.3"/> king <pause dur="0.7"/> Celtic equivalent <pause dur="0.3"/> of the Latin <pause dur="0.5"/> <distinct lang="la">rex</distinct> <pause dur="2.1"/> when in fact a number of these # <pause dur="0.9"/> kings <pause dur="0.6"/> especially people like Verica <pause dur="0.2"/> do put the Latin title <distinct lang="la">rex</distinct> <pause dur="0.8"/> king <pause dur="0.4"/> upon <pause dur="0.3"/> their kings <pause dur="0.3"/> and the very fact that they choose to do it in Latin <pause dur="1.0"/> suggests a <pause dur="0.9"/> a recognition <pause dur="0.5"/> by Rome <pause dur="0.5"/> of their position <pause dur="0.3"/> within Britain in other words that they are <pause dur="1.3"/> in a state of some kind of an agreement <pause dur="0.4"/> with the central Rome authorities <pause dur="3.3"/> of all the Catuvellauni to the north <pause dur="0.2"/> of the Atrebates <pause dur="0.9"/> we know that Cassivellaunus <pause dur="0.3"/> was succeeded <pause dur="0.3"/> at some stage the traditional date is round about twenty B-C <pause dur="0.7"/> by a ruler called Tasciovanus <pause dur="0.7"/> and he's producing coins <pause dur="0.4"/> from <pause dur="0.8"/> a new capital <pause dur="0.4"/> of <pause dur="0.2"/> Verulamium <pause dur="0.7"/> which is now <pause dur="0.2"/> Saint Albans <pause dur="0.3"/> we know this because he puts V-E-R <pause dur="0.9"/> on 
his coins <pause dur="0.6"/> a shortened form of the name <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> Verulamium is simply a Latinized form of <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 word"/> <distinct lang="cel">Verulam</distinct> <pause dur="1.4"/> the Celtic term <pause dur="1.6"/> in effect <pause dur="0.4"/> Tasciovanus was the first king of this tribe <pause dur="0.3"/> to produce <pause dur="0.3"/> inscribed coins <pause dur="1.6"/> there's a mystery here though <pause dur="1.4"/> because some coins produced by Tasciovanus <pause dur="0.9"/> have another <pause dur="0.3"/> set of letters <pause dur="0.5"/> on the reverse C-<pause dur="0.2"/>A-<pause dur="0.3"/>M <pause dur="0.9"/> which can only stand for <pause dur="0.3"/> Camulodunum <pause dur="1.4"/> modern <pause dur="0.2"/> Colchester <pause dur="1.4"/> Camulodunum <pause dur="2.3"/> was the capital of the Trinovantes <pause dur="1.5"/> so according to the traditional <pause dur="0.2"/> interpretation <pause dur="1.9"/> this particular issue of coins bearing the letters C-A-M <pause dur="0.8"/> which is a rare <trunc>ed</trunc> <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> edition of coins it's a rare edition <pause dur="1.2"/> suggesting that not very many were produced <pause dur="0.4"/> which itself suggests <pause dur="0.2"/> a short period <pause dur="0.4"/> of issue <pause dur="0.5"/> the <pause dur="0.4"/> traditional interpretation <pause dur="0.3"/> is that at some stage <pause dur="1.5"/> the Catuvellauni <pause dur="0.2"/> under Tasciovanus <pause dur="0.2"/> overran <pause dur="0.2"/> the Trinovantes <pause dur="0.7"/> took over their capital <pause dur="0.8"/> and as a sign of the takeover Tasciovanus <pause dur="0.3"/> began <pause dur="0.2"/> minting coins <pause dur="0.4"/> 
from <pause dur="0.2"/> the Trinovantine <pause dur="0.2"/> capital <pause dur="4.4"/> when might this have happened <pause dur="2.6"/> well at what stage <pause dur="0.2"/> in <pause dur="0.4"/> Romano-British relations <pause dur="0.8"/> could a takeover have happened <pause dur="0.7"/> that was immediately abandoned because of some threat <pause dur="0.4"/> from Rome <pause dur="1.2"/> and again the traditional date for this is round about sixteen B-C <pause dur="0.9"/> when <pause dur="1.2"/> A <pause dur="1.4"/> Rome <pause dur="0.2"/> was <pause dur="0.2"/> diverted <pause dur="1.0"/> in its # <pause dur="0.3"/> attention <pause dur="0.9"/> by <pause dur="0.6"/> difference elsewhere in the empire <pause dur="0.9"/> and then the presence <pause dur="0.3"/> of the emperor Augustus personally <pause dur="0.4"/> in Gaul shortly afterwards <pause dur="8.9"/> other evidence that has usually been <pause dur="0.2"/> brought out <pause dur="0.5"/> as sign of <trunc>p</trunc> a sign of power struggle <pause dur="0.3"/> is the dichotomy the change between <distinct lang="la">rex</distinct> on some coins <pause dur="0.3"/> and <distinct lang="cel">rico</distinct> or <pause dur="0.2"/> <distinct lang="cel">rigo</distinct> <pause dur="0.8"/> on others <pause dur="1.3"/> does the <pause dur="0.2"/> use of <pause dur="0.2"/> a Celtic <pause dur="0.5"/> title for king <pause dur="0.4"/> suggest a <pause dur="0.2"/> more <pause dur="0.3"/> British oriented <pause dur="0.4"/> and therefore anti-Roman <pause dur="0.9"/> view of things <pause dur="0.2"/> whereas <distinct lang="la">rex</distinct> emphasized the Roman connection <pause dur="0.5"/> we don't know <pause dur="1.6"/> later on <pause dur="0.3"/> we find coins issued <pause dur="0.2"/> by <pause dur="0.4"/> Verica <pause dur="0.2"/> and i've got a few slides that might show this later on <pause dur="0.8"/> which have as their motif on them <pause dur="0.4"/> a vine leaf <pause dur="0.9"/> now the vine is <pause dur="0.3"/> not a native plant to this country <pause dur="0.7"/> and <pause dur="0.5"/> at 
this particular period of ancient history it is very unlikely that there were any vines whatsoever <pause dur="0.5"/> within <pause dur="0.5"/> Britain at all <pause dur="1.2"/> so why does <pause dur="0.2"/> Verica <pause dur="0.3"/> choose to put a vine leaf <pause dur="0.6"/> and the title <distinct lang="la">rex</distinct> <pause dur="0.5"/> on his coins <pause dur="1.3"/> is there anything <pause dur="1.2"/> that one can say from the fact that <pause dur="0.4"/> the coins of the Catuvellauni <pause dur="0.2"/> their neighbours to the north who were traditionally regarded as imperialistic <pause dur="0.4"/> and pressurizing <pause dur="0.5"/> the <pause dur="0.2"/> # Atrebates <pause dur="1.1"/> put an ear <pause dur="0.2"/> of <pause dur="0.5"/> barley <pause dur="1.0"/> on their <pause dur="0.8"/> # coins <pause dur="1.2"/> is this again <pause dur="0.4"/> an element of emphasizing <pause dur="0.4"/> the British aspect <pause dur="0.3"/> as opposed to the Mediterranean motif <pause dur="0.6"/> of the Atrebates <pause dur="1.2"/> we can't <pause dur="0.2"/> really say we note <pause dur="0.4"/> what is there <pause dur="0.5"/> but the interpretation <pause dur="0.4"/> is something of a mystery <pause dur="4.8"/> at some stage <pause dur="2.2"/> Tasciovanus of the Catuvellauni was himself <pause dur="0.2"/> replaced succeeded <pause dur="0.4"/> by <pause dur="0.2"/> a new character Cunobelinus <pause dur="0.2"/> the Cymbeline of Shakespeare <pause dur="2.7"/> an important figure <pause dur="0.5"/> one of our sources <pause dur="0.5"/> Suetonius for instance calls him <pause dur="0.4"/> King of the Britons <pause dur="0.6"/> which suggests that he has <pause dur="0.6"/> control of a number of tribal areas <pause dur="4.0"/> he too <pause dur="2.0"/> begins issuing coins <pause dur="0.2"/> 
with those letters C-A-M <pause dur="0.9"/> on them <pause dur="0.7"/> Camulodunum <pause dur="2.1"/> and this is a <pause dur="0.2"/> long period of issue <pause dur="1.6"/> so do we take it <pause dur="0.4"/> that there has been <pause dur="1.8"/> takeover a military takeover once again <pause dur="0.4"/> of Trinovantine territory <pause dur="1.6"/> if this is the case <pause dur="1.2"/> is there a date that one can use <pause dur="1.0"/> to pinpoint it <pause dur="1.6"/> at what stage might Roman <pause dur="1.1"/> attention <pause dur="0.2"/> be diverted away from Britain <pause dur="1.3"/> the traditionally <pause dur="0.3"/> suggested date is A-D nine <pause dur="0.8"/> when Rome <pause dur="0.3"/> suffered <pause dur="0.5"/> a tremendous disaster <pause dur="1.3"/> on <pause dur="0.7"/> the Rhine <pause dur="3.0"/> in an attempt to shorten the overall frontier of of the empire <pause dur="0.6"/> Augustus had sought to push <pause dur="0.8"/> eastwards from the Rhine to a new line at the Elbe <pause dur="0.9"/> this would cut out in fact <pause dur="0.4"/> a rather troublesome kink <pause dur="0.7"/> in <pause dur="0.6"/> the <pause dur="0.8"/> northern frontier of the Roman empire caused by the <pause dur="0.4"/> almost confluence <pause dur="0.3"/> of the sources <pause dur="0.3"/> of the Rhine <pause dur="0.5"/> and the Danube <pause dur="2.3"/> it was a failure as a policy <pause dur="2.3"/> in the great <pause dur="0.5"/> German <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="2.0"/> forest of Teutoburger Wald <pause dur="1.2"/> Varus at the head of three legions <pause dur="0.7"/> was <pause dur="0.2"/> pretty well <pause dur="0.2"/> annihilated <pause dur="1.6"/> and it was a tremendous shock <pause dur="0.3"/> to Roman

things like wine <pause dur="0.7"/> in order to <pause dur="0.3"/> quench the thirst <pause dur="0.4"/> of the upper echelons of native British society <pause dur="1.1"/> the same is true of <pause dur="0.6"/> fine pieces <pause dur="0.2"/> of <pause dur="0.2"/> pottery <pause dur="1.0"/> and silverware <pause dur="2.0"/> again <pause dur="0.4"/> these come out of <pause dur="0.2"/> native graves of the period <pause dur="0.6"/> and are well preserved <pause dur="2.1"/> what Britain gave to the continent gave to the Roman empire <pause dur="0.6"/> is best exemplified <pause dur="0.4"/> from people <pause dur="0.4"/> like Strabo <pause dur="1.0"/> who lists <pause dur="0.2"/> items like <pause dur="0.4"/> corn <pause dur="0.5"/> cattle <pause dur="1.1"/> gold silver <pause dur="2.6"/> these would be the normal things that you would exchange <pause dur="0.7"/> for <pause dur="0.5"/> the # <pause dur="0.2"/> luxury goods of the empire the gold and silver in the form of coins <pause dur="0.5"/> and it's surprising how much <pause dur="0.5"/> # reliance <pause dur="0.6"/> native British society placed upon <pause dur="0.5"/> gold coinage <pause dur="1.7"/> but also things like slaves <pause dur="0.8"/> and slaves itself suggests a an intertribal <pause dur="1.0"/> element of strife <pause dur="0.2"/> because where would the slaves come from <pause dur="0.2"/> except <pause dur="0.5"/> prisoners of war <pause dur="1.8"/> and <pause dur="1.2"/> hunting dogs <pause dur="3.0"/> for which the Romans always had <pause dur="0.7"/> an element <pause dur="0.4"/> of admiration <pause dur="0.5"/> British hunting dogs <pause dur="0.5"/> # were almost as good <pause dur="0.4"/> as the famed Molossians <pause dur="0.4"/> from the Balkans </u><gap reason="break in recording" extent="uncertain"/> <u who="nm0051" trans="pause"> now if <pause dur="0.3"/> the <pause dur="1.4"/> Catuvellauni did take

ancient writers <pause dur="0.4"/> have to say <pause dur="0.4"/> about him <pause dur="1.3"/> if you <pause dur="0.5"/> remember back <pause dur="0.6"/> to the depiction <pause dur="0.5"/> that you got in I Claudius you can see why <pause dur="3.3"/> in A-D thirty-nine <pause dur="1.8"/> Caligula was engaged in a campaign <pause dur="0.2"/> in Germany <pause dur="1.3"/> when he was visited <pause dur="0.3"/> by another <pause dur="1.6"/> refugee from Britain <pause dur="0.8"/> a young <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="0.9"/> prince called Adminius <pause dur="3.8"/> and we're told that he was driven out of Britain by his <pause dur="0.4"/> father <pause dur="0.4"/> Cunobelinus <pause dur="1.2"/> now there is a small issue <pause dur="0.4"/> of coins <pause dur="1.1"/> # from northern Kent <pause dur="1.6"/> that <pause dur="0.4"/> were produced by somebody called Aminius <pause dur="1.5"/> and it's tempting <pause dur="0.5"/> to <pause dur="0.4"/> equate these two people <pause dur="0.2"/> for there's only a <pause dur="0.2"/> one letter difference <pause dur="1.0"/> and to see <pause dur="0.2"/> Adminius or Aminius established in northern Kent <pause dur="0.3"/> by Cunobelinus <pause dur="0.4"/> but then falling out with his father <pause dur="0.3"/> and being forced from Britain altogether <pause dur="0.4"/> onto the continent <pause dur="0.6"/> this was enough to persuade Caligula <pause dur="0.6"/> that an expedition <pause dur="0.4"/> to Britain <pause dur="1.5"/> was something <pause dur="0.2"/> that warranted <pause dur="0.4"/> his special <pause dur="0.3"/> attention <pause dur="0.5"/> after all there was a lot of <pause dur="0.7"/> # kudos <pause dur="0.2"/> to be gained <pause dur="0.6"/> from such an expedition <pause dur="1.3"/> at this point though <pause dur="0.9"/> the account <pause dur="0.2"/> that is left to us <pause dur="0.8"/> by Suetonius <pause dur="0.4"/> and later <pause dur="0.4"/> by Dio Cassius

undoubtedly <pause dur="0.4"/> Verica or Berikos <pause dur="0.4"/> would have been one of these <pause dur="2.1"/> you'll find this on page forty-five <pause dur="0.4"/> of the source book <pause dur="2.2"/> # <pause dur="0.9"/> <reading>Aulus Plautius who was # <pause dur="0.2"/> to be <pause dur="0.4"/> Claudius' <pause dur="0.2"/> general of the expedition <pause dur="0.7"/> made a campaign to Britain since a certain Berikos <pause dur="0.3"/> who had been driven out of the island as a result of an <trunc>up</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> uprising <pause dur="0.3"/> had persuaded Claudius to send a force there</reading> <pause dur="0.7"/> so Berikos <pause dur="0.5"/> ostensibly <pause dur="1.2"/> according to our sources and it's Dio Cassius who's fairly late but perhaps <pause dur="0.4"/> to be believed <pause dur="1.9"/> was one element <pause dur="0.2"/> suggesting <pause dur="0.2"/> that Claudius might invade Britain there were other <pause dur="0.8"/> things coming together <pause dur="0.2"/> at this same time <pause dur="1.3"/> which would <pause dur="0.3"/> lead to <pause dur="0.4"/> that expedition <pause dur="0.3"/> into Britain <pause dur="0.4"/> and what were these <pause dur="1.0"/> well first of all i've already mentioned that there's a shortage <pause dur="0.3"/> of <pause dur="1.1"/> dynastic links <pause dur="2.2"/> essentially <pause dur="0.4"/> the Julian line <pause dur="0.3"/> the Julian family <pause dur="2.2"/> as rulers of Rome <pause dur="0.4"/> established by Julius Caesar <pause dur="0.5"/> died with Gaius Caligula <pause dur="0.7"/> Claudius <pause dur="0.7"/> was related to the royal family <pause dur="1.7"/> but not <trunc>di</trunc> directly <pause dur="0.2"/> through a blood link <pause dur="2.4"/> his line goes back in fact to the empress 
Livia <pause dur="0.9"/> Augustus' wife <pause dur="1.2"/> by children that she had had <pause dur="0.7"/> as a result of a previous marriage <pause dur="0.7"/> so there's a collateral line <pause dur="0.3"/> so Claudius doesn't have the immediate kudos <pause dur="0.7"/> of being of the Julian line <pause dur="0.9"/> direct <pause dur="0.2"/> descendance <pause dur="0.4"/> even if that's a bit of a fiction <pause dur="0.6"/> of # <pause dur="1.2"/> Julius Caesar himself <pause dur="1.9"/> secondly <pause dur="0.2"/> there was the personality of Claudius himself <pause dur="1.7"/> from birth Claudius had been something of a physical wreck <pause dur="2.1"/> he <pause dur="0.3"/> limped <pause dur="1.4"/> probably as the result of a <pause dur="0.6"/> of a type of infantile polio <pause dur="1.8"/> he stammered <pause dur="0.6"/> very badly especially when he was nervous <pause dur="0.9"/> he had a nervous <pause dur="0.2"/> tic <pause dur="0.2"/> which caused his <pause dur="0.2"/> head <pause dur="0.5"/> to flick <pause dur="0.4"/> every now and again <pause dur="1.8"/> and <pause dur="0.7"/> he had a tongue <pause dur="0.2"/> which we're told was <pause dur="0.3"/> too large for his mouth <pause dur="0.4"/> protruded <pause dur="0.5"/> and caused him to dribble <pause dur="1.3"/> he was given to epileptic fits on occasion <pause dur="4.0"/> and he had a head <pause dur="0.4"/> perched on the top of a very long neck <pause dur="0.5"/> so he was something akin to an ostrich <pause dur="1.0"/> and if <pause dur="0.2"/> the representations of him especially the <pause dur="0.3"/> bronze representation that was fished out of from the British rivers <pause dur="0.5"/> is anything to go by <pause dur="0.4"/> he had <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="1.7"/> jug <pause dur="0.3"/> 
handle <pause dur="0.2"/> ears <pause dur="0.2"/> very protruding ears <pause dur="0.2"/> so he's not <pause dur="0.2"/> the Hollywood picture <pause dur="0.8"/> of <pause dur="0.4"/> a great <pause dur="0.5"/> Roman emperor <pause dur="3.3"/> as a result of this <pause dur="0.2"/> he'd spent virtually the whole of his life in seclusion <pause dur="0.6"/> as an imperial joke <pause dur="0.8"/> and an embarrassment <pause dur="0.3"/> you can well understand why <pause dur="0.5"/> the few times <pause dur="0.2"/> according to Suetonius that he was trundled out <pause dur="0.3"/> in order to make a public appearance <pause dur="0.4"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> to be installed even <pause dur="0.6"/> theoretically <pause dur="0.2"/> in some kind of official <pause dur="0.5"/> capacity <pause dur="0.8"/> the whole thing fell to pieces because he'd either have an epileptic fit or he couldn't <pause dur="0.2"/> manage the words <pause dur="4.2"/> so <pause dur="1.9"/> he was an <pause dur="0.2"/> an unprepossessing figure as emperor <pause dur="1.6"/> because he'd been kept in seclusion he'd never <pause dur="0.5"/> had any experience <pause dur="0.4"/> of military <pause dur="0.3"/> life <pause dur="1.3"/> and Roman <pause dur="0.8"/> emperors were not simply <pause dur="0.7"/> figurehead <pause dur="0.6"/> civil <pause dur="2.7"/> quasi-kings <pause dur="2.6"/> each one who had sat upon the throne <pause dur="0.6"/> had felt it <unclear>incumbent</unclear> upon himself <pause dur="0.4"/> to <pause dur="0.2"/> establish <pause dur="0.2"/> a military <pause dur="0.5"/> prowess <pause dur="0.3"/> now this was easy enough for Julius Caesar because <pause dur="0.4"/> by the time he became dictator of Rome <pause dur="0.4"/> he had a long history <pause dur="0.6"/> of military 
activity <pause dur="0.2"/> behind him <pause dur="1.7"/> his successor Octavian and then there was Augustus <pause dur="0.9"/> did the same <pause dur="0.3"/> not only did he <pause dur="0.8"/> come out victorious against <pause dur="0.4"/> his <pause dur="0.3"/> rival <pause dur="0.3"/> from imperial <unclear>honours</unclear> <pause dur="0.7"/> # Mark Antony <pause dur="1.5"/> but he was also <pause dur="0.5"/> engaged in a number <pause dur="0.3"/> of campaigns <pause dur="0.6"/> his successor Tiberius <pause dur="0.5"/> was in his youth <pause dur="0.3"/> a prominent <pause dur="0.3"/> military <pause dur="0.2"/> figure <pause dur="0.3"/> a prominent general and a successful one <pause dur="1.2"/> Gaius Caligula <pause dur="1.3"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> well Gaius Caligula had to rely upon the fact that his father <pause dur="0.6"/> was an extremely successful <pause dur="0.4"/> Roman <pause dur="0.5"/> general <pause dur="0.9"/> his father Germanicus <pause dur="0.3"/> brother to <pause dur="0.2"/> Tiberius <pause dur="1.8"/> none of that <pause dur="0.3"/> was applicable <pause dur="0.5"/> to <pause dur="0.3"/> Claudius <pause dur="0.3"/> yet Roman <pause dur="0.3"/> emperors <pause dur="0.2"/> were equated with <pause dur="1.4"/> military success <pause dur="3.4"/> Claudius <pause dur="0.2"/> was the choice <pause dur="0.3"/> of the Praetorian Guard <pause dur="2.2"/> they made him <pause dur="1.2"/> Claudius probably realized that they could just as easily <pause dur="0.3"/> unmake him <pause dur="1.1"/> and probably more quickly <pause dur="1.0"/> via well a well aimed knife <pause dur="2.1"/> so <pause dur="0.7"/> from the point of view of sheer survival <pause dur="0.7"/> Claudius <pause dur="0.2"/> really had to <pause dur="0.4"/> prove himself <pause dur="1.8"/> a worthy 
successor <pause dur="0.8"/> to the great military figures <pause dur="0.4"/> who had gone before him <pause dur="2.6"/> and what better way <pause dur="0.5"/> to do that <pause dur="2.4"/> than to go beyond the achievements <pause dur="0.4"/> of the <pause dur="0.5"/> founder of the dynasty <pause dur="0.4"/> Julius Caesar himself <pause dur="0.6"/> who had invaded Britain on two occasions but had not conquered it <pause dur="0.5"/> if Claudius could now invade Britain and <pause dur="0.2"/> conquer it <pause dur="0.6"/> that would link him directly <pause dur="0.6"/> with <pause dur="0.4"/> somebody like Julius Caesar <pause dur="0.9"/> and would take him <pause dur="0.6"/> into an altogether different <pause dur="0.5"/> echelon <pause dur="0.2"/> from the point of <pause dur="0.8"/> of # <pause dur="1.4"/> standing within <pause dur="0.4"/> Rome <pause dur="2.4"/> there were other things that <pause dur="0.2"/> suggested <pause dur="0.7"/> an expedition to Britain would make sense <pause dur="3.6"/> Gaius Caligula's expeditions <pause dur="0.3"/> onto the Rhine frontier <pause dur="0.7"/> had <pause dur="1.7"/> produced two new legions which were stationed there <pause dur="1.9"/> this meant <pause dur="0.4"/> that the Rhine frontier was now the <pause dur="0.2"/> most heavily defended frontier of the whole empire <pause dur="1.1"/> and that Claudius probably realized that where there was a concentration of troops there was also a concentration of power <pause dur="1.8"/> all emperors realized that the true <pause dur="0.8"/> source of their power <pause dur="0.7"/> was not with the senate <pause dur="0.3"/> but <trunc>arc</trunc> actually 
with the Roman army <pause dur="0.8"/> this is why they were all very careful to keep the army <pause dur="0.5"/> happy <pause dur="0.7"/> and employed <pause dur="0.2"/> idle hands <pause dur="0.3"/> start <pause dur="0.2"/> hatching plots <pause dur="2.4"/> so the Rhine army is overmanned <pause dur="0.7"/> what can you do about it he couldn't simply dissolve those two extra legions that Gaius <trunc>ci</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> Caligula <pause dur="0.6"/> had # <pause dur="0.7"/> had created that <pause dur="0.3"/> dissolving a legion <pause dur="0.4"/> cashiering it <pause dur="0.2"/> was a mark of disgrace wouldn't do that <pause dur="1.3"/> but move legions into Britain <pause dur="0.6"/> as a an occupying force <pause dur="0.7"/> did make sense <pause dur="0.8"/> they would be cut off by the channel <pause dur="0.6"/> they would have quite enough <pause dur="0.5"/> on their hands <pause dur="0.5"/> to keep them busy <pause dur="0.3"/> and out of any thoughts of creating trouble <pause dur="2.0"/> additionally Britain <pause dur="0.7"/> who had been made to pay <pause dur="0.5"/> for that occupying <pause dur="0.2"/> power <pause dur="0.7"/> leave them on the continent <pause dur="0.5"/> and the empire as it <pause dur="0.2"/> is currently <pause dur="0.9"/> # established <pause dur="0.2"/> has to pay <pause dur="0.5"/> expand the empire slightly <pause dur="0.3"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> the new opened areas <pause dur="0.3"/> themselves have to pay <pause dur="1.9"/> there was also the fact that Gaius Caligula had been very very <pause dur="0.3"/> profligate in spending money <pause dur="2.1"/> and the treasury <pause dur="0.6"/> was somewhat bare <pause dur="0.8"/> Britain <pause dur="1.2"/> offered <pause dur="1.1"/> by the time that we get to the forties A-D <pause dur="1.3"/> a 
better prospect <pause dur="0.3"/> of producing a profit for the Roman empire <pause dur="0.5"/> than had been the case <pause dur="0.7"/> in Julius Caesar's day <pause dur="2.7"/> Britain also of course <pause dur="0.4"/> offered the potential of a pool of manpower <pause dur="0.4"/> Rome was always on the lookout for new <pause dur="0.7"/> sources of manpower <pause dur="0.2"/> especially for providing auxiliary troops in the army <pause dur="2.0"/> so there were a lot of things within Britain <pause dur="0.7"/> that <pause dur="0.4"/> made sense <pause dur="0.7"/> for anybody looking around <pause dur="0.5"/> for military activity <pause dur="1.2"/> there was also one other factor <pause dur="0.2"/> that i want to bring out before we end today <pause dur="1.2"/> and that is a <pause dur="1.2"/> a religious factor <pause dur="0.5"/> and also a sociological factor <pause dur="0.7"/> and this comes down to the Druids <pause dur="1.4"/> we know from our sources that Britain was the centre of <pause dur="0.9"/> well Druidism in inverted comma <pause dur="0.6"/> because what Druidism <pause dur="0.3"/> was we really don't know we know that there were Druids <pause dur="2.2"/> well let's say that there was the Druid problem <pause dur="1.1"/> now the Druids <pause dur="0.4"/> were <pause dur="0.2"/> a pagan <pause dur="1.3"/> priesthood <pause dur="1.0"/> which would normally have been <pause dur="0.3"/> perfectly <pause dur="0.4"/> easily accommodated <pause dur="0.4"/> within <pause dur="0.2"/> the pantheon <pause dur="0.4"/> of <pause dur="0.2"/> Rome <pause dur="0.6"/> the one thing that the Druids did that the Romans didn't 
particularly like <pause dur="0.5"/> was <pause dur="0.3"/> human sacrifice and we'll come back to this when i <pause dur="0.3"/> talk about <pause dur="0.5"/> religion <pause dur="1.6"/> because human sacrifice was <pause dur="1.1"/> tantamount to murder it was murder in Roman law <pause dur="0.2"/> and was therefore illegal <pause dur="1.3"/> # <pause dur="1.6"/> Roman emperors in the past had tried to <pause dur="0.7"/> # mitigate <pause dur="0.9"/> the worst effects the worst behaviour of the Druids <pause dur="0.5"/> in their continental <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> <pause dur="0.4"/> of all the Celts <pause dur="0.3"/> in Gaul for instance <pause dur="2.2"/> but Claudius seems to have set his sights upon <pause dur="0.7"/> getting rid of human sacrifice altogether <pause dur="0.4"/> and the only way that he could do this was <pause dur="0.3"/> to overcome the problem <pause dur="0.5"/> in its <trunc>s</trunc> at its centre <pause dur="0.4"/> within Britain itself <pause dur="0.7"/> so the message today is that though we have problems <pause dur="0.5"/> in establishing some kind of <pause dur="0.4"/> viable <pause dur="0.7"/> # 
history <pause dur="1.1"/> for the period between the departure of <pause dur="1.0"/> <trunc>s</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> Julius Caesar <pause dur="0.4"/> and the advent <pause dur="0.4"/> of the Claudian invasion <pause dur="0.5"/> but our <pause dur="0.2"/> evidence <pause dur="0.9"/> is thin on the ground <pause dur="1.1"/> and the <pause dur="0.8"/> recent interpretation or reinterpretation of that <trunc>ed</trunc> for that <pause dur="0.2"/> evidence <pause dur="0.3"/> creates problems for us <pause dur="0.3"/> in seeing movements and developments <pause dur="0.3"/> within Britain <pause dur="2.8"/> when we come to Claudius we see the convergence <pause dur="0.4"/> of a number of factors <pause dur="0.6"/> which all point <pause dur="0.6"/> to the advantage for the emperor <pause dur="0.6"/> of <pause dur="0.9"/> physical <pause dur="0.4"/> military intervention <pause dur="0.4"/> by Rome <pause dur="0.4"/> into Britain <pause dur="0.6"/> and what <pause dur="0.4"/> form that military intervention took <pause dur="0.6"/> we'll deal with tomorrow
