Elgin <pause dur="0.7"/> was appointed as <pause dur="0.2"/> # ambassador to the court of the Ottoman Empire <pause dur="2.1"/> and he took this opportunity of his <pause dur="0.4"/> dispatch to # <pause dur="0.4"/> Constantinople to Istanbul <pause dur="1.7"/> to <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="1.4"/> obtain permission <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> for his agents to do some limited work on the site of the Acropolis <pause dur="2.0"/> he was allowed in # a document called a firman <pause dur="0.3"/> which is a was an Ottoman <pause dur="0.3"/> a sort of permit to do # to granting certain favours <pause dur="0.6"/> # to outsiders <pause dur="0.2"/> he was granted this permission to do <pause dur="0.9"/> # limited <pause dur="0.9"/> excavation in a sense not excavation <pause dur="0.3"/> # # in in the modern sense <pause dur="0.5"/> # but retrieve some of the sculptures from the site <pause dur="0.3"/> and to draw and copy <pause dur="0.3"/> and study <pause dur="0.4"/> # the sculptures of the Parthenon <pause dur="1.7"/> now today there's controversy over what exactly that permission involved <pause dur="0.4"/> just what sort of legal right <pause dur="0.3"/> even in the terms of <pause dur="0.4"/> # the Ottoman Empire <pause dur="0.3"/> Lord Elgin had <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> to do what he did <pause dur="1.7"/> but <pause dur="0.6"/> from any point of view there's no doubt that he <pause dur="0.2"/> # interpreted <pause dur="0.4"/> # his permission <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> broadly <pause dur="1.6"/> and before he'd even set foot in Athens which he did briefly in eighteen-o-two <pause dur="1.1"/> his men had begun the 
process <pause dur="0.3"/> of removing everything that wasn't # <pause dur="0.2"/> attached to the building <pause dur="0.4"/> and # <pause dur="0.2"/> nearly everything that was <pause dur="1.7"/> in removing these sculptures from the temple <pause dur="0.6"/> the sculptures which were an integral part of the building <pause dur="0.4"/> not just decorations stuck on the outside <pause dur="1.0"/> Lord Elgin's men caused considerable damage to the building <pause dur="2.9"/> in his absence his agents shipped these sculptures <pause dur="0.4"/><vocal desc="laugh" iterated="n"/><pause dur="2.5"/> in his absence this # agents shipped these sculptures back to # back to England <pause dur="0.6"/> and they included well things you've seen before <pause dur="0.4"/><kinesic desc="puts on transparency" iterated="n"/> that should be <pause dur="0.6"/> # quite familiar <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> fifty slabs representing fifty separate slabs <pause dur="0.3"/> # representing the Parthenon frieze <pause dur="1.8"/> # <pause dur="1.0"/> that's one of the individual slabs here # <pause dur="3.4"/> # and then a little drawing as you saw before reconstructing the sort of view from the ground as you look at the frieze <pause dur="0.3"/> in situ up inside the colonnade of the Parthenon <pause dur="1.9"/><kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="5"/> the sides of the frieze # he <pause dur="0.2"/> retrieved fifteen of the metopes the <pause dur="0.7"/> high relief sculptures from the outside of the temple <pause dur="0.9"/><vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.5"/> most of the the best preserved ones 
representing the battle between the Lapiths and the Centaurs <pause dur="2.7"/> and you removed <pause dur="0.2"/> # what was left of the <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="1.0"/> pedimental sculptures from the <kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="5"/> gables at each end <pause dur="0.5"/> # of the temple <pause dur="0.9"/> # <pause dur="2.0"/> these are <pause dur="0.7"/> what's left of the # <pause dur="1.1"/> of the east pediment in the British Museum <pause dur="0.7"/> representing the birth of Athene <pause dur="1.1"/> these had already been damaged in the course of the eighteenth century by previous attempts to remove bits and pieces <pause dur="0.4"/> # individual <pause dur="0.2"/> figures from the pedimental sculptures had been removed and there'd been <pause dur="0.3"/> a Venetian attempt to remove quite a lot so they'd been damaged <pause dur="0.3"/> before Lord Elgin came along <pause dur="0.6"/> and just to give you some idea of their <kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="5"/> state before the Venetian bombardment in sixteen-eighteen-seven <pause dur="0.7"/> these are # Jacques Carrey's drawings <pause dur="0.4"/> # of <pause dur="0.2"/> # the # <pause dur="0.2"/> the west pediment <pause dur="0.2"/> representing the struggle between <pause dur="0.2"/> Athene and Poseidon <pause dur="2.6"/> so most of this material brought back to the British Museum <pause dur="0.3"/> # and that's where it is now of course how many of you <pause dur="0.6"/> how many of you have seen the Elgin Marbles in the British Museum <pause dur="1.6"/> 
nearly everybody <pause dur="0.9"/> the rest of you probably have without <shift feature="voice" new="laugh"/>remembering anything about it <shift feature="voice" new="normal"/><pause dur="0.4"/> it's not far away so next time you're in London take <pause dur="0.4"/> take # <pause dur="0.8"/> take the opportunity to go and look at them and also think about the way they're displayed in the British Museum <pause dur="0.6"/> which is quite interesting what it implies <pause dur="0.3"/> about the nineteenth century <pause dur="0.3"/> view <pause dur="0.3"/> # of what these sculptures are and why they're important <pause dur="1.4"/> you'll also notice in the British Museum <pause dur="0.5"/> just <pause dur="0.2"/> to one in one of the smaller galleries off to one side <pause dur="0.3"/> partly in response to the contemporary <pause dur="0.3"/> controversy <pause dur="0.2"/> the Greek demands for the return of the Elgin Marbles <pause dur="0.5"/> # there are new displays which put much more emphasis on the original context of the sculptures <pause dur="0.3"/> and what sort of role they had on the temple itself <pause dur="4.8"/> # Elgin also removed other bits and pieces from the Acropolis # including <pause dur="0.2"/> you know one of the caryatids one of the architectural <pause dur="0.4"/> # female figures from the Erectheum <pause dur="0.6"/> which if you remember <pause dur="0.2"/> on the plan was next to <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> next to the 
Parthenon <pause dur="1.5"/> well there's no doubt that Elgin was acting from personal <pause dur="0.2"/> # from motives of personal gain he wanted these sculptures <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> as <pause dur="0.4"/> as many other aristocrats in that period wanted classical sculptures <pause dur="0.2"/> as the suitable cultivated adornments for his home <pause dur="0.9"/> these sculptures were exceptional <pause dur="0.5"/> they were <pause dur="0.4"/> beyond the means of most aristocratic collectors in this period <pause dur="0.4"/> but it's the same kind of thing he wanted them <pause dur="0.4"/> # as <pause dur="0.3"/> # the suitable adornments of his # <pause dur="0.5"/> <trunc>s</trunc> specifically of the property he was building in Scotland <pause dur="3.4"/> it may or may not be true what he later claimed that he was bringing these things back and his drawings and plaster casts as well <pause dur="0.4"/> for the <trunc>s</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> for the good of the arts and crafts of Britain <pause dur="0.5"/> that these things were going to be a sort of inspiring example <pause dur="0.3"/> to nineteenth century <pause dur="0.3"/> # British designers and artists <pause dur="0.6"/> # i suppose it's really fair to say that those two motives were rather blurred in Elgin's own mind <pause dur="0.9"/> # as well as some of his supporters <pause dur="3.8"/> 
now it's <pause dur="0.2"/> very easy especially in light of the contemporary debate and our attitudes to <pause dur="0.4"/> # the plundering <pause dur="0.3"/> of cultural heritage <pause dur="0.4"/> to condemn Lord Elgin <pause dur="2.3"/> # there's a book which you will look at you should look at especially if you're answering <pause dur="0.3"/> # if you're writing an essay on <pause dur="0.2"/> # the Elgin controversy <pause dur="0.5"/> which is <kinesic desc="holds up book" iterated="n"/> this book by Christopher Hitchens <pause dur="0.3"/> which is on your general bibliography <pause dur="0.5"/> # and and today's handout as well <pause dur="0.3"/> The Elgin Marbles Should They Be Returned To Greece <pause dur="1.5"/> if you see a book with a title like that you know that it's not he's not genuinely asking that <pause dur="0.3"/> question <pause dur="0.2"/> and that what he really means is <pause dur="0.2"/> the Elgin Marbles why they should be returned to Greece <pause dur="0.3"/> it's a very polemical book it's a political tract <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> it's <pause dur="0.6"/> factually wrong in many <shift feature="voice" new="laugh"/>places <shift feature="voice" new="normal"/><pause dur="0.4"/> it's <pause dur="0.2"/> # it twists the # historical evidence <pause dur="0.5"/> # it's very <pause dur="0.2"/> # rhetorical <pause dur="0.3"/> last year i devoted a whole lecture to analysing the rhetoric <pause dur="0.6"/> # which he uses to put his point across <pause dur="0.4"/> not time to do that this year <pause dur="0.2"/> but it would be good if you <pause dur="0.3"/> # have a look at that <pause dur="1.6"/> 
anyway # Hitchens is # obviously very hostile to Elgin <pause dur="1.2"/> and he sees him as a sort of grasping hypocrite <pause dur="1.1"/> # totally unscrupulous <pause dur="1.3"/> and he finds it deeply ironic that Lord Elgin and his contemporaries <pause dur="0.2"/> his associates <pause dur="0.3"/> could talk about # Napoleon's <pause dur="0.4"/> plundering of Italy at that time <pause dur="0.4"/> Napoleon <pause dur="0.2"/> taking <pause dur="0.3"/> paintings and sculptures from Italy back to France <pause dur="0.8"/> # and and even Elgin and and his # friends could compare their own <pause dur="0.5"/> # depredations with those of <pause dur="0.2"/> # Napoleon <pause dur="0.4"/> and yet they didn't see anything wrong in what they were doing <pause dur="1.4"/> Napoleon's actions were <pause dur="0.2"/> self-evidently wrong he was <pause dur="0.2"/> plundering these cultural treasures of Italy <pause dur="1.2"/> there was nothing wrong with what Elgin was doing <pause dur="1.4"/> and i think to understand that apparent # double <pause dur="0.9"/> double standard <pause dur="0.9"/> # <pause dur="1.4"/> we have to remember that the # <pause dur="0.2"/> the <pause dur="2.8"/> there's a kind of # difference <pause dur="0.7"/> in the way that # western Europe and its cultural treasures would have been viewed <pause dur="0.9"/> <trunc>a</trunc> <trunc>a</trunc> and and the way in which the the <trunc>r</trunc> # ancient ruins of of Greece would have 
been viewed just at that period <pause dur="0.7"/> we've a very clear idea of cultural treasures of cultural heritage <pause dur="0.6"/> but in that period <pause dur="0.3"/> there was a difference in <trunc>i</trunc> in people's minds between the plundering of the galleries of the established states of western Europe <pause dur="0.6"/> and the recovering <pause dur="0.2"/> of outdoor ruins <pause dur="0.2"/> from a small fortress settlement <pause dur="0.3"/> on the very edge of the Ottoman Empire <pause dur="0.3"/> which is what Athens was <pause dur="0.4"/> # in that period <pause dur="2.7"/> having said that <pause dur="0.3"/> there is # an inconsistency a deep tension <pause dur="0.4"/> in the way <pause dur="0.3"/> in which Elgin and his like-minded contemporaries were thinking <pause dur="2.0"/> they <pause dur="0.2"/> clearly recognized the documents show that they clearly recognized <pause dur="1.0"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> Elgin's enemies recognized that <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> <trunc>hi</trunc> the way that he went about recovering these sculptures was clumsy <pause dur="0.5"/> and self-interested <pause dur="0.7"/> and it resulted in the demolition of a well preserved and <pause dur="0.2"/> and well known classical monument <pause dur="0.9"/> Elgin was much criticized in his own time as we'll see <pause dur="2.7"/> on the other hand <pause dur="1.0"/> you could easily argue that he was just doing on a grander scale <pause dur="0.4"/> what <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="1.0"/> 
other aristocrats from Britain and and western European countries <pause dur="0.2"/> were doing <pause dur="0.3"/> in the the <pause dur="0.2"/> late eighteenth and early nineteenth century <pause dur="1.7"/> and the British Museum <pause dur="0.4"/> is full of <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> monuments that <pause dur="0.2"/> were brought back from Turkey and Greece <pause dur="0.3"/> and other countries <pause dur="0.4"/> in a time when really <trunc>the</trunc> there didn't seem to be anything <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> wrong with <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="1.8"/> in a sense recovering these <pause dur="0.3"/> outdoor remains for civilization <pause dur="2.2"/> so in that sort of tension between the criticism of Elgin <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> the the # <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="1.0"/> # near acceptability of what he was doing <pause dur="0.5"/> you can see that <pause dur="0.9"/> really <trunc>att</trunc> # contemporary attitudes are <pause dur="0.2"/> wavering <pause dur="0.3"/> between those two extremes <pause dur="0.9"/> we're on the # the edge <pause dur="0.5"/> of acceptability <pause dur="0.2"/> and unacceptability <pause dur="2.1"/> it didn't take long for that balance to tip one way <pause dur="1.0"/> so we do very quickly have <pause dur="0.4"/> outspoken <pause dur="0.7"/> romantic <pause dur="0.3"/> nationalist attacks on Elgin <pause dur="0.2"/> from people like Byron and Byron is the most outspoken of all <pause dur="1.0"/> who have already developed a clear idea of Greece <pause dur="0.4"/> as a distinct modern nation <pause dur="0.3"/> with its own special cultural 
heritage <pause dur="2.1"/> now we should find that attitude <pause dur="0.8"/> rather surprising <pause dur="0.9"/> in this period <pause dur="0.2"/> remember that Greece doesn't exist at this time <pause dur="0.7"/> the state of Greece doesn't exist and had never existed <pause dur="0.4"/> at the start of the nineteenth century <pause dur="2.0"/> it had existed in a sense as a province of the Roman Empire <pause dur="1.9"/> but it's <pause dur="0.2"/> a few years after this in the eighteen-twenties that # Greece won its independence and became <pause dur="0.3"/> a nation state <pause dur="1.8"/> so in a sense Byron's # attitudes his idea of the <pause dur="0.3"/> Greek nation <pause dur="0.2"/> and its # <pause dur="0.2"/> spiritual property <pause dur="0.4"/> <trunc>i</trunc> is a a rather novel one <pause dur="0.9"/> today <pause dur="0.6"/> those sorts of sentiments are # perfectly familiar to us <pause dur="4.4"/> still we should bear in mind the ambiguities of the time <pause dur="0.6"/> and these are particularly clear if you <pause dur="0.2"/> # if for example when you start to look at the letters <pause dur="0.6"/> exchanged between <pause dur="0.4"/> # the the painter called # Lusieri <pause dur="0.3"/> who was <trunc>or</trunc> # Elgin's # agent that's L-U-S-<pause dur="0.3"/>I-E-R-I <pause dur="1.4"/> he was in charge of Elgin's operations on the ground in Athens <pause dur="0.6"/> # if you look at his letters to his patron <pause dur="1.7"/> # <pause dur="2.4"/> it's quite interesting it's almost a

maybe half what he'd spent acquiring these things in the first place <pause dur="1.8"/> and there was much opposition <pause dur="0.2"/> to the state's purchase of these sculptures at a time of war <pause dur="1.3"/> but finally after a series # of discussions in the House of Commons through eighteen-fifteen and eighteen-sixteen <pause dur="0.8"/> # the # Parliament agreed in eighteen-sixteen <pause dur="0.2"/> to to pay <pause dur="0.3"/> # Elgin <pause dur="0.4"/> # for the marbles and to deposit them in the British Museum <pause dur="0.4"/> and that's where they have been ever since <pause dur="2.0"/> once again <pause dur="0.4"/> these debates these parliamentary debates <pause dur="0.4"/> which are represented <pause dur="0.3"/> # lot of the documents are in Hitchens' book but i've put extracts in your handout <pause dur="0.6"/> these <pause dur="0.8"/> arguments are really the basis of the # contemporary controversy and you'll see the same sorts of arguments <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> in <pause dur="0.5"/> you know the second decade of the nineteenth century <pause dur="0.3"/> as you'll find once you start to look in the internet <pause dur="0.4"/> for <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> # arguments in the nineteen-nineties <pause dur="3.4"/> well <pause dur="2.3"/> despite this consistency <pause dur="0.2"/> in the nature of the debate and the nature of the 
controversy over two centuries <pause dur="0.8"/> there was another controversy in Elgin's own time which may appear more surprising to us <pause dur="1.5"/> and that is the <pause dur="0.8"/> contemporary aesthetic attitudes <pause dur="0.2"/> to the Elgin marbles <pause dur="0.3"/> the way in which people responded to them as ancient art <pause dur="0.5"/> at the beginning of the nineteenth century <pause dur="4.3"/> individually <pause dur="0.4"/> some Greek sculptures had been admired appreciated since the seventeenth century or before <pause dur="1.3"/> certainly Roman copies # of <pause dur="0.2"/> Greek sculptures or <pause dur="0.3"/> versions of the <pause dur="0.3"/> # recreations of the style of Greek sculpture <pause dur="0.5"/> # had been admired and collected for a long time <pause dur="1.3"/> but really <pause dur="0.3"/> there had been very little <pause dur="0.3"/> public demonstration of what Greek what real <pause dur="0.2"/> classical Greek sculptures looked like <pause dur="1.5"/> people had an idea of what classical sculpture looked like <pause dur="0.3"/> which was especially built on on later Hellenistic and Roman <pause dur="0.3"/> # works <pause dur="2.2"/> and this is a period when as i've said before Greece was <pause dur="0.2"/> just becoming more accessible to western Europe <pause dur="0.9"/> with the products <pause dur="0.3"/> and # well the the # relics of Greece were just 
becoming <pause dur="0.3"/> # better known <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> to collectors in the west <pause dur="1.9"/> we looked before at the # realization that Greek vases came from Athens and not from Italy <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> from about the middle of the eighteenth century <pause dur="2.0"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> as a result of this people weren't quite ready for what they <trunc>f</trunc> <pause dur="0.3"/> saw in the Elgin marbles <pause dur="0.5"/> and while # <trunc>w</trunc> some people had their breath taken away by these sculptures <pause dur="0.6"/> and thought they were the most wonderful works of art <pause dur="0.2"/> that had been seen <pause dur="0.3"/> in western Europe <pause dur="1.0"/> but others were <pause dur="0.4"/> rather shocked and surprised by what they found <pause dur="0.7"/> # they saw sculptures which were <pause dur="0.9"/> very realistic in some respects that paid <pause dur="0.2"/> close attention to details of anantomy <pause dur="0.8"/> including the veins and individual muscles in the body <pause dur="1.2"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> less idealized in that sense than <pause dur="0.3"/> some <pause dur="0.2"/> of the freestanding sculptures that had been known up until then <pause dur="1.4"/> they saw <pause dur="0.2"/> sculptures that had hints of facial expression <pause dur="0.7"/> figures expressing emotion rather than just having blank classical faces <pause dur="0.9"/> and bodies engaged in lively action <pause dur="0.3"/> twisting around <pause dur="0.6"/> # 
dynamic figures very unlike the still <pause dur="0.2"/> impassive <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> Greco-Roman sculptures that had been so much admired in the eighteenth century <pause dur="3.5"/> and there was one particular <pause dur="0.5"/> critic <pause dur="0.3"/> who <pause dur="0.2"/> dealt a serious blow to Elgin's <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> his <pause dur="0.3"/> claim for for money and and # his his attempt to <pause dur="0.4"/> # get the importance of the sculptures recognized in Britain <pause dur="0.5"/> that was a figure <pause dur="0.3"/> called Richard Payne Knight <pause dur="2.0"/> now Richard Payne Knight <pause dur="1.3"/> nowadays you'd call him a classicist he's <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> quite well known for translating # some obscene Latin poems <pause dur="0.4"/> # called the # the Priapic Songs <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> but better known as a connoisseur of art he's a leading figure <pause dur="0.4"/> in an organization called the Society of Dilettante <pause dur="1.3"/> the Society of Dilettante still exists <pause dur="0.4"/> if any of you <pause dur="0.4"/> want some money to go on holiday to Greece you should look out on the noticeboard in the corridor and they sometimes send <pause dur="0.4"/> out the advertisements <pause dur="0.4"/> for the # you know they give awards for <trunc>pe</trunc> # undergraduates to go and study sculpture in Greece <pause dur="1.5"/> # the Society of Dilettante 
was a society a sort of gentlemen's society <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> # of connoisseurs <pause dur="0.2"/> scholars of ancient art <pause dur="0.7"/> # and <pause dur="1.3"/> it doesn't <pause dur="0.2"/> quite have the sort of amateur associations <pause dur="0.7"/> that <pause dur="1.2"/> the <trunc>n</trunc> the the name might suggest today <pause dur="0.4"/> they sponsored a lot of very serious <pause dur="0.3"/> # scientific study <pause dur="0.3"/> of ancient sculptures <pause dur="0.7"/> so Richard Payne Knight was a leading figure in this organization <pause dur="0.3"/> and a kind of expert witness gave evidence to Parliament <pause dur="0.5"/> on the # value of the sculptures <pause dur="0.6"/> and he had a devastating judgement of them <pause dur="1.5"/> he said <pause dur="0.7"/> that far from being works of the greatest sculptors of the high classical period <pause dur="0.4"/> in the fifth century B-C <pause dur="1.0"/> these sculptures that Elgin had brought back <pause dur="0.9"/> had been made in the reign of the Emperor Hadrian <pause dur="0.6"/> in the first half of the second century A-D <pause dur="2.6"/> now Christopher Hitchens <pause dur="0.4"/> talking about this argument <pause dur="0.3"/> thinks it's absolutely ridiculous he calls Richard Payne Knight a buffoon <pause dur="1.1"/> and says that this suggestion <pause dur="0.3"/> that the sculptures are Hadrianic is absolutely ridiculous <pause dur="1.0"/> and taking <pause dur="0.5"/> taking their cue <pause dur="0.3"/> # 
from Hitchens <pause dur="0.8"/> everybody who wrote an essay on this subject last year <pause dur="0.3"/> said <pause dur="0.5"/> # Richard Payne Knight thought the sculptures were Hadrianic # wasn't that ridiculous <pause dur="2.3"/> and i'm sure that some of you will try and do the same thing this year as well <pause dur="0.3"/> and i felt very sorry for Payne Knight <pause dur="0.5"/> when i was reading the essays last year <pause dur="0.9"/> because <pause dur="2.7"/> even today <pause dur="0.2"/> i bet if i i i could show you a picture <pause dur="0.4"/> of a fifth century B-C sculpture <pause dur="0.4"/> and a Hadrianic sculpture <pause dur="0.6"/> # and you wouldn't be able to tell the difference between them <pause dur="0.6"/> i bet i could choose examples <pause dur="0.4"/> that would <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.9"/> you you'd find difficult to tell apart <pause dur="0.7"/> there are differences but they're subtle differences <pause dur="0.4"/> and even today generally with the dating of ancient sculpture <pause dur="0.3"/> we sometimes have <pause dur="0.4"/> great difficulty <pause dur="1.2"/> our judgements tend to be based on style <pause dur="0.8"/> and the age of Hadrian was a period in which <pause dur="0.2"/> classical Greek sculpture was much <pause dur="0.5"/> imitated <pause dur="1.4"/> # so imagine the early nineteenth century imagine a period when people are only just beginning to try and <pause dur="0.3"/> impose <pause dur="0.3"/> some sort 
of historical chronological framework <pause dur="0.3"/> on this mass of <pause dur="0.2"/> bits and pieces of diverse sculpture <pause dur="0.6"/> from Greece and Rome <pause dur="0.9"/> how on earth <pause dur="0.3"/> <shift feature="voice" new="laugh"/> would you <shift feature="voice" new="normal"/> be able to tell <pause dur="0.3"/> the difference <pause dur="0.2"/> between <pause dur="0.2"/> the <pause dur="0.2"/> fifth century material and Hadrianic material <pause dur="1.7"/> the fact that these things were found on the Parthenon is suggestive i admit <pause dur="0.6"/> but there are other monuments in Greece <pause dur="0.2"/> famous temples <pause dur="0.3"/> which had been restored in Roman <pause dur="0.3"/> in the Roman period and had later sculptures on them <pause dur="0.3"/> so it's not an absurd suggestion <pause dur="0.2"/> at all <pause dur="1.5"/> <trunc>i</trunc> it has to be admitted it wasn't <pause dur="0.2"/> the # opinion of most people in this period <pause dur="2.1"/> but even without Payne Knight's specific controversial judgement <pause dur="0.5"/> there was <pause dur="0.3"/> # on the part of many people <pause dur="0.7"/> # at the start of the nineteenth century <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> a feeling of <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="1.8"/> a bit people felt uncomfortable <pause dur="0.4"/> about the # <pause dur="0.5"/> form <pause dur="0.3"/> of the Elgin marbles <pause dur="0.4"/> # which defied their expectations <pause dur="0.2"/> of classical art <pause dur="0.4"/> in the neoclassical period <pause dur="3.3"/> well the upshot of all this <pause dur="0.3"/> is that <pause dur="1.3"/> there are really two lessons from the material we've 
looked at <pause dur="2.3"/> firstly this is a period of flux <pause dur="1.7"/> we've seen that # attitudes were # to the nation <pause dur="0.5"/> and to <pause dur="0.2"/> cultural heritage were changing <pause dur="1.7"/> ideas like those expressed by Byron were just starting to emerge <pause dur="1.5"/> we'll look at that <pause dur="0.3"/> <trunc>m</trunc> more # # in the next lecture <pause dur="0.9"/> but besides that <pause dur="0.4"/> classical studies <pause dur="0.2"/> classical art history classical <pause dur="0.2"/> archaeology <pause dur="1.1"/> are are beginning to take form in <trunc>somethi</trunc> # something <pause dur="0.2"/> like <pause dur="0.2"/> the the the the the form we see them today <pause dur="2.2"/> things that we take for granted ideas and assumptions that we take for granted are just starting <pause dur="0.3"/> to take shape <pause dur="0.4"/> in classical scholarship <pause dur="4.7"/> 
the second thing is <pause dur="2.6"/> that <pause dur="0.6"/> if you look at <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> <trunc>h</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> Hitchens' particular objections <pause dur="1.0"/> # to Lord Elgin's action and <trunc>hi</trunc> his argument for the return of the Elgin marbles <pause dur="0.9"/> they are ultimately underpinned <pause dur="0.7"/> by his own <pause dur="0.3"/> personal <pause dur="0.2"/> passion <pause dur="0.5"/> for the what he sees as the sublime artistic achievement <pause dur="0.4"/> represented by the sculptures in the Parthenon <pause dur="5.1"/> because he has that assumption 'cause his argument his political argument depends on it <pause dur="1.1"/> it is unthinkable that the <pause dur="0.2"/> # classic quality he observes in these sculptures <pause dur="0.3"/> might not be instinctively <pause dur="0.3"/> evident to everybody <pause dur="1.7"/> it's out of the question as far as Hitchens is concerned <pause dur="0.2"/> that anyone might have an alternative view of the Elgin marbles <pause dur="0.4"/> and for that reason <pause dur="0.2"/> he has to devote special effort to rubbishing Payne Knight <pause dur="0.6"/> or any other <pause dur="0.3"/> # aesthetic <trunc>criti</trunc> critics <pause dur="0.2"/> of the Elgin marbles <pause dur="0.4"/> # from # Elgin's own period <pause dur="1.5"/> what Hitchens is doing <pause dur="0.3"/> is really <pause dur="0.3"/> # what what many of us are 
doing <pause dur="0.2"/> all the time <pause dur="0.3"/> we're looking back on <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> recent history of the reception <pause dur="0.3"/> of the this material <pause dur="0.4"/> # and on the classical past <pause dur="0.9"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> from a position of knowledge <pause dur="0.2"/> and we're secure <pause dur="0.8"/> in <pause dur="0.5"/> our assumptions <pause dur="0.3"/> and our expectations <pause dur="0.7"/> and our prejudices about the classical past and what it <pause dur="0.3"/> what what its significance is today <pause dur="1.3"/> so our # everything we look at in the past <pause dur="0.3"/> is orientated towards our own contemporary standpoint <pause dur="1.4"/> you look at a polemical tract like Hitchens and that becomes particularly clear <pause dur="0.4"/> but i think it's part of what we're all doing <pause dur="3.4"/> another point worth making is <pause dur="0.8"/> in this <pause dur="0.2"/> # particular respect <pause dur="0.6"/> is <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="2.2"/> Hitchens' attitude to the # <pause dur="0.4"/> to the creator of the Parthenon sculptures <pause dur="0.5"/> if you look at the the blurb on the back of his book <pause dur="1.4"/> it begins <pause dur="0.3"/> <reading>the Elgin marbles designed and executed by Phidias to adorn the Parthenon <pause dur="0.2"/> are some of the most beautiful sculptures of Ancient Greece</reading> <pause dur="3.1"/> and that's his first factual mistake <pause dur="0.3"/> that these sculptures were made by Phidias <pause dur="1.8"/> we're told by ancient sources that 
Phidias <pause dur="0.6"/> was <pause dur="0.5"/> in some sense responsible for the sculptures of the Parthenon <pause dur="0.9"/> he couldn't have been <pause dur="0.3"/> actively involved in the production of all of them <pause dur="0.6"/> # it's usually thought that he had some sort of role as a supervisor <pause dur="2.5"/> nevertheless we know that Phidias was the most great the the the greatest # most famous # sculpture of the classical <trunc>wor</trunc> # # sculptor of the classical world <pause dur="0.4"/> # Roman sources <pause dur="0.3"/> # always cite him as the example of a classical <pause dur="0.3"/> # sculptor he's a bit like Michelangelo in more recent centuries <trunc>th</trunc> the most famous <pause dur="0.3"/> figure of all <pause dur="0.2"/> in the history of classical art <pause dur="0.5"/> and so Hitchens and <pause dur="0.5"/> many with similar views <pause dur="0.2"/> latch on to that supposed <pause dur="0.4"/> association <pause dur="0.3"/> between Phidias and the Parthenon sculptures <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="1.0"/> to # demonstrate <pause dur="0.5"/> # that # <pause dur="0.5"/> the the these works are # <pause dur="1.3"/> self-evidently <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> the the # # <trunc>s</trunc> sometimes called the crown jewels of Greece <pause dur="0.7"/> something of # <pause dur="0.4"/> # exceptional <pause dur="0.3"/> # importance has cultural heritage not just like anything else that <trunc>w</trunc> may have been <pause dur="0.4"/> # removed from Greece or other countries <pause dur="0.2"/>

was it supposed that our title to them could be supported on the vague words of the firman <pause dur="0.6"/> which only gave authority to remove some small pieces of stone <pause dur="1.3"/> it was well known <trunc>th</trunc> that the empress Catharine</reading> <pause dur="0.6"/> the empress Catharine of Russia <pause dur="0.4"/> <reading>had entertained the idea of establishing the Archduke Constantine in Greece</reading> <pause dur="0.8"/> setting up a monarchy in Greece <pause dur="1.3"/> <reading>if the project of that extraordinary woman should ever be accomplished and Greece ranked among independent nations <pause dur="0.3"/> with what feelings would she contemplate the people who had stripped from this celebrated temple <pause dur="0.3"/> of its noblest ornaments</reading> <pause dur="1.7"/> now that <pause dur="0.6"/> too seems like a very modern argument <pause dur="1.4"/> the idea that <pause dur="0.2"/> you know that # Greece might <pause dur="0.3"/> one day call for these things to be returned <pause dur="0.5"/> # and # that # <pause dur="1.0"/> # there would be ill feeling because Britain had had robbed that nation <pause dur="0.3"/> of its most treasured cultural <pause dur="0.6"/> possessions <pause dur="0.3"/> so superficially it looks like a modern argument <pause dur="0.5"/> but then think again about the terms in which it's presented <pause dur="1.3"/> it is not <pause dur="0.4"/> he

it was true <pause dur="0.4"/> # that they didn't care about them <pause dur="0.4"/> so that Elgin was justified in removing <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> things that literally have no value <pause dur="1.4"/> # <pause dur="1.6"/> he # <pause dur="1.9"/> goes on to suggest that # <pause dur="0.5"/> Elgin's <trunc>marb</trunc> # <shift feature="voice" new="laugh"/> Elgin's <shift feature="voice" new="normal"/> # agents used # bribery <pause dur="0.4"/> to obtain this material <pause dur="1.4"/> # <pause dur="1.7"/> six lines down on the seven lines down on the third column of page one you see <pause dur="0.5"/> # he he he uses the word spoliation <pause dur="1.5"/> very emotive word still used today <pause dur="0.6"/> # by critics of Elgin <pause dur="1.5"/> and then he proposes <pause dur="0.4"/> # an amendment <pause dur="0.5"/> to the <pause dur="0.2"/> # to the # bill that's being discussed <pause dur="2.4"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="1.2"/> the <trunc>s</trunc> really significant bit of this amendment is the last bit just down towards the bottom <pause dur="0.3"/> bottom right hand <pause dur="0.2"/> # corner of your <pause dur="0.2"/> page one <pause dur="3.4"/> this this is part of his amendment this wasn't passed <pause dur="0.8"/> <reading>this committee therefore feels justified under the particular circumstances of the case <pause dur="0.3"/> in recommending that twenty-five-thousand pounds be offered to the Earl of Elgin for the collection <pause dur="0.3"/> in order to recover and keep it together for that government <pause dur="0.3"/> from which it has been improperly taken <pause dur="2.4"/> 
and to which this committee is of the opinion <pause dur="0.7"/> that a communication should be immediately made <pause dur="0.6"/> stating <pause dur="0.3"/> that Great Britain holds these marbles <pause dur="0.3"/> only in trust <pause dur="0.5"/> till they're demanded by the present or any future possessors of the city of Athens <pause dur="1.0"/> and upon such demand engages without question or negotiation <pause dur="0.4"/> to restore them <pause dur="0.4"/> as far as can be effected <pause dur="0.3"/> to the places from whence they were taken <pause dur="0.6"/> and that they shall be in the meantime carefully preserved in the British Museum</reading> <pause dur="1.4"/> and once again he's not talking about the people of Greece <pause dur="0.3"/> he's not talking about the Greek nation <pause dur="0.3"/> he's talking about <pause dur="0.2"/> the Turkish government <pause dur="0.3"/> that's what he means by the government <pause dur="0.3"/> of <pause dur="0.5"/> # Athens <pause dur="1.1"/> government of Greece <pause dur="1.1"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> he <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="1.3"/> # <pause dur="0.9"/> again alludes to the possibility that Greece may become # <pause dur="0.3"/> # a sovereign state <pause dur="0.2"/> but it's <trunc>n</trunc> not in any sense the the people would rise up <pause dur="0.4"/> and and claim their cultural <pause dur="0.2"/> # heritage <pause dur="2.8"/> # <pause dur="2.5"/> to summarize some of the other points made <trunc>i</trunc> in in the rest of page two of your handout <pause dur="0.8"/> # under B Mr 
Croker <pause dur="0.3"/> another Member of Parliament <pause dur="1.1"/> # <pause dur="1.8"/> he <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> thinks that this argument of Mr Hammersley's is ridiculous <pause dur="0.2"/> the suggestion that we should be holding the sculptures in trust <pause dur="0.3"/> until the Russians come along and take them <pause dur="0.2"/> that's how he presents it <pause dur="0.3"/> slightly distorting what <pause dur="0.2"/> # Hammersley had said <pause dur="1.4"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> he then # suggests that the # <pause dur="0.2"/> the economic objections to buying the Elgin marbles <pause dur="0.3"/> were unfounded <pause dur="0.2"/> he thinks this is a good investment <pause dur="0.3"/> and will <trunc>i</trunc> it'll have <pause dur="0.2"/> tremendous impact on the <pause dur="0.4"/> the art and industry of Britain <pause dur="1.6"/> he says that when Pericles wanted to build the Parthenon <pause dur="0.6"/> he was # # he faced objections from people who said it's a needless expense <pause dur="0.7"/> # so # he <pause dur="0.3"/> he compares their position <pause dur="0.3"/> to Pericles <pause dur="0.4"/> to his # <pause dur="0.7"/> obviously no one would object to the Parthenon having been made in the first place <pause dur="2.2"/> and # finally he says that there was no sign that Lord Elgin had shown any rapacity <pause dur="1.4"/> # he had touched things he had he'd laid his hands on things which were already ruins <pause dur="1.5"/> he didn't go to Greece 
with the intention of ravaging it <pause dur="0.4"/> or despoiling its temples <pause dur="0.4"/> he went with the highest motives <pause dur="0.3"/> and has brought back material which will be of great benefit to his <pause dur="0.2"/> nation <pause dur="2.2"/> # he also uses the argument which is <pause dur="0.2"/> still used today <pause dur="0.2"/> that if the sculptures had stayed in the Parthenon <pause dur="0.3"/> they would have been <pause dur="0.2"/> # very quickly destroyed and he gives <pause dur="0.3"/> <trunc>e</trunc> rather dubious evidence for <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> the <pause dur="0.4"/> the the the idea that # the local inhabitants of Athens were <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> # they're smashing up these sculptures and # <pause dur="0.2"/> turning them into mortar and that sort of thing <pause dur="0.2"/> clearly that was happening <pause dur="0.4"/> but there's a little bit of doubt over the particular <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> pieces of evidence that he uses <pause dur="2.2"/> # and then again the sentiments that he expresses # are # <pause dur="0.2"/> echoed # in the final column there under C <pause dur="0.5"/> right at the bottom <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> Mr Banks says that <reading>the most eminent artists had been consulted by the committee</reading> <pause dur="0.5"/> by the select committee 
discussing the issue <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="1.9"/> he says that the sculptures <reading>by many were classed above and by others little below the highest works obtained since the restoration of art</reading> <pause dur="0.5"/> since the Renaissance <pause dur="0.9"/> # <reading>and # for forming a school of art <pause dur="0.3"/> they were considered <pause dur="0.2"/> as absolutely invaluable</reading> <pause dur="0.3"/> so they'd be an inspiration to the current <pause dur="0.4"/> neoclassical movement in art <pause dur="2.6"/> so you can read through those for yourself and look at the details <pause dur="0.4"/> and <pause dur="0.4"/> really you'll see the whole repertoire of arguments that are still used today <pause dur="2.0"/> # <pause dur="0.8"/> don't rush off because we'll discuss the seminar <pause dur="0.4"/> # in the next lecture i will look a little bit more on the issues of of nationalism in Greece and the way in which archaeology was implicated <pause dur="0.3"/> in the growth of the Greek state <pause dur="0.3"/> as well as the actual impact that the # Elgin marbles did in fact have <pause dur="0.3"/> on the art and architecture of Britain <pause dur="1.6"/> 
now very quickly your # <pause dur="0.3"/> handout for the seminar <pause dur="0.4"/> giving you your instructions <pause dur="1.2"/> # <pause dur="2.5"/> # i i no longer have a copy but <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="1.3"/> i <pause dur="0.2"/> # if i recall i i'd asked you to do two things to look # for web sites <pause dur="0.7"/> that <pause dur="0.7"/> as well as the literature on your general bibliography <pause dur="0.3"/> which will # <pause dur="0.2"/> help you to work out what the arguments are <pause dur="0.2"/> on both sides of the contemporary <pause dur="0.3"/> # debate of the Elgin marbles <pause dur="0.2"/> should they be returned to Greece <pause dur="1.0"/> and of course <pause dur="0.5"/> you can make up your own mind where you stand <pause dur="0.2"/> for that argument <pause dur="0.5"/> it's not really our purpose to <pause dur="0.3"/> to <trunc>f</trunc> fight it out and come to a conclusion <pause dur="1.0"/> # but <pause dur="0.5"/> especially what i want you to do <pause dur="0.2"/> is to find # a polemical web site you will find them <pause dur="0.6"/> or if necessary to find some # # an article or a <pause dur="0.4"/> or <pause dur="1.1"/> # <trunc>i</trunc> <trunc>i</trunc> if you really can't cope with the # computers <pause dur="0.3"/> # you could look at Hitchens' book <pause dur="0.3"/> but find some sort of argument about the Elgin marbles today <pause dur="0.8"/> and <pause dur="0.9"/> analyse it think about how the # where the person's coming from <pause dur="0.3"/> how they're pitching their arguments <pause dur="0.4"/> # how they're # organizing their material <pause dur="0.2"/> how they're organizing historical evidence <pause dur="0.3"/> # to back up the particular <pause dur="0.3"/> # ideas that they hold <pause dur="1.1"/> # so that's the important thing not that you should come up with a view on the Elgin marbles <pause dur="0.3"/> but that you should be able to analyse
