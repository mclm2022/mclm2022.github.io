looking at how the making of type speeded up that's type manufacture <pause dur="0.5"/> and composition <pause dur="0.5"/> and both # <pause dur="0.4"/> aspects of type <pause dur="0.8"/> and the use of type <pause dur="0.5"/> were mechanized in the course of the nineteenth century <pause dur="0.5"/> first the # <pause dur="0.6"/> manufacture of type and then actually <pause dur="0.4"/> composing type <pause dur="0.2"/> so that it could be used for # for printing <pause dur="0.6"/> and we will have <pause dur="0.3"/> a a demonstration of the working <pause dur="0.3"/> linotype system that's here in the department <pause dur="1.7"/> so this week's # topic <pause dur="0.7"/> is the letter forms that are known as display type <pause dur="0.9"/> and these were above all a response to the advertising needs <pause dur="0.5"/> # of the <pause dur="0.3"/> century's developing commerce and industry <pause dur="0.4"/> and you remember in our second lecture we talked about <pause dur="0.2"/> the developments # <pause dur="1.1"/> for advertising that came out of the increased production <pause dur="0.2"/> general # industrial production <pause dur="0.4"/> following the industrial revolution <pause dur="1.6"/> so what we're trying to # <pause dur="0.8"/> achieve today # in terms of these letter forms <pause dur="0.4"/> is looking at approximately <pause dur="0.4"/> when and <pause dur="0.2"/> why they developed <pause dur="1.1"/> i'll talk a little bit about <pause dur="0.4"/> the nature of the evidence 
that we have concerning <pause dur="0.4"/> these # display type letter # type forms <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> which <pause dur="0.3"/> amount to what are known as specimens <pause dur="0.2"/> type specimens # <pause dur="0.2"/> type specimens on the board there <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> that come <pause dur="0.4"/> they're issued by the type founders and then # our other <pause dur="0.4"/> principal source of evidence for these <pause dur="0.2"/> display letter forms <pause dur="0.4"/> is the examples of <pause dur="0.3"/> the printed artefacts themselves so we're actually looking at the letter forms <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> in use <pause dur="1.8"/> so we're going to # # learn the names of the five <pause dur="0.3"/> # basic varieties and you'll if you look at your handout <pause dur="0.4"/> you'll see that the names <pause dur="0.9"/> # are listed there <pause dur="0.8"/> and # <pause dur="0.4"/> i'm going to show you in a little bit <pause dur="0.2"/> # the <pause dur="0.6"/> and i'll allow you time to sketch <pause dur="0.2"/> the principal characteristics of these five basic categories <pause dur="2.2"/> <trunc>wa</trunc> <trunc>no</trunc> we'll # discuss a little bit how these <pause dur="0.6"/> display <pause dur="0.2"/> types <pause dur="0.2"/> relate <pause dur="0.2"/> to book types <pause dur="0.3"/> and you'll see on the board i've written <pause dur="0.3"/> display types versus book types <pause dur="0.4"/> by which i mean there are <pause dur="0.2"/> these are <pause dur="0.2"/> two <pause dur="0.4"/> categories of the use of types <pause dur="0.5"/> and they have very strong implications <pause dur="0.2"/> for what those types look 
like <pause dur="0.3"/> the <trunc>ty</trunc> types used for books <pause dur="0.3"/> # have an entirely different characteristic <pause dur="0.2"/> character and nature <pause dur="0.5"/> from the types that are used <pause dur="0.3"/> for display purposes <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> which <pause dur="0.2"/> you might in this case <pause dur="0.2"/> equate to advertising # purposes <pause dur="1.4"/> # <pause dur="1.0"/> some of the terminology for the discussion of types goes back <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> to the fifteenth century <pause dur="0.3"/> and relates a little bit <pause dur="0.2"/> to what we talked about last term <pause dur="2.6"/> all right now let's move to the topic of display types themselves <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> there were <pause dur="0.8"/> # a great many types designed for and used more or less <pause dur="0.2"/> only for <pause dur="0.2"/> books <pause dur="1.1"/> those are what i'm calling here book types <pause dur="0.7"/> the others <pause dur="0.4"/> are used for <pause dur="0.3"/> # wider purposes <pause dur="0.4"/> especially for things <pause dur="0.3"/> that are meant to be posted up and seen from a distance <pause dur="0.5"/> and these are the ones that we refer to a lot on this under this general heading of heading called <pause dur="0.5"/> display types <pause dur="2.6"/> now we also have a few display functions within books <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.9"/> because we use the same term <pause dur="0.2"/> when we're talking about headings <pause dur="0.3"/> and <pause dur="0.3"/> types that are just used for for titles <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> it's a bit confusing to 
have the same term display <pause dur="1.2"/> for both <pause dur="0.7"/> # in both fields but nevertheless we have to live with it <pause dur="1.1"/> yeah there are some <pause dur="0.9"/> two handouts one relates to your <pause dur="0.9"/> essays and the other relates to the # <pause dur="1.6"/> to today's work <pause dur="0.5"/> and there's also the # <pause dur="1.5"/> attendance sheet please <pause dur="5.1"/> in the nineteenth century <pause dur="1.1"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> it was the display types <pause dur="0.2"/> # that underwent the more interesting developments when we compare these two category of the use of that type <pause dur="0.8"/> and it's it's generally understood that book types <pause dur="0.4"/> the ones used for books were more or less in the doldrums <pause dur="0.2"/> much less interesting in terms <pause dur="0.4"/> of their developments <pause dur="1.8"/> so today we're looking at the <pause dur="0.2"/> the category of of of type that had its # <pause dur="0.4"/> an <trunc>e</trunc> an explosion of sorts in the nineteenth century <pause dur="1.4"/> but we need to start as usual a little bit before the nineteenth century <pause dur="0.5"/> # because for most of the eighteenth century <pause dur="0.5"/> # there were no special types <pause dur="0.2"/> that were designed for display purposes <pause dur="1.1"/> instead <pause dur="0.7"/> what was used were the largest available book types <pause dur="1.7"/> and these only got to approximately two 
centimetres in height <pause dur="1.2"/> that's what's referred to # <pause dur="0.5"/> in <pause dur="0.3"/> in type as a two-line pica <pause dur="2.3"/> at the in the later eighteenth century though we do have the beginnings <pause dur="0.3"/> of special design <pause dur="0.3"/> for <trunc>disla</trunc> display purposes <pause dur="0.9"/> in the seventeen-sixties <pause dur="0.7"/> the French # <pause dur="1.2"/> type founding family known as the Fourniers <pause dur="0.7"/> developed letters that <pause dur="0.3"/> that had <pause dur="0.5"/> were floriated and floriated letters <pause dur="0.4"/> # it's put up on the board <pause dur="0.6"/> i by floriated i mean that that any decoration <pause dur="0.6"/> took the form of # flowers <pause dur="0.4"/> floral patterns <pause dur="1.6"/> and in the seventeen-eighties <pause dur="0.5"/> # at least two English type founders # William Caslon and and the <pause dur="0.8"/> # type founder Fry <pause dur="0.8"/> developed simple # <pause dur="0.3"/> open what were known as open types <pause dur="0.3"/> or alternatively in-line <pause dur="0.4"/> and i'm going to show you one # <trunc>i</trunc> on a slide just now <pause dur="0.4"/> # they're characteristic of these open or in-line and you'll see i've got in-line on the board in quotation marks because <pause dur="0.3"/> that was what they called it <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> was a letter that had a white line engraved down the thick strokes <pause dur="0.4"/> now i want to to show you this first # <pause dur="0.3"/> late eighteenth century in-line <pause dur="0.2"/> and i have to # <pause dur="0.6"/> turn the projector on <pause dur="0.5"/> clumsy <pause dur="6.5"/><kinesic desc="turns on overhead projector showing transparency" iterated="n"/> 
and i'm going to have to turn off <pause dur="0.5"/> some of the lights i hope you'll be able to # <pause dur="1.3"/> see well enough to <pause dur="0.2"/><event desc="turns off lights" iterated="n"/> sketch <pause dur="1.9"/> just maybe <pause dur="1.5"/><vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/><pause dur="4.3"/> all right these are the letters that were referred to as in-line <pause dur="0.6"/> # and the the line they're referring to is the white line that runs down <pause dur="0.4"/> the thick <pause dur="0.8"/> # thicker portions of the letters <pause dur="1.7"/> and you'll see they came in a variety of sizes there <pause dur="0.5"/> # all the way up to <pause dur="0.4"/> # what is listed there as five-line <pause dur="0.2"/> pica <pause dur="0.2"/> which is only # two centimetres high <pause dur="3.1"/> # <pause dur="1.7"/> and a variety of English printers began to use these large letters for posters <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="1.9"/> as early as seventeen-sixty-five we have we have Thomas Cottrell <pause dur="0.3"/> using letters that are about two inches high <pause dur="3.7"/><kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="10"/> and i'm going to show you a <pause dur="0.2"/> a slide <pause dur="0.4"/> of just rather large letters by Thomas Cottrell <pause dur="4.3"/> these are are are Thomas Cottrell's # and i want you not to be # <pause dur="0.2"/> misled by the slide because that does enlarge it greatly <pause dur="0.4"/> this is the actual size <pause dur="0.8"/> and i think even at at the back of the room you should be able to read that just but you see 
there's <pause dur="0.3"/> quite a difference <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="1.6"/> so this is the largest late eighteenth century # <pause dur="1.0"/> display face that we're # <trunc>ha</trunc> know about <pause dur="4.2"/> oh i've got my technology and your technology all <pause dur="1.1"/> intertwined here </u><pause dur="1.2"/> <u who="om0186" trans="pause"> <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/></u><pause dur="1.0"/> <u who="nf0184" trans="pause"> oh <pause dur="0.3"/> if you </u><u who="om0186" trans="overlap"> right <pause dur="0.3"/> yeah <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/></u><u who="nf0184" trans="overlap"> just <pause dur="0.2"/> yeah <pause dur="1.2"/> okay <pause dur="0.4"/> that's good <gap reason="inaudible" extent="5 secs"/><pause dur="8.6"/> we were so busy setting up his technology we didn't get mine sorted <pause dur="0.8"/> okay <pause dur="0.9"/> <shift feature="pitch" new="high"/>aagh <shift feature="pitch" new="normal"/><pause dur="7.9"/> now the real change in display faces came in the first # two decades of the nineteenth century <pause dur="1.4"/> we already mentioned that basically it's the needs of the advertising industry <pause dur="0.5"/> # that that led to this development for types that <pause dur="0.4"/> come under the phrase eye-catching <pause dur="1.3"/> now if you read Professor Twyman and it is his # <pause dur="0.3"/> his chapter five that covers # <pause dur="0.2"/> display lettering <pause dur="0.2"/> <vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.4"/> he says that they # he finds no <pause dur="0.9"/> <trunc>s</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> satisfactory single explanation for why all of a sudden there was this great development in in display types <pause dur="0.9"/> he points to as i mentioned briefly the growth of trade <pause dur="0.2"/><vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/> and then the need <pause dur="0.6"/> the growing need for # competitive advertising <pause dur="1.3"/> he points to the fact that 
certain # <pause dur="0.4"/> new generations of of potential purchasers <pause dur="0.3"/> were becoming at least partially literate <pause dur="0.8"/> # and he # talks about a number of <pause dur="0.2"/> technical developments <pause dur="0.9"/> some of which we've already discussed this term <pause dur="0.4"/> for instance <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> the development that related to the cost of paper so paper prices were going down <pause dur="0.6"/> # we've already we've talked earlier about <pause dur="0.3"/> the beginnings of the use of iron presses <pause dur="0.2"/> and the fact that # these could print <pause dur="0.3"/> a larger area of dense <pause dur="0.2"/> black type <pause dur="0.3"/> than earlier <pause dur="0.3"/> because these # <pause dur="1.0"/> these new faces didn't needed somewhat more # <pause dur="0.2"/> power in the machines <pause dur="1.7"/> likewise the origins of the designs <pause dur="0.2"/> # are not <pause dur="0.2"/> wholly <pause dur="0.4"/> understood <pause dur="0.6"/> some of them may have come out of the # profession of sign writing <pause dur="0.6"/> # the especially <pause dur="0.2"/> the signs that were made for for shops <pause dur="0.3"/> on a high street <pause dur="1.0"/> and it is also possible that the # wood engravers <pause dur="1.5"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> and <pause dur="0.7"/> the work that they were doing as as wood engraved lettering <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> was part of the inspiration <pause dur="2.1"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> and here i show you # a slide of a lottery bill <pause dur="0.4"/> # printed in eighteen-ten <pause dur="4.4"/> # which 
has the upper and lower words <pause dur="0.3"/> # done # <pause dur="0.2"/> by a wood engraver <pause dur="4.5"/> and you can see that the letters are placed on on banners or what's known as as as cartouches <pause dur="0.3"/> these are the sort of # panel that it's on <pause dur="0.4"/> and # they're <trunc>v</trunc> they're very <pause dur="0.4"/> very <pause dur="0.7"/> broad <pause dur="0.5"/> they have # # a shading that suggests <pause dur="0.3"/> three-dimensionality <pause dur="0.4"/> both # <trunc>u</trunc> upper and lower <pause dur="0.3"/> and these # at # at the bottom # have a Gothic <pause dur="0.2"/> type inspiration <pause dur="0.4"/> whereas at <trunc>a</trunc> at the top <pause dur="0.2"/> # the <pause dur="0.2"/> inspiration is much more # <pause dur="0.5"/> # Roman <pause dur="4.1"/> i said i was going to discuss what our sources of evidence are for these these <pause dur="0.3"/> types of the nineteenth century <pause dur="2.2"/> we know that certain type founders issued <pause dur="0.4"/> specimen sheets that are referred to as type specimens <pause dur="1.5"/> but <pause dur="0.2"/> unfortunately as a source of evidence the type specimen # <pause dur="1.6"/> is is difficult to interpret <pause dur="0.3"/> by which i mean we don't always have the very earliest ones <pause dur="0.3"/> type specimens are issued by the makers of these types <pause dur="0.3"/> in order to sell the types <pause dur="1.8"/> # they were showing off essentially their wares <pause dur="0.3"/> and so by nature 
these these type specimens were ephemeral <trunc>sh</trunc> they intended to have <pause dur="0.3"/> a short life their purpose wasn't to <trunc>d</trunc> document <pause dur="0.3"/> their <trunc>pur</trunc> purpose was to sell <pause dur="2.1"/> so # <pause dur="0.5"/> we can only go by the earliest surviving ones we have # to help us date the beginnings of this process <pause dur="0.6"/> and there are very good collections of type specimens for instance at # the Saint Bride Printing Library <pause dur="0.9"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> and occasionally <pause dur="0.3"/> body academic bodies like the # Printing Historical Society <pause dur="0.3"/> will issue facsimiles <pause dur="0.5"/> and they help in sorting out <pause dur="0.4"/> # which <pause dur="0.2"/> type founders started to issue these # and when <pause dur="1.7"/> the the other # <pause dur="0.3"/> main source <pause dur="0.4"/> of evidence is the printed objects themselves <pause dur="1.3"/> but again <pause dur="0.2"/> these were often very short-lived <pause dur="0.4"/> printed for # <pause dur="0.5"/> purposes # of advertising individual # events or objects <pause dur="0.7"/> very often they're not dated <pause dur="0.3"/> and <pause dur="0.4"/> # it's highly possible <pause dur="0.3"/> that in the cases of a large proportion of them <pause dur="0.3"/> they've just disappeared altogether <pause dur="0.3"/> so again <pause dur="0.2"/> as far as records go <pause dur="0.2"/> there it weren't it's not very complete <pause dur="0.9"/> but # the 
collecting of this sort of short-lived material which is known as ephemera <pause dur="0.6"/> # is one of the justifications for our <pause dur="0.3"/> departmental Ephemera Studies Centre <pause dur="0.2"/> here that was # founded about five years ago <pause dur="0.6"/><vocal desc="sniff" iterated="n"/><pause dur="1.0"/> all that we know for certain <pause dur="0.3"/> is that by about eighteen-ten <pause dur="0.5"/> large display types <pause dur="0.3"/> began to appear in the type specimens <pause dur="0.4"/> # that do still exist <pause dur="0.6"/> and the first # good ranges # <pause dur="0.2"/> turn up in a type specimen dated eighteen-fifteen <pause dur="0.5"/> and this is the eighteen-fifteen <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> type specimen <pause dur="1.1"/> or # this is <pause dur="0.3"/> part of the type <trunc>spe</trunc> specimen this is <pause dur="0.4"/> this is not actually a type specimen itself because you see <pause dur="0.2"/> <trunc>i</trunc> it's been used as as figures <trunc>ins</trunc> inside a book but it's from a type <trunc>spe</trunc> specimen <pause dur="0.5"/> from a founder known as Figgins the he's got his put his own name in the second <trunc>m</trunc> <trunc>ma</trunc> big line down <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="3.9"/> and he had this # reasonably wide range of different styles <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.9"/> which i'll go into in some detail <pause dur="0.4"/> in a minute <pause dur="4.6"/> now i want to move on to the five basic categories which are on your handout <pause dur="3.3"/> 
# <pause dur="0.8"/> and these were all developed in the first <pause dur="0.2"/> first half of the nineteenth century <pause dur="0.3"/> and we'll start with <pause dur="0.5"/> # fat face because that's the earliest <pause dur="4.0"/> and here <pause dur="0.5"/> # is an example of of of a <pause dur="0.4"/> a fat face <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="2.8"/> display type <pause dur="1.7"/> this one # came again from # <pause dur="0.3"/> eighteen-fifteen <pause dur="0.9"/> and you'll notice that it is <pause dur="2.1"/> fairly aptly named <pause dur="0.3"/> in that it is an extremely <pause dur="0.3"/> fat face <pause dur="0.5"/> now the fat faces <pause dur="0.2"/> were based on a book type <pause dur="0.4"/> known as modern face <pause dur="0.4"/> and i've got modern face on the board over there <pause dur="0.4"/> # in quotation marks because <pause dur="0.3"/> modern face is not just a <pause dur="0.9"/> a general term but it's a specific term <pause dur="2.4"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> and it <pause dur="0.3"/> it relates to <pause dur="1.2"/> # various characteristics that i'll point out to you now first of all <pause dur="0.2"/> a fat face <pause dur="0.2"/> has <pause dur="0.4"/> a very strong vertical contrast <pause dur="1.1"/> in other words <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> the main <pause dur="0.3"/> lines as as you look at it are are vertical <pause dur="0.9"/> as opposed to <trunc>s</trunc> <trunc>fi</trunc> earlier faces <pause dur="0.3"/> which had # an oblique <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> angle of emphasis <pause dur="0.2"/> so that if you had any fattening <pause dur="0.3"/> it you would be more inclined to put an oblique line through it than a vertical line <pause dur="0.5"/> the second characteristic general 
characteristic of modern face <pause dur="0.6"/> is is that you have what's <pause dur="0.4"/> referred to as an abrupt <pause dur="0.4"/> transition between <pause dur="0.2"/> the thin points and the thick points <pause dur="0.5"/> goes it's not <pause dur="0.2"/> it's not smoothed out it's very abrupt <pause dur="0.9"/> now what happens in the fat face <pause dur="0.3"/> is that they just exaggerate <pause dur="0.6"/> they exaggerate the difference between the thins and the thicks <pause dur="1.2"/> so so much so that the thicks <pause dur="0.4"/> the get almost as almost as wide as a third <pause dur="0.3"/> of the height of the # of the letter <pause dur="2.1"/> and it also # the fat faces retain this <pause dur="0.4"/> this verticality in the in the design <pause dur="3.6"/> now and <pause dur="0.3"/> when i talk about modern face type <pause dur="0.2"/> i'm referring to the to the book types <pause dur="0.2"/> so there there are book type designs underlying these <pause dur="0.2"/> display <pause dur="0.3"/> and i'll now show you another <pause dur="1.4"/> fat face <pause dur="0.9"/> which again <pause dur="0.8"/> can see <pause dur="0.2"/> such <pause dur="0.2"/> very <pause dur="0.3"/> strong contrasts between the the thinnest and the thickest <pause dur="0.3"/> and this one <pause dur="0.3"/> probably makes # the <pause dur="0.3"/> the overall vertical emphasis # even stronger <pause dur="11.7"/> now we think that these may have been originated by a # <pause dur="0.3"/> type founder named Robert Thorne <pause dur="0.5"/> but by about 
eighteen-twenty <pause dur="0.3"/> most other type founders # at work <pause dur="0.3"/> were offering <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="1.2"/> fat faces <pause dur="1.1"/> and there are important variations # on fat face <pause dur="4.5"/> for instance there was a Gothic <pause dur="0.3"/> fat face based <trunc>o</trunc> on the types <pause dur="0.5"/> # the black letter types <pause dur="0.3"/> that come # down from the fifteenth century <pause dur="3.2"/> and then another variation <trunc>wa</trunc> on the fat face was to add <pause dur="0.6"/> shading <pause dur="1.1"/> so that you have this exaggerated <trunc>a</trunc> area below and to the right <pause dur="0.4"/> to give a a suggestion of <trunc>three-dimensiali</trunc> <pause dur="0.8"/> three-dimensionality <pause dur="1.0"/><vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/><pause dur="5.0"/> now i'm going to move on to the second major category on your handout and that is <pause dur="0.4"/> the one that's called the Egyptian <pause dur="1.7"/> # never mind # that the # <pause dur="1.0"/> the heading here refers to it as antique <pause dur="0.6"/> the # <pause dur="1.7"/> type founders of the time had no # reason not to give each one of these types their own name <pause dur="1.3"/> # so the # terminology <pause dur="0.4"/> of these <pause dur="0.2"/> these different types <pause dur="0.4"/> is # <pause dur="0.2"/> a nightmare <pause dur="0.7"/> # what i'm using is the <pause dur="0.8"/> categories that have been set up by Professor Twyman in his chapter <pause dur="0.3"/> and # Nicolette Gray <pause dur="0.3"/> in her work on nineteenth century ornamented 
types and title pages <pause dur="0.5"/> so the main characteristic <pause dur="1.1"/> of Egyptian <pause dur="0.6"/> was that <pause dur="0.2"/> all of the lines including the serifs <pause dur="1.3"/> <trunc>ha</trunc> are more or less the same thickness <pause dur="1.2"/> so <trunc>y</trunc> you have the the main stroke and the serifs i mean in this in this one on the <pause dur="0.2"/> on the screen at the moment <pause dur="0.5"/> the serifs are a little bit less fat than the i mean i've never not measured them but i they are less fat <pause dur="0.3"/> nevertheless you have <pause dur="0.2"/> the basic overall effect <pause dur="0.2"/> is that all lines are <pause dur="0.2"/> of equal <pause dur="0.3"/> or nearly equal weight <pause dur="2.2"/> # and this one <pause dur="1.7"/> was for <trunc>fro</trunc> is from Figgins' type specimen of eighteen-seventeen <pause dur="0.7"/> this was a very successful display face <pause dur="0.6"/> and that's because it produced a very dark and dense letter <pause dur="0.5"/> which still remained easy to read at a distance <pause dur="2.6"/> when it first appeared in eighteen-seventeen it was only in <pause dur="0.2"/> the capitals <pause dur="0.6"/> but # <pause dur="0.3"/> from <pause dur="0.2"/> in by the eighteen-twenties we were already having upper case and lower case capitals and small letters <pause dur="1.0"/> and this <pause dur="0.3"/> <trunc>e</trunc> Egyptian along with the fat face these are the two most # <pause dur="0.8"/> popular <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> display 
types <pause dur="3.7"/> the other three that i'm going to discuss next <trunc>l</trunc> in in the five basic <pause dur="0.3"/> were somewhat less <pause dur="0.2"/> widely used <pause dur="0.2"/> especially before <pause dur="0.2"/> about eighteen-thirty <pause dur="1.6"/> so next move on to the third one on your handout which is the sans serif <pause dur="1.4"/> in in this particular slide i'm only talking about # <pause dur="0.4"/> the line here <pause dur="0.5"/> which # you'll see is very helpfully referred to in this one as Egyptian <pause dur="0.5"/> but we have now come to call this one # <pause dur="0.9"/> sans serif <pause dur="0.5"/> now the <trunc>w</trunc> <trunc>de</trunc> derivation of the term sans serif <pause dur="0.5"/> # simply means <pause dur="0.2"/> without <pause dur="0.2"/> serifs <pause dur="0.6"/> sans means without so <pause dur="0.3"/> the sans serif <pause dur="2.2"/> which # <pause dur="0.2"/> as you see here <pause dur="0.2"/> # in this case was # originally called either Egyptian or sometimes it's called antique <pause dur="2.0"/> # <pause dur="1.6"/> this became the ancestor <pause dur="0.6"/> # of what was the the greatest innovation in type design of the nineteenth century and that is the <pause dur="0.5"/> sans serif book type <pause dur="2.3"/> <trunc>i</trunc> <pause dur="0.3"/> its <trunc>des</trunc> design <pause dur="1.3"/> was <pause dur="1.0"/> intended <pause dur="0.7"/> to capture the spirit of the very earliest Roman letter forms <pause dur="0.8"/> and it was # that's why some of the the people who <pause dur="0.5"/> who <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="2.2"/> issued this as a 
type referred to it as antique because it was meant to be <pause dur="0.6"/> antique in inspiration <pause dur="1.7"/> and we another term we use for sans serif <pause dur="0.4"/> is that it's monoline in other words <pause dur="0.5"/> all of the line one size line <pause dur="1.5"/> i mean the # <pause dur="1.7"/> Egyptian that i just showed you in the previous slide <pause dur="0.4"/> had more or less one side <pause dur="0.2"/> # size line but it did have serifs <pause dur="1.6"/> so this one has no <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="2.7"/> no serifs <pause dur="0.3"/> it first appeared in # an eighteen-nineteen type specimen <pause dur="0.9"/> # where it was labelled Egyptian <pause dur="2.2"/> and then it disappears and it doesn't reappear until the eighteen-thirties when it was renamed by Figgins as sans serif <pause dur="1.7"/> and by yet another type founder # <pause dur="0.6"/> renamed it grotesque <pause dur="0.9"/> and it's grotesque <pause dur="0.2"/> not in that it's # full of ornate design because in fact it's rather austere <pause dur="0.4"/> but because it was found in <pause dur="0.5"/> in grottoes <pause dur="1.2"/> which had <pause dur="0.2"/> early <pause dur="0.8"/> Christian <pause dur="0.4"/> inscriptions that were very <pause dur="0.3"/> simple <pause dur="0.4"/> in <pause dur="0.2"/> grottoes so it got <trunc>an</trunc> another name was grotesque <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="1.0"/> i i can't even apologize for these difference in terminologies we just have to live with the fact 
that every time the type founders <pause dur="0.4"/> came out with <pause dur="0.2"/> what they thought was something new <pause dur="0.2"/> they gave it another name <pause dur="0.3"/> and it's just luck i mean they had no responsibility to those of us <pause dur="0.4"/> who come along later and look at it and try to <pause dur="0.4"/> understand what's going on and categorize them and have to just live with the fact that they used the same names <pause dur="0.5"/> # for very different looking letter forms <pause dur="1.2"/> 
i'll now go on to one that that doesn't have very many different names and that's the Tuscan it's the fourth one on your list <pause dur="2.1"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> but it's not the one that's on the screen <pause dur="0.3"/> it's on i have to put this on the overhead <pause dur="10.6"/><kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="4"/> the Tuscan <pause dur="3.8"/> has a different <trunc>characterisci</trunc> <pause dur="0.5"/> characteristic and that is <pause dur="0.4"/> that when it you come to the bottom of of the downstroke <pause dur="0.2"/> the serifs curl you can see how they curl in <pause dur="0.4"/> in opposite directions <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> this one also happens to be shaded and so i'm i'm i'm asking you at this point <pause dur="0.3"/> to ignore the shading and just look at the main downstroke <pause dur="0.3"/> and you'll see that there is a curl to the <pause dur="0.2"/> 
left a curl to the right and then <pause dur="0.3"/> at the top of the <trunc>d</trunc> # the <trunc>downs</trunc> # # the stroke <pause dur="0.4"/> is <trunc>an</trunc> another pair of curls <pause dur="0.9"/> # and that is what characterizes # the the Tuscan <pause dur="1.4"/> i'm going to <pause dur="1.4"/> show you another one <pause dur="0.4"/> but i'll have to take the the the projector back <pause dur="14.5"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="y" dur="10"/> right <pause dur="0.4"/> the Vincent Figgins second line again is a Tuscan <pause dur="0.5"/> and there i'll get although this too <pause dur="0.2"/> has further ornamentation on <pause dur="0.3"/> the surface of especially the downstrokes <pause dur="0.2"/> you'll see when the downstroke gets to the line <pause dur="0.4"/> # it has curls in <trunc>ei</trunc> in either direction <pause dur="0.3"/> and we sometimes refer to that as <pause dur="0.6"/> as <pause dur="0.3"/><vocal desc="laugh" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.5"/> bifurcated <pause dur="0.2"/> i know you'll love this one <pause dur="11.8"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="9"/> it simply means that they're split <pause dur="2.0"/> so you refer to the # <pause dur="1.2"/> decoration as split <pause dur="2.3"/> now <pause dur="4.7"/> you've already seen that these Tuscans can go on to be # <pause dur="1.2"/> further decorated and and we'll talk about that in a minute <pause dur="1.8"/> but now i <trunc>wa</trunc> i'm going to move on to the fifth and last of these basic categories <kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="y" dur="10"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> for that i have to go forward again <pause dur="1.0"/> and that's the one that's called 
Italian <pause dur="5.3"/> right now with the Italian <pause dur="2.2"/> which we think actually originated in France <pause dur="0.2"/> so why it's called Italian i don't know again <pause dur="0.4"/> the letter in this case <pause dur="0.2"/> reverses # our expectations about which parts of the letter are going to be thick and which are going to be thin <pause dur="0.8"/> so that you have these huge <pause dur="0.3"/> serifs <pause dur="0.4"/> and very thin <pause dur="0.3"/> # vertical strokes in this case <pause dur="0.6"/> so # a <pause dur="0.2"/> an easy one for you to sketch perhaps <pause dur="0.3"/> is the I <pause dur="2.6"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> and it looks it looks quite <pause dur="0.5"/> bizarre and almost # <pause dur="1.5"/> perverse <pause dur="2.5"/> and this first came to England in the specimen of # in a specimen of eighteen-twenty-one <pause dur="2.2"/> now the growth of all these <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="1.2"/> was quite fast <pause dur="0.3"/> but they're not used by all printers <pause dur="1.8"/> # most traditional printers were unhappy to see these used within books <pause dur="1.8"/> they were considered inappropriate for books <pause dur="0.4"/> but they were certainly used for posters <pause dur="0.5"/> # and many <pause dur="2.3"/> # would have had their <trunc>m</trunc> their greatest impact <pause dur="1.1"/> on the posters that are printed in the provinces at first <pause dur="2.1"/> # <pause dur="2.3"/> some of the smaller sizes of these types were # <trunc>m</trunc> <pause dur="0.5"/> cast in metal <pause dur="0.4"/> but the 
large ones <pause dur="0.3"/> were often # <pause dur="0.8"/> done in wood and i have three examples <pause dur="0.4"/> of <pause dur="0.5"/> display letters <pause dur="0.3"/> of the nineteenth century here <pause dur="0.3"/> from the department has very large collections <pause dur="0.4"/> # of display letters that you may have noticed <pause dur="0.3"/> now i'd like you # i want to to pass these around for you just to to see <pause dur="0.6"/> they are they are these all these three are <pause dur="0.2"/> in made of wood <pause dur="1.0"/> sorry <pause dur="6.6"/><vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/><pause dur="14.4"/> and while that's going around i'll show you <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> one of the <pause dur="0.2"/> provincial posters <pause dur="1.0"/> that would be making use of <pause dur="0.9"/> this kind of display letter <pause dur="1.4"/> this one is dated # eighteen-thirty-one and you see at the top <pause dur="0.5"/> we have a a fat face <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.9"/> the second line down is <pause dur="0.3"/> is a fat face but italic <pause dur="0.4"/> with <pause dur="0.2"/> an in-line in other words that white line that <trunc>come</trunc> decoration that comes down <pause dur="0.5"/> and <pause dur="2.3"/> here we have a fat face that's been shadowed to give it a three-dimensional look <pause dur="0.4"/> and the surfaces <pause dur="0.3"/> have been # <pause dur="1.8"/> have been decorated <pause dur="3.9"/> so that is a typical # <trunc>n</trunc> <pause dur="1.0"/> nineteenth century <pause dur="0.2"/> poster making use of some of the <pause dur="0.3"/> display faces that we've been discussing so far <pause dur="9.3"/> in eighteen-twenty-seven 
there was a a a technical development that led to some new styles <pause dur="0.5"/> # a machine known as a as a a routing machine a mechanical routing machine was developed invented in America <pause dur="0.6"/> and it facilitated the making of large quantities of these letters <pause dur="1.6"/> although in some cases we find that the routing machine itself <pause dur="0.4"/> affected the shapes of the letters and # i'll show you one example of this <pause dur="0.9"/> general phenomenon <pause dur="0.3"/> where the <pause dur="1.2"/> oops <pause dur="5.4"/> this is a type specimen showing the different sizes of <pause dur="0.3"/> a letter <pause dur="0.4"/> where the <pause dur="0.4"/> the cutting implement of the router <pause dur="0.3"/> has this <pause dur="0.2"/> rounded shape <pause dur="0.5"/> on its blade and so <pause dur="0.2"/> that in this particular case <pause dur="0.3"/> the shape <pause dur="0.3"/> that naturally developed by this new tool <pause dur="0.3"/> has been built into the design of the letter <pause dur="10.0"/> the eighteen-thirties and forties saw a great deal more designs some of them were three-dimensional some of them were <pause dur="0.4"/> what's known as reversed out that's where <pause dur="0.2"/> instead of the normal black letter <pause dur="0.4"/> you got # a black background and the <pause dur="0.2"/> letter is reversed out in white <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> from this black 
background <pause dur="0.6"/> a great deal of ornamentation you've already seen a little bit of it <pause dur="0.4"/> # and then the letters started to be <pause dur="0.3"/> either # elongated <pause dur="0.3"/> or perhaps <pause dur="0.3"/> <trunc>m</trunc> turned into rustic letters <pause dur="0.9"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> and here's an example <pause dur="0.4"/> # of a Figgins <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="3.7"/> type specimen of eighteen-fifty <pause dur="0.6"/> so that you see up the top you've got <trunc>a</trunc> an Egyptian that is put at a slant <pause dur="0.4"/> and # given a three-dimensionality <pause dur="0.4"/> you've got # a a fat face # Gothic <pause dur="0.4"/> you've got a reversed out <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> Egyptian <pause dur="0.6"/> another # <pause dur="2.2"/> # oh <pause dur="1.2"/> Egyptian <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> turned on an angle and # with the opposite of the word virtue but made three-dimensional again <pause dur="4.9"/> # an Egyptian # that # has been reversed out <pause dur="0.2"/> or <pause dur="0.2"/> outlined depending on how you <pause dur="0.3"/> how you want to # <pause dur="1.3"/> look at it <pause dur="0.4"/> # then Gothic <pause dur="1.1"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> down at the bottom <pause dur="0.3"/> our our classic <pause dur="0.2"/> Tuscan <pause dur="0.4"/> with ornamentation <trunc>o</trunc> on the surface <pause dur="6.9"/> and the eighteen-forties saw yet # another development <pause dur="0.6"/> which is known <trunc>a</trunc> <trunc>a</trunc> as the Clarendon <pause dur="1.5"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> oh <pause dur="0.9"/> oh sorry <pause dur="2.4"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/><vocal desc="throat" iterated="n"/> i've got this slightly out of order in in fact in the this this specimen <pause dur="0.3"/> shows a variety of sizes of sans of sans

well first i just <pause dur="0.4"/> mention some of the # <pause dur="0.4"/> influences behind these new letter forms <pause dur="1.8"/> # we know that there was # for instance a a <trunc>g</trunc> <pause dur="0.4"/> a growing interest <trunc>i</trunc> in the Middle Ages <pause dur="0.7"/> in the nineteenth century <pause dur="0.3"/> one of the reasons that they picked off the # Gothic or black letter <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="2.1"/> shapes that had been around since the fifteenth century <pause dur="0.3"/> and we will see # when we # in the lecture on on coloured printing <pause dur="0.4"/> # how some of the interest in the Middle Ages # <pause dur="0.5"/> #  manifested itself <pause dur="0.4"/> there were also # <pause dur="0.3"/> a number of excavations <trunc>go</trunc> that had gone on in the in the eighteenth century <pause dur="0.4"/> that led to interests in in Rome # and and antiquity <pause dur="1.4"/> there were # <pause dur="0.2"/> excavations <pause dur="0.2"/> in Rome itself and in Herculaneum <pause dur="1.4"/> there was <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> interest in travel <pause dur="0.3"/> and and # <trunc>arc</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> other archaeological <pause dur="1.3"/> # expeditions <pause dur="0.9"/> that led us <trunc>mo</trunc> a greater familiarity with exotic languages <pause dur="1.0"/> for instance the Rosetta Stone was <trunc>d</trunc> # <pause dur="0.4"/> discovered around # <trunc>s</trunc> in seventeen-ninety-nine <pause dur="1.0"/> so # there were <pause dur="0.2"/> general influences from outside that were coming in <pause dur="1.1"/> and 
that # the when they <pause dur="0.8"/> type founders did pick names like Egyptian <pause dur="0.4"/> or antique <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> it <pause dur="0.5"/> suggests <pause dur="0.3"/> that they were responding to some of these # outside influences <pause dur="1.2"/> a bit later in the century <pause dur="0.5"/> we find that there <trunc>m</trunc> <pause dur="0.3"/> may have been influence from the <pause dur="0.3"/> # flexibility <pause dur="0.2"/> that the lithographic <pause dur="0.3"/> printers # were developing <pause dur="1.8"/> and that the that their ability to # draw anything they liked <pause dur="0.4"/> in terms of shape # <pause dur="0.6"/> on to the lithographic stone <pause dur="0.3"/> was <pause dur="0.3"/> beginning to work backwards and have have effects on <pause dur="0.3"/> these much more rigid letter forms <pause dur="0.2"/> that are cast in metal or cut in wood <pause dur="3.4"/> # <pause dur="2.0"/> and i refer you in this case to some of the discussions in <pause dur="0.2"/> # Professor Twyman's book <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.9"/> which is # chapter five <pause dur="0.6"/> now i want <pause dur="0.2"/> just to finish off by showing you <pause dur="0.5"/> some of the # exuberant <pause dur="1.0"/> designs of the late <pause dur="0.2"/> nineteenth century and their use as posters <pause dur="1.0"/> # <pause dur="1.0"/> could i ask you to turn the <pause dur="0.3"/> projector off please <pause dur="1.8"/> first i'll start with some letter forms that were <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> probably <pause dur="0.5"/> <trunc>a</trunc> as developed as you could get # <pause dur="0.8"/> in terms of the <pause dur="0.2"/> # exploitation of the

in in this case on on <trunc>c</trunc> in a copper plate engraving <pause dur="0.4"/> you can see well <pause dur="0.2"/> i'm i'm not going to stand here and name them all to you but you can see Gothics <pause dur="0.4"/> you can see Tuscans <pause dur="0.4"/> you can see <pause dur="0.3"/> sans serifs <pause dur="0.2"/> fat faces <pause dur="1.1"/> really the lot <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> and and this is <pause dur="0.2"/> about # eighteen-seventy this particular <pause dur="0.2"/> image <pause dur="7.8"/> and finally <pause dur="0.3"/> even closer to the end of the century i'm sorry this <pause dur="0.6"/> this this new machine <pause dur="0.2"/> doesn't let you <pause dur="1.3"/> move it up <pause dur="3.9"/> but here you can see # a very <pause dur="1.3"/> interesting if odd way of of <pause dur="0.5"/> handling the letter form so that you're actually supposed to read the shadows that are cast by these individual <pause dur="0.5"/> # figures <pause dur="0.7"/> so the so word itself the letters themselves come up as as shadows <pause dur="0.9"/> and here # <pause dur="0.7"/> a Tuscan <pause dur="0.9"/> shadowed Tuscan <pause dur="0.3"/> up here <pause dur="0.5"/> letter forms that are made # out of # out of little people <pause dur="0.7"/> at the top # a reversed out # <pause dur="0.5"/> 
sans serif <pause dur="2.3"/> so by the end of the nineteenth century <pause dur="0.3"/> # the letter forms <pause dur="0.5"/> # were completely transformed from # what we had <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> started with <pause dur="0.3"/> which were merely <pause dur="0.2"/> large sizes of of book faces <pause dur="0.4"/> that were # used occasionally for display <pause dur="0.3"/> at the beginning # <pause dur="0.2"/> of the nineteenth century <pause dur="0.6"/> now # i would <pause dur="0.2"/> recommend that you follow this up by having a good look at # <pause dur="1.0"/> Twyman <pause dur="0.3"/> chapter five and oner <pause dur="0.4"/> # or another of the books by Nicolette Gray <pause dur="1.8"/> # next week we have the demonstrations <pause dur="0.2"/> # on the monotype machine and we talk about <pause dur="0.5"/> type casting <pause dur="0.3"/> type making and type casting <pause dur="0.3"/> and the combination of those two <pause dur="0.5"/> now if any of the rest of you haven't signed the register <pause dur="0.6"/> or <pause dur="1.7"/> filled out one of these cover sheets for your essay <pause dur="0.8"/> please do that <pause dur="1.3"/> that's it
