<u who="nm5500">now the issue about appearing in this in your lives video presentations and all sorts will figure prominently as the technology develops they will alter and you need to know how you look how you perform even if it's for a minute or two and from that we'll learn this is an equivalent of a screen test for some of you and how your face as you notice from recordings you sound very differently in a recording than you do or think you do similarly visually you'll learn how to do this and it'll be part of what kind of photographs you take of yourselves to put on your C-Vs promotional materials you'll learn all those sorts of things so you must be visually literate and this is a way of becoming visually literate because all of a sudden it's more serious than snaps from mother at home so this is a so this is a chance so i really strongly recommend you to sign up for the whole exercise and see what comes from it for your benefit more than anybody else's the fact that foreign students benefit it's really a nice thing but also for you okay good now today you know as we have a double double bill # not so much pro and con but one kind of analysis followed by another and this is a chance for you to talk if you're a little bit nervous remember what it's like to overcome the nervousness the same sort of thing that's standing up in front of you a camera's watching is just another pair of eyes breathe deeply speak slowly be yourselves it'll be wonderful and finally footnote we have seen the essays and by and large they are super so i'm very very pleased with your results some of you have done simply outstanding and almost everyone has done very well so # on that cheerful positive note smile for the camera alright please first we're going to begin with the topic Merry Christmas, Mr Lawrence group A Anglo-Japan relations in the film you have a slightly shorter than thirty minutes to entertain us and then we'll hand over to war crime and war responsibility and afterwards summary and conclusion we need some more chairs or are we going to stand <gap reason="inaudible" extent="3 sec"/> my goodness looks like a group of singers doesn't it alright who's leading off </u>

<u who="sm5501">we start don't we</u>

<u who="sm5502">yeah you</u>

<u who="sf5503"># Merry Christmas, Mr Lawrence was the 1983 adaptation of # the South African writer Laurens Van der Post's # book The Seed and The Sower the director Nagisa Oshima is also known for directing in the Empire of the Senses which was # based on a true story of an event which happened in the 1930's in Japan # that's that's probably the most famous of his other works aside from this film # the film contains many themes one of which is that of equilibrium reached and destroyed there seems to be a sort of uneasy contentment i i hesitate to use the word contentment # a sort of uneasy resignation to the situation reached in the camp where the prisoners and the overseers find a position where they can get used to the very unnatural position of being prisoners and overseers in a in a prisoner of war camp # although it wasn't an optimal situation it was vaguely liveable however when the character # of Major Jack Celliers who is the character played by David Bowie # is captured and brought to the camp this <trunc> equi</trunc> this equilibrium is destroyed which has severe repercussions upon the conditions of the camp # both physically and mentally for both prisoners and the overseers</u>
<u who="sm5501">another theme is that of cultural misunderstanding so you've got two very different cultures there's Western and Eastern cultures and they're so vastly different they're the most extreme different differences in culture are are witnessed here and it's enhanced by the language barrier obviously # Western English and then the Eastern language of Japanese that are two very different languages and you can't possible translate all of the idiomatic phrases and basically that the way that Japanese people tell stories even and how they communicate's just so different with # <trunc> th</trunc> the way # Western people do that one of the Japanese officers David Bowie # <trunc> in</trunc> interprets the apparent indifference to his own fate as an example of the samurai-like morals the morals that # Japanese warriors the samurais had at that time since he might not have had a great deal of experience with Western culture previously he can't construct an accurate frame of reference to which to interpret his behaviour despite this the efforts to demonstrate the understanding on both sides of the cultural divide especially through Tom Conti's character and Captain <trunc>jono</trunc> Yonoi show that even in a situation of war hostility is not a necessity</u>
<u who="sm5502">right # and i'm now going to talk a bit about the background the historical background to help you # understand more # the international perception of Japan in the years leading up to # Pearl Harbour so # and then the # <trunc> subse</trunc> subsequent # things that happened and what happens in the film as well so we'll begin we all know about the Meiji Restoration which is was # the period where the last of the Tokugawa supporters were defeated and the Emperor # came back as a symbol of a new era of unity and and progress # and so Japan # invited # the international community # to help them achieve this goal # to to # create a modern # a modern # nation so the French officers came in to remodel the army British British of course came in to # remodel the navy and the Dutch as well came in to supervise the construction in the islands surrounding Japan and so within a few decades railways telephones modern banking and postal systems were introduced # and all of this # was a a great achievement for Japan but it also was the starting point for Japan's entry into World War Two because # a consequence of this was the emergence of nationalism a force which was also emerging in in Europe at the same time and # so these very Shinto principles # show that people who are united under a common goal can achieve almost anything so # the empire embarked on an aggressive foreign policy because Japan at that time believed that the only time to show the world that it was a true # world class power was through imperialism and Japan believed that at this time Russia was # the main threat in the region because Russia was considered one of the # five main powers in Europe and # in order to achieve an equilibrium # between Japan and # Russia Japan turned towards Korea and the Korean peninsula and attempted through political means to force Korea to accept # Japanese military presence military presence which caused a war with China in 1985  <trunc> 19</trunc> 1895 # the Chinese were of course very swiftly defeated # crushed by the modern military # the new military power Japan #  which showed the world for the first time since the Meiji Restoration # that Japan # was able to was an able nation against <trunc> every</trunc> anybody # and through this Japan gained territory # in Taiwan and Western powers for the first time as i said # saw Japan as a threat # now and <trunc> af</trunc> after this <trunc> Ja</trunc> Japan was not able to gain Korea but they still wanted to gain power in that region in order to create as i said that <trunc> eq</trunc> equilibrium and # after ten years of preparation # they # had a surprise attack on Russia # a war which i might add was heavily financed by the UK and the US # which shows that # the UK and the US wanted to remain Allies with Japan perhaps because of # of of the increase in in military and # industrial power so # after # Russia # was swiftly also defeated in a very bloody war but this # defeat # was a heavy blow not only for Russia but for the rest of Europe because # for the first time in modern times an Eastern nation managed to defeat a Western nation so # Japan continued their imperial policies  # which resulted in a the capture of Manchuria # and # the the subsequent war with China # which # very much isolated Japan from the rest of the world Japan and Japan was now labelled as an aggressor and very soon # pacts were created between Italy and Germany and Japan so the access # was created and this is what # in the end resulted in the attack at Pearl Harbour and i think Warren is going to talk now about the # events in the film which happened because of Pearl Harbour</u> 
<u who="sm5504"># yeah well # # going back to the film and # to elaborate # further on what # my my colleagues on the far right have already said # that it was that it's a movie of contrasts and that # it's also a movie that speaks in images and not only is it on a got well giving examples was # when #  Major said he was eating the flowers i am not sure what it symbolises but it looks pretty you know deep and meaningful and all that # and # also # cutting the cutting his hair off just before he was going to die # by # the head of the of the camp and it's #  to me it's #  <trunc>extre</trunc> set in extreme conditions #  and on a # superficial level # it's a charged atmosphere because here you have prisoners and their captors and they're treating each other <trunc>bad</trunc> badly because of the war and some of them necessarily have that feeling of contempt for for each each other's respective sides and of course you never forget that it's you know that there's still a war going on outside of the camp and that it's a prisoner of war and they're being treated as such or if not even worse worse so # but # having said that # they still have # on an individual level they have that sort of mutual respect for each other i mean to i mean a clear example is that between # Sergeant <trunc> H</trunc> Hara and # Major Jack himself were # i believe in one scene they were in the in the dead of night and they were # in the <trunc> pr</trunc> in # the prisoner's barracks and they were just sat down and they just basically talked about well what they were talking about wasn't really important but the fact of the matter was that # they had a dialogue that they had mutual understanding a mutual respect for each other and # at that time you sort for a brief moment you sort of forgot that they were you know this idea of prisoner and captor that they were just being treated equally and have again shown this mutual respect # and perhaps # the guards favoured more towards Lawrence because he had this sort of understanding of Japanese he you know he already spoke spoke Japanese at quite quite a fluent level and so they could relate to him more and perhaps to a certain extent he has an understanding of the Japanese mentality and # way of thinking # of course this this mutual respect only happens on a one to one level # in another example # Hara although we later on see that he is a good man you know when he's drunk and # gets # Major Celliers and # Lawrence free from getting killed he you know he was happy he was you know it showed a human side of him but essentially he was working in this P-O-W camp and it was it was his job to keep the prisoners in their place and one example # was when # # when # Major Celliers # brought in the flowers and bread and the cake when they were not supposed to eat for forty-eight hours and then Captain Yonoi came to assess the situation and so on # Hara # Lawrence tried to plead the case and tried to get # Celliers free so that he wouldn't get punished but Hara of course he he being a Japanese soldier and in this sort of # situation didn't hesitate to # put to well # physically intervene against him because you know he shouldn't really talk to a high-ranking officer that in that way # and i suppose a more interesting relationship is between that of the Yonoi and Celliers and from the very outset from the very beginning of the movie fairly early scenes when Major Celliers was introduced # you could see the good in Captain Yonoi that he was the only one in the courtroom that sort of believed him who didn't all the others thought that you know he was guilty and so he should be sent immediately to a firing squad and get shot but it was only Yonoi who who stood up and pleaded his case so you immediately see that there is again a human level to this story not just a question of prisoner and # captor again showing contrast and he # actually fixed it so that even though he was sentenced to death he had blanks put into the gun so that he basically wouldn't be killed # why he did this we're not entirely sure perhaps he has this # Major Celliers has this sort of x-factor sort of je ne sais quoi # and # i'm going # the way that the film was # shot he gave it also gave the impression that perhaps he took a liking to # to Major Celliers #  yeah # but # yeah but again we see this contrast of him have been this kind person but on the flipside he's also at the end of the day a Japanese soldier and it's a war situation and he has doesn't hesitate to punish those who try and stand up against his running of the camp when # when they discover that # they found a radio in the in the barracks # he didn't care who who was there someone just had to be punished it was that Japanese mentality that if something was done wrong someone or something had to be had to be done to stop this thing from happening again # and again showing # that also it # shows that sort of consistency with # Sergeant Hara in that he also to a certain extent is helping # helping the # the British soldiers and so we see that they are after all they're all human but they're just placed into this unfortunate situation where the rules of this place# is is # paramount that everything that everything personal underneath isn't as important # and also again going back to the idea of Eastern Western cultures # the Japanese treated the # English with sort of contempt in that they thought they were cowards because # by through watching the movie we that if the # situation were reversed if a Japanese soldier was # captured # they gave the impression that they wouldn't have do do what the English did that they would have # seen it as disgraceful especially if they didn't try to still fight on still resist if they had if they still could and they couldn't understand why the British they still had that sort of you know stiff upper lip we invented the modern world sort of idea going on and so # so yeah they just basically treated them worse because of that and just because they didn't understand each others cultures essentially when you strip it all down they are are basically it's a human film at a human level and # i'll pass you onto one of my colleagues now </u>
<u who="sf5505"># i'm actually going to talk some more about <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> <trunc> be</trunc> about what <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> has been talking about # yeah personally i really enjoyed this film although there were like some quite disturbing sorry # i found some of the scenes quite disturbing # such as the scene where they beat the man accused of raping the Dutch soldier # i found the scene really oppressive and uncomfortable to watch also the scene where the Dutch man bites off his tongue and <trunc> ch</trunc> chokes to death # i don't think the violence in the film was overly gratuitous and unnecessary # on the contrary i think # the scenes helped portray life as a prisoner of war and the brutalities one might face in that situation # focussing on the relationships between the Japanese and the British soldiers # there are obvious differences in values between the two opposing sides such as in the case of the Japanese # which is referring to what # Captain Hara says # they would rather die than be captured as this would bring shame upon them whereas with the British as Mr Lawrence explains # this is an inevitable part of war and to commit suicide would be the act of a coward # the fact the Japanese the fact that the Japanese soldiers cannot understand this mentality seems # like an ancient relic of samurai values # which is # whose aspect is still innately present in Japanese value system in the case of Mr Lawrence he seems to understand more then anyone the differences between them and more importantly why these differences exist # again this is because he has an understanding of Japanese culture and and the language etcetera # in the case of Captain Yonoi and Jack <trunc> C</trunc> Celliers # from the outset you sense a strong sexual tensions between the two men mostly from Captain Yonoi who seems enamoured with Celliers even in the opening scene # i think this has come from an initial attraction and then admiration for Celliers # because of his rogue like character he seems quite attracted to him # yes the situation between the two men is full of homoerotic overtones and we see this especially in the scene where Yonoi's about to kill the British officer and Celliers kissing him # he does this because he knows the power he has over him and the effect it will have on Captain Yonoi and then referring again back to # what Captain Hara says about committing suicide at the end of the film # <trunc> w</trunc> we see Mr Lawrence visiting him on the <trunc> e</trunc> in prison on the eve before his execution</u>
<u who="sf5506"># we're now going to analysis and bring everything to a conclusion # in 1914 it looked as though British and Japanese relationships were becoming stronger because they fought on the same side in the First World War however when the war finally formally began in 1914 that was when things all changed # British and Japanese citizens living in each others territory were confined or even imprisoned # some British soldiers were treated terribly in the # prisoner of war camps # and it is believed that this brutality displayed resulted from the cruelties of Japan's civil wars where the enemies were tortured and women were even turned into sex slaves # the dreadful treatment of the prisoners was also due to cultural traditions that date from the Bushido ethic that to surrender to an enemy was dishonourable # however there is evidence that many prisoner of wars # played football with local students and taught residents about agricultural technology and so experienced a very positive relationship with their captors and this proves the Japanese were certainly capable of treating their conquered enemy with basic humanity and respect # even though through Hara Gengo-san # in the film we see # terrible treatment of the soldiers because he can't understand # soldier's who surrender rather than fight to the death # through # Captain Yonoi we see a human and decent man # who tries to contain the violence in the camp and he's kind to the prisoners without being seen as a pushover # his relationship with # Captain Lawrence the spokesman expresses a positive relationship in the film when they work together for the good of the soldiers and the prisoners # and even though we see that Yonoi is repulsed by Celliers he still tries to accommodate and understand him which shows that even though most Europeans did succumb to horrific torture # many were helped and respected by the few decent <trunc> comman</trunc> # Japanese commanders present in the prisoner of war camps</u>
<u who="sf5507">okay # i'm just going to talk about the relationships between the four # main characters in the film it's sort of what Warren and # Angie have already said but maybe in a bit more detail # Sergeant Hara and Lawrence # had an obvious friendship # they display a mutual respect for each other # for example Lawrence has the ability to speak Japanese and has an understanding of the culture # this has <trunc>allo</trunc> allowed him to # spend time with Sergeant Hara and # get to know him and also he's been # separated from his fellow soldiers who # they can't understand him because he's friendly with the Japanese # # it's very difficult for them to have a true friendship because in Hara's opinion Lawrence should have killed himself rather than # be captured and be in this situation so # but Lawrence sees this as the coward's way out he'd rather be caught and # put in the prisoner of war camp # throughout the film you see # Hara taunting and questioning Lawrence and this is an attempt to understand this culture which amuses him but he's also worried that it's going to corrupt the Japanese as well # whereas Yonoi and # Celliers # Yonoi is attracted to Celliers at the beginning of the film which is why he saves him # from the death penalty and puts him in the camp # he sees Cellliers' rebellious # nature as him possessing some samurai morals so he has some respect for him which is why he justifies the fact that he's interested him in him by this and that's why he wants to put him as the replacement commanding officer in the camp # that's basically it and Candie's just going to speak about how this relationship sort of sums everything up</u>
<u who="sf5508"># i want to like # # give a summary about the four main characters and which may lead to a better understanding between # of the relationship between them # Mr Lawrence # he's an <trunc> af</trunc> <trunc> afa</trunc> <trunc> afable</trunc> affable affable but naive [?] speaking English officer and he desperately trying to alleviate the problems caused by culture and languages and to make the best of the brutal circumstances inflicted in on him and his other soldiers also he's trying to demonstrate a Western notion of mercy and while all around him it's the corporate notion of horror that often ends in ritual style suicide this raise the issue of his relationship with # Sergeant Hara and # the example that Mr Lawrence asks Hara to help the Korean soldier and to protect # told Mr Lawrence that Japanese would never ever ask for help from the enemy and the samurai don't fear him # and also Japanese don't understand yeah why as they mentioned before they would like to surrender but not just # fight to death # and also # the Japanese treat their prisoners with <trunc>r</trunc> <trunc> brutal</trunc> brutality and contempt as they think the deserve however day by day Mr Lawrence and Hara # seem to share respect to each other and eventually Hara # help to release # Mr Lawrence and other soldiers and [?] about another two significant characters Jack <trunc> C</trunc> Celliers and he's considered to be charismatic but enigmatic figure who engages the <trunc>i</trunc> Japanese in # <trunc> psycho</trunc> psychological mind games which preserves his # his self respect but also protect others and Captain <trunc> Yo</trunc> Yonoi # as a <trunc> re</trunc> <trunc> re</trunc> relatively decent man and yeah as # <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> said before # # he's he's # struggled and the old warrior ethic he was elated and repulsed by # Celliers # but even though he's tries to understand him but eventually he's he's trained by the samurai  # samurai <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 word"/> of soldiers around him and # <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> in the in the film that he ordered to be buried Jack in the sand but at night he cuts # a lock of hair of his hair and goes to him and # salute to him this symbolise Japanese nations complicated emotion about <trunc> al</trunc> alien culture and reveals the attitude of Japanese people to Western culture repulsive rejected but <trunc> in</trunc> inevitably attracted by them # this film is # excellent film about <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 word"/> things about # # what <trunc> h</trunc> happened what culture meet or coincide the Japanese traditions and samurai culture add to Western psychology religion and maladjustment and after all # it brings a the bridge has been built to meet a friendly terms by Hara's # at the end Merry Christmas, Mr Lawrence <event desc="applause" iterated="y" dur="5"/></u>

<u who="sf5510">okay # i'll start # we're going to be discussing war crimes and war responsibility and the aspects in the film and explore # the things which appear in the film so first of all what is the film trying to say about these two topics and who should take responsibility for acts committed on screen and for what reasons did they occur so it's following on from what we've just heard # but we need to think about what # <trunc>ea</trunc> different characters represent and who do we as an audience relate to most if any and if not why not and can we as Western viewers learn any insight into the Japanese psyche are is it too alien for us so in order to answer these questions we'd like to you to think about the following topics # first of all it's already been discussed really but Japanese attitude to honour surrender and the Emperor in order to understand their thinking behind some of the actions taken in the film and then linking to this # Celliers character # is he in anyway like the Japanese and following what he believes in and not being afraid to die and therefore is that why he and Yonoi # identified with each other # leading on from that they were in this sort of artificial situation as has been already discussed so were they the war crimes justified # taking culture into account was Sakamoto's character Yonoi merely trying to find out about his enemies and using any methods that he thought were justified # in order to # defend his country and # he needed to break the the men in the camp down so by doing he had to do that # in ways that his culture had taught him to do so were these these crimes actually a crime or was he doing what he thought was necessary # who is responsible as well the military and their interpretation of the imperial dogma or were the West responsible for the things that they'd already taught the Japanese and the way that they sort of encouraged this kind of culture and finally in this film # it's made by a Japanese director so is it acknowledging the crimes # committed in Japan and hence was # accepting responsibility for them and also we don't have things such as the fifteen minute things # programmes on TV in the mornings and also the the samurai the forty-seven samurai programmes so are these merely for entertainment or are they educating people against what was taught # and all the the methods that we used in Japan at the time # are they teaching people against that or they there just for entertainment # and finally what responsibilities must we as the Allies accept # if we were guilt-free then we would not have been present in the war</u>

<u who="sm5512"># i'm going to do i'm going to talk about # examples in the film that relate to # the idea of war crimes war responsibility # i'm going to start off with when most people think of war crimes the motives that led to the Japanese # treatment of prisoners during the war they tend to think pretty much of samurai spirit being the motive behind that the idea Bushido's warrior caste and the kind of thinking behind that # it's already been mentioned but obviously the idea that it was dishonourable to be captured you should # you should i you know commit suicide if you lose # in in the film this is shown quite a lot i think that the film itself is actually a good example of # as as an <trunc> ex</trunc> the whole film itself is an example if you look throughout the film # the prisoners themselves are treated as though they're already dead so # they're malnourished they're # you know they're executed at whim so to the Japanese # captors they're they're already treated as though they're commodities # individual examples i'd say when when they're on when they're on the parade ground # the officer's quite annoyed that the wounded the people that that are in the hospital aren't on the parade and that that's i suppose another side or another signal of this samurai spirit the fact that you know they're they're nothing that you know they don't appreciate the wounded because # of the wounded they're British prisoners because to them you know they're not normal human beings # other examples # include <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 word"/> execution of the <trunc> Maj</trunc> of the officer the British officer in charge from the film # there's also the psychological torture as well the idea that # they postpone Celliers' execution first of all # and then later # when h is put before a firing squad they put blanks in the gun that's not entirely discussed # but it's entirely possible this could be a form of psychological torture maybe # i thought i might compare the film to another to another film that's been made by Western directors # simply because it gives a slightly different perspective i i chose a Bridge on the River Kwai mainly because it's # the only example i could really think of at the time but it is quite it's it's quite a good example # because # although they're both the same in a sense they show British prisoners being #treated harshly # like malnourished # sort of beaten and killed but in Merry Christmas, Mr Lawrence what they do is they # the Sergeant is seen as the bad person and the officers the samurai tend to be <trunc>po</trunc> perceived as # portrayed in the film anyone as # reasoned # and benevolent people i mean that that's shown to an extent when # the Korean <trunc>g</trunc> the Korean guard is captured is captured the Korean guard is about be #  commit the hara-kiri or something # and the sergeant is about to # be very cruel i guess to him # that which is stopped because the officers come over the officers say you know what's going on although he he's executed in the end # there's this idea that throughout the film the the sergeant Sergeant Takeshi he's the one that tends to be slightly more cruel compared to the officers who tend to be more reasoned # maybe this is a portrayal perhaps of they're not trying to blame this entirely on the samurai # this is obviously compared to Bridge on the River Kwai where all of them are quite cruel # this this might just be a difference in the sort of West and East view but # it's not sure i mean # they're this is the first this first example # samurai spirit but there are actually i think two more sort of motives behind why the Japanese treated the prisoners as they did and this responsibility of war crimes # so from this book enough space # yes inventing japan # in the chapter relating to the # to the war what it claims is is that most of the Japanese soldiers were conscripts from conscripts not many of them were samurai # and what what it says is that because of the harsh lives they'd led especially under the military government generals and obviously the propaganda they'd been taught when they'd been # in Japan about their supremacy over other nations when they when they went # forth and conquered i guess # when they went to other countries they were they took out this frustration it was clear from the book they took out this frustration and so many of the people that committed war crimes weren't samurai adhering to a some some concept of Bushido and # that it was dishonourable they simply people taking out something on people they either thought were less than them or just simply they were they were cruel i mean if you if you look at the film # because they have # they have # surrendered without committing suicide but if you but that then doesn't explain why the Japanese in some circumstances massacred civilians because they're not combatants so there might be some reason there might be some other things apart from the main one which is always the idea of the warrior caste # the # this this is kind of shown in Merry Christmas, Mr Lawrence # again with the Korean incident # the sergeant who's probably a conscript farmer # or a peasant maybe # he's going to be quite ruthless to this Korean # and and a lot of the of the crimes in the film or the harsh treatment <trunc> i</trunc> is caused by him # whereas the the samurai # or the officers they tend to intercede quite a bit a bit and be more more reasoned and so to it's credit made by a Japanese director this film tends to could dispel that myth about it all being because of some warrior code # and even Bridge on the River Kwai that that actually plays more into the fact that it was because of # some of the samurai spirit # the last the last thing # the last reason given was actually that # it was done in loyalty to the Emperor # the Tokyo Trials one general claimed # that they were merely showing their #  loyalty to the Emperor # and so by # by being cruel to the Emperor's enemies they were showing their loyalty to the Emperor himself so the concept that the Emperor's enemies are your enemies # by being more <trunc> cru</trunc> by being more cruel you're being more loyal to the Emperor and so this could perhaps be another motive another reason # apart from apart from that one it's not that's not # a # moot point it's an important point but # there were other arguments for their motives and responsibility that they should take because it could be argued it's easier to blame the war crimes on # some ancient code than it is to accept that # it was performed by people that weren't adhering to anything # so # ancient or i don't know # something like that # thank you</u>
<u who="sf5513"># okay the English dictionary defines a war crime as crime such as killing committed during a war in <trunc> viol</trunc> violation of accepted conventions this means in order to have a war crime you have to have a convention to break in the first place now the Geneva Convention # to the treatment of the prisoners of war was revised in 1929 and was signed by forty-seven countries however two of the main countries who did not sign it were Japan and the USSR however in 1942 the Japanese gave a qualified promise to adhere to the regulations of the Geneva Convention but they did not actually sign it so by law they're not contracted to apply the rules of the Convention # part of the Convention # sorry part of the Convention was that no prisoner of war could be forced to disclose information apart from his name or rank this is shown when Captain Hicksley in the film refuses to do so which annoys the head of the Japanese camp because he doesn't understand why he won't give him the information # the the cultural differences between the Western notion of an honourable surrender and the Japanese notion to fight to the death was a big contribution to the ferocity of the Pacific War which was the time period that the film was set in # Allied soldiers had trouble comprehending <trunc> Ja</trunc> the Japanese will to fight # in the face of certain death and Allied atrocities against surrendered Japanese was a function of the racism that infused the <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 word"/> of fighting this resulted in various few survivors of the Pacific garrison # in the fighting at <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 word"/> there were only seventeen Japanese prisoners taken from thousands #  many surrendered only after being knocked unconscious by fire or from being incapacitated or being unable to resist due to wounds this illustrates # that the Japanese will to keep fighting # oh i forgot okay # okay although Japan at first during the Second World War committed such atrocities as the death march of Bataan they began to abide by the rules after a sufficient number of Japanese prisoners had fallen into Allied hands to make reprisals possible # Germany did not treat all it's prisoners alike <trunc> Am</trunc> and American and British subjects received the best treatment while Polish prisoners the worst so all countries were committing war crimes [?] # the modern legal standard governing the doctrine of command responsibility in the United States rests upon the <trunc> pr</trunc> precedent established by the United States Supreme Court in the case of General Tomoyuki Yamashita # the court's holding has become known as the # Yamashita Standard this is to do with where responsibility lies with war crimes down to subordinates and the commanding officers that are in control of them # General <trunc> Yas</trunc> Yamashita was the Commanding General of the Fourteenth Army Group of the Japanese Imperial Army and the Military Governor of the Philippine Islands from October 1944 until control of the Islands was # taken by the US in September 1945 in the <trunc> wa</trunc>  waning days of World War Two numerous atrocities were committed by troops under General Yamashita's control against the civilian population of the <trunc> Phil</trunc> Philippines when he was arrested he was charged with # by the Army's he was charged with violations of the law of war # included in this in this charge were allegations that forces under his command engaged in a deliberate plan to massacre and exterminate a large part of the civilian population of Batangas Province as a result of which more than 25,000 men women and children all unarmed noncombatant civilians were brutally mistreated and killed the General denied his responsibility saying that # he did not order these acts to be committed and he did not have control over the troops under his command however he was found guilty when the testaments from two hundred and eighty-six witnesses # gave a different account # General Yamashita challenged the jurisdiction of the military commission and asserted that he did not commit a violation of the law of war and claimed that he was denied a fair trial under the United States Article of War the Geneva Convention and the United States Constitution however the Supreme Court of the Commonwealth denied his writ in total in responding oh sorry and it then went on to the Supreme Court in February 1946 responding to his claim that he did not personally participate in the order of the commission of these offences the Court described the heart of the charge as being an unlawful breach of duty by him as an army commander to control the operations of members of his command by permitting them to commit the extensive and widespread atrocities and this brings to the point that # there's a responsibility of the commanders of the troops to enforce the conventions of war whether the troops themselves morally have an obligation to disagree with them or whether as a soldier as part of their job they're supposed to carry out any orders given without questioning them # okay so it's quite hard to # accuse someone of a war a war crime because obviously during war time normal laws of social order are different # firstly when there isn't a war if someone kills someone it's # sorry announced as murder however in war killing hundreds and thousands of people is deemed as patriotic and fighting for your country # and so it's deemed something of honour and value so it depends on your perception and interpretation of the situation of whether who's to be held responsible</u>
<u who="sm5509"># right # Merry Christmas, Mr Lawrence is a film made by Japanese people which clearly explores # the war responsibility which Japan # of the Second World War does have # it's very important that it has actually made by Japanese people # it was made in 1983 # other films in popular culture # such as # Gojira which most people know better as Godzilla # this film is actually very interesting it was made in 1954 and # the reason that <trunc>God</trunc> Godzilla was # created was due to # # an atomic bomb i believe of which this monster was created but when you take into comparison that this is only nine years after two atomic bombs were dropped on Japan it's a very interesting # idea for a film # it's interesting because it's kind of changes Japan's responsibility because # it's the victim because Godzilla then goes along attacking many cities and killing many people and he this monster is the culmination of of the atomic bomb # meaning that Japan is is the victim rather than the aggressor # other interesting things are # in the Olympics held in Tokyo in 1964 the # the torch bearer was actually born on August the fifteenth 1945 at the end of the war # kind of showing how Japan now is maybe not as responsible or that it is new Japan because # they they actually chose a person from after the war [?] as soon as the war begins showing the transition from <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 word"/> Japan into # into the peace constitution # Japan another interesting thing about # the film is that other attempts # by # two Japanese writers to to explore # the traumas of the war and the responsibility <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 word"/> and <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 word"/> # they both # in different ways # wrote about Japan and in the war through war memories and humiliation or # his idea was to rather than to show responsibility or the suffering was to show the intensity which the war was involved yet in the 1960's when these books # were written # failed to make any impact in society so it's interesting that then this film in 1983 # did # war responsibility explored within the film # the Japanese soldiers do many quite awful things torturing people and prisoners malnourishment but it's interesting because it also explores the responsibilities of people such as Major Jack Celliers # an interesting thing is the Japanese people # they're given in charge of a prison camp of of enemy prisoner's of war important thing is that these people were sent to kill to Japanese people i myself wouldn't be so nice to someone trying to kill me # Jack Celliers' responsibility firstly # he has a responsibility # which is explored in the film to his little brother who # is maybe comparable at least on a psychological level because his brother i heard from Ellen # was disabled he was made fun of of being <trunc> hunchba</trunc> hunchback Ellen yeah okay # which makes his responsibility quite big because he he was head boy at the school his little brother was going and # he was actually asked if there was any reason why his brother should not be treated different but for selfish reasons such as his own status and partly ignorance and being naive of of not wanting to signal out his his brother for any special treatment yet his responsibility is is quite large <trunc> h</trunc> he took away his brothers gift of singing # which to his brother was probably quite a <trunc> tr</trunc> # treasured gift and very important to him and it's it's taken a part # #  a part of his brother away from him completely # another interesting responsibility of Jack Celliers is that he clearly is not in great mental frame of mind yet the other prisoners begin to look up to him and he even <trunc> reser</trunc> # accepts his responsibility as almost a leader of the group even though he he's clearly # well he he should never have been put into that situation but his responsibility here's great because neither are any of the other prisoners really in a great mental condition and # for him to see himself as their leader and to look after them and then they accept it because they've noticed his influence over the # captain of the prison camp Yonoi # this is also quite a responsibility # interesting at the end of the film when the # the guard sergeant # Gengo Hara Takeshi is # going to be executed him and Mr Lawrence # have a discussion about whether it is right about # him being put on execution # and they say well the the Allies now think they are right # just as # the Japanese used to think that they were right but it it's also interesting because the person in charge  of Japan at the time was a General Douglas MacArthur who had the power more than the Emperor had maybe during his time he he was life and death in his way it's also interesting that # people like the guard sergeant # should be executed when other people maybe more responsible such as # Ishii Shiro # head of # 731 which was # a biological # weapons development which has huge [?] war responsibilities maybe more than Japan itself this <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 word"/> # did many war crimes yet he he himself was not # put onto the Tribunal # because he was seen as a benefit to the the # information that he had to the American government not allowing it to want to fall into Soviet hands # but this puts an interesting responsibility on the Allies rather then Japan # Japan has a responsibility for committing such atrocities but surely # the Allies also have a responsibility for not for not allowing these things to go unpunished and even maybe encouraging it willingly accepting the information gained from from the # <trunc> 73</trunc> 731 # other very interesting things about the film is that # an actual Japanese pop star plays a major part in the film as Sakamoto # this is quite interesting it shows # and it's made by Japanese people showing Japan's war responsibility and it's played by a very popular # pop star Sakamoto # he also does the music which i will be playing # for you for the the film it's also an interesting contrast between the music that he creates which is is # quite mysterious and peaceful i guess compared to the actual character that he plays which can be brutal # although maybe misunderstood for his motivations # Japan's war responsibility on a whole # no country was # is is not guilty in in the war # it's interesting because perhaps Japan maybe is limiting it's war responsibility by acknowledging the responsibilities that it has with making such films as this # an example perhaps of how the West doesn't acknowledge such things # the Great War leader # Winston Churchill # his responsibility is also quite high in the war # an example i would give would be # in 1944 he was <trunc> re</trunc> redirecting food grain # towards the war effort to feed the # soldiers who who needed food and it's decision in itself # was not done # for any evil purpose if it was except due to his naivety # in Bengal # the result was a famine of which 3 million people died which in itself is quite a large responsibility placed on Britain # i myself haven't seen a film about this so that's very interesting # i'm going to finish off by by playing you a little of the music by Sakamoto as i said</u> 
<u who="sm5511">just before Tom plays that # another example of the West # #  supposedly committing crimes that we never really hear about is # a <trunc> hi</trunc> famous historian James Bacque # he's written a book called # Other Losses which # details Colonel Eisenhower who was # well i don't know Supreme Commander or whatever of # Europe towards the end of the war and afterwards he # he changed the German POW camps to German def camps D-E-F which stands for disarmed enemy forces which # negated them from the <trunc> Gene</trunc> Geneva Convention which meant that # i think it was one-point-seven million German soldiers died because of the terrible conditions and # not being allowed access to the # Swiss Red Cross # this while not very well known # James Bacque's book is supported by # the Colonel Ernest Fisher who's former formally Senior Historian of the United States Army for Centre of <trunc> Mi</trunc> Military History which you know he's got to have some credibility surely <trunc> an</trunc> and now for a musical interlude</u>
<u who="sm5509"><event desc="music playing" iterated="y" dur="9"/> and this as i said by Sakamoto who played the Captain in many ways quite a contrast</u>
