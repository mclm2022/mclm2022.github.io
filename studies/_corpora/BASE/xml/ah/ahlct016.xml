<u who="nf0069"> when talking about the French gangster film <pause dur="0.4"/> very often and <pause dur="0.3"/> paradoxically in French one talks about the policier <pause dur="0.4"/> that's the name of the genre <pause dur="0.3"/> so <pause dur="0.3"/> when you you see the word policier # I-E <pause dur="0.7"/> police which relates to the police it doesn't necessarily mean that <pause dur="0.4"/> it's to do with a police film or police procedure as the <pause dur="0.3"/> you have in the American genres <pause dur="0.3"/> but it's <pause dur="0.3"/> <trunc>co</trunc> covers all <pause dur="0.5"/> # virtually all the films # to do with crime <pause dur="0.3"/> # pretty much from the nineteen-fifties onwards so <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> a gangster film and a police film will both be called policier in French <pause dur="0.3"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> sometimes you'll see the in slang this becomes <distinct lang="fr">polar</distinct> <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="2.8"/> i'm sorry i hope it's not too awkward if i move <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> <distinct lang="fr">polar</distinct> <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="3"/> is P-O-L-A-R <pause dur="1.0"/><event desc="student enters room" iterated="n" n="sf0070"/> # is <pause dur="0.7"/> yep </u><pause dur="0.4"/> <u who="sf0070" trans="pause"> sorry </u><pause dur="0.6"/> <u who="nf0069" trans="pause"> okay <pause dur="0.5"/> we're just beginning <pause dur="0.4"/> <distinct lang="fr">polar</distinct> is the slang word for <pause dur="0.2"/> policier so <distinct lang="fr">le polar</distinct> refers to <pause dur="0.2"/> the genre of the <pause dur="0.3"/> police <pause dur="0.2"/> crime gangster movie in French <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> specifically from the nineteen-fifties late forties fifties onwards <pause dur="0.7"/> and <pause dur="0.8"/> so that i will 
talk today about a particular genre <pause dur="0.3"/> or subgenre of French crime films and film noir which arises <pause dur="0.3"/> in the mid-fifties <pause dur="0.3"/> especially with three <pause dur="0.2"/> key movies <pause dur="0.2"/> which are the ones that are at the top of your handout <pause dur="0.4"/> # and that is Touchez pas au Grisbi <pause dur="0.3"/> which i'll refer to as Grisbi <pause dur="0.5"/> # Du Rififi Chez les Hommes <pause dur="0.4"/> <trunc>ri</trunc> Rififi <pause dur="0.4"/> and # Bob le Flambeur the film you're going to see <pause dur="0.2"/> this afternoon <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.8"/> okay and <pause dur="0.6"/> # the theme of the lecture in a sense will be that of hybridity <pause dur="0.5"/> and especially <pause dur="0.2"/> hybridity between <pause dur="0.2"/> French and American <pause dur="0.4"/> culture French and America cinema <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> and to start starting with <pause dur="0.2"/> literature <pause dur="0.6"/> so that <pause dur="0.6"/> if you look at the bottom of your handout there's # a kind of <trunc>s</trunc> skeleton of the <pause dur="0.5"/> # lecture <pause dur="0.5"/> and # i will start with the literary origins <pause dur="0.2"/> of the genre <pause dur="0.4"/> because <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> when it comes to those gangster films those policiers of the mid-fifties starting particularly with Touchez pas au Grisbi <pause dur="0.5"/> but also some Eddie Constantine movies <pause dur="0.2"/> # earlier on <pause dur="0.5"/> # they are films which are very directly related to <pause dur="0.4"/> # 
literature <pause dur="0.3"/> to crime <pause dur="0.3"/> literature and in particular the famous <pause dur="0.3"/> Serie Noire <pause dur="0.3"/> # which i've already mentioned <pause dur="0.2"/> which was an imprint of the # French publisher Gallimard <pause dur="3.0"/> <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="3"/> # which <pause dur="0.5"/> started <pause dur="0.2"/> at the # immediately at the end of the war <pause dur="0.4"/> and has remained extremely successful <pause dur="0.5"/> i brought you so just to <pause dur="0.2"/> make you # <pause dur="5.0"/><event desc="student enters room" iterated="n" n="su0071"/> like to <pause dur="1.0"/> one of these <pause dur="1.0"/> to show you # <kinesic desc="holds up book" iterated="n"/> this is an original Serie Noire book <pause dur="0.5"/> # it's very precious to me <pause dur="0.2"/> it actually happens to be the one on which <pause dur="0.3"/> # Goddard's film Pierrot le Fou <pause dur="0.2"/> is very loosely based # in English or <pause dur="0.4"/> American it's called Obsession and this one in French it's called Le DÃ©mon d'Onze Heures <pause dur="0.3"/> if you read it <pause dur="0.2"/> it's very very distantly related to Pierrot le Fou in case you know that film <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> but <pause dur="0.2"/> i just wanted to show you # the cover that is the original cover <pause dur="0.3"/> # of the Serie Noire and as you can see it's the the background is black <pause dur="0.4"/> and it uses red # <pause dur="0.3"/> yellow <pause dur="0.3"/> lettering <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> and the series was founded by Marcel Duhamel his name is on 
your # <pause dur="0.8"/> # handout <pause dur="0.5"/> who was # an ex-member of the surrealist group in the nineteen-twenties <pause dur="0.7"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> he was very # much linked to the surrealists throughout the twenties and the thirties <pause dur="0.5"/> and James Naremore in the book More than Night which i've already quoted from <pause dur="0.4"/> says that # # Duhamel was particularly # interested in <pause dur="0.5"/> # the researches into sexuality which the surrealists conducted # during the the twenties and early nineteen-thirties <pause dur="0.5"/> and <pause dur="0.6"/> in the American hard-boiled <pause dur="0.2"/> # thriller what the surrealists saw as i've already mentioned was <pause dur="0.4"/> # this notion of <pause dur="0.3"/> eroticized crime <trunc>whi</trunc> <trunc>su</trunc> subverting as it were <pause dur="0.3"/> # the fabric of bourgeois society <pause dur="0.3"/> so that <pause dur="0.4"/> # one can see then the relationship # directed to the surrealists through the person of Duhamel # who <pause dur="0.3"/> then in forty-six begins the series of the Serie Noire <pause dur="0.5"/> and the Serie Noire published <pause dur="0.4"/> <trunc>primar</trunc> initially <pause dur="0.3"/> primarily American writers <pause dur="0.2"/> in translation <pause dur="0.3"/> and famously <pause dur="0.2"/> it always says underneath <pause dur="0.6"/> <distinct lang="fr">traduit de l'Americain</distinct> translated from the 
American <pause dur="0.3"/> not from the English <pause dur="0.3"/> # even though sometimes some of the writers were British but <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> and also famously a number of French writers wrote for the Serie Noire <pause dur="0.4"/> under American pseudonyms <pause dur="0.3"/> # such was the the aura of so they pretended <pause dur="0.4"/> # to translate work into French from the American <pause dur="0.2"/> which in fact they had written into French in the first place <pause dur="0.4"/> but <pause dur="0.3"/> the the the basis of the Serie Noire was to <pause dur="0.2"/> to publish to translate and publish <pause dur="0.3"/> American <pause dur="0.2"/> writers <pause dur="0.3"/> and Duhamel encouraged also people like Chester Himes for example to to write for the series <pause dur="0.8"/> # Duhamel one finds also linked to the cinema # in two ways one is that he was <pause dur="0.3"/> he he appears in a number of films by Jean Renoir in the thirties as an actor <pause dur="0.4"/> and also <pause dur="0.3"/> he <trunc>wri</trunc> he wrote the preface to <pause dur="0.3"/> the book on film noir by Borde and Chaumeton <pause dur="0.2"/> <trunc>fa</trunc> book that's already been mentioned <pause dur="0.7"/> # several times <pause dur="0.8"/> # and i think i # also wanted to show you the the cover <pause dur="0.2"/> # and also the cover of another <pause dur="0.3"/> # Gallimard book <pause dur="0.6"/> to make the point that which i think is 
is very telling the design of that series <pause dur="0.5"/> is that <pause dur="0.3"/> the book combined <pause dur="0.2"/> the kind of sobriety <pause dur="0.5"/> of Gallimard publishing <kinesic desc="holds up book" iterated="n"/> this is this was Gallimard <pause dur="0.3"/> very famous literary # imprint looks like this is <pause dur="0.2"/> # a copy of # a book by Marcel Proust but <pause dur="0.3"/> i could have picked up any <pause dur="0.2"/> they all look the same <pause dur="0.3"/> they have the this cream background and the red lettering <pause dur="0.3"/> and this <pause dur="0.2"/> this this design hasn't changed # throughout the century practically <pause dur="0.3"/> and there is that sense of <pause dur="0.2"/> classicism <pause dur="0.2"/> sobriety <pause dur="0.4"/> and what one sees here i think is is the a kind of <pause dur="0.4"/> mixture of that sobriety and classicism <pause dur="0.3"/> with the lurid colours of pulp fiction the black and the yellow <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> colours which <pause dur="0.2"/> tend to appear on a number of <pause dur="0.6"/> artefacts to to around crime <pause dur="0.3"/> and it <kinesic desc="holds up poster" iterated="n"/> this is # this is some press material for a film called <pause dur="0.4"/> Du Rififi Chez les Femmes which was <pause dur="0.4"/> # a kind of rip off as it were and and follow up to <pause dur="0.2"/> Rififi Chez les Hommes <pause dur="0.3"/> and you see that the black and white background and the and the lurid <pause dur="0.2"/> # yellow colour <pause dur="0.5"/> so <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.9"/> and the <pause dur="0.3"/> # the 
reason why # <pause dur="0.2"/> i'm talking about <pause dur="0.2"/> the # <pause dur="0.6"/> the Serie Noire writers <pause dur="0.5"/> # in relation to the films <pause dur="0.4"/> is is that <pause dur="0.4"/> they are on the one hand those indirect connections through Duhamel <pause dur="0.7"/> between surrealism <pause dur="0.4"/> # literary culture and the cinema <pause dur="0.3"/> but also because the three films we're talking about <pause dur="0.3"/> were directly based on or written by # <pause dur="0.7"/> writers from the Serie Noire <pause dur="0.3"/> and in particular you have it on your # <pause dur="0.4"/> handout <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> Albert Simonin <pause dur="1.0"/> # who wrote <pause dur="0.5"/> Touchez pas au Grisbi <pause dur="0.5"/> # and i have here <pause dur="0.8"/> the the book Touchez pas au Grisbi alas it's not an original Serie Noire <pause dur="0.4"/><kinesic desc="holds up book" iterated="n"/> it's a vulgar folio reprint of the <pause dur="0.4"/> late <trunc>eight</trunc> eighties but <pause dur="0.3"/> and you can see that on the cover what they've put is a a kind of <pause dur="0.4"/> # a graphic version of <pause dur="0.2"/> # Gabin Jeanne Moreau in the film <pause dur="0.6"/> # so that's the <trunc>s</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> sort of obvious # <pause dur="0.8"/> connection to the movie <pause dur="0.3"/> for the readers of the eighties <pause dur="0.4"/> # but # Simonin then <pause dur="0.3"/> wrote <pause dur="0.3"/> # Touchez pas au Grisbi <pause dur="0.4"/> in slang <pause dur="0.4"/> and # the the the book was adapted to the film that you've saw you've seen this morning and Auguste Le Breton <pause dur="0.5"/> 
wrote <pause dur="0.4"/> # Rififi and he wrote the dialogues of Bob le Flambeur <pause dur="0.8"/> which you will see <pause dur="0.4"/> this afternoon <pause dur="0.6"/> # after the lecture and the the importance of Le Breton of those writers in the fifties is shown by the fact that <pause dur="0.4"/> # Jean-Pierre Melville the director of Bob le Flambeur has # said that <pause dur="0.4"/> he <pause dur="0.2"/> used Le Breton <pause dur="0.2"/> as a marketing ploy <pause dur="0.2"/> that <pause dur="0.4"/> # at the time he made Bob le Flambeur in nineteen-fifty-five fifty-six <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> he was not a well known director <pause dur="0.2"/> the film doesn't have a star unlike Grisbi which had Jean Gabin <pause dur="0.3"/> the star of Bob le Flambeur <pause dur="0.3"/> in nineteen-fifty-six <pause dur="0.3"/> was Auguste Le Breton <pause dur="0.2"/> that's the name that sold the movie <pause dur="0.4"/> today of course # it's Jean-Pierre Melville's name which which is prominent <pause dur="0.2"/> but at the time <pause dur="0.2"/> # Melville recognized that he needed # Le Breton <pause dur="0.8"/> in order to # to sell his film <pause dur="0.4"/> and Le Breton wrote the dialogue # in the slang <pause dur="0.3"/> which was accustomed to # the writers of the Serie Noire <pause dur="0.4"/> in French <pause dur="0.6"/> okay <pause dur="0.4"/> just a word then about # language # <pause dur="0.8"/> and and that is that <pause dur="0.4"/> # <trunc>tho</trunc> those books 
were written in slang <pause dur="0.4"/> # in the <distinct lang="fr">argot</distinct> <pause dur="0.5"/> that's the French word for slang <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="3"/> # but you you'll come across it <pause dur="0.3"/> a number of times <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.9"/> which <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> was <pause dur="0.2"/> a a kind of romanticized version <pause dur="0.4"/> of <pause dur="0.3"/> crooks' <pause dur="0.6"/> slang <pause dur="0.3"/> # which has a long history # in in French language going back to the late Middle Ages <pause dur="0.4"/> # and which was revived in the nineteenth century <pause dur="0.3"/> by a number of classic writers like Victor Hugo but also <pause dur="0.4"/> # some of the writers of <pause dur="0.4"/> the popular novels which were the antecedents of the crime novels <pause dur="0.3"/> people like EugÃ¨ne Sue his name is written on the # on the handout <pause dur="0.4"/> so that <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> that <trunc>sla</trunc> slang if you like had <trunc>lo</trunc> very <pause dur="0.3"/> # old history and and # <pause dur="0.6"/> distant origins in French language <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> and went through a number of revivals <pause dur="0.5"/> and in the post-war period went through a particularly dramatic revival <pause dur="0.2"/> through the writers of the of the Serie Noire <pause dur="0.5"/> and <pause dur="0.3"/> the <pause dur="0.2"/> importance of the slang # is is on is felt on many levels <pause dur="0.3"/> and it's it 
advertises itself immediately from the titles of the film <pause dur="0.3"/> so <pause dur="0.2"/> for the French audience of the mid-fifties <pause dur="0.6"/> words like <distinct lang="fr">grisbi</distinct> <pause dur="0.4"/> # <trunc>ha</trunc> <distinct lang="fr">chnouf</distinct> as in Razzia sur la Chnouf which means drugs <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> <distinct lang="fr">rififi</distinct> <pause dur="0.3"/> and so on <pause dur="0.2"/> were words which were not # necessarily in everyday use but but had that aura <pause dur="0.2"/> of <trunc>crim</trunc> criminal language <pause dur="0.2"/> so that right from the title of the films <pause dur="0.2"/> the their # the nature <pause dur="0.3"/> of the literature on which the films were based and the criminal milieu <pause dur="0.3"/> which was evoked in the film <pause dur="0.2"/> was was made evident <pause dur="0.4"/> # and of course <pause dur="0.2"/> # if you <pause dur="0.2"/> if you don't speak French the # the kind of flavour of it # is lost and we we have to be reconciled to that <pause dur="0.3"/> but it is <pause dur="0.3"/> quite an important aspect of <pause dur="0.5"/> of the films the way in which the lines are spoken and the the words of slang <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> which are used <pause dur="0.4"/> and it's it's it was # very important to the film <pause dur="0.3"/> in a way which is made very self-conscious in the films <pause dur="0.3"/> so <pause dur="0.7"/> i want to show you now <pause dur="0.3"/> two <pause dur="0.3"/> extracts before we # move on to <pause dur="0.4"/> # the <pause dur="0.7"/> the <pause dur="0.2"/> the the gangster 
films themselves # and especially Grisbi and Bob le Flambeur <pause dur="0.5"/> i want to show you an extract first of all from # a film with Eddie Constantine <pause dur="0.6"/> # and then an extract from Rififi so i know some of you i hope most of you have seen Rififi but <pause dur="0.2"/> # nevertheless we'll <trunc>s</trunc> we'll look <pause dur="0.4"/> at an extract <pause dur="0.9"/> so backtracking a little bit # on on on on the handouts still on the <pause dur="0.2"/> literary origins <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.8"/> you see that i make mention of American <trunc>hard</trunc> hard-boiled writers which i've already mentioned so people like Dashiell Hammett Raymond Chandler and so on <pause dur="0.4"/> all those writers who were <pause dur="0.5"/> translated <pause dur="0.2"/> into the Serie Noire <pause dur="0.5"/> but another one another writer who was translated and who may not be <pause dur="0.3"/> as meaningful to you today as <pause dur="0.2"/> Chandler and Hammett are <pause dur="0.3"/> was Peter Cheyney <pause dur="0.4"/> who wrote # a series of novels with a a private detective called Lemmy Caution <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="3.4"/> <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="5"/> and <trunc>a</trunc> according to # <pause dur="0.6"/> Jill Forbes # the <trunc>f</trunc> the very first <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> book published by Serie Noire <pause dur="0.3"/> was a book 
called Poison Ivy <pause dur="0.2"/> by Cheyney <pause dur="0.3"/> # and that's it's # and it's the book which is adapted <pause dur="0.4"/> # into a film called <pause dur="0.2"/> La MÃ´me Vert-de-Gris <pause dur="0.3"/> which would translate as The Vert-de-Gris Chick <pause dur="0.2"/> # sort of that that's the sort of flavour of it <pause dur="0.4"/> and <pause dur="0.3"/> which was a film <trunc>wh</trunc> the <trunc>f</trunc> <trunc>wh</trunc> the film which really made Eddie Constantine into a star <pause dur="0.7"/> and i'm going to show you <pause dur="0.3"/> a quick extract <pause dur="0.5"/> # now Eddie Constantine # was an American <pause dur="0.3"/> but who'd come to work in France he was a singer <pause dur="0.6"/> and <pause dur="0.3"/> he # was a protÃ©gÃ© of <trunc>e</trunc> of the singer Edith Piaf I-E lover <pause dur="0.4"/> and <pause dur="0.3"/> she kind of helped his career initially <pause dur="0.2"/> and then <pause dur="0.2"/> # he started getting parts small parts in movies <pause dur="0.3"/> and with # La MÃ´me Vert-de-Gris he became a major star <pause dur="0.3"/> through the the the mid-fifties and <pause dur="0.2"/> # through the fifties really <pause dur="0.9"/> and the <pause dur="0.5"/> i i will come to <trunc>sa</trunc> to talk talk later on about <pause dur="0.3"/> # the <pause dur="0.2"/> attitude to American culture in those films but <pause dur="0.3"/> the <pause dur="0.2"/> # interesting aspect of <trunc>con</trunc> Eddie Constantine and i pronounce him <pause dur="0.2"/> on on purpose as Constantine and not

productions <pause dur="0.3"/> but of course with quote unquote B subjects <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> and that itself gave rise to a lot of controversy at the time <pause dur="0.3"/> the fact that <pause dur="0.2"/> so much talent and money in in the view of some was was as it were quote unquote wasted on <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> unimportant trivial <pause dur="0.3"/> and immoral subjects <pause dur="0.4"/> so <pause dur="0.2"/> that <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> even in a French context where censorship was much less <pause dur="0.4"/> # intent on questions of morals of sexual sexual depiction <pause dur="0.4"/> and morality generally <pause dur="0.3"/> # there were controversies about these films <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> the fact that the criminals of course are <pause dur="0.2"/> presented <trunc>sym</trunc> # with sympathy <pause dur="0.2"/> # that that the spectator is is expected to identify <trunc>wi</trunc> with them you identify with Max <pause dur="0.3"/> and his friends and you identify with Bob <pause dur="0.3"/> and his friends in Bob le Flambeur # as you will see <pause dur="0.4"/> # have <pause dur="0.2"/> created controversy <pause dur="0.4"/> and <pause dur="0.8"/> # i know the the reason why the print of # Grisbi you saw this morning was incomplete # <pause dur="0.4"/> is that # was due to the British censor so the censorship was was worse on the British side of # as usual <pause dur="0.3"/> # in in relations to morality and 
and and sexuality <pause dur="0.4"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> the scene i will show you # <pause dur="0.6"/> in a little while from <trunc>gris</trunc> # from Grisbi is the scene <trunc>y</trunc> that that's missing but there were <pause dur="0.2"/> there are little bits <pause dur="0.2"/> which are missing and which are no doubt due to to censorship <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> <trunc>w</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> one point i would i would plant here in your mind is that <pause dur="0.2"/> and and because i'll come back to it at the end of the lecture <pause dur="0.4"/> is <pause dur="0.2"/> # the fact that a star <pause dur="0.2"/> like Jean Gabin <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> # saw the renewal of his career in Grisbi <pause dur="0.4"/> # and shortly after this film in the late fifties and early sixties <pause dur="0.4"/> two of the biggest new stars of French cinema <pause dur="0.2"/> namely Jean-Paul Belmondo and Alain Delon <pause dur="0.3"/> began their careers <pause dur="0.2"/> also playing criminals or <pause dur="0.3"/> # or policemen sometimes but or <trunc>g</trunc> <trunc>b</trunc> <trunc>y</trunc> very often gangsters <pause dur="0.2"/> so that <pause dur="0.2"/> there is as it were in the mid-fifties to the early sixties a rise in French cinema <pause dur="0.3"/> of the male star as gangster <pause dur="0.3"/> as a criminal or a delinquent <pause dur="0.3"/> and and that's that's a very # interesting point and it contrasts quite sharply <pause dur="0.2"/> with what happened <pause dur="0.3"/> # before the 
war <pause dur="0.3"/> and and <pause dur="0.2"/> here you can make a direct comparison with Gabin because <pause dur="0.2"/> although <pause dur="0.4"/> in PÃ©pÃ© le Moko he played a gangster <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> in in his other films he tended to play <pause dur="0.3"/> # a worker <pause dur="0.2"/> maybe a worker driven to crime but to # a <trunc>h</trunc> a an honest working class hero <pause dur="0.3"/> and as we discussed even in PÃ©pÃ© he was <pause dur="0.3"/> portraying a kind of # honest working class character even though he's a gangster <pause dur="0.5"/> and <pause dur="0.4"/> with <pause dur="0.4"/> # when we move to the mid-fifties and early sixties we we see a change a very important change # in the way <pause dur="0.4"/> # major male stars begin to <pause dur="0.2"/> # be associated <pause dur="0.3"/> primarily with figures of gangsters <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> and <pause dur="0.5"/> the point i would make about the place of the films in the French film industry <pause dur="0.3"/> # was that <pause dur="0.3"/> they combined <pause dur="0.3"/> popular <pause dur="0.2"/> box office well they combined box office popularity <pause dur="0.4"/> with <pause dur="0.2"/> critical <pause dur="0.3"/> # acclaim in many cases <pause dur="0.4"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> i think that we can then see them as a very important transitional <pause dur="0.4"/> # <trunc>y</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> cycle if you like <pause dur="0.3"/> between the tradition of quality <pause dur="0.3"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> the new wave that's about to come <pause dur="0.2"/> and it's interesting that <pause dur="0.2"/> # 
most of these films certainly Grisbi <pause dur="0.3"/> and and certainly Rififi <pause dur="0.3"/> very much slot within the tradition of quality <pause dur="0.4"/> in terms as i say of stars budgets sets et cetera <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> yet the subjects are not <pause dur="0.4"/><kinesic desc="makes quotation mark gesture" iterated="n"/> typical quality subjects <pause dur="0.4"/> and <pause dur="0.3"/> # at the same time they are films which are approved of <pause dur="0.2"/> by the <trunc>n</trunc> the future new wave directors as critics <pause dur="0.3"/> and indeed <pause dur="0.2"/> when the new wave directors begin to make movies <pause dur="0.3"/> most of them <pause dur="0.8"/> # start by making <pause dur="0.2"/> # thrillers or films with delinquent characters and gangsters <pause dur="0.2"/> so think of Godard and A Bout de Souffle <pause dur="0.4"/> think of <pause dur="0.4"/> Truffaut and Shoot the Pianist <pause dur="0.3"/> # # <trunc>es</trunc> <trunc>tho</trunc> think of Chabrol <pause dur="0.2"/> # virtually all most of the new wave directors <pause dur="0.2"/> begin by making <pause dur="0.3"/> # thrillers so i think <pause dur="0.2"/> those films we're looking at this week are very important as a transitional point <pause dur="0.3"/> between tradition of quality <pause dur="0.4"/> and new wave <pause dur="0.2"/> # another # person i haven't mentioned here is Louis Malle who made Lift to the Scaffold Ascenseur Pour l'Echafaud <pause dur="0.4"/> in fifty-seven <pause dur="0.2"/> <trunc>whi</trunc> which is a thriller <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.9"/> okay so <pause dur="0.4"/> that that's i 
think the the the main point here about <pause dur="0.2"/> how these films are placed within the film industry <pause dur="0.3"/> and <pause dur="0.4"/> although some of the critics raise objections as i said about the morality <pause dur="0.2"/> of the films <pause dur="0.2"/> in particular Georges # interestingly <pause dur="0.4"/> # a critic on the left Georges Sadoul # who's a Communist critic <pause dur="0.3"/> # raised objections to Grisbi <pause dur="0.5"/> very much along the lines of <pause dur="0.2"/> what a pity that Jacques Becker <pause dur="0.2"/> with all his talent <pause dur="0.2"/> is making a thriller <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> now <pause dur="0.8"/> the next point i want to come to is # <pause dur="0.2"/> in a way the the the one of the most important points of about studying those films for us # at # in this course <pause dur="0.4"/> is <pause dur="0.2"/> the relationship between <pause dur="0.4"/> # French national identity <pause dur="0.2"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> American <pause dur="0.4"/> cultural artefacts and <trunc>cultura</trunc> and American cinema <pause dur="0.4"/> and how <pause dur="0.3"/> that relationship <pause dur="0.3"/> is played out in the thrillers <pause dur="0.7"/> so <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> as you can see on your on your handout the first point i would make here <pause dur="0.4"/> is to contrast in these films <pause dur="0.3"/> and this is very much something i want us to discuss tomorrow in the seminar <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> # to look at the contrast 
or <trunc>a</trunc> at least the relationship <pause dur="0.2"/> between <pause dur="0.7"/> the iconography which one may say is a very much # a Hollywood iconography <pause dur="0.4"/> of <pause dur="0.4"/> the the gangsters <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> now Max and his friends in Grisbi don't wear trench coats but as you will see in Bob we do see trench coat <pause dur="0.3"/> the hats <pause dur="0.2"/> the guns <pause dur="0.3"/> # the sharp suits and so on <pause dur="0.2"/> # we have <pause dur="0.3"/> # the iconography that Colin McArthur talks about in <trunc>ho</trunc> # <pause dur="0.3"/> Underworld U-S-A is very much there <pause dur="0.3"/> # the cigarettes the drinks <pause dur="0.3"/> the well dressed people <pause dur="0.3"/> jukeboxes <pause dur="0.4"/> # jazz musicians <pause dur="0.3"/> # a lot of <pause dur="0.4"/> # artefacts and objects # that we associate or certainly at the time were associated with American culture <pause dur="0.3"/> litter these films <pause dur="0.2"/> so <pause dur="0.2"/> the way the the characters dress <pause dur="0.2"/> the <pause dur="0.4"/> locations they inhabit <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> think about the ubiquitous cabaret <pause dur="0.4"/> # <trunc>wh</trunc> which you've just seen in in Rififi you've seen that in in in Grisbi you will see it in Bob le Flambeur <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> music the role of music and and et cetera <pause dur="0.3"/> # very much connotes <pause dur="0.3"/> an American iconography and an iconography which people then could relate directly to <pause dur="0.2"/> 
American gangster films they could see <pause dur="0.2"/> and they'd been seeing since the thirties <pause dur="0.2"/> okay <pause dur="0.7"/> however at the same time <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> it's certainly in Grisbi <pause dur="0.2"/> and in # Bob le Flambeur <pause dur="1.1"/> interestingly differently in Rififi and i hope tomorrow there'll be enough people who've seen Rififi so we can discuss that in in detail <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> at the same time as we have this American iconography <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> which is very pervasive <pause dur="0.3"/> both visually and aurally <pause dur="0.6"/> we also have <pause dur="0.4"/> # a particular French type of <distinct lang="fr">mise en scÃ¨ne</distinct> <pause dur="0.3"/> which we <pause dur="0.2"/> may recognize you may recognize already from films you've seen # in the last two weeks <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> a more <pause dur="0.2"/> mundane # # type of # delivery if you like of the story <pause dur="0.2"/> and more of an emphasis on <pause dur="0.3"/> the quotidian <pause dur="0.3"/> on <pause dur="0.2"/> # the <distinct lang="fr">temps mort</distinct> the sort of dead time <pause dur="0.2"/> # a <trunc>l</trunc> a lot of the time when <pause dur="0.4"/> it doesn't seem that very much is happening <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> i used a quote which is from Roland Barthes' # text on on your <trunc>han</trunc> on the back of the handout <pause dur="0.3"/> which where he describes Grisbi <pause dur="0.2"/> in one of his rare look at looks at # a <trunc>f</trunc> a film at a

we see them is doing their teeth and putting on their pyjamas and <pause dur="0.4"/> and # in a way which emphasizes # <pause dur="0.3"/> their lack of glamour although they wear very nice pyjamas but but nevertheless they they're kind of <pause dur="0.4"/> # just like middle-aged men going to bed and in fact <pause dur="0.5"/> are musing over the <trunc>a</trunc> the issue of ageing <pause dur="0.2"/> # and <pause dur="0.2"/> Truffaut said in his review of the film <pause dur="0.3"/> # that apart from saying <pause dur="0.2"/> what happens is less important than how it happens <pause dur="0.2"/> and this scene demonstrates that it's not <pause dur="0.2"/> what happens <pause dur="0.3"/> it's the how <pause dur="0.3"/> it's it's the relationship <pause dur="0.3"/> between these men which is the depicted purely in terms of everyday quotidian actions like <pause dur="0.3"/> going to do your teeth <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> but Truffaut # also said that this is a film about ageing it's about about turning <pause dur="0.3"/> fifty and so on and so forth and <pause dur="0.4"/> as you you've noticed what when you watched the film this morning it's got a lot of you know # remarks about <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> wanting to retire getting old being tired and so on and <pause dur="0.3"/> when Riton looks at his the bags under his eyes you 
recall that it refers to an earlier conversation where <pause dur="0.2"/> Max says you know look at yourself you know <pause dur="0.2"/> you should you should retire you know you've had enough <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> so <pause dur="0.3"/> that but but it it's it's very much <pause dur="0.2"/> that that sort of that sense of muted everyday <pause dur="0.4"/> action <pause dur="0.3"/> which is at the centre of the film <pause dur="0.4"/> and yet <pause dur="0.2"/> this is a gangster movie this is a film about <pause dur="0.3"/> gangsters and about criminals <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> so <pause dur="0.2"/> it seems seems to me to <pause dur="0.4"/> to <pause dur="0.3"/> <trunc>emph</trunc> to really focus <pause dur="0.3"/> on <pause dur="0.2"/> that hybrid <pause dur="0.2"/> between <pause dur="0.2"/> a French style of <distinct lang="fr">mise en scÃ¨ne</distinct> <pause dur="0.3"/> and an American type of narrative and also iconography <pause dur="1.0"/> okay <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> two other points about # the the Franco-American # relationship in the film <pause dur="0.4"/> one is to do with the use of foreigners and foreignness in the films <pause dur="0.4"/> # that <pause dur="1.0"/> you will have noticed in Grisbi but this is true in Rififi and you will see that in Bob that <pause dur="0.4"/> # all the <trunc>poli</trunc> the French policiers of that period very much emphasize <pause dur="0.3"/> foreign characters # <trunc>a</trunc> among the French characters <pause dur="0.3"/> now # there's of course the Eddie 
Constantine film where he's <pause dur="0.2"/> clearly an American <pause dur="0.3"/> but in in the the the more typical <trunc>g</trunc> French gangster films of the mid and late fifties <pause dur="0.3"/> what we have is a lot of <pause dur="0.4"/> Italians and a lot of Corsicans <pause dur="0.2"/> now that <pause dur="0.2"/> refers to <pause dur="0.2"/> # there's there's the <trunc>ref</trunc> referential reality of <pause dur="0.4"/> # the Corsican Mafia <pause dur="0.2"/> which was an important part of the French underworld <pause dur="0.3"/> # and <pause dur="0.3"/> also <pause dur="0.2"/> with the Italians <pause dur="0.2"/> a kind of nod towards the American gangster film and references to the Italian # <pause dur="0.3"/> and Sicilian Mafia <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.8"/> but <pause dur="0.4"/> also <pause dur="0.2"/> one might want to see <trunc>thi</trunc> this emphasis on foreign characters <pause dur="0.3"/> # and and and look at how <pause dur="0.4"/> # they # behave in relation to the French ones <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> as another # displaced image of the relationship between France and America in the films <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> that <pause dur="0.3"/> the <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> the contrast between the behaviour of the French characters <pause dur="0.3"/> and the behaviour of the non-French characters <pause dur="0.2"/> is always to the advantage of the French ones <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> that the <pause dur="0.3"/> non-French characters tend to be the one <pause dur="0.2"/> who betray <pause dur="0.2"/> who are weak <pause dur="0.3"/> # et cetera <pause dur="0.2"/> so that <pause dur="0.3"/> what what what 
what one has there i think <pause dur="0.2"/> encapsulated is the way in which <pause dur="0.3"/> the films play <pause dur="0.5"/> very often on on a <trunc>f</trunc> on on one level <pause dur="0.4"/> on <pause dur="0.3"/> contrasting unfavourably the French characters they tend to be <pause dur="0.3"/> less good-looking # <pause dur="0.4"/> less slim less athletic and so on <pause dur="0.2"/> so on the surface <pause dur="0.2"/> there there's a kind of parody of of # <pause dur="0.2"/> particular <trunc>att</trunc> # French attitude <pause dur="0.2"/> yet at the same time <pause dur="0.2"/> the narrative resolution usually gives them the upper hand <pause dur="0.2"/> so <pause dur="0.2"/> there's a kind of interesting # play there on <pause dur="0.2"/> # national identity <pause dur="0.4"/> # and as i say one can read it as as a displacement of <pause dur="0.3"/> # Franco-American <pause dur="0.2"/> relationship <pause dur="0.9"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> and # <trunc>w</trunc> <pause dur="0.3"/> as one goes towards the late fifties and the early sixties and we'll we'll see that # <pause dur="0.6"/> when we look at # Alphaville and talk about the new wave <pause dur="0.3"/> and the new wave attitude to the thriller <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> there there's there's a more overt # move towards imitating American characters # everybody knows about <pause dur="0.4"/> Jean-Paul Belmondo in A Bout de Souffle imitating Bogart <pause dur="0.3"/> there's a more <pause dur="0.2"/> kind of self-conscious <pause dur="0.3"/> # play <pause dur="0.2"/> on on 
Frenchness and non-Frenchness <pause dur="0.3"/> but in those mid-fifties gangster film <pause dur="0.3"/> it's the Italians and the Corsicans and also and <pause dur="0.2"/> the kind of Latin characters or # <pause dur="0.2"/> characters with <pause dur="0.3"/> perhaps not to you but to French people <pause dur="0.2"/> foreign sounding names like <trunc>an</trunc> Angelo for example <pause dur="0.3"/> and so on <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> at the same time <pause dur="0.2"/> note that <pause dur="0.4"/> all the main characters in the film the French characters <pause dur="0.2"/> have American sounding names <pause dur="0.2"/> so <pause dur="0.4"/> it's no accident that the heroes are called Max <pause dur="0.3"/> Bob <pause dur="0.7"/> Tony <pause dur="0.4"/> right in Rififi <pause dur="0.2"/> Tony le StÃ©phanois <pause dur="0.4"/> # in in Grisbi we have Max le Menteur <pause dur="0.4"/> and in # <pause dur="0.7"/> Bob we have Bob le Flambeur <distinct lang="fr">le flambeur</distinct> means the gambler <pause dur="0.3"/> in in slang <pause dur="0.3"/> so <pause dur="0.2"/> that </u><pause dur="0.2"/> <u who="sm0073" trans="pause"> <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/></u><u who="nf0069" trans="overlap"> as if you <trunc>y</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> sorry </u><pause dur="0.5"/> <u who="sm0073" trans="pause"> i thought it was somebody with the name FlambÃ© <vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" n="ss" dur="2"/></u> <pause dur="0.8"/> <u who="nf0069" trans="pause"> <shift feature="voice" new="laugh"/> well <shift feature="voice" new="normal"/><pause dur="0.9"/> well <pause dur="0.3"/> <distinct lang="fr">flambÃ©</distinct> in slang means means # yes <distinct lang="fr">flambÃ©</distinct> means to burn but it's it means <pause dur="0.2"/> in slang it means to play to gamble <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> and # <pause dur="1.0"/> the <pause dur="0.6"/> you remember what i said about <pause dur="0.3"/> PÃ©pÃ©

what you have is music that is <pause dur="0.4"/> clearly influenced by jazz music by American jazz music <pause dur="0.4"/> but <pause dur="0.3"/> is <pause dur="0.2"/> very often composed by French composers <pause dur="0.3"/> # and # the <pause dur="0.6"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> the what we can measure the success they had <pause dur="0.3"/> by the fact that <pause dur="0.3"/> the the theme tune in both Grisbi and Rififi <pause dur="0.3"/> became # big hits in in the mid-fifties and <pause dur="0.4"/> # <kinesic desc="holds up sheet music" iterated="n"/> this is the sheet music for Grisbi <pause dur="0.3"/> # # and <pause dur="0.4"/> apparently <pause dur="0.2"/> the film started a mini craze for harmonica <pause dur="0.3"/> # music # at at the time # <pause dur="0.4"/> thanks to the success of the # of the theme tune <pause dur="0.4"/> Grisbi which you remember is Max's tune <pause dur="0.3"/> the <trunc>f</trunc> one of the first things he says is <pause dur="0.3"/> i'm going to put my tune on # <pause dur="0.3"/> yeah <pause dur="0.2"/> remember <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.8"/> and think about when you see Bob # # in a in a little while <pause dur="0.4"/> think about the the role that that music plays # <pause dur="0.4"/> in <pause dur="0.2"/> setting that hybrid mood between <pause dur="0.2"/> Frenchness and Americanness # aurally in a <trunc>s</trunc> and and how that interacts with <pause dur="0.3"/> the way <pause dur="0.3"/> the <distinct lang="fr">mise en scÃ¨ne</distinct> and the narrative work <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> visually <pause dur="0.8"/> so # <pause dur="1.1"/> and the the <trunc>l</trunc>
