<u who="nm0079"> okay well # <pause dur="0.6"/> today we're # <pause dur="0.9"/> going to be carrying on with the # French Revolution you may have noticed i was sort of getting rather # <pause dur="0.4"/> enthusiastic and carried away at the end of the last one i was sort of almost # like i sort of started at the beginning about someone standing on a coffee table and <trunc>s</trunc> shouting to arms citizens <pause dur="0.5"/> as if i was going to sort of <pause dur="0.5"/> leap up on the desk and say to arms let's storm <pause dur="0.6"/> the Rootes Social Building <vocal desc="laughter" n="ss" iterated="y" dur="1"/> or # let's go out arm in arm singing the Marseillaise or something # like that <pause dur="0.4"/> well this is obviously <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.9"/> partly at least because the revolution the French Revolution <pause dur="0.4"/> # resonates with something about us about the sort of political life that we lead the <pause dur="0.4"/> # way in the some type of society <pause dur="0.3"/> in which we # live <pause dur="0.4"/> and this is one of the reasons why historians have thought it # important because it does seem to set <pause dur="0.3"/> as i think i mentioned to you in a previous # <pause dur="0.5"/> # lecture <pause dur="0.2"/> set the sort of framework <pause dur="0.4"/> set the framework in 
existence <pause dur="0.4"/> # through <pause dur="0.3"/> within which we still live much of our <pause dur="0.3"/> political <pause dur="0.2"/> and # <pause dur="0.5"/> social life <pause dur="0.9"/> sets a sort of # agenda if you like of what we expect as <pause dur="0.2"/> participants within <pause dur="0.2"/> the type of society in which we <pause dur="0.3"/> we live <pause dur="0.4"/> so the declaration of the rights of man <pause dur="0.3"/> which # as i said came out on the twenty-sixth of <trunc>w</trunc> was issued by this new <pause dur="0.4"/> national assembly <pause dur="0.3"/> representing the nation the French nation for the first time <pause dur="0.4"/> # # # an elected body which # <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> worked according to a new constitution new written constitutional <pause dur="0.3"/> # # # <pause dur="0.4"/> <trunc>s</trunc> # <trunc>o</trunc> <pause dur="0.8"/> settlement <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> this provides a set of <pause dur="0.6"/> rights <pause dur="0.5"/> which are <pause dur="0.5"/> not <pause dur="0.2"/> privileges of # a set of corporate groups not the sort of privileges of the nobility or the privileges of the clergy or the privileges of such and such a <pause dur="0.3"/> a town or cathedral or whatever <pause dur="0.4"/> they are rights which every man <pause dur="0.5"/> # it is held <pause dur="0.3"/> # has <pause dur="0.2"/> and that <pause dur="0.4"/> that declaration is one of the biggest <pause dur="0.4"/> intellectual influences cultural influences <pause dur="0.4"/> on <pause dur="1.2"/> the United Nation Declaration of Human Rights <pause dur="0.3"/> which was issued 
in nineteen-forty-seven and as as i say is you know the way in which we think about not just <pause dur="0.3"/> our own government not just European governments <pause dur="0.3"/> but world governments the way in which we think # <pause dur="0.2"/> # societies ought to operate in a fair and just <pause dur="0.3"/> and equal way <pause dur="0.4"/> so for example the freedom of speech the freedom <pause dur="0.3"/> to publish <pause dur="0.3"/> # the right to <pause dur="0.3"/> # live in a society without fear of arbitrary <pause dur="0.3"/> # arrest <pause dur="0.3"/> the right to <pause dur="0.2"/> # have a religion # religious views <pause dur="0.3"/> # of your own without any sort of harassment <pause dur="0.4"/> # from the state the right to have <trunc>pe</trunc> <pause dur="0.8"/> to have political rights if you like to belong to a nation <trunc>w</trunc> # in such a way that # <pause dur="0.3"/> # # a political entity i should say <pause dur="0.2"/> in such a way that you actually your views are heard <pause dur="0.3"/> you have a a a a a a role in shaping the political system <pause dur="0.5"/> in some ways <pause dur="0.3"/> the French Revolution really sets that out in a sort of model way for the # first time in in a way which is <pause dur="0.5"/> durably extremely <pause dur="0.2"/> influential <pause dur="0.4"/> so that when we think about <pause dur="0.2"/> seventeen-eighty-nine when we think 
about the French Revolution <pause dur="0.5"/> we think about that movement of elan that movement of tremendous energy <pause dur="0.3"/> and excitement and enthusiasm <pause dur="0.3"/> when new things suddenly seem to be possible <pause dur="0.3"/> when a new epoch <pause dur="0.3"/> in human history seemed to be <pause dur="0.2"/> # starting up it's not for an <trunc>ac</trunc> it's not by any accident <pause dur="0.3"/> although it was a couple of years after seventeen-eighty-nine in fact <pause dur="0.6"/> that the French Revolutionaries introduced their own calendar a new calendar to get rid of the old <pause dur="0.3"/> # religious # # calendar which existed and to <pause dur="0.3"/> create a <pause dur="0.2"/> a calendar which and it's an amazingly obvious # sort of enlightenment # reference here <pause dur="0.3"/> a calendar which somehow reflected <pause dur="0.3"/> nature so months were named after <pause dur="0.6"/> weather conditions and types of # <pause dur="0.3"/> # the seasons were named after after after # <pause dur="1.0"/> after sort of natural objects the days were <pause dur="0.2"/> not saints' days but # <pause dur="0.3"/> # # plants and flowers and things like that <pause dur="0.3"/> so the idea that a new epoch has been created and the revolutionary calendar starts <pause dur="0.4"/> from year one <pause dur="0.4"/> 
you know to get rid of <pause dur="0.2"/> seventeen-eighty-nine and we go to a new calendar in human history so this idea of a new <pause dur="0.4"/> opening and <trunc>ne</trunc> new possibilities <pause dur="0.5"/> and with that the idea and this of course is something which is true of many revolutions the idea <pause dur="0.2"/> that <pause dur="0.6"/> the revolution could create could <pause dur="0.2"/> could # <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> reorganize society <pause dur="0.4"/> rationally <pause dur="0.3"/> yeah again a very enlightenment sort of project <pause dur="0.4"/> # in a way <pause dur="0.3"/> # that <pause dur="0.3"/> # everyone <pause dur="0.2"/> had a say <pause dur="0.3"/> everyone had a say <pause dur="0.3"/> and this would produce a new type of human individual no longer <pause dur="0.3"/> a subject no longer a sort of person who just follows orders <pause dur="0.3"/> # but a citizen <pause dur="0.2"/> equal in rights equality before the law <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> # to all other # <pause dur="0.2"/> # citizens this idea of a new man <pause dur="0.4"/> the nation the French nation <pause dur="0.2"/> would be regenerated in this way a new species of humanity <pause dur="0.3"/> would evolve <pause dur="0.3"/> and France would be in the sort of vanguard of a transformation <pause dur="0.2"/> of the whole of the world <pause dur="0.4"/> France was sort of leading the way <pause dur="0.2"/> in pioneering fashion <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> # towards a new # future <pause dur="0.4"/> and that's exciting <pause dur="0.3"/> and that 
because it links up with # # <pause dur="0.2"/> you know some of the things which we still feel <pause dur="0.5"/> is one reason why people look back to the revolution and think incredibly positive things about it <pause dur="1.9"/> but <pause dur="1.8"/> on the other hand <pause dur="1.2"/> what do we think about <pause dur="0.7"/> when <pause dur="0.2"/> another part of our mind <pause dur="0.2"/> thinks about the French Revolution <pause dur="0.7"/> it thinks <pause dur="1.0"/> guillotines <pause dur="0.4"/> it thinks <pause dur="0.5"/> reign of terror <pause dur="0.8"/> it thinks <pause dur="0.5"/> # a chilling <pause dur="0.3"/> bureaucracy <pause dur="0.7"/> it thinks <pause dur="0.2"/> a revolutionary tribunal <pause dur="0.5"/> # it thinks the mass execution <pause dur="0.4"/> of peasants men women and children <pause dur="0.3"/> in areas of # France <pause dur="0.2"/> which were not <pause dur="0.7"/> as excited <pause dur="0.2"/> about this new revolutionary beginning <pause dur="0.3"/> # as others it thinks about war <pause dur="0.4"/> it thinks about a war of <trunc>y</trunc> of France and revolution <pause dur="0.3"/> against just about the whole of the rest # of Europe <pause dur="0.6"/> and it's for this reason that i've sort of put the in the first heading there <pause dur="0.2"/> the term paradox <pause dur="0.5"/> you know <pause dur="0.5"/> that that is one of the great things about the revolutionary legacy if you like to the rest of the nineteenth century <pause dur="0.3"/> that there is this sense of paradox about # about 
the French Revolution <pause dur="0.4"/> which <pause dur="0.2"/> the whole of the nineteenth century really is intensely engaged with and <pause dur="0.2"/> which still in the twentieth century <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> we can we can sort of still sort of understand on the one hand the revolution <pause dur="0.3"/> as new opening new beginning <pause dur="0.4"/> # new possibilities the regeneration <pause dur="0.3"/> of the human <pause dur="0.2"/> # species <pause dur="0.4"/> on the other <pause dur="0.6"/> the revolution as <pause dur="0.2"/> an an instrument of terror <pause dur="0.3"/> of repression <pause dur="0.4"/> # a sort of early eighteenth century version <pause dur="0.3"/> # of the kind of totalitarian democracy <pause dur="0.4"/> totalitarian repression the totalitarian regimes i mean <pause dur="0.4"/> # which <pause dur="0.2"/> with which we've become depressingly familiar <pause dur="0.4"/> # in the late # <trunc>twentie</trunc> by the late # twentieth century <pause dur="0.6"/> so that sort of paradox the <trunc>posti</trunc> pluses and the minuses is what i want to sort of <pause dur="0.4"/> put absolutely in front of you <pause dur="0.3"/> # today <pause dur="0.3"/> i put it <trunc>un</trunc> <pause dur="0.3"/> <trunc>t</trunc> at the start of the lecture i put it under this # <pause dur="1.0"/> heading living paradoxes <pause dur="0.4"/> because it <pause dur="0.5"/> the emphasis i'd like to <pause dur="0.4"/> place is that <pause dur="1.2"/> people <pause dur="0.2"/> just normal individuals <pause dur="0.4"/> had to try and live through the 
two aspects of the # revolution and try somehow keep them in <pause dur="0.5"/> within the same sort of # box in their in their lives <pause dur="0.3"/> # in in the # in the seventeen-nineties <pause dur="0.3"/> and many groups found it <pause dur="0.2"/> too difficult to keep those <pause dur="0.2"/> things <pause dur="0.6"/> you know together <pause dur="0.4"/> # and <pause dur="0.3"/> what you actually see in the revolution is an increased <pause dur="0.3"/> polarization <pause dur="0.3"/> of # society <pause dur="0.2"/> a pro <pause dur="0.2"/> enthusiastically pro the revolution <pause dur="0.3"/> and an <shift feature="voice" new="laugh"/>enthusiastically <shift feature="voice" new="normal"/> against the revolution a counter-revolutionary <pause dur="0.4"/> # movement as well <pause dur="0.3"/> a revolution which has stressed <pause dur="0.3"/> harmony <pause dur="0.2"/> equality <pause dur="0.5"/> every community everyone being in together <pause dur="0.5"/> i mean the best illustration which historians usually give of that is <pause dur="0.3"/> it's the <trunc>s</trunc> the first celebration of the fourteenth of July <pause dur="0.7"/> which was obviously a year later in seventeen-ninety <pause dur="0.2"/> the French have what <pause dur="0.2"/> # the in in Paris they create this enormous sort of amphitheatre <pause dur="0.3"/> people come up from every part of France they have an enormous civil <pause dur="0.3"/> # <trunc>festi</trunc> a civic festival <pause dur="0.2"/> this so-called <distinct lang="fr">fête de la fédération</distinct> 
the the festival of the federation <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> symbolizing i think this idea of the new unity the new indivisibility of the new # regime <pause dur="0.5"/> and yet even by seventeen-ninety i think <pause dur="0.3"/> the fissures are opening up <pause dur="1.1"/> let me start <pause dur="0.3"/> let me start at the top <pause dur="1.6"/><event desc="takes off jumper" iterated="n"/> sorry i'm not just going # it sounds like i'm doing a striptease <vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" dur="2"/> if i don't take my # pullover <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> which wasn't the intention at all <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.8"/> let's start with the king <pause dur="1.2"/> there's a really good engraving i've i'm sorry i meant to bring it along <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> it's an engraving of Louis the Sixteenth and it's an engraving <pause dur="0.5"/> originally done under the Ancien Régime so he's looking i don't know if you've ever seen a picture of Louis the Sixteenth but he's trying to look serious <pause dur="0.6"/> which is difficult for Louis the Sixteenth because he's very very he's a simpleton really he's he's well meaning but <pause dur="0.5"/> you know profoundly <pause dur="0.5"/> silly <pause dur="0.3"/> # a twerp in # in # breeches <pause dur="0.3"/> # Louis the Sixteenth and he's there sort of looking in this bovine way <pause dur="0.4"/> and the 
genre of the engraving is sort of very sort of adulatory you know trying to make him look good he's got a star and he's you know looking good <pause dur="1.2"/> Ancien Régime version of the king <pause dur="0.3"/> okay on the top of this on the top of his head like just painted on the top <pause dur="0.4"/> is a big red bonnet <pause dur="0.3"/> the bonnet which came to symbolize <pause dur="0.2"/> revolutionary patriotism <pause dur="0.5"/> it was actually <pause dur="0.7"/> # the idea of a red bonnet to symbolize freedom and equality <pause dur="0.3"/> came from <pause dur="0.3"/> the red bonnet which in antiquity <pause dur="0.3"/> was given to slaves who had been freed <pause dur="0.4"/> okay so under in <pause dur="0.2"/> # ancient Rome <pause dur="0.3"/> if you were a slave you got freedom you could wear the red bonnet to show that you were <pause dur="0.2"/> emancipated as a slave <pause dur="0.3"/> and the revolutionaries pick up on this idea because they have been slaves allegedly <pause dur="0.3"/> under the Ancien Régime and now they are free men <pause dur="0.6"/> and what <pause dur="0.5"/> <trunc>thi</trunc> and with this moreover goes a <distinct lang="fr">tricolore</distinct> the <distinct lang="fr">tricolore</distinct> flag <trunc>a</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> but a <distinct lang="fr">tricolore</distinct> <pause dur="0.2"/> <distinct lang="fr">coquet</distinct> the <distinct lang="fr">tricolore</distinct> is the <pause dur="0.5"/> mixture of the colours of Paris <pause dur="0.2"/> the the ceremonial colours of Paris <pause dur="0.4"/> red and blue <pause dur="0.3"/> 
# with the white <pause dur="0.4"/> colour which is the Bourbon the Bourbon dynasty the the the royal dynasty's <pause dur="0.3"/> # ceremonial colour so putting these together <pause dur="0.3"/> seems to symbolize that new <pause dur="0.3"/> new unity <pause dur="0.4"/> okay so you've got <pause dur="0.2"/> Louis the Sixteenth in this sort of <pause dur="0.7"/> # Ancien Régime type of engraving with on his <trunc>ho</trunc> sort of painted <trunc>i</trunc> on in this sort of very crude way <pause dur="0.3"/> a red bonnet a revolutionary <distinct lang="fr">coquet</distinct> and for me what that painting says is <pause dur="0.6"/> can Louis the Sixteenth <pause dur="0.3"/> be <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> a free man <pause dur="1.0"/> can Louis the Sixteenth adapt to a new type of # <pause dur="0.4"/> # political system <pause dur="0.4"/> in which <pause dur="0.2"/> he is not <pause dur="0.4"/> God's representative on Earth who everyone has to obey because he's allegedly absolute monarch <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> # the only sort of representative of the of the French nation <pause dur="0.3"/> he has to work within a new political system which is totally new to him <pause dur="0.4"/> # totally foreign and different and difficult for him to accept <pause dur="0.2"/> that he is just one agent of the French nation <pause dur="0.4"/> he's called the King of the French now and the idea is that he is the <pause dur="0.4"/> the executive arm of 
a of an elected assembly <pause dur="0.3"/> # the <pause dur="0.4"/> national assembly <pause dur="0.2"/> which has come into existence in seventeen-eighty-nine <pause dur="0.3"/> which he hasn't <pause dur="0.3"/> very little control of he can veto legislation a little but not very much frankly <pause dur="0.4"/> the sort of sovereignty <pause dur="0.4"/> # in the # within France has shifted from the body the person <pause dur="0.3"/> of the monarch <pause dur="0.3"/> to this national assembly this new national assembly <pause dur="0.3"/> and within that <trunc>sit</trunc> situation <pause dur="0.4"/> can Louis the Sixteenth cope <pause dur="0.3"/> can he <pause dur="0.3"/> can he sort of # deal with this new political <pause dur="0.2"/> # arrangement <pause dur="0.3"/> i've got # <kinesic desc="turns on overhead projector showing transparency" iterated="n"/> sort of a few dates for you there to to look at i might mention some of these things as we <pause dur="0.3"/> # go through <pause dur="2.0"/> well can he <pause dur="0.6"/> can he cope <pause dur="0.4"/> no he can't cope <pause dur="0.4"/> # throughout seventeen-eighty-nine and ninety we find him endlessly vacillating wanting to <pause dur="0.3"/> sort of half accept things then <pause dur="0.2"/> sort of falling back on <pause dur="0.3"/> # when he's sort of pressed he's very very lukewarm about the revolution <pause dur="0.3"/> in a way that many people who 
are enthusiastic <pause dur="0.2"/> revolutionaries <pause dur="0.3"/> find extremely difficult # to to take <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> and their patience becomes increasingly <pause dur="0.2"/> tested <pause dur="0.7"/> now what are the things that Louis the Sixteenth finds difficult to accept well obviously the reduction in his own power that's a <pause dur="0.3"/> that's the first thing <pause dur="0.5"/> but i think also he finds <pause dur="0.3"/> two other areas of the new revolutionary <pause dur="0.3"/> situation the new political <pause dur="0.6"/> # system <pause dur="0.2"/> of post-seventeen-eighty-nine France <pause dur="0.3"/> very difficult to cope with <pause dur="0.5"/> first of all the reduction of the nobility's status the idea that the nobility <pause dur="0.3"/> who were you know <pause dur="0.2"/> the most powerful group of individuals within <pause dur="0.3"/> # France <pause dur="0.3"/> # they were <trunc>s</trunc> <pause dur="0.3"/> allegedly the second estate you know the ones who above the third estate above everyone else <pause dur="0.4"/> these too have to accept that they are normal citizens as well indeed in seventeen-ninety <pause dur="0.2"/> all titles are abolished <pause dur="0.3"/> # throughout France so you're not allowed to call yourself the Duke of this the Marquis of that or or whatever <pause dur="0.3"/> you have to take 
normal <trunc>li</trunc> normal names like everyone else <pause dur="0.3"/> and many of the privileges and rights which they have # <pause dur="0.5"/> had for literally <pause dur="0.4"/> more than a millennia in many # <pause dur="0.2"/> # cases are <pause dur="0.2"/> removed them <pause dur="0.3"/> removed from them one of the <pause dur="0.3"/> # things which <trunc>k</trunc> happens in seventeen-eighty-nine which makes this such an important powerful <pause dur="0.3"/> national movement <pause dur="0.3"/> is the peasants <pause dur="0.3"/> # rising in seventeen-eighty-nine following the # <pause dur="0.2"/> overthrow of the Bastille <pause dur="0.4"/> # which leads to the abolition of feudalism the abolition of many of the senorial and feudal rights <pause dur="0.3"/> which the nobility in particular although other social groups as well <pause dur="0.2"/> have maintained so the nobility is <pause dur="0.4"/> losing its rights losing its power losing its <pause dur="0.3"/> its sort of status within French society <pause dur="0.4"/> and putting a lot of pressure <pause dur="0.2"/> on the king <pause dur="0.3"/> # to stand by their <trunc>f</trunc> <pause dur="0.4"/> you know the king is a noble he's the first of all nobles the first of <trunc>ar</trunc> most aristocratic of all aristocrats if you like <pause dur="0.5"/> # he <pause dur="0.2"/> the nobility are putting pressure on him not to fall in with this new 
revolutionary system but to stick <pause dur="0.3"/> by their rights <pause dur="1.0"/> one way in one thing which this <pause dur="0.2"/> which many of these nobles were starting to do in <trunc>sevente</trunc> well even in seventeen-eighty-nine but particularly in seventeen-ninety and ninety-one <pause dur="0.3"/> is to emigrate <pause dur="0.6"/> to get out of France they just say this is hopeless we're getting out you know <pause dur="0.3"/> # this is a sort of political system we don't like <pause dur="0.5"/> they emigrate and they <trunc>s</trunc> try and put pressure on the political leaders of other countries particularly in Germany <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> # to <trunc>s</trunc> <pause dur="0.5"/> to build up <pause dur="0.2"/> an army <pause dur="0.5"/> on the French frontiers which will <pause dur="0.2"/> frighten the French out of their sort of revolutionary ways so the émigrés the emigrated <pause dur="0.3"/> nobles other groups as well but the nobles are the most important <pause dur="0.4"/> start <pause dur="0.4"/> talking <pause dur="0.2"/> conspiracy they start conspiring in some of the provinces but <pause dur="0.2"/> outside France they're trying to make <pause dur="0.4"/> # the overthrow of the new revolutionary government <pause dur="0.3"/> on the top of the agenda <pause dur="0.2"/> of most of the European rulers <pause dur="0.2"/> okay so already you've got a 
sort of sense of polarization there <pause dur="0.3"/> # coming up # very strongly <pause dur="0.4"/> so the king <pause dur="0.5"/> is worried about his own position he's worried about that of the nobility <pause dur="0.3"/> he's worried too and i think this cannot be underestimated <pause dur="0.7"/> or overestimated whichever <pause dur="0.4"/> word is right <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> the <trunc>n</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> clergy <pause dur="0.5"/> okay <pause dur="0.3"/> religion <pause dur="1.1"/> now i didn't when i was talking about the Enlightenment <pause dur="0.7"/> i didn't say that much about # religion <pause dur="0.5"/> i emphasized <pause dur="0.3"/> the changes in # <pause dur="0.2"/> in ideas which the Enlightenment had brought about i emphasized how <pause dur="0.3"/> the ideas of the Enlightenment circular circulate <pause dur="0.3"/> among social groups and in settings and urban setting <pause dur="0.3"/> # in which they obviously are doing # doing very well <pause dur="0.5"/> but <pause dur="0.6"/> if one looked at the total picture of France <pause dur="0.2"/> # in seventeen-eighty-nine <pause dur="0.4"/> one would <pause dur="0.4"/> probably say that most <pause dur="0.2"/> of the population <pause dur="0.2"/> are still Catholics <pause dur="0.3"/> and many of them are intensely <pause dur="0.3"/> # Catholic <pause dur="0.5"/> okay <pause dur="1.2"/> when the revolution <trunc>fixt</trunc> it first comes out <pause dur="0.3"/> # first occurs many people <pause dur="0.2"/> don't see a problem with that <pause dur="0.2"/> they don't see that # a revolution need 
necessarily be anticlerical <pause dur="0.3"/> in fact the <distinct lang="fr">fête de la fédération</distinct> which i mentioned to you which is this sort of celebration of harmony and unity <pause dur="0.4"/> in # seventeen-ninety <pause dur="0.2"/> is in fact celebrated by a Te Deum there is actually a an altar at the centre of this enormous sort of amphitheatre <pause dur="0.2"/> where someone # you know <pause dur="0.2"/> celebrates # a Mass and # <pause dur="0.2"/> so in other words religion is part of the new sort of revolutionary # <pause dur="0.3"/> # sort of culture <pause dur="0.8"/> but it doesn't last like that for very long <pause dur="0.7"/> if you remember <pause dur="0.2"/> the reason why the state is having a revolution at all in seventeen-eighty-nine is because of its financial problems <pause dur="0.3"/> it's facing bankruptcy <pause dur="0.4"/> and one of the first things that the revolutionary assembly <pause dur="0.2"/> does in seventeen-eighty-nine <pause dur="0.4"/> is try and seek a way out of that <pause dur="0.4"/> by <pause dur="0.5"/> nationalizing church property <pause dur="0.3"/> church owns probably between six and ten per cent of the total cultivable land <pause dur="0.3"/> # within France between six and ten per cent <pause dur="0.2"/> so straightaway as soon as you've 
nationalized that <pause dur="0.4"/> you're basically you're going to be all right financially that's a lot of money coming in <pause dur="0.4"/> in return for that nationalization of land <pause dur="0.3"/> the church says <pause dur="0.4"/> we will <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> reorganize the church <pause dur="0.4"/> now <trunc>w</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> it reorganizes the church along <pause dur="0.3"/> lines which you'd expect because as i say the influence of the Enlightenment is very clear <pause dur="0.2"/> which are rational <pause dur="0.5"/> # straightforward <pause dur="0.4"/> administratively very clear-cut <pause dur="0.4"/> okay <pause dur="0.9"/> many people within the church accept that <pause dur="0.5"/> they accept that the revolution the revolutionary <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> has the right to <pause dur="0.3"/> impose a new structure <pause dur="0.3"/> on the French church <pause dur="0.9"/> many however <pause dur="0.5"/> do not <pause dur="1.6"/> what happens in seventeen-ninety seventeen-ninety-one the so-called Civil Constitution of the Clergy which is voted through a new constitution for the clergy as well which will be written into the in the # <pause dur="0.2"/> # political constitution as well <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.9"/> so there'll be salaries for priests there'll only be one bishop <pause dur="0.2"/> in every department <pause dur="0.3"/> # most monastic orders lose their property and <pause dur="0.3"/> the monks and

'cause they're religious <pause dur="0.3"/> to be against the # revolution <pause dur="1.4"/> what happens in seventeen-ninety-one and ninety-two is that <pause dur="0.2"/> the <pause dur="0.2"/> the national assembly realizing that France is divided on this <pause dur="0.3"/> imposes an oath <pause dur="0.3"/> of loyalty to the new civil constitution <pause dur="0.6"/> if you vote for it <pause dur="0.3"/> fine you know you can stay within the church you can become a priest # you can become a bishop you you know you <pause dur="0.3"/> everything will work well for you you are like a state <pause dur="0.2"/> civil servant <pause dur="0.3"/> for religion <pause dur="0.8"/> if you don't however if you don't vote for it <pause dur="0.3"/> # then <pause dur="0.3"/> basically <pause dur="0.3"/> you're out <pause dur="0.3"/> you <trunc>wha</trunc> you haven't got the right to any position within the church you lose your salary you lose any <pause dur="0.3"/> any sort of rights to a pension <pause dur="1.6"/> late seventeen-ninety there is an oath <pause dur="0.5"/> the clergy splits <pause dur="0.4"/> down the middle <pause dur="0.3"/> roughly half # vote for the <pause dur="0.2"/> constitution civil constitution half against <pause dur="0.5"/> interestingly you know is that just the clergy <pause dur="0.2"/> which it takes <pause dur="0.3"/> it's the clergy who are half for half against <pause dur="0.5"/> very interesting work been done in recent years by an American 
historian called Timothy Tackett <pause dur="0.3"/> T-A-C-K-E-double-T <pause dur="0.9"/> and what he argues i think it's a convincing argument if you read the book <pause dur="0.4"/> is that <pause dur="0.5"/> that <pause dur="0.2"/> that oath which you know obviously it's the clergy that take <pause dur="0.3"/> fact that's like a sort of <pause dur="0.4"/> popularity poll on the revolution by the whole of the French nation <pause dur="0.4"/> because the people who are voting you know for it for the oath the clergy <pause dur="0.4"/> are under pressure <pause dur="0.2"/> from their parishioners or from the people in their <pause dur="0.2"/> # neighbourhood to vote one way or another <pause dur="0.4"/> in other words <pause dur="0.3"/> the <pause dur="0.2"/> complexion <pause dur="0.3"/> of # the <pause dur="0.2"/> the sort of <pause dur="0.3"/> religious the the geography if you like of voting for <pause dur="0.3"/> and voting against is is mapped over <pause dur="0.2"/> a sort of <pause dur="0.3"/> <trunc>s</trunc> a regional geography of <pause dur="0.6"/> pro-church and anti-church <pause dur="0.2"/> feeling <pause dur="0.9"/> and this <pause dur="0.6"/> in France at least and i think this is not just France but <pause dur="0.2"/> you know France is very very clear <pause dur="0.2"/> this vote of seventeen-ninety-one <pause dur="0.3"/> divides France for the rest of the seventeen-nineties <pause dur="0.2"/> and indeed to a very considerable extent <pause dur="0.2"/> for the next two centuries <pause dur="0.6"/> if you 
look <pause dur="0.2"/> for example at <pause dur="0.3"/> who votes right and who votes left <pause dur="0.3"/> in <pause dur="0.5"/> it's not so clear actually it must be said in the nineteen-eighties and nineteen-nineties but if you look in nineteen-<pause dur="0.2"/>seventies <pause dur="0.3"/> look at you know the voting pattern who's you know like in England <pause dur="0.4"/> north of England normally votes # <pause dur="0.3"/> # Labour the south <pause dur="0.2"/> well you know i know it's been different since # Blair but you know that's usually the sort of what we expect <pause dur="0.6"/> in France <pause dur="0.4"/> you look at the map <pause dur="0.2"/> and you see that the <trunc>righ</trunc> the places which vote right <pause dur="0.3"/> and are therefore tend to be pro-supporting <pause dur="0.2"/> # supportive of the church <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> places like <pause dur="0.2"/> the <pause dur="0.2"/> Brittany in particular <pause dur="0.2"/> in the west the Massif Central <pause dur="0.2"/> these are very precisely the areas which voted against the civil constitution <pause dur="0.3"/> in seventeen-ninety so in other words <pause dur="0.4"/> religion <pause dur="0.2"/> has broken apart has has <pause dur="0.4"/> <trunc>crea</trunc> created a massive fissure <pause dur="0.2"/> within the <trunc>rev</trunc> new revolutionary nation <pause dur="0.3"/> which had been established in # seventeen-ninety <pause dur="0.3"/> the clergy therefore had to live this 
paradox <pause dur="0.5"/> # seventeen-eighty-nine had seemed to open up # a new a new era to them <pause dur="0.3"/> they had to accept that <pause dur="0.3"/> # half of them at least are not finding this something they want to go along with <trunc>fro</trunc> <pause dur="0.4"/> the the the the the unity of seventeen-eighty-nine <pause dur="0.2"/> is breaking apart <pause dur="2.5"/> in seventeen-ninety-one <pause dur="0.3"/> as you'll see <pause dur="1.1"/> the situation sort of looks as if it's coming to a head <pause dur="0.4"/> when Louis the Sixteenth the king <pause dur="0.3"/> leaves <pause dur="0.2"/> Paris secretly <pause dur="0.4"/> clandestinely where <pause dur="0.2"/> he feels he's being held prisoner <pause dur="0.3"/> and makes a run for the border <pause dur="0.3"/> makes a run for the frontier where all these émigré <pause dur="0.2"/> # armies are <pause dur="1.0"/> he's fortunately caught <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> before he gets there <pause dur="1.9"/> he's brought back to Paris <pause dur="0.3"/> many people would say at that stage <pause dur="0.2"/><vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.3"/> let's get rid for him <pause dur="0.2"/> for heaven's sake you know the man's obviously against the revolution <pause dur="0.2"/> he's actually creating more trouble than he's worth let's get rid of him <pause dur="1.5"/> this <pause dur="0.2"/> is <pause dur="0.3"/> the exact <pause dur="0.2"/> opposite of what in fact happened <pause dur="0.7"/> okay because this gives # <pause dur="0.4"/> the revolutionary national assembly a 
chance if you like to blackmail Louis the Sixteenth into accepting the new constitution <pause dur="0.4"/> # which they are going to pass in seventeen-ninety-one <pause dur="1.0"/> creating a constitutional # monarchy <pause dur="0.9"/> why don't they get rid of him <pause dur="0.2"/><vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.2"/> well because i think <pause dur="0.2"/> very largely <pause dur="0.8"/> you've got the pressure from the émigrés the pressure from # the the clergy as well <pause dur="0.5"/> the other grouping i think in this period we would say isn't <pause dur="0.3"/> which is living the paradox of the revolution <pause dur="0.4"/> is <pause dur="0.4"/> the lower classes and in particular the most politically conscious of those <pause dur="0.3"/> the people in the towns the urban consumers <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> who are <pause dur="0.9"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="5"/> they're often called in fact <pause dur="0.4"/> and you'll get used to this term the <distinct lang="fr">sans-culottes</distinct> <pause dur="0.7"/> this does not mean that they didn't wear trousers by the way those who # have # # <pause dur="0.5"/> sort of O-level # G-C-S-E # French <pause dur="0.3"/><kinesic desc="indicates point on board" iterated="n"/> sans-culottes this means without <pause dur="0.2"/> knee breeches the knee breeches is the sign of # <pause dur="0.4"/> gentility it shows you're sort of a gent <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> if you don't if you wear the straight trousers of the

and fight for the front so this is <pause dur="0.2"/> sort of <pause dur="0.3"/> first inkling of this idea of mass warfare which is obviously such an important thing in the nineteenth and particularly <pause dur="0.3"/> # the twentieth # <pause dur="0.2"/> # century <pause dur="1.6"/> so around that <pause dur="0.6"/> patriotism how do you get people to <pause dur="0.5"/> how do you mobilize that enthusiasm obviously the revolution has brought much in seventeen-ninety-three <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> how in <trunc>seven</trunc> in seventeen-eighty-nine how in seventeen-ninety-three do you make people want to go out and you know even kill themselves on the battlefield for # <pause dur="0.2"/> an entity France which probably didn't mean very much to them <pause dur="0.2"/> # before seventeen-eighty-nine <pause dur="0.6"/> well there are two arms to the strategy <pause dur="0.5"/> # of within France of <pause dur="0.2"/> mobilizing the nation in this way i've sort of given some of the <pause dur="0.3"/> # things here <pause dur="0.4"/> # very <trunc>si</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> very <pause dur="0.5"/> simplistically i would say <pause dur="0.4"/> radical social policies <pause dur="0.5"/> and terror <pause dur="0.5"/> okay let's start with radical social policies 'cause they are often forgotten <pause dur="0.4"/> # because people have a view of the terror 
which is almost entirely <pause dur="0.3"/> # negative <pause dur="0.4"/> but if you were writing the history of the welfare state <pause dur="0.3"/> you would make a big detour <pause dur="0.2"/> # into this period because it's precisely in this period that <pause dur="0.2"/> the French legislative <trunc>asse</trunc> the French # national convention <pause dur="0.2"/> and particularly <kinesic desc="indicates point on board" iterated="n"/> this guy particularly Robespierre <pause dur="0.2"/> argued that in order to <pause dur="0.2"/> give people something <pause dur="0.3"/> to fight for you've got to give them something you've got to introduce <pause dur="0.4"/> the maximum in other words a ceiling on prices so grain and bread is at an affordable price <pause dur="0.3"/> you've got to introduce a whole welfare package for <pause dur="0.3"/> # families of # # of soldiers <pause dur="0.2"/> for the aged for the infirm <pause dur="0.5"/> whole sort of set of new hospitals and all the rest of it a whole sort of set of welfare provision <pause dur="0.4"/> # within this # period <pause dur="0.5"/> # so that people have something to fight for <pause dur="2.3"/> and if they're not <pause dur="0.2"/> if they're not enthusiastic <pause dur="0.3"/> if they're not keen then you have to frighten them <pause dur="0.3"/> into being keen as well that's the other side you <trunc>a</trunc> the terror side <pause dur="0.3"/> is that you use 
violence the violence of the revolutionary state <pause dur="0.4"/> # against <pause dur="0.2"/> the enemies of the republic <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> both without and within so you've got the <trunc>e</trunc> the the idea of <pause dur="0.3"/> of this <trunc>su</trunc> sort of new national <pause dur="0.4"/> # this new nation fighting against the # <pause dur="0.3"/> # the the the the forces of counter-revolutionary Europe <pause dur="0.2"/> but within you've got also a set of <pause dur="0.2"/> terroristic policies <pause dur="0.4"/> meant to <pause dur="0.4"/> keep the enemies of the revolution quiet and even <pause dur="0.4"/> # in its more horrible <trunc>e</trunc> # exemplifications to liquidate them <pause dur="0.3"/> so you have a revolutionary tribunal a special court where anyone accused of a <pause dur="0.2"/> a counter-revolutionary offence will go and this becomes tighter and tighter <pause dur="0.2"/> and more defined basically anyone can go <pause dur="0.2"/> # and have their head chopped off by the by the summer of seventeen-ninety-four <pause dur="0.3"/> you have a committee of public safety a war cabinet but also a sort of terror cabinet <pause dur="0.3"/> in which the Robespierre faction the person <pause dur="0.2"/> Robespierre as i say who gets this sort of <pause dur="0.2"/> this strategy of # <pause dur="0.3"/> war on the frontiers but # <trunc>so</trunc> 
radical social policy give the people something to fight for <pause dur="0.2"/> let them rally around the flag of the republic <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.8"/> # Robespierre dominates the committee of public safety you've got <pause dur="0.3"/> # the maximum the law of suspects # sort of very <trunc>m</trunc> very vague definition of counter-revolution <pause dur="0.4"/> and you've got these <distinct lang="fr">représentants en mission</distinct> deputies elected to the national assembly going <pause dur="0.2"/> into the provinces <pause dur="0.4"/> and using violence against anyone who seems to be counter-revolutionary <pause dur="0.4"/> i mean some of the famous ones people like Carrier in Nantes where he sort of puts whole piles of <pause dur="0.3"/> priests and counter-revolutionaries on boats floats them out into the middle of the <pause dur="0.2"/> River Loire and then pulls the plugs and so thousands of people die <pause dur="0.3"/> or Lyon or indeed in in the Vendée where people where basically in certain <pause dur="0.4"/> you've got a sort of free fire zone essentially in many parts of of # <pause dur="0.2"/> # Brittany and in some of the other areas of counter-revolution <pause dur="0.3"/> where if you see anyone <pause dur="0.3"/> with a rifle in your hand <pause dur="0.3"/> in their hands 
you shoot them if you're a a revolutionary soldier <pause dur="0.3"/> and you go through a policy of <trunc>s</trunc> of burning <pause dur="0.2"/> houses down killing <pause dur="0.2"/> # civil populations and all the rest of it <pause dur="0.3"/> that horrible side of the revolution <pause dur="0.2"/> horrible side of the revolution <pause dur="0.4"/> which is however <pause dur="0.3"/> effective <pause dur="2.4"/> the Marseillaise <pause dur="0.3"/> is created the the French # national anthem is created precisely at this time in in August <unclear>i think by</unclear> seventeen-ninety-two <pause dur="0.6"/> # don't know if you've ever listened to the words of the Marseillaise or or translated them <pause dur="0.3"/> it's all about blood flowing through # <pause dur="0.2"/> # through furrows and things like that it is a <trunc>v</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> it's a marching song a militaristic song <pause dur="0.4"/> # the idea's that French republic is an army a nation with rights <pause dur="0.4"/> the citizen is a rights bearing individual <pause dur="0.2"/> but he's also an arms bearing <trunc>cit</trunc> # <trunc>cit</trunc> citizen he bears arms <pause dur="0.2"/> to defend <pause dur="0.3"/> # the <trunc>r</trunc> the # republic <pause dur="0.5"/> and this policy is successful because by seventeen-ninety-four <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="1.2"/> # what's happening is that <pause dur="0.4"/> i should have put the third heading <pause dur="0.5"/> # as well <pause dur="4.4"/> <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="3"/> 
what's happening by seventeen # <trunc>ni</trunc> ninety-four is that the <pause dur="0.4"/> counter-revolutionary armies are being driven back France there aren't any more sort of troops or anything on French soil in fact the French are pushing them into their own # <pause dur="0.2"/> into Europe as we'll see when talking about this # <pause dur="0.3"/> # next week <pause dur="0.9"/> # <pause dur="2.5"/> so <pause dur="0.3"/> to a certain extent the terror has its justification <pause dur="0.9"/> you know this is a horrible way a a horrible logic if you like the terror has its justification and that it's successful <pause dur="0.2"/> it defends France against it it allows the <pause dur="0.3"/> it allows France to stay geographically united even though socially and politically it's very <pause dur="0.4"/> # divided <pause dur="1.9"/> and by the middle of seventeen-ninety-four you've got a <pause dur="0.5"/> a choice <pause dur="0.3"/> it's open to you really if you're within # # France if you're as long as you're keeping your head down if you're a counter-revolutionary obviously but if you're a revolutionary you have two choices <pause dur="0.5"/> one of them is to say well terror <pause dur="0.4"/> you know we don't like what's <pause dur="0.2"/> gone on in the terror but 
it has been successful at least so let's go back to <pause dur="0.2"/> you know what it was before let's go back and <pause dur="0.3"/> to sort of seventeen-ninety-two or seventeen-ninety <pause dur="0.3"/> or something let's <pause dur="0.3"/> dismantle <pause dur="0.3"/> all this # sort of stuff all this sort of apparatus <pause dur="0.3"/> of terror this apparatus of # <pause dur="0.2"/> # strong centralized government which has been set up by the war emergency <pause dur="1.5"/> and yet <pause dur="0.3"/> there is that group and yet there is another group <pause dur="0.4"/> # Robespierre is perhaps the most prominent and certainly the most articulate of them <pause dur="0.3"/> who say no <pause dur="1.0"/> no turning back this is the time <pause dur="0.2"/> to create a new republic that new man which we talked about in <trunc>seventeen-eighty-na</trunc> nine <pause dur="0.3"/> may have been a new man of <pause dur="0.3"/> the age of liberty what we need is a new man <pause dur="0.3"/> of the age of <pause dur="0.2"/> equality <pause dur="0.4"/> even though in other words the war is being won and the the the sort of rationalization for terror is no longer there <pause dur="0.2"/> let's take things <pause dur="0.2"/> # further <pause dur="0.3"/> what is very interesting and i i think it's also one of the reasons why this <pause dur="0.3"/> paradox about the revolutionary <trunc>le</trunc> legacy is 
so powerful <pause dur="0.2"/> and yet so difficult for us in the <trunc>ni</trunc> <pause dur="0.3"/> in the twentieth and nineteenth and twentieth century <pause dur="0.4"/> # is that <pause dur="0.2"/> where Robespierre gets his ideas from <pause dur="0.5"/> where this idea of a purification of the nation <pause dur="0.4"/> # of more radical social legislation more equality within the <pause dur="0.2"/> # within the system <pause dur="0.4"/> is very precisely <pause dur="0.2"/> from <pause dur="0.6"/> the Enlightenment <pause dur="0.7"/> the Enlightenment <pause dur="0.3"/> i've argued has created the sort of conditions the social conditions <pause dur="0.3"/> and the ideology <pause dur="0.2"/> that the discourses which make seventeen-eighty-nine <pause dur="0.3"/> # possible <pause dur="0.3"/> what historians get very agitated about very divided about <pause dur="0.3"/> # very upset about sometimes <pause dur="0.3"/> is that the the the ideology and the discourses of Enlightenment <pause dur="0.3"/> have also seemed to prove the <pause dur="0.2"/> <trunc>pr</trunc> provide the justification <pause dur="0.4"/> # behind <pause dur="0.2"/> the reign of terror <pause dur="0.4"/> the idea that <pause dur="0.3"/> a new republic of virtue <pause dur="0.2"/> that's what Robespierre is always talking about virtue <pause dur="0.4"/> # that one can get a new <trunc>civ</trunc> <pause dur="0.3"/> # a new civic system of equality <pause dur="0.2"/> where everyone basically has a sort of <pause dur="0.4"/> direct and equal relationship

in which you can say <pause dur="0.3"/> i quite liked the Louis the Sixteenth and you'll end up before the revolutionary tribunal <pause dur="0.3"/> so <pause dur="0.5"/> opinion opinion is no longer free <pause dur="0.3"/> so how do you get rid how do you change it <pause dur="0.8"/> you have to get rid of Robespierre this is what many of the people who got rid of him later say <pause dur="0.2"/> they say <pause dur="0.6"/> we couldn't do anything you had to kill him <pause dur="0.2"/> there was no way out Robespierre has to go the symbol of this new idea of <pause dur="0.3"/> of of revolutionary virtue has to be executed <pause dur="0.3"/> there is a coup d'état <pause dur="0.3"/> # on the <pause dur="0.2"/> <trunc>n</trunc> ninth of Thermidor under the new calendar the twenty-seventh of July seventeen-ninety-four <pause dur="0.3"/> where he he <trunc>h</trunc> he is <pause dur="0.5"/> captured <pause dur="0.3"/> he and they are all executed a gang of them are executed <pause dur="0.2"/> # the next day <pause dur="0.2"/> the the people who've been the driving force the van if you like of the movement for social regeneration and political regeneration <pause dur="0.3"/> social welfare policies <pause dur="0.3"/> but also terror <pause dur="0.4"/> but also terror <pause dur="0.3"/> so you know very much the two sides <pause dur="0.3"/> are removed and one can <pause dur="0.2"/> if you like <pause dur="0.5"/> the revolutionaries who get get the sense of going back so that they can get go forward they've got over the political crisis <pause dur="0.3"/> they've got over <pause dur="0.2"/> # the social divisions if you like of seventeen # ninety-three
