<u who="nf0096"><kinesic desc="slide projector is on showing slide" iterated="n"/> so you know this is the last lecture of this unit # and i really hope you will enjoy the other modules and you know that # <pause dur="0.4"/> whenever there's a problem with a particular module and you feel you can <pause dur="0.2"/> clarify <pause dur="0.2"/> the problem <pause dur="0.2"/> with the the the the tutor the <trunc>c</trunc> your course tutor <pause dur="0.2"/> then do so if there's a more <pause dur="0.2"/> fundamental problem or you feel you can't go to the course tutor <pause dur="0.3"/> please by all means come <pause dur="0.3"/> always come back to me i need to know if there's a problem <pause dur="0.5"/> so don't have any inhibition <pause dur="0.3"/> come and see me <pause dur="0.5"/> my office hours shall be from <pause dur="0.4"/> ten till eleven on Wednesdays <pause dur="0.2"/> from this week onwards <pause dur="1.0"/> so <pause dur="0.3"/> the last lecture <pause dur="1.0"/> let me <pause dur="0.3"/> briefly review where we've come from so far <pause dur="1.1"/> if you remember in the first lecture i looked at one artist <pause dur="0.2"/> Turner <pause dur="0.6"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> tried to sort of run the gamut of all the different approaches really to show you <pause dur="0.6"/> how different meaning can look <pause dur="0.2"/> from <pause dur="0.2"/> you know whatever angle you approach the work of art <pause dur="0.3"/> so i really tried to show you <pause dur="0.4"/> the differences of of of meaning 
you generate by just simply the way you approach a work of art <pause dur="0.6"/> and then <pause dur="0.7"/> in the last two weeks <pause dur="0.3"/> i gave you an account of <pause dur="0.3"/> art histories <pause dur="0.2"/> from the nineteenth century to the twentieth century really and the early twentieth century <pause dur="0.4"/> all of which in one way or another <pause dur="0.4"/> tried to <pause dur="0.7"/> give a causal account of # why an artwork looks the way it does <pause dur="0.3"/> a causal account which at once <pause dur="0.3"/> is specific to the historic time in which the artwork is generated <pause dur="0.3"/> as well as being superhistorical so that this cause is also something which determines the way we perceive the world nowadays or the way <pause dur="0.3"/> artworks are produced nowadays <pause dur="0.3"/> because only when you have that <trunc>super</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> <trunc>aca</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> emphasizing that superhistorical point of view <pause dur="0.4"/> did you really have a means of assessing the work of art in the past you had a connection to the past a legitimate connection <pause dur="0.7"/> now <pause dur="0.7"/> for <pause dur="0.2"/> Hegel that was the world spirit for <pause dur="0.3"/> Wölfflin and Riegl it was the evolution of human perception <pause dur="0.4"/> then for <pause dur="0.2"/> Panofsky and 
and iconography <pause dur="0.2"/> it was <pause dur="0.5"/> the way that thoughts throughout human societies always try to conceptualize the world <pause dur="0.2"/> the sort of constant <pause dur="0.5"/> which <pause dur="0.2"/> which # Panofsky saw as something which constantly stayed in societies <pause dur="0.4"/> and then <pause dur="0.2"/> with Marx it was <pause dur="0.2"/> the way that the means of production <pause dur="0.2"/> differently structured the economic societies <pause dur="0.4"/> and it was always the means of production which and and the way they were distributed which changed over time but stayed <pause dur="0.3"/> you know that <pause dur="0.3"/> as a sort of economic base state stable <pause dur="1.5"/> so all of these accounts <pause dur="0.3"/> gave this you know <pause dur="0.2"/> gave you in the proper sense an art history one which you could write but you which you could write throughout the ages <pause dur="0.3"/> when i came then to weaker form of Marxist analysis to social history and to feminism <pause dur="0.4"/> i said <pause dur="0.3"/> that they really don't have that any more <pause dur="0.3"/> they can give you a specific account of a <trunc>w</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> a work of art in its historic <pause dur="0.2"/> time <pause dur="0.6"/> from a critical viewpoint but they don't claim that they have this sort of superhistorical cause 
or have discovered that superhistorical cause <pause dur="0.4"/> which gives you continuity throughout the ages <pause dur="0.5"/> now that's for a variety of reason i mean for various of reasons <pause dur="0.3"/> particularly Hegel and Panofsky's <pause dur="0.2"/> way of explaining it <pause dur="0.4"/> had just become <pause dur="0.8"/> quite suspiciously metaphysical and nobody can really hold to that nowadays <pause dur="0.4"/> now <pause dur="0.3"/> Wölfflin and Riegl's account of the evolution of human perception <pause dur="0.2"/> is just simply not borne out by psychology so people don't really believe that into in that any more <pause dur="0.6"/> and also <pause dur="0.2"/> of course <pause dur="0.2"/> they felt it was just too reductive it was just giving an account of the formal changes rather than the content <pause dur="0.9"/> and <pause dur="0.3"/> with Marxist of course that you know all yourself i mean people can't really quite believe in the Marxist trajectory any more after the wall came down in <pause dur="0.3"/> in in Germany and Berlin in eighty-nine <pause dur="0.3"/> because this trajectory of the an evolution from # a capitalist society to communism <pause dur="0.3"/> was just simply not borne out <pause dur="0.7"/> so <pause dur="0.2"/> for <trunc>var</trunc> <trunc>variet</trunc> various <pause dur="0.2"/> 
reasons art historians nowadays feel very suspicious of these sort of superhistorical causes and this endeavour to give an account there <pause dur="0.6"/> and they have <pause dur="0.2"/> resigned themselves to give quite a specific account of an artwork in its specific <trunc>toci</trunc> society <pause dur="0.3"/> from <pause dur="0.2"/> # a critical viewpoint formulated nowadays <pause dur="1.5"/> and of course <pause dur="0.8"/> that <pause dur="0.2"/> aspect that they embed the artwork deeply in its society is really what all those accounts all these contemporary approaches <pause dur="0.3"/> which i started with last week and i will continue today <pause dur="0.3"/> really share <pause dur="0.9"/> but <pause dur="0.3"/> of course what does it mean it means that there's a multiplicity of viewpoints possible because of course if you say well <pause dur="0.3"/> we don't really have a authoritative viewpoint any more <pause dur="0.3"/> then you have a variety of approaches which are possible <pause dur="0.4"/> but <pause dur="1.1"/> any single one of them is really rid of authoritative conviction <pause dur="0.2"/> so you have this multiplicity of legitimate approaches coexisting next <pause dur="0.2"/> to each other <pause dur="0.5"/> but not <pause dur="0.2"/> one single one which can really claim 
it is the one and exhaustive explanation <pause dur="1.0"/> that i think you have to bear in mind when you <pause dur="0.3"/> continue in this course <pause dur="0.9"/> you really again and i come back to that <pause dur="0.2"/> are left to choose what you feel is the most plausible to yourself bearing in mind this is the most plausible to you and it could be <pause dur="0.2"/> something else could be entirely plausible to someone else <pause dur="0.4"/> and you can <pause dur="0.2"/> really construct the history of art <pause dur="0.3"/> from your own viewpoint from your own interests <pause dur="0.2"/> from your own approach <pause dur="0.3"/> but really can't <pause dur="0.2"/> go as far as claim that that is really the exhaustive explanation and you have an authoritative account <pause dur="0.4"/> and can really indeed give <pause dur="0.2"/> an authoritative survey <shift feature="voice" new="laugh"/>course on the history of art <shift feature="voice" new="normal"/></u><gap reason="break in recording" extent="uncertain"/> <u who="nf0096" trans="pause"> today i will talk about <trunc>cos</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> post-colonial approaches <pause dur="0.4"/> semiotics <pause dur="0.3"/> and <pause dur="0.7"/> finish with the psychoanalytic approach <pause dur="1.2"/> it's obvious let me start with the post-colonial <pause dur="0.2"/> account <pause dur="0.3"/> it's obvious there's <pause dur="0.4"/> that a post-colonial account <pause dur="0.5"/> is # asking <pause dur="0.2"/> # or is # # considers the outward is deeply embedded 
and deeply imbricated by what's going on in society <pause dur="0.5"/> and particularly a post-colonialist <pause dur="0.2"/> # or someone who <trunc>m</trunc> # adheres to that <pause dur="0.6"/> discourse # <pause dur="0.7"/> would ask <pause dur="0.3"/> what does it mean for works of art that <trunc>societ</trunc> western European societies in particular or western societies <pause dur="0.3"/> have continued to <pause dur="0.7"/> absorb and dominate other non-western societies non-European societies <pause dur="0.9"/> but <pause dur="0.2"/> post-colonial discourse also means that it's not just a recuperation into the canon of # # recuperation of non-western European societies' artefacts into the canon of art <pause dur="0.5"/> but it also <pause dur="0.3"/> tries to critically inflect <pause dur="0.6"/> what it means to have this canon what it means to <pause dur="0.5"/> to to <trunc>m</trunc> to be <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> faced with a with a domination by western societies <pause dur="2.8"/> it really <pause dur="0.3"/> post-colonial <pause dur="0.6"/> approaches in the history of art really took off with two exhibitions in the eighties <pause dur="1.3"/> one <pause dur="0.2"/> was staged <pause dur="0.4"/> in the <trunc>mu</trunc> in the Museum of Modern Art in New York in <trunc>eighti</trunc> in nineteen-eighty-four <pause dur="0.9"/> and what people tried there what set out to do there was to show 
that far from <pause dur="1.0"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> <trunc>sh</trunc> # from completely developing without any contact with other societies <pause dur="0.2"/> western art was deeply influenced by <pause dur="0.2"/> what happened what what was produced in other societies and other cultures non-western cultures <pause dur="0.6"/> so in the wake of <pause dur="0.3"/> nineteenth century colonialism artefacts from <pause dur="0.8"/> all over the world and other cultures reached the western museums and of course as you know from the seminars already was studied <pause dur="0.2"/> by artists in particularly <pause dur="0.7"/> by Picasso as we've seen in the seminars <pause dur="0.5"/> i'm <pause dur="0.2"/> quite surprised yes here <trunc>o</trunc> obviously <pause dur="0.5"/> did it wrongly <pause dur="0.3"/> here i show you <pause dur="0.2"/> which you probably all recognize by now as a <pause dur="0.4"/> as a <pause dur="0.2"/> as a <pause dur="0.3"/> as a picture very closely related to the Demoiselles d'Avignon <pause dur="0.3"/> then he also produced the two <pause dur="0.2"/> females nudes were <trunc>p</trunc> produced in nineteen-o-six <pause dur="0.4"/> now you can see that <pause dur="0.3"/> Picasso here has <pause dur="0.2"/> taken or is influenced by the mask which he saw the Iberian mask in particular he saw <pause dur="0.4"/> in <pause dur="0.2"/> the museums in in Paris <pause dur="0.2"/> so you have this almond the almond-shaped eyes the dark contours <pause dur="0.6"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> it's sort of propped 
onto those female nudes what he also has taken and this is what the exhibition catalogue in the MOMA emphasized <pause dur="0.4"/> that <pause dur="0.4"/> what he'd taken from the artefacts of other societies and other cultures particularly African and Iberian cultures <pause dur="0.3"/> was that # <pause dur="0.5"/> # that <pause dur="0.3"/> fragmentation of forms <pause dur="0.4"/> so forms didn't have to <trunc>f</trunc> to like <pause dur="0.2"/> the breast of the right nude for example is sort of propped on rather than in a sort of continuous <pause dur="0.3"/> plausible <shift feature="voice" new="laugh"/>three-dimensional <shift feature="voice" new="normal"/>space of a female body <pause dur="0.6"/> so <pause dur="0.2"/> they really argued that <pause dur="0.3"/> what made Picasso such a hero in contemporary # in in twentieth century art the shattering of the three-dimensional <trunc>in</trunc> illusionistic # picture space <pause dur="0.3"/> was really something which he took <pause dur="0.5"/> from <pause dur="0.4"/> other cultures from non-western cultures <pause dur="0.6"/> and learned from them <pause dur="2.0"/> but soon <pause dur="0.2"/> after the exhibition opened and this characteristically voluminous catalogue was issued <pause dur="0.3"/> this exhibition came under heavy criticism from people who were influenced by <pause dur="0.3"/> post-colonial discussions <pause dur="1.2"/> they <pause dur="1.2"/> accused the exhibition 
of simply <sic corr="continuing">contintinuing</sic> the exploitation of non-western cultures <pause dur="0.5"/> in this case of simply continuing <pause dur="0.3"/> an account which says <pause dur="0.3"/> look <pause dur="0.3"/> we're going and taking <pause dur="0.3"/> the means and resources from other cultures <pause dur="0.2"/> in order to advance our own aims <pause dur="0.2"/> in this case twentieth century art history or the twentieth century art <pause dur="0.3"/> the shattering of the picture space is something <pause dur="0.3"/> which <pause dur="0.2"/> has significantly happened in twentieth century art <pause dur="0.3"/> but it is something <pause dur="0.2"/> which is <pause dur="0.6"/> on the ground on the base of # <pause dur="0.3"/> artistic articulations in non-European cultures <pause dur="0.4"/> so they say this is really just a continuation of colonization it doesn't give any of those cultures proper recognition <pause dur="1.9"/> so another exhibition opened <pause dur="0.7"/> five years later <pause dur="0.2"/> in nineteen-eighty-nine in Paris <pause dur="0.8"/> and that exhibition was called La Magicien De La Terre <pause dur="0.4"/> the magicians of the earth and in this exhibition modern art was shown alongside contemporary achievements by other cultures non-western cultures <pause dur="0.6"/> and the aim in this show was <pause dur="0.2"/> to 
show <pause dur="0.2"/> that such productions <pause dur="0.4"/> were not simply a source <pause dur="0.3"/> for western art as it had been in the primitivism <pause dur="0.2"/> exhibition <pause dur="0.3"/> but actually equalled <pause dur="0.3"/> western art <pause dur="0.4"/> in the in their achievements in the aesthetic beauty they could generate <pause dur="1.0"/> now again this exhibition came under heavy fire and criticism <pause dur="0.3"/> because <pause dur="0.2"/> it was argued <pause dur="0.3"/> that <pause dur="0.2"/> not only <pause dur="0.5"/> did this exhibition <pause dur="0.4"/> show <pause dur="0.3"/> the work <pause dur="0.4"/> from other cultures completely disconnected from their contexts so <pause dur="0.5"/> that decontextualization was heavily criticized <pause dur="0.5"/> but <pause dur="0.2"/> they furthermore said <pause dur="0.2"/> these critics of this exhibition said <pause dur="0.4"/> that <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.8"/> it is perceived <pause dur="0.5"/> in in a mould <pause dur="0.2"/> aesthetic beauty which is really very very intrinsic to western cultures and very very foreign to other cultures <pause dur="0.2"/> and therefore <pause dur="0.2"/> it is another <pause dur="0.2"/> sign of an appropriation <pause dur="0.2"/> rather than a proper recognition <pause dur="1.8"/> so <pause dur="0.5"/> underlying all those criticisms <pause dur="0.3"/> these <pause dur="0.2"/> two two those exhibitions <pause dur="0.2"/> was really <pause dur="0.2"/> what is properly <pause dur="0.2"/> a post-colonial approach <pause dur="0.4"/> and that was influenced <pause dur="0.2"/> by a rather wonderful book by the literary critic 
and Palestinian Palestinian Edward Said <pause dur="0.3"/> called Orientalism <pause dur="0.3"/> which came out actually <pause dur="0.2"/> ten years <trunc>ag</trunc> # twenty years ago in nineteen-seventy-eight <pause dur="0.8"/> now Said <pause dur="0.3"/> in this book Orientalism <pause dur="0.5"/> has very forcefully <pause dur="0.5"/> argued <pause dur="0.2"/> that western societies <pause dur="0.6"/> not only just exploited <pause dur="0.3"/> others' other cultures <pause dur="0.7"/> in their colonial strategies <pause dur="0.3"/> but in fact <pause dur="0.8"/> fabricated those societies in their own image <pause dur="0.8"/> other societies became and actually took on that character <pause dur="0.4"/> simply by being characterized in opposition to western cultures <pause dur="0.3"/> so whatever a western culture <pause dur="0.2"/> isn't <pause dur="0.4"/> # that other culture other cultures non-European cultures had to be <pause dur="0.3"/> so <pause dur="0.2"/> for example <pause dur="0.2"/> they were deemed to be <trunc>m</trunc> <pause dur="0.4"/> much purer somehow much more essential <pause dur="0.2"/> more related to nature <pause dur="0.2"/> less rational <pause dur="1.2"/> much more emotional so you can see it's all constructed in oppositions that was Said's point <pause dur="0.7"/> and he also argued <pause dur="0.3"/> that <pause dur="0.3"/> in fact because of the many many years of encounters <pause dur="0.4"/> these societies then took on those characteristics were really shaped in those images <pause dur="0.3"/> and we 
really do look in vain for <pause dur="0.4"/> an essential more purer <pause dur="0.3"/> more nature-related society elsewhere <pause dur="0.3"/> it is already our own construct <pause dur="1.9"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> now <pause dur="0.6"/> let me illustrate this by looking <pause dur="0.4"/> at the work here <pause dur="0.2"/> on your left <pause dur="0.7"/> which <pause dur="1.0"/> was produced by <pause dur="0.6"/> someone <pause dur="0.5"/> called Jimmie Durham a contemporary artist <pause dur="0.7"/> in when was it actually it's nineteen-eighty <pause dur="2.3"/> i don't have the <pause dur="0.5"/> date i think it's <pause dur="0.4"/> something in <trunc>th</trunc> in the nineteen-eighties i think it's something in the nineteen-eighties sorry i've forgotten the date of this <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> it's called <pause dur="0.2"/> The Cathedral of Saint John <pause dur="1.4"/> and i think if you look at it # # let me tell you about Jimmie Durham first a little bit Jimmie Durham is what we now would call a Native American artist i mean the they themselves at once stage called themselves the First Nation people <pause dur="0.7"/> and Jimmie Durham also was <pause dur="0.2"/> the representative for the First Nation people at the United <trunc>sta</trunc> # United Nations in Geneva for some time <pause dur="0.5"/> so what is quite typical here is and it's no no accident that i take to 
illustrate that point <pause dur="0.4"/> an artist a contemporary artist because contemporary artists and Jimmie Durham <pause dur="0.2"/> is quite a typical example <pause dur="0.3"/> were actually very heavily and much more at the forefront of <pause dur="0.3"/> taking up and articulating <pause dur="0.3"/> theoretical <trunc>con</trunc> and critical viewpoints in the eighties much more than any art critic or art historian <pause dur="1.0"/> so you can see <pause dur="0.3"/> he <pause dur="0.2"/> he was someone <pause dur="0.3"/> who <pause dur="0.4"/> also had a career as a politician apart from being <pause dur="0.3"/> this incredibly famous now contemporary artist <pause dur="0.5"/> and very articulate <pause dur="0.2"/> on the reasons why he <pause dur="0.2"/> produced a work of art in the way he did <pause dur="1.2"/> however we look at it <pause dur="0.4"/> at first hand it probably seems to you <pause dur="0.4"/> or some of you quite raw quite unfinished sort of assembled rather <pause dur="0.4"/> dilettantish perhaps even <pause dur="2.4"/> what we note is there's a skull <pause dur="0.5"/> we see some sort of <pause dur="0.3"/> <trunc>f</trunc> <pause dur="0.6"/> material from <pause dur="0.2"/> remains from animals the skull the antlers <pause dur="0.9"/> and i think in the way that it is assembled we immediately might think of some sort of totemic figure <pause dur="0.2"/> from non-European cultures <pause dur="0.3"/> perhaps also you know using a skull 
using animal remains <pause dur="0.2"/> but also probably in the way <pause dur="0.5"/> that it is painted in this rather <pause dur="0.3"/> garish decorative <pause dur="0.2"/> # way the skull is painted there's blue and then the sort of <pause dur="0.3"/> points dots # of red and and yellow on top of it <pause dur="0.7"/> and that is probably something we do # associate with <pause dur="0.3"/> artefacts now manufactured by <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> say Native Americans <pause dur="0.2"/> for example <pause dur="1.4"/> but <pause dur="0.2"/> we also notice i think <pause dur="0.2"/> that there are <pause dur="0.2"/> quite sort of <pause dur="0.2"/> industrially <pause dur="0.2"/> manufactured elements in this <pause dur="0.4"/> in this sculpture <pause dur="0.7"/> the the the the boot <trunc>f</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> the <trunc>m</trunc> # the sawmill produced wood <pause dur="0.3"/> which is <pause dur="0.2"/> roughly bolted together <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> with with nails and big bolts at <kinesic desc="indicates point on slide" iterated="n"/> these places <pause dur="0.2"/> and of course <pause dur="0.3"/> the the the metal tubes which form a surrogate antler here <pause dur="0.2"/> at the top <pause dur="1.0"/> another industrial produced <pause dur="0.2"/> material <pause dur="0.4"/> and also <pause dur="0.2"/> industrially manufactured in a way that it <trunc>pu</trunc> it is put together here <pause dur="2.3"/> so what we really have with this sculpture <pause dur="0.3"/> is <pause dur="0.2"/> a number of oppositions <pause dur="0.6"/> culture nature <pause dur="0.6"/> savagery civilization <pause dur="0.7"/> before after <pause dur="0.9"/> the technical <pause dur="0.2"/> the non-technical <pause dur="0.9"/> now if you recall what 
i said before <pause dur="0.3"/> about Edward Said and his account of colonization <pause dur="0.5"/> you realize that these kind of oppositions is what he <pause dur="0.4"/> criticized as the West doing when it encounters cultures which are foreign <pause dur="1.1"/> to it or European <pause dur="0.3"/> societies did when they encountered those rather strange to them strange societies <pause dur="0.4"/> in order to understand them <pause dur="0.4"/> they had to shape them in their own image and they gave them <pause dur="0.7"/> characteristics <trunc>s</trunc> which were in opposition <pause dur="0.2"/> to what they were and what they understood <pause dur="0.7"/> and so this is really played out here <pause dur="0.2"/> all those oppositions brought together in one culture <pause dur="1.0"/> # in one sculpture <pause dur="0.3"/> now Jimmie Durham himself is <pause dur="0.3"/> repeatedly emphasizes in his writings <pause dur="0.4"/> that the ease <pause dur="0.3"/> that there was an incredible ease with which Native Americans <pause dur="0.2"/> assimilated and used all those <pause dur="0.2"/> products and materials # <pause dur="0.2"/> which <pause dur="0.5"/> western societies brought to them when they colonized the country <pause dur="0.2"/> America <pause dur="0.8"/> so <pause dur="0.2"/> he <trunc>p</trunc> he would make a point that if they came with rifles and they got hold of rifle rifles <pause dur="0.3"/> 
these guns were immediately incorporated in the artefacts they # <pause dur="0.3"/> they produced <pause dur="0.4"/> without really you know obviously giving them their proper <pause dur="0.2"/> use they were just incorporated in what was there <pause dur="0.8"/> so that is the first point <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> which i want to <pause dur="0.2"/> to make here that Jimmie Durham says # says <pause dur="0.2"/> look <pause dur="0.3"/> there is <pause dur="0.3"/> there's an incredible ease with which our culture <pause dur="0.2"/> Native Americans have always assimilated whatever was brought to them <pause dur="0.6"/> and secondly he points out <pause dur="0.3"/> that this thinking in opposition is quite foreign to his own culture <pause dur="0.3"/> that in fact and probably that <trunc>r</trunc> <pause dur="0.3"/> might ring true to you that <pause dur="0.4"/> there is a <pause dur="0.2"/> # a that this is a <pause dur="0.7"/> culture Native Americans have a culture <pause dur="0.3"/> which is <pause dur="0.9"/> much more characterized by blurred demarcations things are not as <pause dur="0.2"/> hard and fast <trunc>f</trunc> are fastly fixed in oppositions <pause dur="0.3"/> so for example <pause dur="0.3"/> there isn't a strict demarcation between animals and humans <pause dur="0.5"/> and this is also borne out in the sculpture <pause dur="0.4"/> you see these animals remains the skull and the antler <pause dur="0.2"/> but they 
are assembled in a <pause dur="0.2"/> in a rather figurative way in a way that # resembles more an upright human <pause dur="0.8"/> he also points out that there is no no clear <pause dur="0.4"/> demarcation between <pause dur="0.4"/> death and life <pause dur="0.3"/> so the skull he uses here <pause dur="0.3"/> is really a tribute to <pause dur="0.3"/> death as it lives on in the presence <pause dur="2.1"/> and on the basis of all that <pause dur="0.3"/> we can probably also see that the <pause dur="0.4"/> character of assemblage here the sort of raw unfinished state which might have looked or might look dilettantish to you <pause dur="0.6"/> is something which <pause dur="0.2"/> Jimmie Durham does quite consciously <pause dur="0.4"/> in fact <pause dur="0.3"/> he <pause dur="0.2"/> he really does feel that the found object what he finds and assembles <pause dur="0.2"/> needs to be left <pause dur="0.4"/> in its own right <pause dur="0.2"/> must not be homogenized in a sort of entity which loses <pause dur="0.2"/> where all the <pause dur="0.2"/> individual elements <pause dur="0.3"/> <trunc>u</trunc> <trunc>loo</trunc> use their lose their own characteristic <pause dur="0.3"/> so he really does want an assemblage which looks <pause dur="0.4"/> quite assembled and not really homogenized in a unified object <pause dur="0.3"/> because he thinks <pause dur="0.3"/> that would just simply <pause dur="0.3"/> annihilate <pause dur="0.3"/> the character of the # of all the individual elements 
in the way that the colonials annihilated the characteristics of the natives <pause dur="0.3"/> when they arrived in their country <pause dur="0.7"/> or attempted to <pause dur="2.6"/> furthermore actually Durham <pause dur="0.3"/> turns the table on us and he says even our own culture is not as homogenous as we imagine it to be <pause dur="0.2"/> as seamless <pause dur="0.4"/> because <pause dur="0.4"/> this odd title this sculpture has The Cathedral of Saint John the Divine <pause dur="0.3"/> is actually a church in Manhattan some of you might know <pause dur="0.3"/> and it is the biggest <pause dur="0.6"/> and largest Gothic <trunc>achie</trunc> cathedral on Earth <pause dur="0.3"/> except of course <pause dur="0.2"/> that it is not a medieval <pause dur="0.2"/> Gothic church <pause dur="0.3"/> it is <pause dur="0.2"/> it stems from the nineteenth century <pause dur="0.4"/> and <pause dur="1.1"/> Durham points out that the stonework which gives it the resemblance of the Gothic of # the Gothic style <pause dur="0.2"/> is actually held together <pause dur="0.3"/> with steel <pause dur="0.3"/> which is now as you know it's <trunc>e</trunc> expanding with rust <pause dur="0.3"/> and therefore eventually will destroy that <pause dur="0.2"/> magnificent building <pause dur="2.3"/> so <pause dur="1.1"/> i think <pause dur="0.2"/> the message here is <pause dur="0.4"/> that <pause dur="0.5"/> Jimmie Durham says <pause dur="0.2"/> there are differences <pause dur="0.3"/> but <pause dur="0.5"/> there is no essential <pause dur="0.3"/> character to any one culture <pause dur="0.2"/> every culture is a 
hybridity in one way or another <pause dur="2.1"/> and this is i think very much <pause dur="0.4"/> what the post-colonial discourse <pause dur="0.5"/> in art history also tries to take on board and give account of <pause dur="0.8"/> and this is also something <pause dur="0.2"/> which the second approach today semiotics <pause dur="0.4"/> is very clear about that there is actually <pause dur="0.3"/> in this case behind language no essential reality <pause dur="0.4"/> that language denotes nothing essential nothing <pause dur="0.2"/> clear but is <trunc>alwa</trunc> what it denotes is already always a construct <pause dur="0.5"/> of the context in which language is used </u><gap reason="break in recording" extent="uncertain"/> <u who="nf0096" trans="pause"> so i come to semiotics now <pause dur="1.4"/> now of course the analysis of our means of communications as a system of science <pause dur="0.3"/> is as old as western civilization as <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> will tell you when it come when when you get to the forth module of this course <pause dur="1.3"/> but <pause dur="0.2"/> in the way that semioticians nowadays use <pause dur="0.6"/> the the <trunc>m</trunc> the # the <trunc>l</trunc> the the language of science and the system of science <pause dur="0.2"/> this really goes back to the twenties early twentieth century linguist Ferdinand Saussure who i've mentioned before <pause dur="0.7"/> who stated <pause dur="1.1"/> stated this analysis of 
science in in in terms which are still in use so for example he <pause dur="0.2"/> argued <pause dur="0.3"/> that a word <pause dur="0.2"/> is a signifier for something <pause dur="1.4"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> he called the signified <pause dur="0.3"/> which is already a mental concept and not a object out in # <pause dur="0.4"/> # in the world <pause dur="0.2"/> something which the signifier refers to so there is the signifier and the signified you've heard this now <shift feature="voice" new="laugh"/>before <shift feature="voice" new="normal"/><pause dur="0.3"/> and in the seminars as well <pause dur="0.3"/> and the signified <pause dur="0.5"/> that which is denoted by the signifier <pause dur="0.6"/> is already a mental concept <pause dur="1.2"/> and not an <pause dur="0.2"/> objective world out there <pause dur="2.6"/> and it is really only in the <pause dur="0.7"/> in the <pause dur="0.2"/> in the context of the whole sentence <pause dur="0.2"/> of the <pause dur="0.2"/> society <pause dur="0.3"/> that language or words <pause dur="0.2"/> take on their meaning <pause dur="0.4"/> now <pause dur="0.6"/> what does that mean for pictures <pause dur="1.1"/> <trunc>le</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> let's look at <pause dur="2.1"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> this picture here <pause dur="0.2"/> on your <pause dur="0.9"/> on your right <pause dur="0.2"/> this is on your right now yes <pause dur="1.4"/> here's a still life by the seventeenth century artist Caravaggio <pause dur="0.3"/> who worked in Rome in the seventeenth century <pause dur="0.8"/> now <pause dur="0.3"/> first we should note the signifiers what are the signifiers in this picture <pause dur="0.5"/> now <pause dur="0.2"/> strictly <trunc>s</trunc> 
speaking the signifiers in this picture <pause dur="0.2"/> are the brushstrokes so we note <pause dur="0.3"/> the sort of <pause dur="0.3"/> rather luminous background in <pause dur="0.2"/> pinkish this is actually a very pinkish slide it's not as pinkish as that # but # <pause dur="0.4"/> a sort of greyish <pause dur="0.7"/> rather luminous rather cloudy background <pause dur="0.8"/> which at times those brushstroke condemns to some sort of figurative <pause dur="0.5"/> assemblage in the foreground <pause dur="0.4"/> which yet is very pushed <pause dur="0.3"/> into the two-dimensional realm or or really kept or held back i should better say in the two-dimensional realm <pause dur="0.3"/> it seems as if it <trunc>n</trunc> <pause dur="0.7"/> it's articulated into some three-dimensional object but if you look very clearly it's not very clear <pause dur="0.4"/> how this object or these sorts of condensation of brushstrokes <pause dur="0.4"/> really <pause dur="1.2"/> take place in a three-dimensional picture space <pause dur="1.1"/> now these brushstroke and i've tried really hard to limit myself to just talking about brushstrokes here because <pause dur="0.3"/> only those are the signifiers <pause dur="0.4"/> these brushstroke <pause dur="0.3"/> then <pause dur="0.2"/> take on some meaning for us or we might associate them 
with <pause dur="0.4"/> fruit <pause dur="0.9"/> vegetables you know <trunc>ju</trunc> i think it's just fruit and a basket on a table <pause dur="1.0"/> and this is the signified <pause dur="0.4"/> the fruit <pause dur="0.2"/> we we associate with those brushstrokes the concept of fruit <pause dur="0.7"/> and basket <pause dur="1.5"/> now there is another semiotician called <pause dur="0.4"/> Charles Peirce <pause dur="0.5"/> who called <pause dur="0.2"/> the signified what Saussure called the signified <pause dur="0.3"/> an icon and that's been taken on by art historians quite quite rapidly the the the word icon <pause dur="0.3"/> because what Peirce said <pause dur="0.4"/> that the icon or the signified <pause dur="0.3"/> can have <pause dur="0.2"/> various relations <pause dur="0.2"/> with <pause dur="0.3"/> a known world various relations of resemblance with a <pause dur="0.2"/> with a known world <pause dur="0.3"/> so in this case there's a very close resemblance <pause dur="0.3"/> with <pause dur="0.2"/> the concept we have of fruit and basket <pause dur="0.4"/> because <pause dur="0.3"/> you know we we seem to see a fruit and a basket and it seems to be very close to fruits and baskets in our knowledge <pause dur="0.6"/> but there's also a further <trunc>dime</trunc> it can the icon can <trunc>a</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> also be <pause dur="0.3"/> quite # far removed from what we know in the objective world <pause dur="0.3"/> and take on much more abstract thoughts <pause dur="0.5"/> and that's actually <pause dur="0.5"/> present 
in this picture as well you might not have thought <pause dur="0.3"/> but if you look very closely <pause dur="0.3"/> and now i'm afraid i have to go here <pause dur="0.6"/><event desc="walks to slide" iterated="y" dur="1"/><kinesic desc="indicates point on slide" iterated="n"/> you can see that the <pause dur="0.4"/> the apple is worm-eaten <pause dur="0.2"/> that <pause dur="0.6"/> the <pause dur="0.2"/> the leaves wilt <pause dur="0.7"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> on the knowledge of # with the knowledge of seventeenth century thought <pause dur="0.5"/> we <pause dur="0.3"/> know that this is that actually denotes quite an abstract thought <pause dur="0.7"/> I-E it denotes <pause dur="0.3"/> a memento mori a vanitas symbol <pause dur="0.5"/> what it means is that <pause dur="0.3"/> even in the midst of beauty there's death <pause dur="0.3"/> we all will decay <pause dur="0.3"/> the vanitas symbol <pause dur="0.6"/> a memento mori <pause dur="0.4"/> so this is actually in this picture <pause dur="0.7"/> the signified <pause dur="0.7"/> also <trunc>i</trunc> # <trunc>e</trunc> <trunc>m</trunc> # it denotes two things one which is very closely related to <pause dur="0.2"/> what we think is the objective world <pause dur="0.4"/> and one which is <pause dur="0.3"/> a bit more removed from that <pause dur="0.2"/> and takes on abstract thoughts <pause dur="1.2"/> so that is <pause dur="0.2"/> <trunc>fu</trunc> # fundamental semiotic analysis of a picture <pause dur="3.3"/> now <pause dur="0.2"/> you find semioticians like Rosalind Krauss <pause dur="0.5"/> in one of the seminar texts who we've encountered <pause dur="0.2"/> one seminar hasn't quite encountered it yet <pause dur="0.4"/> who concentrate <pause dur="0.3"/> on 
how this meaning is constituted within the language of the individual picture <pause dur="0.8"/> like Saussure really who says <pause dur="0.9"/> meaning is only constituted by the syntax by the individual sentence in which a word is found <pause dur="0.5"/> and the sentence in this case is the entire picture so <pause dur="0.6"/> Rosalind Krauss if she looked at this picture <pause dur="0.3"/> would point out <pause dur="0.3"/> how much actually it is a two-dimensional construct it <pause dur="0.3"/> # Caravaggio doesn't actually give us the basket very firmly placed on a three-dimensional <pause dur="0.2"/> table in a three-dimensional room <pause dur="0.3"/> it really is very oddly pressed into two dimensions <pause dur="0.6"/> and she would <pause dur="0.4"/> take <pause dur="0.2"/> and <trunc>di</trunc> discuss that <pause dur="0.3"/> as then constructing the meaning which of course in the end would come close to the meaning i've just discussed <pause dur="0.2"/> the meaning of <pause dur="0.4"/> you know that he obviously wants to not just show us a beautiful arrangement of fruits in a basket <pause dur="0.3"/> but generate some further meaning <pause dur="0.8"/> that of the memento mori <pause dur="0.9"/> there is death in the midst of beauty <pause dur="2.0"/> however <trunc>va</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> after the Second World War another 
analysis of language <pause dur="0.5"/> rapidly spread through Anglo-American world <pause dur="0.3"/> and that was one <pause dur="0.3"/> which came from the philosopher the Viennese philosopher who emigrated to England # <pause dur="0.2"/> Ludwig Wittgenstein <pause dur="0.6"/> now <pause dur="0.2"/> Wittgenstein's philosophy of language <pause dur="0.2"/> emphasized the context the social context in which language emerged <pause dur="1.1"/> now he <pause dur="0.2"/> held that language emerges within and transforms our social <pause dur="0.2"/> transactions <pause dur="0.2"/> its contents is not some fixed state of affairs in the world <pause dur="0.4"/> but that state of affairs <pause dur="0.4"/> is permanated permeated by the life of speech by the way and the context it which we utter something <pause dur="2.7"/> now by analogy art might be seen <pause dur="0.2"/> as both to emerge <pause dur="0.2"/> out of the context of social activity <pause dur="0.6"/> as well as being irreducible to it and that is <pause dur="0.3"/> the <pause dur="0.2"/> really really important characteristic # of semioticians why they are so keen on what they are doing because they say <pause dur="0.3"/> what they do is <pause dur="0.2"/> different from a social historian or art historian <pause dur="0.4"/> because <pause dur="0.3"/> a social # they criticize social art historians as reducing a work 
of art as simply reflecting the states of affair in society <pause dur="0.4"/> while a semiotician <pause dur="0.5"/> claims to pay close attention <pause dur="0.2"/> to the irreducible nature of a work of art there is something very specific in a work of art as it comes together <pause dur="0.3"/> and a semiotician <pause dur="0.2"/> and that's characteristic of semiotics is that it tries to <pause dur="0.7"/> keep the balance between <pause dur="0.3"/> the reference to the social society and the context on the one hand <pause dur="0.4"/> and <pause dur="1.0"/> the artwork and the nature of the artwork <pause dur="0.3"/> as quite a <pause dur="0.4"/> in quite an quite a characteristic being on the other <pause dur="2.6"/> really the best known <pause dur="1.0"/> advocate of this kind of art history the semiotic approach in art history <pause dur="0.4"/> is someone called Norman Bryson <pause dur="0.7"/> B-R-Y-<pause dur="0.3"/>S-O-N <pause dur="0.4"/> B-R-Y-<pause dur="0.2"/>S-O-N so <pause dur="0.2"/> i'll just give you that name because you will find that <pause dur="0.5"/> that person in Preziozi's collection of essays for example <pause dur="2.0"/> now <pause dur="0.4"/> let me look at an analysis of a painting by Bryson and i will quote Bryson here but i have to <pause dur="0.3"/> give you a little bit more background before i can just <pause dur="1.1"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> launch into this <pause dur="0.9"/> into this quote from him <pause dur="1.4"/> 
and i give you two pictures <pause dur="0.6"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> Bryson is really in what i am going to quote to you now <pause dur="0.2"/> is really talking about this picture <pause dur="0.2"/> which is called the Gilles and is in the Louvre <pause dur="0.5"/> but he also refers to a figure <pause dur="0.4"/> which you will find in this picture <pause dur="0.2"/> by the same artist which is <kinesic desc="indicates point on slide" iterated="n"/> this figure and you will see it when i talk about it # <pause dur="0.2"/> so he amalgamates # various pictures by Watteau <pause dur="0.3"/> but really only talks <pause dur="0.3"/> and elicits the meaning of <kinesic desc="indicates slide" iterated="n"/> this one here <pause dur="1.5"/> another point <pause dur="0.3"/> in order to understand that quote is <pause dur="0.2"/> that he alludes to something called the <distinct lang="fr">fête champêtre</distinct> and that came up in the seminar yesterday <pause dur="0.3"/> and that's really a tradition which goes back to Titian but really <pause dur="0.3"/> became very <pause dur="0.2"/> very alive with Watteau in the eighteenth century # oh sorry i've given you the name of the artist now i'll come back to that but with this artist <pause dur="0.3"/> in the eighteenth century in France this is an eighteenth century French artist <pause dur="0.8"/> who placed # <pause dur="0.3"/> aristocratic people parties <pause dur="0.4"/> in nature <pause dur="0.3"/> and the point 
here was that <pause dur="0.5"/> that gathering that aristocratic <trunc>na</trunc> # gathering is as natural <pause dur="0.2"/> as nature itself <pause dur="0.2"/> in fact the nature though he places these people in were highly <pause dur="0.2"/> highly cultivated <pause dur="0.2"/> but still <pause dur="0.6"/> nature functions as a backdrop <pause dur="0.2"/> for these <distinct lang="fr">fêtes champêtres</distinct> <pause dur="0.2"/> the party in the countryside that means # <pause dur="0.3"/> as a sort of <pause dur="0.3"/> naturalizing element which naturalizes the coming-together <pause dur="0.8"/> right we've got that so <pause dur="0.4"/> let me <trunc>l</trunc> <pause dur="0.5"/> well first tell you <pause dur="0.7"/> about the artist <pause dur="0.5"/> who Bryson is talking about <pause dur="0.6"/> that is Jean-Antoine Watteau an eighteenth century French artist <pause dur="2.2"/> Bryson says <pause dur="0.8"/> <reading>in Watteau <pause dur="0.3"/> a whole narrative structure <pause dur="0.2"/> insists on meaning <pause dur="0.8"/> but at the same time <pause dur="0.6"/> withholds or avoids meaning <pause dur="0.7"/> let us take the example of this characteristic <kinesic desc="indicates slide" iterated="n"/> theatrical costume <pause dur="0.8"/> in the theatre <pause dur="0.4"/> such clothing is part of a general system of conventionalized costumes <pause dur="0.4"/> with exact dramatic and signalling functions <pause dur="0.9"/> the diamond-patterned costume <pause dur="0.4"/> signals Arlecchino</reading> <pause dur="0.7"/><kinesic desc="indicates slide" iterated="n"/> that's here <pause dur="0.3"/> on <pause dur="0.2"/> on the on the right <pause dur="0.6"/> <reading>the baggy <pause dur="0.3"/> white <pause dur="0.2"/> ruffed costume <pause dur="0.3"/> 
signals Pedrolino or Gilles <pause dur="0.5"/><kinesic desc="indicates slide" iterated="n"/>  here on the left <pause dur="0.4"/> the black cap and gown <pause dur="0.2"/> signals doctor <pause dur="1.9"/> but outside the frame of the stage in a <distinct lang="fr">fête champêtre</distinct> <pause dur="0.3"/> such signalling costumes lose their semantic charge <pause dur="0.2"/> and having lost that the original <trunc>meani</trunc> meaningfulness <pause dur="0.6"/> take on all the sadness of the depleted sign <pause dur="1.9"/> a sign <pause dur="0.2"/> that insists on a signified which is absent <pause dur="0.4"/> disconnected <pause dur="0.2"/> from the present signifier <pause dur="0.3"/> at the same time <pause dur="0.3"/> that sign <pause dur="0.2"/> makes the claim for a powerful and <unclear>attractive</unclear> <pause dur="0.2"/> signified <pause dur="0.6"/> in this case <pause dur="0.2"/> melancholy <pause dur="0.6"/> that is nowhere stated in the <trunc>pain</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> painterly signifier explicitly</reading> <pause dur="1.1"/> so what's he saying here <pause dur="0.3"/> he's really saying <pause dur="0.3"/> that Bryson that is that the meaning of the figures in the picture <pause dur="0.2"/> is at once dependent on the original context the theatre <pause dur="0.4"/> yet <pause dur="0.4"/> it's not <pause dur="0.2"/> like Wittgenstein's Life of Speech reducible to it <pause dur="0.8"/> but constitutes something other as well <pause dur="0.3"/> and particularly because it is depleted of that meaning in the theatre it takes on another meaning in this <pause dur="0.3"/> in this picture <pause dur="0.2"/> in 
this case <pause dur="0.3"/> the melancholy melancholy of <kinesic desc="indicates slide" iterated="n"/> this picture <pause dur="5.4"/> now here <pause dur="0.6"/> like in all other contemporary approaches i think it is which i've discussed so far and <pause dur="0.2"/> will continue to discuss here <pause dur="0.3"/> the specific social context of a work of art is crucial as you can see <pause dur="0.2"/> Bryson needs to know about the conventions of these figures in the theatre <pause dur="1.4"/> the comedians in the theatre <pause dur="0.2"/> and he needs to know about Watteau so he needs to know about the social context so that is the same <pause dur="0.6"/> as in all other <pause dur="0.2"/> approaches <pause dur="2.0"/> this is also the case and that's perhaps more surprising in the last <pause dur="0.2"/> approach i will come to today the psychoanalytical approach <pause dur="0.7"/> although here the larger context <pause dur="0.5"/> becomes the psychological development <pause dur="0.3"/> common or assumed to be common to all human beings <pause dur="1.1"/> so again <pause dur="0.5"/> because of psychoanalysis broader claims for unveiling general human psychological configurations <pause dur="0.3"/> we do not stand still with <pause dur="0.2"/> an interpretation of an individual artist <pause dur="0.5"/> and his or her work <pause dur="0.7"/> although <trunc>tha</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> 
that <pause dur="0.2"/> would always be the starting point <pause dur="0.4"/> but we are also drawn into <pause dur="0.3"/> how <pause dur="0.4"/> this work is conditioned by society in fact how the individual's <pause dur="0.3"/> psychological make-up <pause dur="0.3"/> is actually conditioned by society </u><gap reason="break in recording" extent="uncertain"/> <u who="nf0096" trans="pause"> i've very briefly looked <pause dur="0.5"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> at <pause dur="1.2"/> no <pause dur="1.3"/> at this picture <pause dur="0.6"/> last week <pause dur="0.3"/> you remember <pause dur="0.3"/> Renoir's the impressionist Renoir's La Loge <pause dur="0.2"/> of eighteen-seventy-four <pause dur="1.0"/> now let me here now recast that analysis which i i brought it up in discussion of feminist approaches you know the <pause dur="0.2"/> the men are the painters the women are the objects in painting <pause dur="0.4"/> now let me recast this here <pause dur="0.3"/> in a psychoanalytical <pause dur="0.2"/> in psychoanalytical terms and see what <pause dur="0.2"/> what that will generate for this picture <pause dur="0.6"/> but in order to do so i have to tell you a little bit more <pause dur="0.6"/> about <pause dur="0.2"/> Sigmund Freud <pause dur="0.3"/> who i mentioned in connection with Turner <pause dur="0.6"/> now Sigmund Freud <pause dur="0.4"/> the psychoanalyst well doctor in Vienna at the turn of the century <pause dur="1.7"/> advanced a theory <pause dur="0.3"/> of <pause dur="0.2"/> castration anxiety which really lies at the heart of psychoanalytical <pause dur="0.5"/> approaches to the history of art <pause dur="1.0"/> now 
that theory states that <pause dur="0.2"/> the infant male the infant boy experiences an uninhibited <trunc>pleas</trunc> # pleasure in his relationship with his mother's body <pause dur="0.8"/> until the stage <pause dur="0.2"/> when he realizes <pause dur="0.3"/> that he's actually in competition for it <pause dur="0.2"/> with his father <pause dur="0.8"/> now in particular <pause dur="0.4"/> the male infant <pause dur="0.2"/> fears that his father will deprive him <pause dur="0.2"/> of the penis <pause dur="0.3"/> that gives him so much pleasure <pause dur="1.4"/> now a thought which is actually confirmed according to psychoanalysis in the infant's <trunc>m</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> imagination <pause dur="0.3"/> by the appearance of his mother's <sic corr="genitalia">genitatalia</sic> <pause dur="0.3"/> which look to him like a castrated version of his own <pause dur="2.1"/> what is more the the father appears to be such a powerful figure <pause dur="0.8"/> obviously with a much more developed penis <pause dur="0.4"/> that the infant simply <pause dur="0.2"/> according to psychoanalysis <pause dur="0.5"/> sacrifices <pause dur="0.8"/> his own penis <pause dur="0.8"/> # as a source of pleasure <pause dur="0.3"/> and tries to found his identity on <pause dur="0.2"/> a substitute for that on some kind of what then psychoanalysis calls a phallus <pause dur="0.7"/> that has come <trunc>an</trunc> up in the seminars as well so the phallus is distinct from the 
penis <pause dur="0.3"/> it really is <pause dur="0.3"/> the object which the infant tries to concentrate on <pause dur="0.3"/> an object which is completely <pause dur="0.3"/> unviolatable which can't be reached by <pause dur="0.4"/> by <pause dur="0.2"/> by by the threat of the father can't be reached <pause dur="0.5"/> by any <pause dur="0.4"/> any violation from the father <pause dur="0.6"/> now <pause dur="0.2"/> asserting identity and identifying this phallus can take various forms and a <trunc>n</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> number of <trunc>i</trunc> <trunc>n</trunc> <pause dur="0.4"/> # of objects <pause dur="0.5"/> but its importance lies in it ability to have a symbolic value <pause dur="0.2"/> as something <pause dur="0.3"/> that stands for presence <pause dur="0.3"/> like <pause dur="0.3"/> the penis and the pleasure the <trunc>preni</trunc> the penis generated was present and <pause dur="0.3"/> and just there <pause dur="0.6"/> as well as <pause dur="0.4"/> power <pause dur="0.3"/> something which can't be hurt can't be taken away by someone else <pause dur="2.3"/> so really all that the male's physical otherness from the female first signified <pause dur="0.2"/> that had to be <pause dur="0.2"/> this phallus <pause dur="0.6"/> this is often why people or psychoanalysts explain why babies or infants actually toddlers i should say <pause dur="0.2"/> acquire language <pause dur="0.2"/> because that language actually stems <pause dur="0.6"/> has this kind of symbolic value it is present and it has power and the father uses 
it powerfully <pause dur="0.3"/> so <pause dur="0.3"/> it's often explained that <pause dur="0.3"/> children try to identify the with # with that and and take that on as a substitute <pause dur="0.3"/> for <trunc>hi</trunc> for <pause dur="0.2"/> for <pause dur="0.3"/> their own former pleasure <pause dur="0.2"/> with # with the female body and <pause dur="0.5"/> their own <pause dur="0.5"/> actual physical penis <pause dur="1.1"/> now what does that mean <pause dur="0.2"/> what what consequence <pause dur="0.2"/> does that have for this image here <pause dur="0.7"/> now simple argument would simply state <pause dur="0.5"/> that <pause dur="0.8"/> in all men there's a residual fear of castration <pause dur="0.7"/> and that was also there in Renoir when he painted this painting <pause dur="0.6"/> and <trunc>renoi</trunc> Renoir's <pause dur="0.6"/> and it inclined Renior <trunc>n</trunc> Renior to <pause dur="0.3"/> find # <pause dur="0.3"/> to find ways of deferring recognition <pause dur="0.5"/> that the female body is in fact a body castrated <pause dur="1.4"/> and therefore he painted <pause dur="0.2"/> this <pause dur="0.2"/> rather fetishized female number of them female bodies <pause dur="0.3"/> as a sort of <pause dur="0.2"/> perfect image something which can't be hurt something which isn't <pause dur="0.7"/> characterized by a lack <pause dur="0.4"/> or by something <pause dur="0.2"/> you know missing <pause dur="0.7"/> and # in this <pause dur="0.2"/> <trunc>c</trunc> sense you know in this psychoanalytical sense in fact the female body becomes a phallus <pause dur="0.2"/> a <trunc>s</trunc> penis 
substitute something which stands for power something <trunc>s</trunc> which stands for <pause dur="0.3"/> perfect <pause dur="0.6"/> unadulterated presence <pause dur="0.7"/> and of course <pause dur="0.2"/> it is <trunc>v</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> and of course in this image <pause dur="0.3"/> and this is where <pause dur="0.2"/> feminists have <pause dur="0.3"/> leaped into this <pause dur="0.3"/> the eroticized major still hangs on in all <trunc>f</trunc> <pause dur="0.3"/> all penis substitutes and all phalli according to psychoanalysis <pause dur="0.5"/> the that pleasure that initial pleasure the infant <pause dur="0.2"/> experienced <pause dur="0.2"/> that still lingers on <pause dur="0.3"/> and so <pause dur="0.2"/> the female body is <pause dur="0.2"/> eroticized on one hand it still has that it still stands in for the original penis which gave so much pleasure <pause dur="0.4"/> but of course it must never this woman must never become real she <trunc>m</trunc> she has to <pause dur="0.3"/> remain a figment of <pause dur="0.4"/> the <trunc>m</trunc> the male artist's imagination <pause dur="0.2"/> because as soon as she were to become real <pause dur="0.4"/> # the lack <pause dur="0.5"/> would become apparent again <pause dur="1.7"/> the lack the non-perfectness <pause dur="0.3"/> of women <pause dur="1.4"/> so <pause dur="1.2"/> this is <pause dur="0.4"/> i think the <trunc>vu</trunc> # a <trunc>ru</trunc> rudimentary account of psychoanalysis which really <trunc>underli</trunc> # underlies all psychoanalytic accounts <pause dur="0.6"/> and you can 
see <pause dur="0.2"/> very clearly <pause dur="0.3"/> in this account <pause dur="0.8"/> which is my last point here <pause dur="0.2"/> in with regard to approaches today # <pause dur="0.7"/> psychoanalytic <pause dur="0.3"/> approach <pause dur="0.3"/> is of course very very conducive to feminist appropriation and this is something i didn't mention last week when i went <pause dur="0.3"/> through all the different <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> ways that # all the different approaches which feminism or feminists question in art history can take on <pause dur="0.6"/> very often you do find feminist art history aligned with a psychoanalytic account <pause dur="0.3"/> for the obvious reasons that it helps <pause dur="0.3"/> feminists to explain why male artists have always depicted women in the way they have <pause dur="2.5"/> indeed <pause dur="0.4"/> <trunc>mo</trunc> just most of the contemporary approaches can appear in combination with one another and you've seen that in the seminars and in <trunc>v</trunc> variety of the texts there already <pause dur="0.8"/> let me finish <pause dur="0.3"/> today by going back to the start of this lecture series and <pause dur="0.2"/> hopefully <pause dur="0.2"/> wrapping this one up neatly in # as well <pause dur="0.2"/> and this is by <pause dur="0.8"/> going back to the blackboard <pause dur="0.2"/> which i <pause dur="0.7"/> something i did earlier <pause dur="0.5"/> <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/><event desc="moves screen" iterated="y" dur="10"/> <pause dur="0.3"/> and i 
hope you can read it <pause dur="0.5"/> and something you should <pause dur="0.2"/> recognize <pause dur="1.0"/> <vocal desc="laugh" iterated="n"/><shift feature="voice" new="laugh"/> you think i'm bombarding you with German here now <vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" dur="1"/> but no <vocal desc="laugh" iterated="n"/> <pause dur="0.6"/> <vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" dur="1"/> we are here <kinesic desc="indicates point on board" iterated="n"/> <vocal desc="laugh" iterated="n"/><shift feature="voice" new="laugh"/> <pause dur="0.9"/> this blackboard do you recognize this this is <pause dur="0.9"/> what <pause dur="0.2"/> i wrote up at the end of the first lecture <pause dur="0.3"/> all the different approaches i had gone through <pause dur="0.2"/> in the course of discussing Turner <pause dur="0.6"/> now <pause dur="0.2"/> what i've produced here in my beautiful <pause dur="0.2"/> designer <pause dur="0.3"/> mode <vocal desc="laugh" iterated="n"/> very clearly laid out <pause dur="0.4"/> i've <pause dur="0.5"/> taken them put them all down again and you can now recognize we had <pause dur="0.4"/> we really <pause dur="0.2"/> apart from the biographical approach i we i discussed all those approaches in the lectures <pause dur="0.8"/> but <pause dur="0.2"/> i drew a very firm line this time between <pause dur="0.2"/> those first four <pause dur="0.5"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> the last five <pause dur="0.6"/> because <pause dur="0.3"/> as i said in the lectures and today again <pause dur="0.4"/> all those last four <pause dur="0.2"/> refuse to accept and really highly criticize those approaches <pause dur="0.4"/> for just standing still there <pause dur="0.2"/> what they really all all these want to show is that <pause dur="0.4"/> an artwork <pause dur="0.3"/> can't <trunc>s</trunc> you can't stand still with a connoisseurial 
approach you can't sell still with a biographical approach or a formalist approach <pause dur="0.6"/> or indeed <pause dur="0.2"/> iconography as such you really have to show how deeply embedded <pause dur="0.2"/> the artwork <pause dur="0.3"/> is in society <pause dur="0.2"/> that comes here <kinesic desc="indicates point on board" iterated="n"/> i'll read it to you in a second <pause dur="0.4"/> and you have to investigate it <pause dur="0.2"/> from a critical contemporary viewpoint <pause dur="0.3"/> so what i've <pause dur="0.3"/> written <kinesic desc="indicates point on board" iterated="n"/> here i've made an arrow going up from all of these going up there <pause dur="0.3"/> saying <pause dur="0.3"/> they refuse to accept <pause dur="0.3"/> that an analysis of work of art is exhausted by these <pause dur="0.6"/> yet and that is important i think it is fair to say that all of these still need <kinesic desc="indicates point on board" iterated="n"/> those approaches somewhat as a base <pause dur="0.3"/> you do need a proper <pause dur="0.2"/> attribution to an artist or you <trunc>n</trunc> <pause dur="0.3"/> in order to really discuss an artwork meaningfulness in its place in its society <pause dur="0.4"/> you do need <pause dur="0.3"/> to look <pause dur="0.2"/> at an artwork first of all the way that it is <pause dur="0.3"/> painted the way or or sculpted or <pause dur="0.2"/> produced <pause dur="0.4"/> in order to really <pause dur="0.3"/> understand its meaning so you do need some kind of formalist appreciation after all so <pause dur="0.9"/><kinesic desc="indicates point on board" iterated="n"/> this is this sentence <pause dur="0.2"/> 
they do yet <pause dur="0.2"/> they do form these four approaches do form the base <pause dur="0.2"/> for all of these <kinesic desc="indicates point on board" iterated="n"/> <pause dur="0.7"/> but <pause dur="0.3"/> what these add is that art is <pause dur="0.4"/> very very clearly embedded in social formations <pause dur="0.3"/> and investigated from a <trunc>compe</trunc> contemporary critical viewpoint <pause dur="1.1"/> now then <pause dur="0.3"/> i have some very confusing arrows <kinesic desc="indicates point on board" iterated="n"/> here <pause dur="0.3"/> and they really show all the combinations possible that # in fact i started off when i thought about this <pause dur="0.5"/> this <pause dur="0.7"/> # <kinesic desc="indicates point on board" iterated="n"/> this # <pause dur="0.5"/> this <pause dur="0.4"/> graphic <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.8"/> outline here <pause dur="0.3"/> that in fact <pause dur="0.9"/><kinesic desc="indicates point on board" iterated="n"/> all these four last four approaches really do depend i mean and they have to on some kind of social art history if they all adhere to the <pause dur="0.3"/> # to to the belief that an artwork has <pause dur="0.3"/> is something not divinely ordained on the world but <pause dur="0.3"/> produced by <trunc>soti</trunc> societies <pause dur="0.3"/> so really <pause dur="0.2"/> social history of art not the Marxist one though because that as i said initially <pause dur="0.2"/> has become <pause dur="0.3"/> somewhat <pause dur="0.2"/> suspicious in its fundamental claims but social art history really feeds in all of these <kinesic desc="indicates point on board" iterated="n"/> <pause dur="0.3"/> and they can all feed into each other and form various and this is why it's sort of <pause dur="0.3"/> then i went from <kinesic desc="indicates point on board" iterated="n"/> this with arrows into 
all three <pause dur="0.3"/> from this <kinesic desc="indicates point on board" iterated="n"/> # so they're all connected with each other <pause dur="1.0"/> but <kinesic desc="indicates point on board" iterated="n"/> here at the very end and i think one can and and i have to be a bit more careful <pause dur="0.2"/> i think it's fair to say <pause dur="0.3"/> that a psychoanalytical approach <pause dur="0.2"/> would always have a <trunc>h</trunc> have a special affinity with a biographical approach you do need to if you start from the individual <pause dur="0.4"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> his or her make-up you do need to have some kind of knowledge of the <pause dur="0.3"/> of the not always as my analysis of Renoir showed you can do without it if you take it in very general terms <pause dur="0.3"/> but <pause dur="0.3"/> i think it's fair to say that they <pause dur="0.4"/> there is a special affinity to the biographical approach <pause dur="0.6"/> and i also think that there is a special affinity <pause dur="0.2"/> between the semiotic approach <pause dur="0.2"/> and formalists # the formalist approach we saw it with <trunc>ro</trunc> Rosalind Krauss <pause dur="1.1"/> but if you read Norman Bryson you can see that he places a heavy heavy <pause dur="0.4"/> emphasis <pause dur="0.2"/> on the way that the artwork is produced and i said it in the lecture a little earlier <pause dur="0.3"/> that what is specific about a semiotic 
approach is <pause dur="0.3"/> that it not only shows that the artwork is part of a context <pause dur="0.3"/> but also tries to account <pause dur="0.2"/> for what is really non-reducibly arty about an artwork <pause dur="0.4"/> so <pause dur="0.2"/> and that's where the formalist <pause dur="0.6"/> sympathy comes in <pause dur="0.9"/> there's and you will see this but this will now complicate it a little bit more but you will see it with <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> <pause dur="0.2"/> there's also a special affinity <pause dur="0.5"/> if if you don't have the special <trunc>af</trunc> <trunc>a</trunc> <trunc>a</trunc> affinity with a formalist approach <pause dur="0.3"/> then you might have a <pause dur="0.2"/> special affinity <pause dur="0.3"/> with <pause dur="0.2"/> the iconographical approach and i believe that <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> in his <pause dur="0.4"/> module <pause dur="0.3"/> will take iconography <pause dur="0.5"/> in a <trunc>m</trunc> non in a in a sort of modified non-Panofsky sense <pause dur="0.4"/> and # introduce you # talk about that again and the semiotic approach together <pause dur="1.1"/> so there are various special affinities <pause dur="0.4"/> but i hope <pause dur="0.3"/> that sort of <pause dur="0.2"/> neatly wraps it up and recalls certain things and brings it together <pause dur="0.9"/> and i'm <pause dur="0.2"/> actually for once today <pause dur="0.3"/> we'll finish in time <pause dur="0.3"/> but let me just say <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> that i've <pause dur="0.4"/> you know having come to the end now <pause dur="0.6"/> that <pause dur="0.4"/> none of the 
contemporary approaches has a clear sense and repeat this again of the underlying mechanisms <pause dur="0.4"/> which connect us with the past <pause dur="0.3"/> and <pause dur="0.4"/> is at the same time # <pause dur="0.3"/> working historically specific to that age or context or artwork under in <trunc>dev</trunc> investigation <pause dur="0.5"/> thus <pause dur="0.2"/> all of them are unable to give you a clear authoritative <pause dur="0.2"/> account of the art of the past <pause dur="0.6"/> and how it developed over time <pause dur="1.8"/> now it is however possible to give an account from a particular viewpoint <pause dur="0.3"/> be it social history feminism semiotics or indeed reception theory and all of that of course you will get over the next four modules in this course <pause dur="0.7"/> but of course you also will <pause dur="0.3"/> get a much much deeper <pause dur="0.2"/> knowledge of individual periods <pause dur="0.3"/> than i've <pause dur="0.3"/> produced here <pause dur="0.2"/> and of course you probably noticed and i greatly <pause dur="0.2"/> relish this that i that my account or my use of <pause dur="0.3"/> works of art in these lectures have really stretched right across the civilizations from <pause dur="0.3"/> Egyptian artworks <pause dur="0.3"/> to <pause dur="0.2"/> a very contemporary <pause dur="0.4"/> very up to date contemporary artist 
Jimmie Durham <pause dur="0.2"/> so if you really think about it you almost had an artwork from <pause dur="0.2"/> almost any very well known period of the of the history of art so we had Egyptian <pause dur="0.4"/> # we had classic Greek <pause dur="0.3"/> we had late Roman empire <pause dur="0.7"/> i referred to medieval cathedrals when i discussed Hegel <pause dur="0.3"/> then we went to the Renaissance with Martène <pause dur="0.3"/> Rubens and Rembrandt again when i <pause dur="0.3"/> discussed Wölfflin <pause dur="0.9"/> again the Baroque with Caravaggio here <pause dur="0.7"/> the eighteenth century is there with Watteau <pause dur="0.2"/> the nineteenth century is there with the with the Impressionists Monet Renoir the twentieth century with Picasso <pause dur="0.3"/> and # <pause dur="0.3"/> and the late twentieth century we're nearly <pause dur="0.3"/> out of it the late twentieth century we're nearly in the twenty-first century <pause dur="0.2"/> that's Jimmie Durham <pause dur="0.5"/> now <pause dur="0.4"/> this is something very unusual i must admit that i really really <pause dur="0.2"/> # it's very rare that one gets an opportunity in a lecture to have that <shift feature="voice" new="laugh"/>wide a range <shift feature="voice" new="normal"/>and <pause dur="0.3"/> oh i've forgotten there was Dürer as well so German Renaissance you had <pause dur="0.2"/> a bit more of the Renaissance <pause dur="0.4"/> and i enjoyed it but i hope <pause dur="0.5"/> it will make more sense to you <pause dur="0.3"/> when you do study <pause dur="0.6"/> particular periods from a particular angle at more depth in the next module so i hope you enjoy it
