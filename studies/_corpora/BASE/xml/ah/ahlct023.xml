he joined the Communist Party <pause dur="0.6"/> # following the example of his elder brother <pause dur="0.7"/> who again is significant Frank Thompson <pause dur="1.1"/> Frank Thompson was a kind of romantic hero for his <pause dur="0.3"/> for Edward <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> during the war Frank served in the Special Operations Executive <pause dur="0.7"/> # which was # organizing <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> # liaison with partisans in the Balkans <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> # he was parachuted in behind enemy lines <pause dur="0.6"/> and he was # <pause dur="0.5"/> shot by the Germans <pause dur="0.9"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> after he'd # <pause dur="0.3"/> teamed up with some Bulgarian partisans in nineteen-forty-four and they got themselves captured by the Nazis and he was executed <pause dur="1.5"/> Frank's death <pause dur="1.1"/> # cemented an emotional link <pause dur="0.5"/> for his younger brother who admired him hugely <pause dur="0.4"/> # an emotional link <pause dur="0.2"/> with the wartime resistance movements in occupied Europe <pause dur="1.0"/> that were to be the touchstone of Thompson's politics throughout his life <pause dur="2.3"/> okay war's over <pause dur="0.5"/> he's got his degree from Cambridge nineteen-forty-eight <pause dur="0.2"/> he moves to Halifax with his wife <pause dur="0.6"/> Dorothy Thompson who's another Cambridge historian and also a communist <pause dur="0.7"/> # they take 
up jobs in the W-E-A in adult education <pause dur="1.1"/> and # over the next decade or so Thompson is active as a communist <pause dur="0.4"/> in the West Riding peace movement and labour movements <pause dur="0.9"/> # and <pause dur="0.3"/> out of that comes his sense of who he's writing history for <pause dur="0.7"/> his sense of a popular audience <pause dur="0.5"/> it isn't academia that Thompson wants to address primarily <pause dur="1.3"/> his first two books were written out of his adult education teaching <pause dur="0.6"/> # and for that audience <pause dur="0.3"/> a biography of William Morris in nineteen-fifty-five <pause dur="1.1"/> which evokes the kind of fervour of <pause dur="0.5"/> the religion of socialism of socialist commitment <pause dur="0.3"/> in the eighteen-eighties and eighteen-nineties <pause dur="0.5"/> and his second book his most famous book <pause dur="0.3"/> The Making of the English Working Class in nineteen-sixty-three <pause dur="0.9"/> which is about the formation of <pause dur="0.6"/> and many of you will have looked at it about the formation of working class consciousness <pause dur="0.6"/> in England in the seventeen-nineties to the eighteen-<pause dur="0.4"/>thirties <pause dur="0.4"/> very much rooted in evidence from West Yorkshire <pause dur="0.2"/> where he was living and 
teaching <pause dur="1.2"/> now one key influence on Thompson's writing <pause dur="0.8"/> during the late nineteen-forties and early nineteen-fifties <pause dur="0.3"/> was the Communist Party <pause dur="1.8"/> British communism of course was a very marginal <pause dur="0.2"/> political force <pause dur="1.1"/> but it had <pause dur="0.9"/> a highly significant impact on intellectual life <pause dur="0.5"/> both in Britain and beyond <pause dur="0.8"/> because the Communist Party fostered a group of Marxist historians <pause dur="0.4"/> who were among the most distinguished of Britain's post-war historians <pause dur="1.1"/> Rodney Hilton <pause dur="0.6"/> medieval history Christopher Hill <pause dur="0.4"/> and the English Revolution <pause dur="0.3"/> Eric Hobsbawm <pause dur="1.4"/> # <pause dur="1.1"/> and Edward Thompson would be the biggest names among them but there were others as well other significant historians coming out of the Communist Party <pause dur="1.5"/> # <pause dur="0.9"/> for most of these people <pause dur="0.4"/> nineteen-fifty-six <pause dur="0.3"/> was the crunch year when they did their reckoning <pause dur="0.5"/> with official communism <pause dur="0.4"/> that's to say the year when Khrushchev <pause dur="0.4"/> made his famous speech about Stalin's crimes <pause dur="0.4"/> and when the Soviet Union invaded Hungary <pause dur="1.8"/> Thompson was to play a leading role in the <pause dur="0.5"/> 
breakaway <pause dur="0.6"/> of intellectuals from the Communist Party <pause dur="0.2"/> at that time <pause dur="1.0"/> and he was central with other ex-communists <pause dur="0.3"/> in establishing <pause dur="0.2"/> what became known as the new left <pause dur="1.4"/> an attempt to work out a <pause dur="0.2"/> kind of post-Stalinist democratic <pause dur="0.6"/> Marxism <pause dur="0.5"/> that was non-sectarian <pause dur="0.2"/> and above all was non-aligned in the Cold War that didn't see <pause dur="0.8"/> Moscow as any better than Washington <pause dur="2.5"/> Thompson's <pause dur="0.4"/> <trunc>a</trunc> and the major political intervention <pause dur="0.4"/> of this new left <pause dur="0.4"/> coming out of the # <pause dur="0.3"/> the breakaway from communism in nineteen-fifty-six <pause dur="0.3"/> was the first wave of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament <pause dur="0.8"/> <trunc>ch</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> between <pause dur="0.5"/> late fifties nineteen-fifty-nine nineteen-sixty-four <pause dur="2.1"/> and in fact it was just at the end of that period i first met <pause dur="0.4"/> Edward Thompson on an Aldermaston march <pause dur="0.9"/> the <trunc>f</trunc> <pause dur="0.6"/> second one i went on i think but i was amazed to find myself # <pause dur="0.4"/> walking alongside this fellow <pause dur="0.2"/> whose book i'd <pause dur="0.3"/> just been reading and he talked exactly like he wrote i couldn't understand how a man could be <pause dur="0.3"/> quite that eloquent in just ordinary 
conversation <pause dur="1.5"/> i'll give you more of these little personal insights as we go along <pause dur="0.3"/> right <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.8"/> in the same year <pause dur="0.4"/> # nineteen-sixty-five <pause dur="0.7"/> that i <pause dur="0.2"/> met him on an Aldermaston march he was appointed as one of the first members of <pause dur="0.4"/> <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/>'s History department <pause dur="0.5"/> and he stayed at <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> <pause dur="0.3"/> until nineteen-seventy-two establishing the <pause dur="0.2"/> Social History Centre <pause dur="1.7"/> and developing the insights of The Making of the English Working Class back in time essentially <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> working on <pause dur="0.2"/> crime <pause dur="0.3"/> and the link between crime and popular protest <pause dur="0.7"/> # he got together a group of graduate students <pause dur="0.5"/> # they <pause dur="0.3"/> collectively published <pause dur="0.3"/> a book <trunc>o</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> of essays Albion's Fatal Tree in nineteen-<pause dur="0.3"/>seventy-five <pause dur="0.3"/> and in and in the same year Thompson published <pause dur="0.5"/> the book that will be the text <pause dur="0.6"/> for the course <pause dur="0.4"/> # Whigs and Hunters in nineteen-seventy-five <pause dur="2.5"/> now <pause dur="0.4"/> the job at <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> <pause dur="0.2"/> was Thompson's only full time academic appointment <pause dur="1.2"/> # he subsequently after he left <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> <pause dur="0.3"/> lived on royalties journalism the occasional American lecture tour <pause dur="0.4"/> his wife 
Dorothy remained <pause dur="0.2"/> in academia <pause dur="0.6"/> and had a distinguished career herself as a historian of Chartism <pause dur="2.0"/> while at <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> <pause dur="0.3"/> Thompson <pause dur="0.2"/> didn't <pause dur="0.5"/> and # simply devote himself <pause dur="0.4"/> to <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> academic work <pause dur="0.3"/> he was also <pause dur="0.2"/> he went on being a political activist <pause dur="0.9"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> he writes a series of # <pause dur="0.2"/> # sorry <pause dur="0.3"/> i've lost my <pause dur="0.2"/> place there <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/><vocal desc="sniff" iterated="n"/><pause dur="3.6"/> in the early sixties <pause dur="0.6"/> the new left which i just described as this formation of <pause dur="0.2"/> <trunc>b</trunc> of of anti-<pause dur="0.2"/>Stalinist Marxism that comes out of the break up of the C-P and <pause dur="0.4"/> # the Communist Party in nineteen-fifty-six <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> the new left <pause dur="0.2"/> splits apart <pause dur="0.3"/> # in the early nineteen-<pause dur="0.2"/>sixties <pause dur="0.4"/> and there's particularly a fall out between younger Marxists on New Left Review <pause dur="0.5"/> and that group of people who are now much older Marxists very much older Marxists still control <pause dur="0.2"/> New Left Review <pause dur="0.6"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> the people who'd set it up originally Thompson and his friends <pause dur="0.8"/> the younger Marxists <pause dur="0.2"/> embrace a kind of structuralist Marxism <pause dur="0.3"/> that's coming out of France at that time <pause dur="0.2"/> i'll say more about that later <pause dur="0.4"/> but Thompson <pause dur="0.6"/> 
defines during the # <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> # these years he defines a distinctive relationship to Marxism <pause dur="0.4"/> he writes a series of <pause dur="1.0"/> # polemical essays <pause dur="0.2"/> directed at <pause dur="0.6"/> these structuralists on New Left Review notably his essay on the peculiarities of the English <pause dur="0.3"/> in nineteen-sixty-five <pause dur="0.3"/> and it culminates in his book <pause dur="0.3"/> or collection of essays but also the big essay in the book <pause dur="0.2"/> The Poverty of Theory <pause dur="0.8"/> in nineteen-seventy-eight and the an extract from The Poverty of Theory <pause dur="0.8"/> is also part of the text for the seminar <pause dur="1.1"/> and that <pause dur="0.5"/> essay <pause dur="0.4"/> was a polemic against the French Marxist philosopher <pause dur="0.4"/> Althusser <pause dur="0.6"/> who was all the rage among young younger Marxists <pause dur="1.2"/> so Thompson was doing <pause dur="1.2"/> Marxist argumentation as it were <pause dur="0.2"/> while he was <pause dur="0.2"/> teaching at <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> <pause dur="0.4"/> he was also playing a leading role <pause dur="0.4"/> in the unsuccessful campaign of resistance to what <pause dur="0.3"/> he called <pause dur="0.3"/> <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> University Limited <pause dur="0.9"/> that's to say the very close relations the university has always had from the start <pause dur="0.4"/> with # local and national and international <pause dur="0.4"/> business organizations <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> 
you probably all have some idea of the story of what happened perhaps you don't perhaps it's just disappeared in the mists of times i don't know but there was <pause dur="0.3"/> a student occupation of the registry they found a lot of files <pause dur="0.4"/> # that # some of those files <pause dur="0.2"/> # showed the Vice-Chancellor of the time <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> # going along with Rootes <pause dur="0.5"/> of <pause dur="0.3"/> Rootes <pause dur="0.2"/> yeah <pause dur="0.4"/> # and <trunc>r</trunc> and Rootes Hall <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> paying # a lawyer to spy on visiting academics who were talking to Coventry workers <pause dur="0.4"/> and stirring up trouble in Coventry factories <pause dur="0.5"/> so # <pause dur="0.5"/> that stuff came out <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="1.3"/> in fact <pause dur="0.2"/> i went along with Edward the night <pause dur="0.3"/> those files were found to the registry which was occupied by students <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> we lifted the files we took them home i organized the illegal <trunc>distri</trunc> those <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> the university took out an injunction <pause dur="0.6"/> i organized the illegal distribution of these files while Edward wrote the polemics <pause dur="0.5"/> # about how the liberal university was abusing its <pause dur="0.2"/> position <pause dur="1.4"/> that <pause dur="0.5"/> little local campaign <pause dur="0.9"/> was # part of a much broader issue 
for Thompson about civil liberties <pause dur="0.7"/> and throughout the nineteen-seventies he's writing polemical journalism <pause dur="0.3"/> attacking the secret state <pause dur="0.8"/> # defending the right to strike defending the jury system which is under threat and so on <pause dur="0.6"/> and that in a way is <pause dur="0.6"/> quite surprising the the all this is informed by a quite surprisingly un-Marxist sense <pause dur="0.6"/> of the law <pause dur="0.7"/> as an instrument <pause dur="0.2"/> not just of repression <pause dur="0.9"/> but also as an instrument of resistance to repression <pause dur="1.1"/> there were real liberties to be defended he believed <pause dur="0.3"/> the final period of Thompson's life was dominated by the new Cold War <pause dur="0.7"/> from nineteen-seventy-nine <pause dur="0.5"/> by the second wave of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament in the early nineteen-eighties which owed a great deal to Thompson's <pause dur="0.2"/> skills as a pamphleteer <pause dur="0.3"/> and a public speaker <pause dur="1.0"/> and if i can put myself in the picture once again why not <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> i went along to hear Edward talk in Leamington Spa that swept me <pause dur="0.2"/> off my feet and i spent the next six years <pause dur="0.3"/> more or less full time doing peace 
movement work and occasionally coming in here to lecture and somehow <pause dur="0.3"/> holding down the job <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="1.5"/> Thompson <pause dur="0.3"/> gave up history altogether <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> he helped to found and lead an organization called European Nuclear Disarmament which was <pause dur="0.4"/> all about getting up some kind of non-aligned dialogue between dissidents in the East <pause dur="0.4"/> and dissidents like himself in the peace movement in the West <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="2.2"/> and his critical intervention in all that was <pause dur="0.2"/> to talk about the importance to theorize about the importance of popular revolt on both sides of the Iron Curtain against what he saw <pause dur="0.2"/> and defined as the <pause dur="0.2"/><kinesic desc="makes quotation mark gesture" iterated="n"/> exterminist was the word he used <pause dur="0.2"/> the exterminist logic <pause dur="0.2"/> of the bloc system <pause dur="0.5"/> we all at that time of course <pause dur="0.2"/> thought <pause dur="0.3"/> that nuclear war <pause dur="0.3"/> was quite possible and would quite possibly happen quite soon <pause dur="0.9"/> that danger might seem quite remote now <pause dur="0.7"/> # but in the early eighties <pause dur="0.3"/> as twenty years earlier <pause dur="0.7"/> the idea that the Cold War confrontation had built into it a structure of exterminism <pause dur="0.9"/> had compelling 
force for millions of people and <pause dur="0.3"/> as i say Thompson gave up history <pause dur="0.2"/> altogether <pause dur="0.3"/> full time commitment to the peace movement <pause dur="1.8"/> he's eventually killed <pause dur="0.7"/> by a disease that he picked up while travelling in India <pause dur="0.8"/> which was always part of his kind of one of his places <pause dur="0.6"/> because of the importance of how he grew up as i <pause dur="0.2"/> # said <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> he died but before he died in nineteen-ninety-three he had time to complete a book on William Blake <pause dur="2.0"/> which was part of a lifelong engagement with the Romantic poets when he was here he taught a special subject <pause dur="0.5"/> on # <pause dur="0.3"/> the making of the English working class and the poets <pause dur="0.6"/> Wordsworth and so on <pause dur="0.6"/> # the book on Wordsworth was never written <pause dur="0.6"/> Thompson had originally intended to be a poet <pause dur="0.8"/> like his father and his brother <pause dur="1.1"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> not a historian <pause dur="0.9"/> and he did write poetry he wrote a novel <pause dur="0.5"/> a <pause dur="0.4"/> not terribly good novel actually <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> but his poetic sensibility <pause dur="0.2"/> and craftsmanship went above all into his writing of history <pause dur="9.1"/><kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="3"/> a contrast there between what i'm calling <pause dur="0.5"/> 
Thompson a poet of the past and what Marx said about where poetry <pause dur="0.2"/> has to come from <pause dur="0.6"/> i will come back to <pause dur="1.3"/> now it's clear i think from the sketch i'd given you already that there's an intimate link between history and political commitment <pause dur="0.6"/> for Thompson <pause dur="2.5"/> i'll talk about <pause dur="0.3"/> his take on Marxism a bit later </u><gap reason="break in recording" extent="uncertain"/> <u who="nm0086" trans="pause"> what i want to stress now is the kind of politics <pause dur="0.5"/> that turned Thompson on <pause dur="1.6"/> it certainly wasn't orthodox electoral politics <pause dur="0.8"/> he joined the Labour Party some years after he left the Communist Party but he was never active <pause dur="0.4"/> and he tended to be contemptuous <pause dur="0.2"/> of the kind of machine politics <pause dur="0.4"/> of <pause dur="0.2"/> the established parties <pause dur="0.5"/> though he did actually have Robin Cook <pause dur="0.2"/> working with him closely in European Nuclear Disarmament <pause dur="0.6"/> how things change <pause dur="0.8"/><vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" dur="1" n="ss"/> # <pause dur="1.9"/> it wasn't electoral politics it wasn't revolutionary politics either which probably is where i was coming from at the time i was <pause dur="0.6"/> with Edward and <pause dur="0.2"/> got rather impatient with him <pause dur="0.2"/> he was very critical of 
younger revolutionary Marxists <pause dur="0.3"/> in the nineteen-sixties and nineteen-seventies <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> though he continued to think of himself as a communist <pause dur="1.2"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> and imagined a future transformation of society on liberal <pause dur="0.3"/> libertarian democratic communist lines <pause dur="1.0"/> he never thought the time was right for that though <pause dur="1.3"/> the key to Thompson's politics and to the politics actually of a whole generation <pause dur="0.5"/> of leftists <pause dur="0.2"/> that he belonged to <pause dur="0.3"/> was anti-fascism <pause dur="1.3"/> # <pause dur="0.8"/> he'd grown up in the late nineteen-thirties and the nineteen-forties <pause dur="0.7"/> in when the compelling <pause dur="0.6"/> thing was to be part of a popular front against fascism <pause dur="1.1"/> it was a politics of socialism in defeat <pause dur="0.8"/> the highest goal <pause dur="0.2"/> for the time being <pause dur="0.3"/> was to resist fascism <pause dur="1.0"/> and to defend democratic values <pause dur="0.7"/> the revolution the dream of October nineteen-seventeen <pause dur="0.3"/> hadn't been abandoned <pause dur="0.8"/> but it'd been pushed forward into <pause dur="0.3"/> you know a pretty unreal future <pause dur="0.4"/> and it remained there for <pause dur="0.2"/> throughout Edward's life <pause dur="0.2"/> so far as he was concerned <pause dur="0.9"/> the emotional touchstone of his politics 
as i said before <pause dur="0.7"/> was the cause for which brother Frank died <pause dur="0.3"/> the European resistance movements against fascism <pause dur="1.0"/> and whatever opportunities existed <pause dur="0.6"/> for a move towards some kind of democratic socialist outcome of the Second World War <pause dur="1.3"/> which Thompson would have argued there were real opportunities for <pause dur="0.2"/> for that to happen <pause dur="1.0"/> # those were decisively closed down of course by the emergence of the Cold War <pause dur="1.5"/> Thompson always had a profound sense that this wasn't actually a very good time to be alive <pause dur="1.9"/> one was if one was coming from where he was standing struggling on the margins of history to defend <pause dur="0.2"/> what you could of human values <pause dur="0.3"/> against a new Dark Ages <pause dur="0.3"/> that the Cold War threatened <pause dur="0.5"/> extermination <pause dur="0.4"/> possibly <pause dur="0.9"/> # <pause dur="1.2"/> when Thompson issued calls for political action he did it not in the language of socialism <pause dur="1.6"/> and social transformation <pause dur="0.5"/> he did it more in a in a more modest language of the defence <pause dur="0.3"/> of democratic values <pause dur="0.3"/> and of human survival <pause dur="1.1"/> the key terms are always

relationships among individuals <pause dur="0.5"/> yeah <pause dur="0.9"/> by the nineteenth century society <pause dur="0.9"/> is a big thing out there isn't it it's a structure <pause dur="2.3"/> mm <pause dur="1.0"/> # it's an object a system operating according to its own laws of motion <pause dur="1.3"/> so the point i'm making here is that Thompson's critique <pause dur="0.2"/> of the economic <pause dur="0.6"/> of the idea of an economy and of economic man and of laws of political economy <pause dur="1.8"/> Thompson's critique of the economic can be seen as opening the way <pause dur="0.5"/> to a historicization <pause dur="1.2"/> of all the foundational concepts of social science <pause dur="1.3"/> yeah <pause dur="1.5"/> the polity <pause dur="1.1"/> society <pause dur="1.3"/> the culture <pause dur="0.8"/> the culture nature distinction <pause dur="0.5"/> # this is <pause dur="0.3"/> # <trunc>m</trunc> much of the way we think that <pause dur="0.5"/> happened in the eighteenth century <pause dur="0.6"/> male female <pause dur="0.8"/> yeah <pause dur="0.4"/> the way we think that <pause dur="0.4"/> is a social product <pause dur="0.3"/> and <trunc>s</trunc> in its current form quite recent <pause dur="0.9"/> all this <pause dur="1.1"/> of course can be seen as pointing the way towards a post-structuralist <pause dur="0.5"/> historical practice <pause dur="1.0"/> yeah <pause dur="0.6"/> in which the point <pause dur="0.2"/> of <pause dur="0.2"/> critical history <pause dur="0.7"/> is not to find out what the structures were and how they operate <pause dur="0.6"/> right <pause dur="0.7"/> 
the economy society <pause dur="0.6"/> and so on not to find out these what these structures are <pause dur="0.5"/> but to explain how those concepts came into existence <pause dur="0.9"/> mm <pause dur="1.4"/> so you're not working with the concepts of social science <pause dur="0.7"/> you're explaining how social science is just the ideology of modern society <pause dur="2.0"/> yeah <pause dur="1.4"/> then you get into territory that we will get into next term when we turn to look at Foucault <pause dur="1.1"/> in which <pause dur="0.2"/> what the job of the historian is to do is to mine down and uncover the origins of the discourses <pause dur="0.5"/> by which we speak about <pause dur="0.2"/> the way power operates <pause dur="1.2"/> yeah <pause dur="1.2"/> but we can't then say well we'll explain how societies society whatever that is is developing by talking about the economy <pause dur="0.8"/> these concepts are themselves <pause dur="0.2"/> what we need to investigate how did we come to think <pause dur="0.6"/> in that way <pause dur="0.6"/> now that's a route Thompson didn't want to go down <pause dur="0.3"/> and i don't want to go any further down it now <pause dur="0.2"/> we will explore that much more next term <pause dur="0.4"/> yeah <pause dur="0.8"/> as to a history <pause dur="0.3"/> which is essentially an analysis of the production and 
reproduction of discourses <pause dur="1.1"/> yeah <pause dur="0.6"/> Thompson didn't want to go round down that road <pause dur="1.5"/> he clung to the Marxist notion <pause dur="0.5"/> that relations of production were fundamental to the ways in which society worked <pause dur="0.6"/> and he was content to avoid economic reductionism <pause dur="1.0"/> by insisting that the economy <pause dur="2.3"/> was not <pause dur="0.2"/> a separate level <pause dur="1.8"/> that it involved <pause dur="0.3"/> as he said all the bloody levels <pause dur="2.9"/> when more orthodox Marxists objected that this wasn't <pause dur="0.7"/> what Marx meant <pause dur="1.4"/> then Thompson began to lose <pause dur="0.4"/> patience with <pause dur="0.2"/> theological <pause dur="0.3"/> takes on Marxism <pause dur="0.9"/> Thompson was well aware that <pause dur="0.3"/> after the eighteen-forty-eight defeats <pause dur="1.2"/> Marx himself had moved away from a humanist position <pause dur="0.3"/> as expounded in his early writings <pause dur="0.4"/> towards more structuralist <pause dur="0.2"/> positions <pause dur="2.3"/> Thompson would argue that Marx's <pause dur="1.1"/> the writing of Das Kapital <pause dur="0.3"/> Marx's engagement with <pause dur="0.3"/> structuralist engagement with political economy investigating the laws of motion of the capitalist economy <pause dur="0.8"/> represented <pause dur="0.4"/> for Marx something of a capitulation <pause dur="1.3"/> to the very categories of thought <pause dur="1.4"/> which the 
working class movement and the early Marx <pause dur="0.2"/> had set out to challenge in the name of humanity and human agency <pause dur="1.6"/> when Thompson cites <pause dur="0.6"/> that <pause dur="0.5"/> passage from The Eighteenth Brumaire <pause dur="0.4"/> <reading>men make their own history but they do not make it just as they please</reading> <pause dur="0.2"/> he puts the emphasis on the first part of the sentence <pause dur="2.3"/> a more orthodox reading of The Eighteenth Brumaire <pause dur="0.2"/> stresses the second half of the sentence <pause dur="2.0"/> now you've all read The Eighteenth Brumaire <pause dur="0.6"/> haven't you <pause dur="0.7"/> so <pause dur="0.4"/> you should <pause dur="0.2"/> # be able to make a judgement <pause dur="0.2"/> about this <pause dur="0.5"/> but let me just sketch out for you so you can situate Thompson <pause dur="0.2"/> in relation to orthodox more orthodox Marxism <pause dur="1.1"/> the structuralist <trunc>reas</trunc> reading <pause dur="0.5"/> of The Eighteenth Brumaire is going to stress the but <pause dur="0.2"/> aren't they men make their own history but <pause dur="0.2"/> only under certain conditions <pause dur="1.6"/> for the orthodox Marxist agency <pause dur="0.8"/> self-determination <pause dur="0.5"/> are what are going to happen in the future <pause dur="1.0"/> that's what the socialist revolution will produce <pause dur="0.2"/> in the 
meantime however <pause dur="0.4"/> men are doomed to be playthings of forces they don't understand <pause dur="0.5"/> locked in false consciousness <pause dur="0.5"/> inherited attitudes ideas traditions which <pause dur="0.4"/> Marx writes <reading>weigh like a nightmare on the brain of the living</reading> so you know in The Eighteenth Brumaire they <pause dur="0.7"/> they do the English Civil War out of the Bible and the French # first French Revolution out of the Roman Republic and eighteen-forty-eight out of the first French Revolution and so on <pause dur="0.2"/> they're living in a mental prison of tradition <pause dur="0.4"/> the players in these games <pause dur="0.8"/> and that's a major source of their inability to understand what they're really at <pause dur="0.3"/> and therefore to be in control <pause dur="0.4"/> of the consequences <pause dur="0.2"/> of their own actions <pause dur="1.5"/> for Marx the past is a nightmare <pause dur="0.7"/> from which we're struggling to wake up <pause dur="0.4"/> and the revolution will be that wake up process <pause dur="0.8"/> that and the nightmare's a land of false consciousness a land of <pause dur="0.2"/> vast impersonal forces <pause dur="0.7"/> <reading>the poetry of the proletarian 
revolution</reading> <pause dur="0.3"/> he says <pause dur="0.4"/> yeah <pause dur="0.8"/> <reading>will be drawn not from the past but from the future <pause dur="0.6"/> let the dead bury their dead</reading> <pause dur="0.3"/> says Marx talking about all that junk past history <pause dur="2.8"/> a humanist reading of The Eighteenth Brumaire on the other hand would privilege the first part of the sentence men make their own history <pause dur="0.3"/> but only under certain conditions <pause dur="1.2"/> agency that is to say <pause dur="1.0"/> for Thompson <pause dur="0.2"/> is already with us <pause dur="0.9"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> it's in agency that the ultimate meaning of history is to be found <pause dur="1.8"/> human agency for Thompson is too important to be booted into the future <pause dur="1.8"/> the past <pause dur="0.2"/> is not just a vale of necessity <pause dur="0.6"/> in which men are pathetic victims at the mercy of impersonal forces <pause dur="1.3"/> class struggle <pause dur="0.9"/> is <pause dur="0.6"/> an open undetermined process what comes out what eventuates <pause dur="0.8"/> does so through blood sweat intelligence energy <pause dur="2.3"/> now he's not arguing of course that <pause dur="0.3"/> men <pause dur="0.4"/> or women are in complete control <pause dur="0.3"/> the second half of the sentence is still there the outcome is often unintended <pause dur="3.1"/> 
nevertheless the meaning of history <pause dur="0.4"/> is to be found in <pause dur="0.3"/> the will and the action that precious space of partial <pause dur="0.3"/> free agency <pause dur="1.0"/> not in the triumph of impersonal laws of motion over the puny and <pause dur="0.3"/> confused efforts of human beings <pause dur="1.1"/> Thompson rescuing the poor from the condescension of posterity <pause dur="1.3"/> well it's the condescension that Marx among others that he's trying to rescue them from <pause dur="0.8"/> Marx's contemptuous dismissal <pause dur="0.2"/> let the dead bury their dead those old struggles are done and gone <pause dur="1.0"/> for Thompson the investigation of previous movements of protest and resistance <pause dur="0.2"/> wasn't just a record of failure <pause dur="0.9"/> it was a major resource <pause dur="0.2"/> for the future <pause dur="1.5"/> as i pointed out earlier <pause dur="0.8"/> Thompson never thought the revolution was round the corner <pause dur="0.3"/> he didn't expect to hear Marx's poetry of the future <pause dur="1.6"/> the time wasn't right for the audacity of revolutionaries kind of junking history <pause dur="0.2"/> starting off from year one and reinventing society out of pure reason <pause dur="0.8"/> time wasn't right for that kind of stuff <pause dur="1.0"/> 
for Thompson <pause dur="0.4"/> and this is true of the whole British school of Marxist historians much more generally <pause dur="0.9"/> the poetry <pause dur="0.7"/> was to be found precisely in the past <pause dur="1.8"/> in the capacity of human beings over centuries of oppression <pause dur="0.4"/> to resist <pause dur="0.5"/> to resist the iron logic of the structures <pause dur="0.7"/> that held out hope for the future <pause dur="0.5"/> it was a record of <pause dur="0.4"/> will and struggle and only partly defeated human values <pause dur="0.9"/> <reading>men</reading> Thompson writes <reading>are the</reading> <pause dur="0.8"/> and the phrase is there <pause dur="0.2"/> <reading>the ever baffled <pause dur="0.2"/> and ever resurgent agents <pause dur="0.2"/> of an unmastered history</reading> <pause dur="1.2"/> there's everything to play for <pause dur="1.4"/> ever baffled ever resurgent <pause dur="0.7"/> there's a deep sense of the tragedy of human existence <pause dur="0.5"/> in the way Thompson approaches thing <pause dur="0.5"/> alongside <pause dur="1.6"/> people's capacity to change the world or at least to resist <pause dur="1.4"/> any final triumph of the anti-human changes wrought by such malevolent forces <pause dur="0.2"/> as in his view <pause dur="1.3"/> free market capitalism <pause dur="1.0"/> or indeed exterminism what he labelled the <pause dur="0.4"/> 
military industrial complexes of East and West confronting each other <pause dur="0.2"/> with nuclear missiles <pause dur="0.2"/> in the nineteen-<pause dur="0.3"/>#-<pause dur="0.3"/>seventies and eighties <pause dur="1.0"/> now this is radically different from Marx's version of the idea of progress <pause dur="0.6"/> yeah <pause dur="0.3"/> for Marx <pause dur="2.1"/> come the revolution men will <pause dur="0.8"/> become their own agents they'll escape from the realm of necessity prehistory will end real history will begin <pause dur="0.2"/> you'll move into the realm of freedom <pause dur="1.1"/> you're not ever baffled ever ever resurgent <pause dur="0.5"/> you're finally triumphing over the weight of the past this nightmare that weighs down on the brains of the living <pause dur="0.5"/> you're taking conscious control of your destiny <pause dur="0.5"/> that's Marx's vision <pause dur="1.3"/> it wasn't one that Thompson <pause dur="0.6"/> attuned to the depressing realities of mid-twentieth century history <pause dur="0.7"/> # could give much meaning to <pause dur="1.2"/> Thompson had a decidedly jaundiced view of progress what did progress mean <pause dur="0.4"/> Soviet industrialization and the Gulag <pause dur="1.0"/> or <pause dur="1.5"/> the United States military industrial <pause dur="0.3"/> complex and exterminism <pause dur="1.3"/> ecological disaster <pause dur="0.8"/> capitalist globalism <pause dur="1.5"/> 
for Thompson <pause dur="0.7"/> the best hope and <pause dur="0.2"/> of both <trunc>re</trunc> surviving and resisting the anti-human logic <pause dur="0.5"/> of these systems <pause dur="0.9"/> <trunc>wa</trunc> lay in recovering some of the human values <pause dur="0.5"/> which had been defended by those who <pause dur="0.2"/> resisted <pause dur="0.2"/> the rise of that world system <pause dur="0.2"/> from the outset <pause dur="1.3"/> their battles <pause dur="0.2"/> clearly were unsuccessful <pause dur="0.9"/> but the values they fought for <pause dur="0.3"/> weren't altogether lost <pause dur="0.8"/> and Thompson <pause dur="0.5"/> history was all about <pause dur="1.0"/> recovering it <pause dur="0.8"/> mounting defences on the basis of those values confident not perhaps of any ultimate victory but that something could be <trunc>atre</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> achieved <pause dur="0.3"/> at least you could keep the struggle alive <pause dur="0.8"/> so that human beings could go on <pause dur="0.9"/> surviving which means being ever baffled but also ever resurgent <pause dur="2.3"/> and that really <pause dur="0.3"/> brings me <pause dur="0.5"/> to the end and it brings me to <pause dur="0.2"/> where i'm going to start my next <pause dur="0.3"/> 
lecture <pause dur="0.2"/> because that's the standpoint from which Whigs and Hunters <pause dur="0.5"/> set out to recover the history <pause dur="0.7"/> in Whigs and Hunters Thompson sets out to recover the history <pause dur="0.3"/> of a really very obscure group of people <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> foresters <pause dur="0.4"/> in <trunc>win</trunc> around Windsor <pause dur="0.2"/> in the early eighteenth century <pause dur="0.4"/> who are reacting against the onrush of capitalist property relations in and around the forest <pause dur="1.0"/> what i'll do <pause dur="0.4"/> in the first week of next term is explore <pause dur="1.4"/> some of the methods and the arguments of Whigs and Hunters <pause dur="1.0"/> and look at the some # but also <pause dur="1.0"/> look <pause dur="0.8"/> # perhaps more critically than i've done in this lecture <pause dur="0.8"/> at some of the major tensions and difficulties <pause dur="0.4"/> in Thompson's approach to history <pause dur="0.9"/> and on the bottom of the handout you'll see i've given you some advice <pause dur="0.3"/> about how to skip read Whigs and Hunters <pause dur="0.5"/> if you # <pause dur="0.8"/> can't bear to read it all <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> though you need to read a good deal of it but the advice is there
