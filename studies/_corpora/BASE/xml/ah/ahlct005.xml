<u who="nm0050" trans="pause"> well as you can see we've got # <pause dur="0.8"/> you've heard of Jaws two this is yawn two today <pause dur="2.4"/> this is for the # <pause dur="0.7"/> the Internet version <pause dur="0.7"/> so we'll put the whole world to sleep not just the # <pause dur="0.6"/> the video public <pause dur="0.9"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> we saw last time <pause dur="1.1"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> the history of Agricola within Britain <pause dur="0.7"/> through <pause dur="0.6"/> what i hope was the medium of the archaeological record <pause dur="0.4"/> in so far as he set out <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> the camps <pause dur="1.0"/> # <pause dur="1.2"/> in his progress northwards and then into the lowlands of Scotland and up the east coast of Scotland <pause dur="0.9"/> and we saw <pause dur="0.4"/> that <pause dur="0.5"/> in some cases it's rather difficult to distinguish between an Agricolan <pause dur="0.4"/> # foundation <pause dur="0.5"/> and say somewhere that had been established by Cerialis or Frontinus <pause dur="0.9"/> so there is a problem <pause dur="0.4"/> in viewing Agricola's <pause dur="0.3"/> campaigning <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> career <pause dur="0.6"/> through the medium of archaeology <pause dur="1.3"/> which is many ways is a pity because Agricola is probably the most significant <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> Roman governor <pause dur="0.6"/> # who ever came to Britain <pause dur="0.9"/> certainly we know more about him <pause dur="0.8"/> than we do about any other <pause dur="0.3"/> governor <pause dur="0.3"/> of Roman Britain <pause dur="2.0"/> and yet what we do know <pause dur="0.8"/> remains 
extraordinarily patchy <pause dur="1.0"/> and this itself <pause dur="0.3"/> has <pause dur="0.2"/> a lot to say <pause dur="0.3"/> about the state of our information <pause dur="0.3"/> concerning other significant governors <pause dur="0.3"/> who came and went <pause dur="1.4"/> before Agricola of course there was Petilius Cerialis <pause dur="0.7"/> and we hear from Tacitus <pause dur="0.3"/> in the Agricola <pause dur="0.4"/> that it was Cerialis <pause dur="0.3"/> who largely defeated <pause dur="0.4"/> the Brigantes <pause dur="1.2"/> yet apart from that <pause dur="1.1"/> passing reference almost within <pause dur="0.7"/> Tacitus <pause dur="0.3"/> we know very little <pause dur="0.6"/> about <trunc>ker</trunc> the details of Cerialis' <pause dur="0.3"/> campaigns within <pause dur="0.2"/> the province <pause dur="3.0"/> so when we come <pause dur="0.2"/> to somebody <pause dur="0.2"/> like Agricola <pause dur="0.3"/> about whom <pause dur="0.4"/> there is a certain degree <pause dur="0.4"/> of information <pause dur="0.4"/> in terms of archeological remains <pause dur="0.2"/> and in terms especially of <pause dur="0.2"/> literary remains <pause dur="0.7"/> we have to be careful <pause dur="0.3"/> first of all <pause dur="0.3"/> we have to be careful that we don't <pause dur="0.6"/> focus in upon Agricola <pause dur="1.0"/> and <pause dur="0.7"/> use the very fact that we know more about him <pause dur="1.8"/> to take his achievements beyond their natural <pause dur="0.3"/> limits <pause dur="1.3"/> and secondly we have to be careful <pause dur="0.3"/> about <pause dur="0.2"/> how we approach <pause dur="0.3"/> those sources in the first place <pause dur="1.1"/> the very fact that there are sources <pause dur="1.4"/> 
tends to lull us in to a false sense of security and to accept them at face value <pause dur="1.1"/> simply because they're there <pause dur="0.5"/> and to view <pause dur="0.7"/> Agricola <pause dur="1.2"/> as <pause dur="0.9"/> the great figure <pause dur="0.3"/> that certainly his son-in-law <pause dur="1.2"/> Tacitus <pause dur="0.4"/> paints him as <pause dur="0.8"/> what i want to do is actually <pause dur="0.6"/> to look <pause dur="0.5"/> at the literary record today <pause dur="1.0"/> and to see <pause dur="0.3"/> whether in fact <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> there are dangers within it <pause dur="0.2"/> that we need to <pause dur="0.3"/> to bear in mind <pause dur="0.3"/> when we look <pause dur="0.2"/> at Agricola <pause dur="0.9"/> as a historical figure <pause dur="3.2"/> the first thing to bear in mind is that this particular work <pause dur="0.2"/> was written in the period shortly after <pause dur="0.6"/> ninety-eight <pause dur="1.9"/> in the <pause dur="0.6"/> opening <pause dur="0.3"/> at the opening of the reign <pause dur="0.2"/> of the emperor <pause dur="0.4"/> Trajan <pause dur="2.3"/> this means that the information that <pause dur="0.5"/> Tacitus is <pause dur="0.3"/> is giving us here <pause dur="1.5"/> is a decade old <pause dur="0.7"/> by the time he gets writing <pause dur="0.5"/> it's over a decade old in in in <pause dur="0.2"/> many ways <pause dur="2.1"/> it's also to be borne in mind <pause dur="1.3"/> that <pause dur="0.5"/> for a number of years <pause dur="1.4"/> Tacitus and Agricola <pause dur="0.4"/> did not meet <pause dur="0.8"/> prior <pause dur="0.4"/> to Agricola's death <pause dur="1.2"/> and therefore we immediately need to be aware of the fact that the information that Tacitus is putting over here <pause dur="0.6"/> is 
not fresh information <pause dur="0.8"/> it's not hot off the press it's not <pause dur="0.6"/> straight from the lips <pause dur="0.6"/> of <pause dur="0.6"/> Agricola himself <pause dur="1.3"/> Agricola left Britain <pause dur="1.1"/> round about eighty-three <pause dur="0.6"/> this is being written <pause dur="1.0"/> round about ninety-eight <pause dur="1.8"/> so there's immediate problem about the accuracy <pause dur="0.4"/> of <pause dur="0.8"/> the work <pause dur="0.7"/> in terms of <pause dur="0.3"/> access <pause dur="0.3"/> to first-hand information undoubtedly there would have been records within Rome <pause dur="0.5"/> of Agricola's period within Britain <pause dur="2.5"/> but to some extent it's clear that <pause dur="0.9"/> Tacitus may well be relying upon <pause dur="0.3"/> his own memory <pause dur="0.9"/> and that is notoriously <pause dur="0.7"/> a weak point <pause dur="0.2"/> with everybody <pause dur="1.1"/> the next thing to bear in mind of course this is <pause dur="0.6"/> this <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> biography <pause dur="0.7"/> of Agricola <pause dur="0.2"/> has its own agenda <pause dur="1.4"/> it is not being written by somebody <pause dur="0.3"/> who is <pause dur="0.4"/> totally <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="2.2"/> unaffected <pause dur="0.6"/> by the topic that he's dealing with <pause dur="1.0"/> it's his own father-in-law <pause dur="3.7"/> at the same time <pause dur="0.3"/> think about <pause dur="0.5"/> the circumstances under which it was being written <pause dur="0.6"/> it's written <pause dur="0.2"/> after a period <pause dur="0.6"/> of <pause dur="3.4"/> tyranny <pause dur="0.3"/> within Rome <pause dur="0.4"/> not to put <pause dur="0.3"/> # too fine a point on it <pause dur="1.1"/> the end the the final years of the emperor Domitian <pause dur="0.2"/> 
the emperor <pause dur="2.5"/> who under whom <pause dur="1.5"/> Agricola's greatest <pause dur="0.3"/> victory was won <pause dur="0.7"/> the victory at Mons Graupius <pause dur="2.2"/> was to turn into <pause dur="0.6"/> a monster <pause dur="1.1"/> in some ways a justified monster since he was <pause dur="0.4"/> the subject of # <pause dur="0.6"/> a number of attempted assassinations <pause dur="2.0"/> but <pause dur="0.4"/> the work is being written against the background of <pause dur="0.2"/> a monster <pause dur="0.8"/> under whom <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> # Agricola lived <pause dur="0.2"/> his final years <pause dur="0.6"/> and <pause dur="0.8"/> whose memory <pause dur="1.9"/> was <pause dur="0.6"/> undergoing a process of damnation <pause dur="1.2"/> in the minds <pause dur="0.3"/> of the ruling elites that is the the senate in Rome <pause dur="0.7"/> # in the period after his <pause dur="0.6"/> his assassination <pause dur="0.3"/> the <pause dur="0.2"/> the successful attempt <pause dur="0.6"/> # in ninety-six <pause dur="0.5"/> Domitian had been followed by Nerva <pause dur="0.8"/> # who's mentioned in this work and then <pause dur="0.2"/> in ninety-eight <pause dur="0.4"/> by Trajan <pause dur="0.2"/> who again <pause dur="0.4"/> is mention it setting the composition of the work <pause dur="0.5"/> into a <pause dur="0.6"/> context <pause dur="1.3"/> and it <pause dur="0.2"/> <trunc>ha</trunc> has been suggested by a number of people that part of the <pause dur="0.7"/> whole purpose of the Agricola <pause dur="0.4"/> is actually to justify <pause dur="0.4"/> the survival <pause dur="0.2"/> of those members of the senate who did survive the reign <pause dur="0.4"/> of Domitian <pause dur="0.5"/> whereas <pause dur="0.2"/> better men <pause dur="1.0"/> more <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.9"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> patriotic <pause dur="1.1"/> and more 
heroic figures <pause dur="0.4"/> died <pause dur="0.4"/> or were forced <pause dur="0.3"/> into <pause dur="0.2"/> suicide <pause dur="4.3"/> so it's not just <pause dur="0.5"/> a biography <pause dur="0.2"/> it's not a dispassionate view <pause dur="0.6"/> of Agricola's <pause dur="0.4"/> life <pause dur="0.2"/> and his career <pause dur="0.4"/> it has <pause dur="0.6"/> extra <pause dur="0.2"/> dimensions to it <pause dur="0.6"/> and you'll find these well set out in Ogilvie and Richmond's <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> edition <pause dur="0.6"/> of the work in the introduction there <pause dur="2.2"/> we needn't worry about <pause dur="1.7"/> the initial chapters of the work they simply set the scene <pause dur="1.8"/> Agricola himself doesn't begin to appear <pause dur="0.4"/> until <pause dur="0.2"/> chapter four <pause dur="0.4"/> when we're told about his early years his <pause dur="0.4"/> birth <pause dur="0.4"/> at Fréjus <pause dur="0.4"/> or Forum Julii <pause dur="0.2"/> in southern Gaul <pause dur="0.8"/> of how <pause dur="0.2"/> his education was steered away <pause dur="0.5"/> from <pause dur="0.2"/> that un-Roman <pause dur="0.5"/> topic of study <pause dur="0.2"/> philosophy <pause dur="1.1"/> and philosophy <pause dur="0.3"/> in the reign of <pause dur="0.4"/> the emperors from Nero on <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> was something to be avoided <pause dur="1.0"/> since philosophers <pause dur="0.8"/> regularly became the object of suspicion <pause dur="0.3"/> in other words they thought <pause dur="0.5"/> and thinking was a dangerous occupation <pause dur="1.8"/> in chapter five he comes <trunc>t</trunc> # Tacitus comes to <pause dur="0.4"/> # the early years of <pause dur="0.2"/> Agricola's <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="1.2"/> military <pause dur="0.2"/> political career <pause dur="0.4"/> and this is all a build up <pause dur="1.8"/> to the 
time when Agricola becomes governor <pause dur="0.4"/> of Britain itself <pause dur="1.0"/> it's from Tacitus that we learn about Agricola's <pause dur="0.3"/> two earlier periods <pause dur="0.4"/> of office within Britain <pause dur="1.0"/> the first of them <pause dur="0.7"/> the military apprenticeship would have been <pause dur="0.4"/> as senior tribune <pause dur="1.3"/> in one of the legions <pause dur="2.1"/> under the governor <pause dur="0.6"/> Suetonius Paulinus and he immediately <pause dur="0.3"/> rings a bell with us because he was the man <pause dur="0.5"/> who had to sort out the Boudiccan rebellion <pause dur="0.6"/> so this indicates that <pause dur="0.4"/> <trunc>s</trunc> <pause dur="2.0"/> Agricola's first posting <pause dur="0.2"/> in a military position <pause dur="2.0"/> puts him right at the <pause dur="0.3"/> centre <pause dur="0.5"/> of the greatest crisis that the province of Britain <pause dur="0.4"/> had actually <pause dur="0.2"/> suffered <pause dur="2.8"/> he came through it <pause dur="1.6"/> well <pause dur="0.9"/> at least <pause dur="0.4"/> alive <pause dur="0.2"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> with some military distinction <pause dur="1.3"/> Tacitus <pause dur="0.3"/> is eager to show that his father-in-law even then <pause dur="1.4"/> ran counter <pause dur="1.0"/> to what <trunc>w</trunc> might be regarded as the norm <pause dur="0.3"/> though how far it was the norm <pause dur="1.2"/> # <pause dur="1.6"/> leaves certain questions in our minds <pause dur="0.3"/> he says that # <pause dur="1.1"/> <reading>Agricola was no loose young <unclear>subbleton</unclear> <pause dur="0.4"/> to turn his military career into a life of gaiety he wouldn't make his self-captaincy <pause dur="0.3"/> 
<trunc>as</trunc> and his inexperience an excuse for idly enjoying himself <pause dur="0.3"/> and continually going on leave</reading> <pause dur="0.3"/> giving us <pause dur="0.3"/> the impression that the norm <pause dur="0.4"/> for <pause dur="0.2"/> senior tribunes <pause dur="0.6"/> was basically to use <pause dur="0.4"/> their period <pause dur="0.3"/> of supposed military service <pause dur="0.2"/> as a long <pause dur="0.2"/> and extended holiday <pause dur="0.6"/> where they could go <pause dur="0.4"/> off <pause dur="0.5"/> from their station <pause dur="0.3"/> and engage <pause dur="0.3"/> in extended <pause dur="0.2"/> hunting trips <pause dur="0.7"/> no <pause dur="0.6"/> according to Tacitus <pause dur="0.3"/> that was not the case <pause dur="0.2"/> and this kind of <pause dur="1.0"/> special pleading for Agricola <pause dur="0.4"/> continues right through the work <pause dur="0.4"/> one <trunc>wo</trunc> begins to wonder in fact <pause dur="0.2"/> how <pause dur="0.3"/> true it actually is <pause dur="1.6"/> well it may have been true <pause dur="2.8"/> then <pause dur="0.4"/> Agricola returns to Rome <pause dur="0.6"/> gets married the next stage <pause dur="0.3"/> is his election to the post of quaestor which gives him financial responsibility <pause dur="0.2"/> for taxes <pause dur="0.5"/> within one of the provinces and the province he's given <pause dur="0.3"/> is Asia <pause dur="1.0"/> another good thing about this particular work is it gives us a very good <pause dur="0.4"/> idea <pause dur="0.3"/> of the progression <pause dur="0.8"/> for a <pause dur="0.3"/> military political <pause dur="0.4"/> young man destined for high office <pause dur="0.6"/> and a senatorial career <pause dur="0.9"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> as he moves through it <pause dur="0.7"/> he goes <pause dur="0.5"/> to be 
quaestor in Asia and Asia <pause dur="0.2"/> a notorious province it had been notorious even in republican times <pause dur="0.7"/> notorious <pause dur="0.4"/> for the potential <pause dur="0.8"/> for <pause dur="0.8"/> making money on the side <pause dur="2.2"/> for corruption <pause dur="1.2"/> anybody with any responsibility for <pause dur="0.5"/> financial dealings in <pause dur="0.2"/> Asia <pause dur="0.2"/> which is <pause dur="0.3"/> a very rich province <pause dur="0.7"/> was immediately <pause dur="0.6"/> presented with <pause dur="0.2"/> the <pause dur="1.3"/> prospect <pause dur="0.2"/> of making a killing <pause dur="1.4"/> by <pause dur="0.5"/> putting money into his own pocket that shouldn't be there <pause dur="1.6"/> according to Tacitus <pause dur="0.5"/> Agricola avoided this <pause dur="4.1"/> there was the temptation of the governor <pause dur="1.6"/> colluding with lower officials <pause dur="0.2"/> to their mutual benefit <pause dur="0.8"/> he avoided this <pause dur="2.2"/> he then leaves the quaestorship <pause dur="0.8"/> and becomes a tribune of the people <pause dur="1.2"/> this <pause dur="0.3"/> in the time of Nero <pause dur="1.2"/> a time <pause dur="0.8"/> which according to Tacitus <pause dur="2.0"/> was one for keeping your head below the parapet <pause dur="0.3"/> and your mouth shut <pause dur="3.5"/> apparently <pause dur="0.6"/> Agricola <pause dur="0.4"/> did just that <pause dur="1.3"/> he understood the age of Nero in which inactivity was tantamount to wisdom <pause dur="2.4"/> is this special pleading for somebody <pause dur="1.1"/> who <pause dur="1.0"/> shifted with the wind <pause dur="0.8"/> who knew where his best interests lay <pause dur="0.6"/> is it <pause dur="1.6"/> 
Agricola <pause dur="0.3"/> doing essentially <pause dur="0.8"/> what <pause dur="3.5"/> the whole senate that survived Domitian <pause dur="0.4"/> could be accused of doing <pause dur="0.7"/> of <pause dur="0.4"/> keeping quiet <pause dur="0.6"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> staying alive <pause dur="1.5"/> from the tribuneshit of the # ship of the people he goes into the praetorship <pause dur="1.7"/> praetorship having a legalistic <pause dur="1.3"/> aspect to it <pause dur="1.0"/> but in <pause dur="0.2"/> Agricola's case <pause dur="0.3"/> that legal side never materialized <pause dur="0.8"/> he was responsible though for the ordering of public games <pause dur="1.2"/> a notoriously easy way of losing <pause dur="0.2"/> money <pause dur="2.8"/> in Rome one tended to buy favour <pause dur="1.3"/> by putting on spectacular games <pause dur="2.3"/> according to Tacitus <pause dur="0.9"/> Agricola compromised between economy <pause dur="0.4"/> and excess <pause dur="0.2"/> this is a man <pause dur="0.6"/> we are presented with who knew <pause dur="0.2"/> the right proportions <pause dur="0.3"/> and exercised the right proportions <pause dur="0.4"/> right through his career <pause dur="1.4"/> now that can be seen and Tacitus obviously wants it to be seen <pause dur="0.4"/> as a virtue <pause dur="1.0"/> but <pause dur="0.2"/> is it a virtue <pause dur="0.5"/> or is it the sign <pause dur="0.3"/> of <pause dur="0.2"/> weakness <pause dur="2.7"/> then <pause dur="0.7"/> following the death <pause dur="0.5"/> of <pause dur="0.6"/> Agricola's mother <pause dur="0.5"/> in the civil wars that followed the <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="1.1"/> suicide <pause dur="0.7"/> of Nero <pause dur="0.9"/> he's returned to Britain <pause dur="0.7"/> this time as a legionary commander <pause dur="0.4"/> put in charge <pause dur="0.3"/> of the

never mind <pause dur="1.5"/> i think we need something wet <pause dur="1.0"/> for it <pause dur="0.6"/> no <pause dur="0.5"/> what we have <pause dur="1.1"/> are <pause dur="0.2"/> three lead pipes <pause dur="0.2"/> from Chester <pause dur="1.1"/> now they're not insignificant in their own <pause dur="0.6"/> in their own right because they <pause dur="0.4"/> they are part <pause dur="0.5"/> of <pause dur="0.2"/> the <pause dur="0.5"/> # process <pause dur="0.2"/> of <pause dur="1.2"/> romanization <pause dur="0.4"/> the establishment of towns and amenities <pause dur="0.3"/> within towns the very fact that they've got Agricola's name <pause dur="0.3"/> on them <pause dur="0.3"/> shows this is an official <pause dur="0.6"/> # an officially designated an officially sanctioned process <pause dur="1.3"/> so we've got <pause dur="0.4"/> three lead pipes <pause dur="0.4"/> from Chester <pause dur="0.4"/> and we have a fragmentary inscription <pause dur="0.4"/> from Saint Albans <pause dur="1.1"/> from the forum there dedicating the forum <pause dur="0.8"/> and if we put that <pause dur="0.2"/> on <pause dur="1.2"/> <kinesic desc="turns on projector showing slide" iterated="n"/> and # <pause dur="1.2"/> switch the light off and if you can see <pause dur="1.6"/><event desc="turns off lights" iterated="n"/> past <pause dur="0.2"/> the scribble on the <pause dur="0.6"/> board <pause dur="4.8"/> i've said this in the <pause dur="0.3"/> source book so you can see <pause dur="0.6"/> that the shaded parts here <pause dur="0.9"/> yes the shaded parts are actually the bits that exist <pause dur="1.6"/> the rest <pause dur="0.3"/> is restoration what have we got <pause dur="0.7"/><kinesic desc="indicates point on slide" iterated="n"/> got a bit of the name of Vespasian <pause dur="0.8"/><kinesic desc="indicates point on slide" iterated="n"/> a little bit of the name of Vespasian <pause dur="0.2"/><kinesic desc="indicates point on slide" iterated="n"/> part of the 
fact that he was consul designate <pause dur="1.5"/><kinesic desc="indicates point on slide" iterated="n"/> all <pause dur="0.6"/> we have three letters from Agricola's name G-R-I <pause dur="0.8"/><kinesic desc="indicates point on slide" iterated="n"/> we have the name of the town well <pause dur="0.8"/> one letter <pause dur="0.5"/> and <pause dur="0.5"/> a part of another <pause dur="0.5"/> so we've got V-E <kinesic desc="indicates point on slide" iterated="n"/> <pause dur="0.4"/><kinesic desc="indicates point on slide" iterated="n"/> and we have <pause dur="0.8"/> that bit there which is propraetorian legate <pause dur="0.3"/> and the fact that the Basilica <pause dur="0.3"/> was <trunc>order</trunc> # was # ornamented <pause dur="2.6"/> the only way we actually can establish that is the fact that <pause dur="0.2"/> many of these inscriptions are purely <pause dur="0.6"/> functional <pause dur="0.6"/> and go by rote <pause dur="0.6"/> there are so many formula <pause dur="0.2"/> in it <pause dur="0.7"/> that one can <pause dur="0.5"/> have a pretty good stab <pause dur="0.2"/> at <pause dur="0.2"/> restoring it <pause dur="0.7"/> but take it away and you can see <pause dur="0.6"/> that <pause dur="0.5"/> in terms of inscription <pause dur="1.4"/> Agricola <pause dur="0.2"/> is essentially a non-event <pause dur="0.4"/> within Romano-British history <pause dur="1.3"/> so one really has to set the <pause dur="0.2"/> the sources <pause dur="0.3"/> within a <pause dur="0.2"/> tight <pause dur="0.4"/> parameter frame <pause dur="1.4"/> we are very limited <pause dur="0.3"/> even though we <pause dur="0.2"/> seem to have <pause dur="0.4"/> so much <pause dur="0.4"/> to deal with the # <pause dur="0.4"/> the career of Agricola <pause dur="0.8"/> and at that <pause dur="0.2"/> i'll leave you <pause dur="0.6"/> to # <pause dur="0.4"/> evaporate
