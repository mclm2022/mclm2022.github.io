postmodernism # in relation to film and T-V i think # <trunc>i</trunc> <trunc>i</trunc> it can work there or it can work in relation to the sorts of things we'll look at this term # the first thing that i've i've put down the thing i want to talk about now is beauty # beauty in relation to The Thin Red Line would somebody like to start off by by commenting really on what you think the relationship between ideas of beauty i suppose those aesthetic ideas and The Thin Red Line what that relationship might be <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> </u><u who="sf5026"> # well it's quite strongly # linked to nature sort of the the beauty in The Thin Red Line seems to be all surrounding the ideas of nature and the natural and like the the whole of like the first half an hour when they're # is it an island they're on an island </u><u who="nm5019"> mm </u><u who="sf5026"> or they're separate from the army then it's like you see shots of the sea and the trees # just growing without # interference from man and sort of sunlight and that it's the and you also hear # 
Witt talking about kind of how perfect the island is like that so i think the beauty in the thin in The Thin Red Line is sort of mainly linked to ideas of nature </u><u who="nm5019"> mm-hmm ideas and images of the natural </u><u who="sf5026"> yeah </u><u who="nm5019"> any other thoughts </u><u who="sf5027"> i think it's it's kind of linked to # transcendence in a way # because the darkness and light in it is # it is that kind of dialectical enlightenment so they're both kind of interspersed so and the the shots of kind of a lot where the camera is just looking up through the trees and you have that light # the moments where Jim Caviezel's character Witt every person that he touches in the film # <trunc>experience</trunc> # he kind of changes their life in some way # i think he's kind of very kind of linked to transcendence and that's shot 'cause nature is quite # frightening in a way you know the the vines round the trees it's all very kind of dark so it it's 
not like you can kind of extract a single meaning from the text 'cause they are so kind of tightly interwoven </u><u who="nm5019"> mm </u><u who="sf5027"> # with with the voiceovers as well but i think beauty is # is <trunc>figura</trunc> figured more in transcendence because in the violent scenes as well # they're not really shown to be beautiful you know it's always kind of juxtaposed with something more natural more # what's the word kind of communicative like you have the the village at the beginning # it's kind of set up a sort of utopian ideal that sets up those ideas of of community of family of communication of something that is beyond the self something that you have # which is # illustrated in the character of Witt that having that vision to see something beyond the self # which i think is why it starts off in the village you know there's no kind of sense of time you know she i think she says something 
about the child going to sleep </u><u who="nm5019"> mm </u><u who="sf5027"> it depends something on the trees it's like that # the old kind of tribal communities that were that were very kind of extracted from modernity and it shows that to be something that's wonderful something that is is beautiful </u><u who="nm5019"> mm </u><u who="sf5026"> and it's quite interesting as well because at at the beginning the army's kind of shown fairly negatively because you you hear the woman say # he's he asks her if she's scared of him </u><u who="nm5019"> yeah yeah </u><u who="sf5026"> and # she says yes i am because you're with the army and # </u><u who="nm5019"> yeah </u><u who="sf5026"> then you see the boat coming round and they # and they run and you think but they're in the army why are they running # and then # like you say on the sheet you don't know how they get back on the boat but you see a shot of the boat in the sea and with the mountains in the background and it's turning out 
this big black smoke which kind of seems as though it's like ruining the the perfect nature it's like </u><u who="nm5019"> mm </u><u who="sf5026"> man's intruding on the perfect world and the U-S army's intruding </u><u who="nm5019"> mm mm </u><u who="sf5027"> i think it kind of asks questions of what is nature not just in kind of natural world or environment but what is nature in general what is the nature of humanity what is the nature of man what is a man </u><u who="nm5019"> mm </u><u who="sf5027"> what kind of constitutes man or makes up man # it doesn't actually give you any answers which is what's so amazing about it i think it does kind of </u><u who="sf5026"> but it raises questions for you to think about </u><u who="sf5027"> it raises questions i think it is a dialectic 'cause it just covers everything it's all so interwoven and that's i think where its power comes from </u><u who="nm5019"> let's go back to something you were saying about the the village we see in the beginning to 
what extent is that maintained as an ideal or as a as a as a as a as a place of wonder throughout the film </u><u who="sf5026"> well you can't <trunc>sor</trunc> he each constantly talks about having seen this different world but # sort of they go back later and # he doesn't really know how to react to it then he goes back and he's just seeing all these people dying and i think it's </u><u who="sf5027"> well </u><u who="sf5026"> it's very different then </u><u who="sf5027"> it's quite ambiguous </u><u who="nm5019"> yeah </u><u who="sf5027"> it's what we were saying with you the other day it's a point of view shot is really it sets itself up as being a point of view that his because at the beginning when he's having the conversation with Sean Penn he's talking about this world as being in his imagination so he he changes throughout the film as well he isn't just this person who is representative of something it's his education as well as the people who come into contact with 
him so when he goes back and he sees the skulls and he sees the sores on the child's back and he can't quite kind of correlate it 'cause it's no longer <trunc>ima</trunc> an imagination # because the war's been <trunc>affect</trunc> has affected him the death's affected him but then he has the conversation with the the child's mother again and she says # oh they've always fought you know they look like they're playing but they're fighting you know so it's i think it's still quite it's quite ambiguous </u><u who="nm5019"> mm-hmm </u><u who="sf5027"> though even though she says that and it <trunc>hi</trunc> is primarily his point of view # of kind of like a distorted vision the illusion's kind of broken down so don't quite know what its relation is to the big picture </u><u who="nm5019"> mm what were you going to say <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> </u><u who="sm5028"> i was just going to say that # however it appears to me that the <trunc>v</trunc> the 
depiction of the village is kind of the the this whole notion of beauty being disturbed is kind of how the film criticizes # war rather than you know doing a <trunc>spie</trunc> Spielberg and kind of you know saying war is bad it it it shows war is having an effect on the the purity of the village # it disturbs the you know what was once serene is now you know it is it's all gone </u><gap reason="break in recording" extent="uncertain"/> <u who="sm5028"> and i mean i wasn't so sure that # Witt had changed i thought that it was just the village had changed and he he's kind of making an observation about it i mean it it is filmed in # this kind of documentary <trunc>s</trunc> style like i mean i think a lot of it could come out of a nature movie </u><u who="nm5019"> yeah </u><u who="sm5028"> but it's it's through these kind of you know personal voiceovers and stuff where we get the # you know it kind of colour colours it in you know specific ways and it especially through Witt we get the you know what he really thinks </u><u who="nm5019"> 
yeah i wonder i've got a real problem with that i've got a real problem with the village as a as a kind of site of purity and wonder # </u><u who="sm5029"> yeah i thought the point was that when he goes back to the village the point was that it's always been that way </u><u who="nm5019"> all right </u><u who="sm5029"> but he does he now sees that he is now able to see it for what it is you know and the the skulls have always been on the shelf you know </u><u who="nm5019"> mm </u><u who="sm5029"> # and the men have always fought and you know the kids have always got sick and that's the point of it </u><u who="nm5019"> mm </u><u who="sm5029"> and i know and i actually did # i was sort of uncomfortable with the start i thought this is a bit trite you know just swimming in the water and it's all very nice and you know so it and then you know the purity of the noble savage being corrupted by the modern world you know i was sort of i was thinking okay here we go but then when he did go back to the village thought that was a 
key point because i thought it's sort of like <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> said that we would go and see a you know there they look like they're playing but they're fighting or whatever that bit is you know that's a key line i think </u><u who="nm5019"> yes but she says that right at the beginning i mean it's not later he he says at the beginning he says to her kids round here never fight do they and she says yes sometimes they do you know </u><u who="sm5029"> mm <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> </u><u who="nm5019"> that's right at the beginning </u><u who="sf5027"> oh is it </u><u who="nm5019"> yeah when he's talking to them at so that's already a a warning i think that his what he can see <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> swimming </u><u who="sf5027"> # </u><u who="nm5019"> mm </u><u who="sm5029"> it's all right </u><u who="sf5027"> moving from imagination to a kind of realist perspective because i think that's why it kind of ties into the conversation with # Sean Penn's 
character you know where he's he's saying oh i have my imagination he's like and this is the only world you have they're kind of both polar opposites but he's set up as a kind of dreamer </u><u who="nm5019"> mm </u><u who="sf5027"> and i think his experience # enables him to kind of group and kind of to a certain extent # gel his his imaginations his aspirations for a better world with # a kind of neo-realist framework as opposed to within a kind of fantasy framework which is set up at the beginning </u><u who="nm5019"> mm </u><u who="sf5027"> # this i think it is tied to his point of views # # for the two opposing scenes </u><u who="sf5026"> but that's quite interesting as well the conversations between # Witt and Sean Penn's character because # they they have then 'cause Sean Penn says well you're not going to ever do any good you're just going to die in this war and you're not going to make any difference you're not going to change anything for anyone but when it actually comes to it when Witt does die 
then he has he's saved by by distracting kind of all the soldiers away from the river he's basically saved the rest of his company's lives so he <trunc>ac</trunc> <trunc>ha</trunc> does actually do something but like <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> was saying it's because he changes all the way through the film and he starts off being a bit of a dreamer and then he possibly kind of realizes that he has to pull together </u><u who="nm5019"> but we don't get that moment of realization </u><u who="sf5026"> no </u><u who="nm5019"> it seems to me <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> </u><u who="sf5027"> i think you do in the voiceover at the end though </u><u who="nm5019"> really </u><u who="sf5027"> 'cause he says # it is his voiceover he says who are you that i lived with walked with the brother the friend darkness and light strife and love were they the workings of one mind features of the same face </u><u who="nm5019"> mm </u><u who="sf5027"> so he seems to have like the this is what's strange 'cause he's dead but his voiceover's still speaking he's kind of transcended <trunc>li</trunc> literally life itself and he's 
still asking that question but he's able to kind of see both sides </u><u who="nm5019"> mm </u><u who="sf5027"> # which i think is what the film is you know good side of nature the bad side of of human nature and like natural world as well </u><u who="nm5019"> so sorry how is that final question different from what he's asking at the beginning </u><u who="sf5027"> because i think it's i think at the beginning it's rooted in his imagination a bit </u><u who="nm5019"> oh right </u><u who="sf5027"> i think at the end he's able to kind of take in both and his perspectives change somewhat and you're aware that his perspectives change and his death has resonance anyway # 'cause i suppose with like a normal or a kind of # Hollywood flick type picture he would be alive he would he would not die in it at all </u><u who="nm5019"> mm </u><u who="sf5027"> which i think is quite interesting 'cause he's died for a purpose in a way it's quite a religious thing i suppose </u><u who="nm5019"> mm </u><u who="sf5027"> that's why i kind 
of see it as like # the education of the sergeant </u><u who="nm5019"> <trunc>c</trunc> but but that's so interesting because he doesn't <trunc>ch</trunc> i don't he doesn't change you see </u><u who="sf5027"> Sean Penn </u><u who="nm5019"> yes </u><u who="sf5027"> i think he does </u><u who="sf5026"> i think that he changes enormously </u><u who="nm5019"> i don't think Witt's death makes any difference to him at all </u><u who="sf5026"> you don't think his death has any <gap reason="inaudible due to overlap" extent="1 sec"/> </u><u who="nm5019"> i don't Witt's death has any <trunc>dif</trunc> makes any difference to his to what Sean Penn's philosophy or isolation 'cause he reiterates immediately afterwards he says you know you're in a box a moving box it's it's all a lie it's got to be the <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> in here </u><u who="sf5027"> mm </u><u who="nm5019"> so why <trunc>w</trunc> what changes you tell me what changes </u><u who="sf5027"> i think i think he does change </u><u who="nm5019"> 
why do you think that </u><u who="sf5026"> # i'm not going to be able to articulate this though </u><u who="nm5019"> okay you don't you don't have to answer now but let's hear from somebody else <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> </u><u who="sf5030"> what </u><u who="sf5027"> what </u><u who="sf5030"> <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> </u><u who="nm5019"> well your opinions comments and observations on what we've been discussing </u><u who="sf5030"> # i think i'm not sure whether i do think Sean Penn's character changes and i think if he doesn't it's quite effective in balancing the whole message of the film </u><u who="nm5019"> mm </u><u who="sf5030"> 'cause i think it some bits of it are a bit kind of crappy psychology a bit kind of look at nature and isn't it beautiful which </u><u who="nm5019"> mm </u><u who="sf5030"> is very limited and especially about war it it it it can't get you very far # and i think that kind of him saying it's all about property and not getting too carried away with your 
idea of human nature because he's like it's not human nature it's you've been put into this it's someone else's battle it's all about property </u><u who="nm5019"> mm </u><u who="sf5030"> keeps the film kind of saves it from being wishy-washy and </u><u who="nm5019"> right kind of mysticism and </u><u who="sf5030"> yeah </u><u who="nm5019"> and yeah i yeah does anyone else feel like that about about it i mean you really as far as only talk about that kind of danger really <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> of the film i mean it does have those moments where you think oh <trunc>s</trunc> you know stop this is so # you said wishy-washy and thinking about pop psychology </u><u who="sf5030"> it is kind of like it it's like <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> kind of # </u><u who="nm5019"> right </u><u who="sf5030"> the plague that kind of nature and <trunc>i</trunc> is it all beautiful and it's like yeah but that that can't get really get you anywhere </u><u who="nm5019"> mm </u><u who="sf5030"> at the end of the day </u><u who="nm5019"> mm </u><u who="sf5027"> do you think it's kind of asking if there's a place for that kind of mysticism 
in the modern world is there a place for somebody like Witt in the modern world </u><u who="nm5019"> i don't think it's if you say that i don't think it's one thing # </u><u who="sf5027"> or the kind of difficulty of accommodating that kind of philosophy </u><u who="nm5019"> i think </u><u who="sf5027"> i think you can accommodate it if you don't <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> something that that's that's basic </u><u who="nm5019"> mm </u><u who="sf5027"> and i mean like a beginning you know that kind of philosophy works in his own mind within that environment but when it's put into kind of the imaginations of war and everything is is <trunc>re</trunc> actually replaceable really </u><u who="nm5019"> well i think it it retains this oddness actually # that i think some of Witt's questions seem quite odd now whereas they wouldn't have seemed very odd at all # even thirty years ago forty years ago # the idea of the family of man for example # just yesterday my parents brought me <trunc>m</trunc> 
bringing me books from my childhood years and there's this old book from the fifties the early fifties an encyclopedia <trunc>t</trunc> for children and <trunc>d</trunc> you know for sort of eight to ten year olds so yeah it's all about the family of the human race yeah it's one big family it's like it's written as if Witt wrote it yes just that it's yes kind of <trunc>mis</trunc> you know it's idea of the family <trunc>ma</trunc> man is all different races brought together there's always the mother the father yes i think George Clooney's bit yeah that's kind of the way the world was thought of and actually not that long ago so i think Witt just seems strange his idea of a unity of a coherence of a of universality that runs through objects and # # through nature and through people and the the kind of sense of seeing beyond appearances into just kind of essential bonds between things i think that seems very rather strange and kind of arty now whereas before it would be just if you like what was taught in 
schools and things # so now actually i don't even think it's <gap reason="inaudible due to equipment difficulties" extent="2 secs"/> it might've been might be asking that but i don't think there is a place for it all right what do other people think <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> </u><u who="sf5031"> don't really know </u><u who="nm5019"> what do you think of the # the Ben Chaplin character # he's had the one he we see his wife and yes he's talking about his wife a lot we see him at the beginning yes quite early on in the movie we actually you see him he's talking saying he got drafted because he wanted to be with his wife he wasn't actually high up in the in the # engineering corps whatever and then later on we discover that his his wife has left him i mean how do you think that that sort of big thing that happens with his wife's asking for a divorce doesn't she it's a kind of a big kind of shock moment i think in the film what did you think of

moments of the movie which seem to be directly relevant to the audience and it's it's saying it's commenting on the movie yes we're in a moving <trunc>bo</trunc> everything you see and hear is lies yes so we get this kind of there's an issue about seeing in the movie clearly you see a lot of people seeing things and you there's a lot of attention given to eyes and looking yeah in the movie even animals are looking you know so like the little possum on the tree and the sort of tree lizard looking the owl that's staring seems to be there's an issue about you know what is consciousness what is seeing # and certainly i think you're right that that # that moment the sergeant is speaking i think that bit that confirms what you were saying about the uncertainty of the movie in relation to some of its articulations there it seems to be saying don't trust what you see and hear you know there's a possibility it's # <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> and on on the other hand i mean i there there's 
this this issue of # Witt who seems to unify the separate identities yeah so on one hand war fractures though we all have our own different particular experiences yeah so but then there's a moment where Witt returns from the village # and he meets someone alone on the hill yes he returns from the village and he gets back and he's kind of shaking everyone's hand on the way back yes like some kind of you know i strange don't know why he seems to know everybody then you see him looking around the camp and he sees some people playing cards or just talking characters we don't know and then we get instead of cutting back like in a point of view shot we see Ben Chaplin alone in the fields yes it's just after we find out he's been dumped by his wife and i think we see something else before we return back to the shot of Witt and he cries we see a tear coming out of his eye yeah so he seems to unify these different 
fragments # in his gaze in if you like that point of view structure so we do get these opposing forces in the film you know on the one hand there's a a sense which you've got of pulling together of the family of man who who are you my brother you know my soul that that unifies all <trunc>l</trunc> looks out through my eyes and unifies all opposed to # Sean Penn really his philosophy of isolation i don't think it's reconciled in the film because what's the final image yes it's a very <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> quite isolated object yes you know the coconut growing in in the sea and you know the final three images seem to be about those kind of balance you know this sort of the journey down through the you know the people on the boat going through the kind of rainforest area then we see two # parrots are they parrots or lorikeets i'm not sure but they're beautiful beautiful birds they're obviously a pair are mates yes and then we see the final image

it to the beginning where he says i wonder what it would right at the beginning he says i wonder what it would be like to to know this is my last breath and how i would okay so and of course that's three hours later he's in that situation where he's about has the choice of whether to draw his last breath or not # so i suppose one can read it quite as being in relation to that to that moment of speculation at the beginning which is so characteristic of the film that kind of philosophical question about the <trunc>en</trunc> the last point of one's life it's also a very ordinary question that most people would ask themselves at some point in their lives </u><u who="sm5029"> mm </u><u who="nm5019"> it's ordinary language philosophy what would it be like to be at the last moment of your life the last instance it's something that everybody will experience right in this room # but also will be survived that's the Cavell point

pieces you know it wasn't just wasn't wasn't done and # they can see i think it's a reappraisal of the sort of Second World War with a massive influence of you know Vietnam and the American sort of experience </u><u who="nm5019"> okay i'm going to have to draw to a close # thank you that's Jima comparison was right i mean the obvious other comparison's Saving Private Ryan i mean if you're thinking about war on # the Pacific war and the  if you like the colonial wars wars fought for property yes that issue as contrasted against the sort of 
myth of the wars fought against fascism yes the different sorts of # <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/>legacy associated with two <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/>kinds of war that contrast is important okay now remember # revision sessions on Friday okay if you want them to take if you want them to take place at all people have to volunteer to do presentations okay if you want clarification on it you can see me # # either this afternoon or or # or later this week okay well # thanks a lot then
