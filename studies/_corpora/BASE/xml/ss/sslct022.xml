<u who="nm1166"> in the previous lecture to today we # on British politics we <pause dur="0.3"/> explored <pause dur="0.4"/> # the issue of immigration <pause dur="0.4"/> and saw how immigration was <pause dur="0.2"/> the prism <pause dur="1.2"/> through which <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> the politics of race has played itself out <pause dur="2.6"/> but we also saw how <pause dur="0.4"/> the central importance of immigration didn't just lie in <pause dur="1.1"/> the need to control numbers <pause dur="0.2"/> entering the country per se <pause dur="0.8"/> but was <trunc>m</trunc> more specifically <pause dur="0.9"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> centrally about <pause dur="0.9"/> establishing a coherent <pause dur="0.5"/> conception of British identity <pause dur="0.3"/> in the post-war context <pause dur="3.9"/> # we also saw how the discourse on immigration <pause dur="1.0"/> # and within that discourse on immigration race <pause dur="0.7"/> was perceived to be a problem <pause dur="0.8"/> from <pause dur="0.4"/> the very start <pause dur="11.0"/> so the importance of immigration <pause dur="0.4"/> is not simply about numbers <pause dur="0.7"/> it has a subsidiary <pause dur="0.4"/> possibly even a primary <pause dur="0.7"/> # purpose that goes beyond that which is in terms of defining <pause dur="0.3"/> the conception of Britishness <pause dur="4.8"/> where numbers does come into play <pause dur="0.4"/> the issue of how many black people <pause dur="0.3"/> live in Britain <pause dur="2.2"/> is with respect to <pause dur="0.3"/> the need to ensure good race relations <pause dur="6.3"/> because much of the 
discourse around immigration was premised on the notion that if <pause dur="0.4"/> numbers <pause dur="0.2"/> were limited <pause dur="0.9"/> then one could ensure <pause dur="1.0"/> that race relations <trunc>m</trunc> would remain <pause dur="1.0"/> in some sense good <pause dur="1.3"/> or <pause dur="1.0"/> taking it from the other side <pause dur="0.7"/> if numbers were unlimited <pause dur="0.4"/> then there was a threat <pause dur="0.6"/> to good race relations and stable race relations <pause dur="3.8"/> and that whole notion was premised on the idea <pause dur="2.0"/> that allowing <pause dur="1.7"/> too many people into Britain <pause dur="0.5"/> from the new Commonwealth <pause dur="2.5"/> would cause problems in terms of <pause dur="0.3"/> the ability of British society to assimilate <pause dur="0.3"/> or integrate <pause dur="1.6"/> those numbers <pause dur="5.3"/> and what we see in the post-war period <pause dur="0.4"/> at a time when immigration <pause dur="1.2"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> is <pause dur="0.3"/> the primary discourse <pause dur="0.4"/> is the emergence of a secondary subsidiary discourse <pause dur="0.3"/> around <pause dur="0.5"/> the notion of <pause dur="0.2"/> race relations very specifically <pause dur="2.8"/> and in particular <pause dur="2.3"/> articulated by the question of how <pause dur="0.5"/> to integrate <pause dur="1.6"/> specifically black minority groups <pause dur="0.9"/> into Britain <pause dur="0.6"/> and into a British way of life <pause dur="3.5"/> and as i mentioned last week there were already <pause dur="0.8"/> perceived problems <pause dur="0.4"/> emerging <trunc>betw</trunc> in relations 
between blacks and whites in Britain <pause dur="0.3"/> from an early stage <pause dur="1.0"/> whilst they reached their pinnacle <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="1.0"/> in nineteen-fifty-eight <pause dur="0.2"/> in the <pause dur="0.4"/> social unrest in Notting Hill <pause dur="0.5"/> and in Nottingham <pause dur="1.9"/> one should also note that the first <pause dur="0.9"/> acknowledged racist murder in Britain in the post-war period <pause dur="0.7"/> # occurred in nineteen-forty-eight <pause dur="0.6"/> in Camden <pause dur="0.2"/> in London <pause dur="3.9"/> there was also a historical legacy <pause dur="0.6"/> of recognizing the problem of race relations <pause dur="0.5"/> as we saw <pause dur="0.3"/> in last week's lecture <pause dur="0.3"/> in terms of the <pause dur="0.9"/> antagonisms <pause dur="0.3"/> that had existed <pause dur="0.4"/> between <pause dur="0.5"/> earlier minority groups like <pause dur="0.5"/> the Irish <pause dur="0.4"/> and the Jewish <pause dur="0.4"/> communities <pause dur="1.0"/> and the indigenous white community in Britain <pause dur="5.1"/> but the specific issues <pause dur="1.7"/> # around which questions of race relations <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> focused in the post-war period <pause dur="1.9"/> were distributional issues <pause dur="4.2"/> and distributional issues <pause dur="0.4"/> in the context <pause dur="0.3"/> of post-war <pause dur="0.3"/> reconstruction <pause dur="3.1"/> and more specifically <pause dur="1.3"/> it hinged around <pause dur="0.4"/> the idea <pause dur="0.2"/> or the perception <pause dur="0.4"/> and a widespread perception <pause dur="2.2"/> that the arrival of black immigrants into Britain <pause dur="0.4"/> was 
threatening the allocations <pause dur="0.6"/> of goods and services <pause dur="0.2"/> and jobs <pause dur="0.7"/> for the indigenous white population <pause dur="11.4"/> those goods and services included immediate welfare provisions <pause dur="2.5"/> but also housing <pause dur="9.6"/> and more directly <pause dur="1.3"/> issues of employment <pause dur="1.1"/> and from a very early stage in Britain and remember we're talking about a context within which there is no <pause dur="0.3"/> <trunc>legis</trunc> <trunc>l</trunc> legislative redress <pause dur="0.4"/> for <pause dur="1.2"/> ethnic minorities at this stage <pause dur="2.0"/> that from an early stage <pause dur="0.4"/> there were colour bars <pause dur="0.2"/> operating <pause dur="0.7"/> in <pause dur="1.0"/> almost every area of the provision of goods and services and jobs in Britain <pause dur="1.3"/> in every area in the public sector and the private sector <pause dur="0.4"/> they were <pause dur="0.2"/> colour bars that were <pause dur="1.0"/> often explicit <pause dur="4.1"/> and sometimes <pause dur="2.1"/> were more de facto <pause dur="1.4"/> in operation <pause dur="0.6"/> implicitly <pause dur="6.6"/> now unsurprisingly <pause dur="2.5"/> the <pause dur="3.0"/> realities of discrimination in Britain <pause dur="2.4"/> intensified the disaffection of black people <pause dur="0.6"/> who had arrived <pause dur="1.5"/> unsurprisingly <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> black people were not <pause dur="0.7"/> especially <pause dur="2.0"/> enamoured <pause dur="1.1"/> to a situation in which <pause dur="1.0"/> in <pause dur="0.2"/> often incredibly explicit terms they were <pause dur="0.5"/> denied access to 
goods services and jobs <pause dur="5.2"/> more especially <pause dur="0.9"/> # there was growing concern within black communities from a very early stage <pause dur="0.6"/> that in the face of <pause dur="1.0"/> that sort of discrimination <pause dur="0.3"/> they were offered no <pause dur="0.5"/> protection under the law <pause dur="5.9"/> now in that context one has on the one side <pause dur="1.9"/> white antagonisms to the black community because of white fears over distributional <pause dur="0.4"/> concerns <pause dur="1.4"/> and on the other side <pause dur="0.3"/> one has <pause dur="0.2"/> disaffection in <pause dur="0.2"/> the black community <pause dur="0.3"/> because of the de facto realities of <pause dur="0.4"/> being discriminated against <pause dur="0.5"/> as a result almost of those concerns within the white community <pause dur="1.9"/> and in that context <pause dur="0.7"/> through the nineteen-fifties and early nineteen-sixties <pause dur="1.7"/> there was an increasingly clear <pause dur="1.0"/> view within <pause dur="0.5"/> the British state <pause dur="1.9"/> that there was <pause dur="0.7"/> an acute danger of social conflict arising out of <pause dur="1.4"/> the problems <pause dur="2.7"/> of black and white relations <pause dur="14.5"/> now <pause dur="0.2"/> even though <pause dur="0.2"/> the problem of <pause dur="0.3"/> race relations <pause dur="0.2"/><vocal desc="sniff" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.3"/> as we saw last week <pause dur="0.3"/> # can be traced back to the very <pause dur="0.3"/> earliest stages of post-war black immigration <pause dur="1.2"/> in general <pause dur="0.3"/> despite the acknowledgement <pause dur="0.3"/> 
of the problem <pause dur="0.3"/> of race relations <pause dur="0.3"/><vocal desc="sniff" iterated="n"/><pause dur="1.3"/> the state's attitude in general <pause dur="2.0"/> was to hinge <pause dur="1.8"/> policy <pause dur="0.9"/> attempts at <pause dur="0.8"/> resolving those issues around the one <pause dur="3.9"/> basically hammer-like implementation of policy around immigration <pause dur="0.5"/> immigration control <pause dur="0.7"/> for fifteen-odd years <pause dur="2.8"/> was generally regarded as <pause dur="1.5"/> the only possible way <pause dur="0.3"/> of ensuring good <pause dur="0.2"/> race relations there was effectively no other <pause dur="0.3"/> policy input <pause dur="0.3"/> at the level of the state <pause dur="0.9"/><vocal desc="sniff" iterated="n"/><pause dur="5.3"/> and it isn't until <pause dur="2.5"/> the mid to late nineteen-sixties <pause dur="0.4"/> that there's any attempt by the state in Britain <pause dur="0.6"/> to actively intervene <pause dur="0.6"/> in tackling <pause dur="0.4"/> discrimination <pause dur="0.4"/> against <pause dur="0.7"/> black <pause dur="0.3"/> British <pause dur="0.4"/> people <pause dur="0.8"/><vocal desc="sniff" iterated="n"/><pause dur="12.2"/> now in lieu of the state's involvement <pause dur="0.9"/> what sort of protective mechanisms did <pause dur="0.5"/> the black community have <pause dur="2.1"/> well immediately after the Second World War <pause dur="2.2"/> there were various groups and movements <pause dur="1.3"/> that did begin to grow around <pause dur="0.7"/> the issue <pause dur="0.2"/> of immigrant <pause dur="0.3"/> welfare <pause dur="0.8"/><vocal desc="sniff" iterated="n"/><pause dur="2.4"/> and as i suggested <pause dur="0.2"/> these emerged <pause dur="2.1"/> as a result of <pause dur="1.7"/> an absence of <trunc>s</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> any organized provision in law <pause dur="1.5"/> by the state <pause dur="2.5"/> now the majority of those <pause dur="2.7"/> voluntary 
organizations <pause dur="1.0"/> were white led <pause dur="1.2"/> and were <pause dur="0.2"/> philanthropic in nature <pause dur="4.1"/> and their aim <pause dur="0.2"/> was most often <pause dur="1.2"/> to advance the effective integration <pause dur="1.1"/> of black people <pause dur="0.2"/> into <pause dur="0.3"/> the host society <pause dur="1.9"/> and on the whole <pause dur="0.7"/> those voluntary groups didn't receive state support <pause dur="0.4"/> until <pause dur="0.4"/> well into <pause dur="0.4"/> the nineteen-sixties <pause dur="7.5"/> so what causes or what is the impetus for <pause dur="0.8"/> state intervention <pause dur="0.7"/> during the nineteen-sixties <pause dur="4.0"/> well most obviously <pause dur="0.2"/> by the mid-nineteen-sixties there are strict immigration controls <pause dur="0.3"/> in Britain <pause dur="7.1"/> however <pause dur="1.1"/> the problem remains <pause dur="1.2"/> that there are still black people in Britain <pause dur="2.8"/> and the problem remains that those black people are now <pause dur="2.1"/> unless repatriated <pause dur="1.6"/> going to be a permanent feature <pause dur="0.5"/> of British life <pause dur="8.8"/> and in that context <pause dur="0.6"/> and the recognition of the permanent presence <pause dur="0.5"/> in the context of <pause dur="0.2"/> endemic discrimination <pause dur="3.6"/> and in the context of widespread hostility towards <pause dur="0.3"/> that permanent black presence <pause dur="0.4"/> there was increasingly perceived to be a need <pause dur="0.3"/> to actively intervene <pause dur="0.2"/> at this stage <pause dur="8.0"/> there was increasingly a 
perception of the need <pause dur="0.6"/> for the state to actively intervene <pause dur="0.5"/> in the relations between blacks and whites in Britain in order to <pause dur="0.5"/> allow for the effective integration <pause dur="1.7"/> of black people <pause dur="0.3"/> into <pause dur="1.0"/> the host society <pause dur="5.2"/> and moreover <pause dur="1.0"/> external <pause dur="2.3"/> events <pause dur="2.9"/> held a double <pause dur="0.2"/> emphasis <pause dur="1.8"/> 'cause of course during the nineteen-sixties and the mid-nineteen-sixties <pause dur="3.0"/> the British public is witnessing <pause dur="1.8"/> some of the most tumultuous events in American society <pause dur="1.5"/> namely the height of <pause dur="0.5"/> the radical <pause dur="0.2"/> end of the civil rights movement <pause dur="8.6"/> it isn't just the laudable claims of Martin Luther King <pause dur="2.1"/> to end discrimination in the South <pause dur="0.8"/> that is being witnessed at this moment <pause dur="1.4"/> but is also <pause dur="1.3"/> a recognition <pause dur="0.7"/> of massive <pause dur="1.0"/> violence and upheaval across the north <pause dur="0.3"/> of <trunc>at</trunc> the United States <pause dur="2.7"/> from around nineteen-sixty-four to sixty-eight <pause dur="2.3"/> the every summer of <pause dur="0.3"/> in the United States there is massive <pause dur="0.3"/> urban unrest <pause dur="1.0"/> massive urban unrest centred around the issue of race <pause dur="6.3"/> that focuses <pause dur="0.4"/> attention <pause dur="1.0"/> and fears and concerns <pause dur="0.6"/> of the British public <pause dur="1.3"/> as for the 
possibility of such tensions emerging here <pause dur="0.8"/> and of the necessity to avoid those tensions <pause dur="19.0"/> now in the earliest periods <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> where the state is concerned to intervene in race relations <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> its main <pause dur="0.2"/> concern <pause dur="0.5"/> is to find ways of overcoming <pause dur="0.3"/> differences <pause dur="0.3"/> between immigrant <pause dur="0.4"/> and indigenous populations <pause dur="4.0"/> differences it regards <pause dur="0.3"/> as primarily those of <pause dur="0.4"/> culture <pause dur="0.2"/> and identity <pause dur="1.3"/> and again we can see how that ties in <pause dur="0.4"/> quite centrally <pause dur="0.5"/> to questions of <pause dur="2.3"/> Britishness <pause dur="0.9"/> of what is to be British <pause dur="4.1"/> during this earliest period <pause dur="1.3"/> there is a perception <pause dur="0.6"/> that the only way in which to ensure good <trunc>rel</trunc> race relations <pause dur="0.4"/> is to integrate <pause dur="1.5"/> actively <pause dur="0.5"/> that immigrant population <pause dur="0.5"/> into broader conceptions <pause dur="0.4"/> dominant conceptions <pause dur="0.5"/> of British <pause dur="0.3"/> national <pause dur="0.3"/> life <pause dur="0.3"/> and British <pause dur="0.2"/> national identity <pause dur="9.7"/> now one <pause dur="0.2"/> needs to think through what underlies <pause dur="0.5"/> that sort of <pause dur="0.2"/> conception <pause dur="2.6"/> it is a conception which requires one to think <pause dur="0.4"/> of ways in which black people <pause dur="0.3"/> can be made <pause dur="0.6"/> to fit <pause dur="0.3"/> the model <pause dur="0.7"/> of <pause dur="0.3"/> Britishness <pause dur="6.8"/> and as soon as the problem is identified to be one of 
difference <pause dur="0.2"/> in culture <pause dur="0.3"/> and identity <pause dur="2.5"/> then the solution to that problem is to find ways of <pause dur="5.8"/> is to find ways of <pause dur="2.3"/> undermining those differences of culture and identity or lessening <pause dur="0.3"/> their problematic nature <pause dur="0.5"/> the view <pause dur="0.5"/> at the time the view <trunc>f</trunc> <pause dur="0.4"/> <trunc>w</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> during the nineteen-sixties was <pause dur="0.3"/> that those differences of culture and identity were only temporary differences <pause dur="4.5"/> they were temporary differences that could be ironed out <pause dur="0.4"/> of the immigrant population <pause dur="9.6"/> cultural differences <pause dur="2.9"/> could be flattened <pause dur="0.9"/> in a way that would allow for the effective integration of black <pause dur="0.3"/> people into white society <pause dur="0.4"/> linguistic differences <pause dur="0.4"/> were regarded linguistic differences were regarded as a central feature of that <pause dur="0.8"/> one of the major problems between black and white societies was <pause dur="0.5"/> one of language <pause dur="2.9"/> ironing out those sorts of differences would allow for effective integration <pause dur="0.4"/> now <pause dur="0.4"/> it follows pretty obviously if you take that view <pause dur="7.9"/> that the easiest way to pursue integration <pause dur="1.8"/> is to get the black 
population to be <pause dur="0.4"/> like the white population <pause dur="2.7"/> to make the cultural significance <pause dur="0.2"/> of the black population <pause dur="0.7"/> less significant <pause dur="10.0"/> and during the nineteen-sixties there were very deliberate attempts to pursue exactly <pause dur="0.8"/> that concern <pause dur="7.7"/> cultural <pause dur="0.6"/> cohesiveness <pause dur="0.2"/> amongst the black population <pause dur="0.9"/> was regarded to be <pause dur="0.4"/> a feature of its concentration in particular areas <pause dur="1.0"/> the fact that the black population was <pause dur="0.2"/> concentrated in certain large cities <pause dur="0.4"/> meant that <pause dur="0.9"/> it was always going to be able to protect a culture that was regarded as <pause dur="0.3"/> problematic <pause dur="4.4"/> therefore <pause dur="0.8"/> a way of overcoming that problem <pause dur="0.2"/> was to distribute <pause dur="0.3"/> the black population <pause dur="1.9"/> deconcentrate <pause dur="1.5"/> the black population <pause dur="1.0"/> in a way in which its cultural identities <pause dur="0.4"/> and cultural bonds <pause dur="0.7"/> would not be able to be maintained <pause dur="10.9"/> the most notorious example of this <pause dur="0.3"/> was a policy pursued by most <pause dur="0.6"/> major <pause dur="0.6"/> metropolitan local authorities <pause dur="0.4"/> throughout this period <pause dur="1.9"/> and it was the active intervention of local authorities to distribute an ethnic minority population <pause dur="3.1"/> 
into white society so one got for example in terms of public housing <pause dur="0.6"/> in <pause dur="0.4"/> cities like Manchester and Birmingham <pause dur="0.6"/> the attempt <pause dur="3.3"/> to establish housing ratios <pause dur="0.4"/> of ethnic minorities <pause dur="3.1"/> to deconcentrate ethnic minorities <pause dur="0.4"/> councils would <pause dur="0.8"/> establish a particular ratio that they it regarded as <pause dur="0.3"/> an optimum one <pause dur="1.0"/> for <pause dur="2.7"/> the concentration of black people <pause dur="0.2"/> within white society <pause dur="0.2"/> so in Birmingham for example <pause dur="0.3"/> every <pause dur="1.3"/> every <pause dur="0.3"/> housing estate <pause dur="0.8"/> had a particular ratio inputted on it <pause dur="1.7"/> there would be thirteen white families for every one black family <pause dur="2.8"/> in Manchester the figure was one in i think nine <pause dur="9.0"/> in the education sector <pause dur="0.7"/> ethnic <trunc>ni</trunc> minority <pause dur="0.2"/> children <pause dur="2.5"/> were required <pause dur="5.7"/> to be taught <pause dur="0.3"/> only in English <pause dur="2.8"/> with no move <pause dur="0.4"/> to integrate them slowly into that process <pause dur="0.6"/> the idea was if they were made to speak English they would just be forced to speak English <pause dur="0.5"/> whether they could or not they'd have to learn <pause dur="8.3"/> but these were generally ad hoc measures during this period <pause dur="13.0"/> but they are ad hoc measures <pause dur="1.0"/> that are perceived to be the right 
way forward in terms of integrating ethnic minorities <pause dur="0.3"/> and they are a stimulus and a pressure <pause dur="0.3"/> for the state <pause dur="0.4"/> to advance <pause dur="0.2"/> a more coherent <pause dur="0.3"/> and deliberate response <pause dur="1.1"/> in the form <pause dur="0.2"/> of <pause dur="0.2"/> race relations <pause dur="0.3"/> protection <pause dur="0.6"/> for ethnic minorities <pause dur="2.7"/> because what is clear <pause dur="2.0"/> is that despite attempts to integrate <pause dur="0.3"/> the black community <pause dur="0.3"/> there is still hostility <pause dur="0.3"/> from the indigenous white population <pause dur="0.3"/> and there is no guarantee <pause dur="0.7"/> of how long it will take <pause dur="0.8"/> <trunc>purs</trunc> pursuing policies like <pause dur="0.2"/> distributing black populations et cetera for them to be <pause dur="1.3"/> integrated effectively into British society <pause dur="0.4"/> there is a recognition that without protection in law <pause dur="0.7"/> the black community in Britain <pause dur="0.2"/> is <pause dur="0.9"/> utterly vulnerable <pause dur="3.3"/> to the prejudices of white society <pause dur="3.5"/> and the attempt by the state <pause dur="0.3"/> to offer black people protection in the law <pause dur="1.6"/> come to fruition <pause dur="0.4"/> in the mid to late nineteen-sixties <pause dur="0.2"/> in the form of the nineteen-sixty-five <pause dur="0.4"/> and nineteen-sixty-eight <pause dur="0.4"/> Race Relations Acts <pause dur="14.9"/> now the nineteen-sixty-five Race Relations Act <pause dur="1.7"/> was to say the least <pause dur="0.6"/> 
limited <pause dur="0.5"/> in its effects <pause dur="1.1"/> and even the potential <pause dur="0.3"/> of its effects <pause dur="3.2"/> the nineteen-sixty-five act established no criminal sanction <pause dur="0.7"/> for those guilty of racial discrimination <pause dur="0.9"/><vocal desc="sniff" iterated="n"/><pause dur="1.3"/> and the Race Relations Board <pause dur="1.8"/> was set up as part of the act <pause dur="0.6"/> to deal with cases <pause dur="1.3"/> of racial discrimination <pause dur="1.2"/> but the Race Relations Board <pause dur="0.3"/> had a very narrow remit <pause dur="2.9"/> and in practice was unable to deal with <pause dur="1.3"/> the vast majority of complaints it initially received <pause dur="0.4"/><vocal desc="sniff" iterated="n"/><pause dur="2.8"/> the nineteen-sixty-eight act was tougher <pause dur="7.3"/> before detailing some of the aspects of that let's just remember what's going on in nineteen-sixty-eight <pause dur="0.6"/> and this is part of the state's dual strategy <pause dur="0.3"/> with respect to race relations <pause dur="0.3"/> because it isn't just about protecting ethnic minorities <pause dur="0.3"/> it's also still about <pause dur="0.5"/> maintaining <pause dur="0.4"/> that need to be tough on immigration <pause dur="0.4"/> it's about maintaining the need to define <pause dur="0.2"/> absolutely <pause dur="1.2"/> what <pause dur="0.3"/> being British is about <pause dur="1.0"/> because remember in nineteen-sixty-eight <pause dur="1.3"/> there is the perceived flood <pause dur="0.2"/> of Kenyan Asians into 
Britain <pause dur="1.4"/> escaping persecution in Kenya <pause dur="4.1"/> nineteen-sixty-eight <pause dur="0.3"/> is <pause dur="0.9"/> the pinnacle moment <pause dur="0.2"/> of <pause dur="0.6"/> Powellism <pause dur="2.2"/> and of the concerns expressed about the presence of ethnic minorities in Britain <pause dur="6.9"/> so the state's response to ethnic <trunc>ni</trunc> minorities is not simply a protective one <pause dur="0.5"/> it's a protective one on one side <pause dur="0.8"/> and a <pause dur="0.5"/> tough <pause dur="1.4"/> uncompromising one on the other <pause dur="3.0"/> the nineteen-sixty-eight Act <pause dur="1.7"/> made it unlawful in explicit terms <pause dur="0.3"/> made it unlawful to discriminate <pause dur="0.2"/> on the grounds of race <pause dur="0.3"/> colour <pause dur="0.2"/> or ethnic <pause dur="0.3"/> or national <pause dur="0.2"/> origin <pause dur="7.6"/> and it specifically highlighted <pause dur="0.6"/> discrimination in the areas of employment <pause dur="0.6"/> and of housing <pause dur="0.6"/> and of the provision <pause dur="0.2"/> of goods <pause dur="0.2"/> and services <pause dur="0.5"/><vocal desc="sniff" iterated="n"/><pause dur="1.4"/> and the nineteen-sixty-eight act banned <pause dur="0.5"/> discriminatory notices <pause dur="0.3"/> and adverts <pause dur="2.8"/> and it also expanded <pause dur="1.0"/> the remit of the original Race Relations Board <pause dur="0.6"/> offering it firmer <pause dur="0.2"/> legal sanctions <pause dur="5.8"/> so far so good <pause dur="2.9"/> but the problem with both of those acts in nineteen-sixty-five and nineteen-sixty-eight <pause dur="2.1"/> was that <pause dur="0.4"/> they represented <pause dur="0.6"/> a very <pause dur="0.6"/> specific <pause dur="2.2"/> way of 
understanding <pause dur="0.8"/> what racial discrimination amounted to <pause dur="5.5"/> in both of those acts <pause dur="1.3"/> racial discrimination <pause dur="0.3"/> was primarily understood <pause dur="0.2"/> in fact <pause dur="0.6"/> that's wrong <trunc>i</trunc> they were exclusively <pause dur="0.7"/> both acts understood racial discrimination <pause dur="0.3"/> to be a matter of active <pause dur="0.8"/> and purposeful <pause dur="0.5"/> discrimination <pause dur="5.4"/> that is to say <pause dur="0.8"/> any attempt to establish that racial discrimination had occurred <pause dur="0.5"/> required one to prove <pause dur="0.3"/> that there had been explicit <pause dur="0.3"/> intention <pause dur="0.2"/> to discriminate <pause dur="0.4"/> against <pause dur="0.3"/> ethnic minorities <pause dur="0.3"/> in some way <pause dur="4.2"/> unsurprisingly <pause dur="3.2"/> under <trunc>n</trunc> <pause dur="1.6"/> either of these acts very few people <pause dur="0.8"/> were successful <pause dur="0.6"/> in making claims <pause dur="2.6"/> and indeed even fewer <pause dur="0.6"/> were particularly successful <pause dur="0.6"/> at prosecuting successfully <pause dur="0.4"/> those initial claims <pause dur="5.5"/> and it's here we can see quite centrally <pause dur="0.3"/> why it's important we understand the nature of race and racism <pause dur="6.1"/> 'cause if we <trunc>u</trunc> <pause dur="0.3"/> if we understand racism for example <pause dur="0.2"/> in terms of individual activity <pause dur="4.3"/> if we understand racism as identifiable within <pause dur="0.4"/> the locus or the origin of <pause dur="0.4"/> a particular intended activity <pause dur="2.9"/> then of course we 
have the advantage <pause dur="1.4"/> of knowing what we're looking at when we're trying to put legal sanction against it <pause dur="0.4"/> if somebody's explicitly saying no i'm a racist i think black people are not as good as white people i'm not going to employ them <pause dur="0.3"/> you know what you're looking at <pause dur="1.0"/> you know that you can say that's against the law you're not allowed to do that <pause dur="2.6"/> the problem though <pause dur="1.0"/> is how much racism is like that <pause dur="15.9"/> because as we discussed earlier <pause dur="0.5"/> in the course <pause dur="1.5"/> if you <pause dur="0.8"/> understand racism in a different way if you understand it in some institutional sense <pause dur="0.4"/> or if you understand it as something <pause dur="0.3"/> systemic rather than <pause dur="0.2"/> something that just <pause dur="0.4"/> happens to be what people believe <pause dur="3.2"/> if you believe that racism is reproduced <pause dur="0.9"/> through operations in the economy <pause dur="0.2"/> and in society <pause dur="0.3"/> and in culture <pause dur="3.8"/> then does it have to be intentional <pause dur="4.7"/> does it have to be about the deliberate <pause dur="0.3"/> actions <pause dur="0.2"/> of a set of individuals <pause dur="0.2"/> who make <pause dur="0.3"/> their <pause dur="0.3"/> deliberate intentions explicit <pause dur="9.7"/> so racism may in fact be something <pause dur="1.3"/> more general <pause dur="5.5"/> and less <pause dur="2.1"/> 
deliberate in those ways <pause dur="0.5"/> but then the problem immediately arises <pause dur="0.3"/> as that if that's the case <pause dur="0.5"/> then how do you begin to legislate against it <pause dur="0.9"/> 'cause what are you identifying <pause dur="1.0"/> if you can't find people who are saying i'm being a racist and i'm not going to employ you <pause dur="0.2"/> then what are you looking at <pause dur="7.7"/> moreover how do you begin <pause dur="0.4"/> to conceive of how <pause dur="1.0"/> whatever that racism amounts to at an institutional level how do you begin <pause dur="0.4"/> to understand its relationships with other forms of discrimination <pause dur="0.8"/> gender discrimination <pause dur="2.2"/> discrimination <pause dur="2.3"/> with respect to sexuality <pause dur="7.5"/> at this point are we not moving into the realms <pause dur="0.4"/> of some vague notion <pause dur="0.5"/> that people are just not treated very fairly <pause dur="0.3"/> <trunc>h</trunc> <trunc>m</trunc> and at that point if we are <pause dur="1.1"/> how do you get any sense of precise legal definition <pause dur="0.4"/> over that <pause dur="1.6"/> that is a core concern for the state <pause dur="1.2"/> during this period <pause dur="7.3"/> but it's the recognition that <pause dur="0.3"/> by focusing on individual explicit intentions <pause dur="1.7"/> it's the recognition that by <pause dur="0.2"/> focusing on that <pause dur="1.9"/> <trunc>th</trunc> <pause dur="0.9"/> there is no effective <pause dur="0.5"/> or <pause dur="0.8"/> particular 
legislation aimed at that is not effective in overturning discrimination <pause dur="0.3"/> it's the recognition of that <pause dur="0.2"/> that leads to the state <pause dur="0.5"/> during the nineteen-seventies <pause dur="1.1"/> leads to the state's rethinking <pause dur="0.3"/> of its approaches <pause dur="0.4"/> to race relations <pause dur="1.5"/> which comes together <pause dur="0.4"/> in <pause dur="1.8"/> the codified <pause dur="0.9"/> Race Relations Act of nineteen-<pause dur="0.2"/>seventy-six <pause dur="1.2"/><vocal desc="sniff" iterated="n"/><pause dur="3.3"/> the Race Relations Act of nineteen-seventy-six follows close on the heels of the Sex Discrimination Act <pause dur="0.3"/> of nineteen-seventy-five <pause dur="1.5"/> and in both cases <pause dur="0.6"/> these were legislation <pause dur="0.5"/> that emphasized <pause dur="0.5"/> not only <pause dur="1.1"/> the illegality of intentional acts of racism <pause dur="1.0"/> but also <pause dur="0.4"/> made illegal <pause dur="2.1"/> those <pause dur="0.8"/> procedures <pause dur="0.2"/> and activities <pause dur="0.3"/> that systemically <pause dur="0.3"/> produced <pause dur="0.6"/> or reproduced <pause dur="0.2"/> discrimination <pause dur="2.3"/> what we otherwise refer to as indirect discrimination <pause dur="3.0"/> and it's in the nineteen-seventy-six Race Relations Act <pause dur="0.5"/> where the emphasis shifts from <pause dur="0.3"/> intentional acts <pause dur="0.6"/> that discriminate <pause dur="0.3"/> in explicit ways <pause dur="2.3"/> to <pause dur="1.5"/> a focus instead on the outcomes <pause dur="0.8"/> of procedures <pause dur="0.4"/> that in practice <pause dur="0.3"/> discriminate <pause dur="0.2"/> whether they <pause dur="0.3"/> explicitly intend 
to or not <pause dur="1.6"/> so the focus goes to outcome <pause dur="2.1"/> rather than <pause dur="1.1"/> focusing on <pause dur="0.2"/> intention <pause dur="6.2"/> what that allowed for <pause dur="0.2"/> therefore <pause dur="0.7"/> was that even where policies and procedures <pause dur="0.3"/> were equal in a formal sense <pause dur="5.2"/> what mattered was whether the outcome <pause dur="0.6"/> of those procedures <pause dur="0.8"/> was to discriminate against certain <pause dur="0.3"/> racially designated groups <pause dur="0.6"/> and if they could be shown <pause dur="0.4"/> in their outcomes <pause dur="0.3"/> to discriminate <pause dur="0.2"/> whether they meant to or not <pause dur="0.2"/> whether they explicitly denied that that was the case or not <pause dur="0.8"/> then they were deemed to be illegal <pause dur="5.9"/> that came under the remit <pause dur="0.7"/> of the Commission for Racial Equality <pause dur="2.2"/> which was set up <pause dur="0.4"/> specifically <pause dur="0.3"/> to streamline <pause dur="0.4"/> the administration <pause dur="0.7"/> of <pause dur="0.2"/> this particular area of the law <pause dur="3.8"/> now you can read about <pause dur="2.0"/> the Commission for Racial Equality in your reading i would make a few comments however <pause dur="0.6"/> these are that <pause dur="0.2"/> despite what i think is an enormous shift <pause dur="0.3"/> in emphasis <pause dur="0.3"/> in the race relations <pause dur="1.0"/> perspective <pause dur="1.2"/> on behalf of the state despite <pause dur="0.3"/> that enormous shift in emphasis <pause dur="0.3"/> from <pause dur="0.2"/> intention <pause dur="0.2"/> to outcome <pause dur="1.4"/> the 
Commission for Racial Equality in practice <pause dur="2.9"/> has not been <trunc>effec</trunc> as effective as i suspect <pause dur="0.4"/> was once hoped <pause dur="1.4"/> because even today twenty years later <pause dur="0.4"/> what is clear is <pause dur="0.3"/> that its definitions of discrimination <pause dur="0.9"/> and its <pause dur="0.6"/> attempts to impose those definitions in judgements of <pause dur="0.3"/> discrimination claims <pause dur="0.3"/> are still incredibly vague <pause dur="3.0"/> it isn't clear how <pause dur="0.2"/> general definitions of <pause dur="0.8"/> racist outcomes <pause dur="0.2"/> still <pause dur="0.3"/> get <pause dur="0.2"/> put into practice <pause dur="0.3"/> as <pause dur="0.4"/> the criteria for judgement <pause dur="0.7"/> of discrimination cases <pause dur="1.7"/> moreover <pause dur="0.2"/> the Commission for Racial Equality <pause dur="0.7"/> is administratively cumbersome <pause dur="1.5"/> and incredibly time-consuming <pause dur="0.7"/> for those engaged <pause dur="0.3"/> in trying to make claims <pause dur="1.9"/> and further <pause dur="0.5"/> the Commission for Racial Equality <pause dur="0.6"/> does not have <pause dur="0.4"/> a particularly harsh set <pause dur="0.2"/> of sanctions <pause dur="0.3"/> in practice <pause dur="0.2"/> for those it finds guilty of discrimination <pause dur="9.4"/> and the one thing <pause dur="0.6"/> that the Commission for Racial Equality doesn't have <pause dur="0.2"/> in any way at all <pause dur="2.9"/> is any form of <pause dur="0.2"/> positive sanction <pause dur="0.4"/> to reverse <pause dur="0.2"/> what it regards as discrimination <pause dur="0.2"/> it does not have the ability to positively <pause dur="0.3"/> 
discriminate <pause dur="0.5"/> to reverse what it regards <pause dur="0.2"/> as discriminatory practices <pause dur="0.3"/> it has the ability <pause dur="0.4"/> to stop <pause dur="0.7"/> discrimination <pause dur="0.5"/> at the moment it finds it <pause dur="0.3"/> but it does not have the sanction <pause dur="0.2"/> of <pause dur="0.3"/> of requiring <pause dur="0.2"/> an employer <pause dur="0.2"/> or the provider of goods and services <pause dur="0.3"/> to actively redress that balance <pause dur="12.4"/> but the nineteen-seventy-six act <pause dur="0.3"/> <trunc>a</trunc> also represented something much <pause dur="0.7"/> more <pause dur="2.9"/> well much less tangible but perhaps more important nevertheless <pause dur="0.4"/> than <pause dur="0.6"/> simply the view <pause dur="1.9"/> of a way in which race relations could be thought of <pause dur="0.6"/> in terms of integrating and assimilating black people <pause dur="0.3"/> about helping black people overcome their problems <pause dur="0.3"/> the nineteen-seventy-six act reflected something <pause dur="0.2"/> very different <pause dur="0.5"/> again in the thinking <pause dur="0.2"/> about race relations more generally <pause dur="0.9"/> because the seventy-six act <pause dur="0.3"/> recognized even in a half-hearted way <pause dur="0.7"/> it nevertheless recognized <pause dur="0.4"/> that conceptions of good race relations <pause dur="0.3"/> could not be premised on the idea of simply <pause dur="0.2"/> needing <pause dur="0.2"/> to assimilate black people into dominant white society <pause dur="3.4"/> it recognized <pause dur="4.0"/> in 
very explicit ways in terms of what it regarded as a remit of the Commission for Racial Equality <pause dur="0.6"/> what it regarded as <pause dur="0.2"/> the context within which <pause dur="0.2"/> the nineteen-seventy-six act would take its course <pause dur="3.6"/> it recognized <pause dur="1.7"/> that Britain was <pause dur="0.2"/> explicitly and permanently <pause dur="0.3"/> a multicultural society <pause dur="1.7"/> a pluralistic <pause dur="0.2"/> society <pause dur="7.5"/> and it presupposed that in the context of being a multicultural <pause dur="0.3"/> and pluralistic society <pause dur="3.2"/> Britain <pause dur="3.1"/> would <trunc>r</trunc> <pause dur="0.6"/> or British society <pause dur="0.3"/> would need to include <pause dur="0.3"/> and encourage <pause dur="0.4"/> those people <pause dur="0.2"/> it had previously <pause dur="0.5"/> designated as different <pause dur="1.1"/> in their difference <pause dur="0.7"/> the aim was not now to iron out differences <pause dur="1.1"/> it was about encouraging <pause dur="0.3"/> the positive articulation of those differences <pause dur="1.9"/> in helping to shape in an active way <pause dur="5.2"/> the nature of <pause dur="3.2"/> British public life <pause dur="1.2"/> and British social life <pause dur="10.9"/> now of course the reality <pause dur="0.3"/> despite that rhetoric and despite that recognition <pause dur="0.3"/> the reality was actually quite different <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> in many ways or the reality was <trunc>w</trunc> at least more begrudging <pause dur="1.4"/> than <pause dur="0.2"/> that rhetoric would presuppose <pause dur="3.7"/> because 
of course during the nineteen-seventies there were further restrictions <pause dur="0.4"/> placed on <pause dur="1.5"/> black immigration into Britain <pause dur="1.1"/> again sending out a rather different message about <pause dur="0.9"/> the nature of that pluralism <pause dur="0.2"/> the nature of that multiculturalism <pause dur="0.3"/> the nature of the boundaries that were being drawn around British identity <pause dur="4.9"/> nevertheless there was something pragmatic <pause dur="0.3"/> in this approach <pause dur="0.5"/> in regarding Britain <pause dur="0.2"/> as multicultural <pause dur="0.4"/> in regarding Britain <pause dur="0.2"/> as pluralistic <pause dur="0.7"/> the pragmatics of this were <pause dur="0.2"/> that it simply was not possible <pause dur="0.4"/> to look at British society and pretend there weren't black people there <pause dur="1.2"/> and to pretend that those black people suddenly become white <pause dur="0.5"/> culturally <pause dur="1.2"/> or become white in their identifications <pause dur="3.4"/> politically and socially <pause dur="2.4"/> there was a recognition that there was <pause dur="0.3"/> there were differences <pause dur="0.8"/> that were important differences <pause dur="0.2"/> that couldn't be <pause dur="0.3"/> whitewashed <pause dur="10.6"/> and that black <pause dur="0.5"/> communities in Britain would not <pause dur="0.6"/> take an active participatory role in British life <pause dur="0.4"/> unless <pause dur="1.0"/> those 
differences were acknowledged in some sort of positive way <pause dur="1.4"/> now the nineteen-seventy-six act was <pause dur="0.7"/> the last major <pause dur="0.5"/> state inspired <pause dur="0.4"/> initiative <pause dur="0.3"/> in this area <pause dur="0.4"/> twenty years later <pause dur="0.9"/> more than twenty years later <pause dur="2.0"/> there has been no <pause dur="0.4"/> state <pause dur="0.5"/> legislation <pause dur="0.9"/> at the national level <pause dur="0.9"/> in the area of race <pause dur="0.3"/> relations <pause dur="5.3"/> for the most part therefore for the last twenty years <pause dur="0.3"/> it hasn't been at the national level <pause dur="0.3"/> where the issue of race relations has for the most part played itself out <pause dur="2.1"/> over the last twenty years the main focus for <pause dur="0.2"/> debate <pause dur="0.3"/> and <pause dur="2.5"/> moves forwards and <trunc>r</trunc> regressive moves backwards in this area <pause dur="0.2"/> have almost entirely been <pause dur="0.2"/> played out at the local level <pause dur="2.0"/><vocal desc="sniff" iterated="n"/> now of course the local level is important because the local level is exactly <pause dur="0.3"/> where the politics of race and racism get played out <pause dur="1.7"/> it's exactly at the local level <pause dur="0.2"/> that we see notions of community coming together <pause dur="0.5"/> it's exactly at the <trunc>losh</trunc> local level <pause dur="0.2"/> that we see <pause dur="0.2"/> the importance of the identities those communities <pause dur="0.2"/> assume <pause dur="1.1"/> <unclear>i mean</unclear> 
you're thinking of <unclear>it in</unclear> thinking of it in the most simple terms <pause dur="0.3"/> it's at the local level that we think about <pause dur="0.2"/> what <pause dur="0.8"/> our neighbourhoods are like <pause dur="0.2"/> it's at the local level <pause dur="0.4"/> we think <pause dur="0.2"/> in the most explicit terms <pause dur="0.2"/> about who our neighbours are <pause dur="2.7"/> and it's at the local level <pause dur="0.9"/> that we will <pause dur="0.4"/> # or we have seen <pause dur="0.3"/> that those tensions operate <pause dur="0.5"/> those tensions operated in Notting Hill <pause dur="0.2"/> because Notting Hill was a local area where there were black people <pause dur="0.2"/> living in antagonistic relationship to white people on the ground <pause dur="1.9"/> it was at the local level <pause dur="1.4"/> that Peter Griffiths in Smethwick <pause dur="0.5"/> in the <trunc>mi</trunc> mid-nineteen-sixties <pause dur="0.2"/> could make his appeal <pause dur="0.6"/> about <pause dur="1.4"/> <trunc>h</trunc> if you want a nigger neighbour vote Labour <pause dur="0.4"/> because it was at the local level <pause dur="0.9"/> that the politics of race <pause dur="0.6"/> was articulated in such a frenzy <pause dur="0.4"/> and such <pause dur="0.6"/> intensity <pause dur="1.2"/> during the sixties and seventies <pause dur="6.8"/> local authorities <pause dur="1.5"/> became actively involved in the process <pause dur="0.4"/> of <pause dur="0.7"/> intervening in race relations at the local level <pause dur="2.9"/> after <pause dur="0.4"/> and very much <pause dur="0.6"/> as a direct 
consequence <pause dur="0.4"/> of <pause dur="0.6"/> the urban unrest in the nineteen-eighties <pause dur="2.5"/> the most violent and frightening <pause dur="0.4"/> manifestation <pause dur="0.2"/> of local antagonisms <pause dur="0.3"/> between blacks and whites <pause dur="6.5"/> it's in this context <pause dur="0.4"/> the first <pause dur="0.7"/> deliberate <pause dur="1.3"/> and actively empowering moment <pause dur="0.4"/> in black political life as i will argue later in the course <pause dur="1.1"/> it's at this very moment that the black community begins to exert pressure <pause dur="0.3"/> on <pause dur="0.4"/> local authorities <pause dur="1.2"/> to address problems <pause dur="0.6"/> that are not being addressed effectively at the national level <pause dur="0.4"/> of <pause dur="1.0"/> discrimination in employment in housing in service provisions <pause dur="0.3"/> in education <pause dur="0.2"/> in the social services et cetera et cetera <pause dur="2.5"/> and it's here we see the shift <pause dur="3.2"/> from a national level recognition of the multicultural society <pause dur="0.6"/> to a a rather different emphasis at the local level <pause dur="0.3"/> towards anti-racism <pause dur="2.3"/> here it's not simply about <pause dur="0.3"/> Britain's a multicultural society <pause dur="0.2"/> lots of different groups <pause dur="0.6"/> live together in we're going to try and make it harmonious this is about addressing <pause dur="0.3"/> the specific problem of racism <pause dur="13.2"/> 
and as a consequence of the idea <pause dur="0.2"/> that what needed to be addressed here was not <pause dur="0.2"/> simply how to make <pause dur="0.3"/> life for black people in Britain harmonious how to make race relations harmonious <pause dur="0.3"/> but was actually about actively intervening <pause dur="2.0"/> to address the problem of racism <pause dur="3.3"/> the consequence of that realization <pause dur="0.6"/> was the <pause dur="0.5"/> emergence of a number of initiatives that were <pause dur="0.4"/> pursued by local authorities across the country <pause dur="1.4"/> these included <pause dur="0.4"/> the active monitoring of outcomes <pause dur="0.7"/> of service provisions <pause dur="0.7"/> in order to identify <pause dur="0.3"/> discrimination <pause dur="1.3"/> councils would increasingly monitor <pause dur="0.6"/> their services <pause dur="0.3"/> to see whether there were differential benefits going to one group or another <pause dur="1.9"/> there was also an <pause dur="0.3"/> active <pause dur="0.7"/> pursuit <pause dur="1.0"/> of more ethnic minority recruitment <pause dur="0.5"/> within local authorities <pause dur="0.3"/> whether they be teachers <pause dur="0.3"/> or local authority council workers <pause dur="0.4"/> of whatever sort <pause dur="0.7"/> or council officials themselves <pause dur="1.1"/> and moreover <pause dur="0.2"/> large numbers of authorities <pause dur="0.2"/> took the initiative <pause dur="0.2"/> in trying <pause dur="0.3"/> to consult <pause dur="0.5"/> in a much more <pause dur="1.1"/> friendly manner <pause dur="0.2"/> with the 
ethnic minority communities <pause dur="0.7"/> and these ranged with all sorts of # <pause dur="0.9"/> initiatives but the most obvious one now is that almost every local authority in Britain now <pause dur="0.4"/> has translation services for all of its <pause dur="0.9"/> information <pause dur="0.2"/> i mean just a little example <pause dur="0.6"/> that's now <pause dur="2.0"/> a standard practice <pause dur="0.3"/> now all of that those sorts of policies were initiated by <pause dur="0.2"/> and were led <pause dur="0.7"/> by <pause dur="0.4"/> radical left <pause dur="0.2"/> local authorities during the nineteen-eighties <pause dur="0.6"/> authorities like Haringay <pause dur="1.7"/> in London Brent in London <pause dur="1.1"/> Manchester City Council Liverpool City Council <pause dur="2.7"/> now we all of course know <pause dur="0.2"/> that it was exactly those same authorities during the nineteen-eighties <pause dur="0.3"/> that were vilified at the national level <pause dur="0.3"/> in the press <pause dur="0.2"/> and by political parties <pause dur="0.2"/> as being <pause dur="0.3"/> the loony left <pause dur="8.8"/> the intense media focus <pause dur="0.3"/> on this these groups <pause dur="0.2"/> of local authorities <pause dur="0.2"/> focused absolutely centrally <pause dur="0.4"/> on the question of what they were doing for our ethnic minorities <pause dur="0.4"/> the whole discourse was pitched in terms of special treatment <pause dur="0.3"/> for ethnic minorities <pause dur="0.2"/> some of you may 
recall or will have read about <pause dur="0.8"/> the apparent bans on things like golliwogs in <pause dur="0.2"/> nursery schools <pause dur="7.1"/> all of this stuff became equally pitched in terms of <pause dur="0.6"/> the overt <pause dur="0.2"/> and unnecessary and debilitating consequences of political correctness <pause dur="4.9"/> where in education <pause dur="0.8"/> authorities like the London <pause dur="0.2"/> Inner London Education Authority <pause dur="0.3"/> began to promote <pause dur="0.7"/> explicitly anti-racist curricula <pause dur="1.6"/> they were accused of brainwashing children <pause dur="5.7"/> we will remember that there were active pursuits of policies around <pause dur="0.2"/> adoption <pause dur="1.3"/> where local authorities would try and encourage <pause dur="0.2"/> same race adoptions <pause dur="2.1"/> this again was regarded <pause dur="0.7"/> not only <pause dur="0.2"/> as political correctness gone too far <pause dur="0.4"/> but actually reverse discrimination <pause dur="1.1"/><vocal desc="sniff" iterated="n"/><pause dur="4.1"/> a central focus of <pause dur="0.2"/> local authority work <pause dur="0.7"/> in this area became <pause dur="1.0"/> contract compliance <pause dur="0.7"/> local authorities would put their contracts out to tender <pause dur="0.5"/> but would require <pause dur="0.6"/> that <pause dur="0.6"/> any company <pause dur="0.2"/> employed by the council <pause dur="0.2"/> would have to meet certain requirements with regards <pause dur="0.3"/> to ethnic minority representation and treatment <pause dur="2.3"/> that <pause dur="0.2"/> 
measure <pause dur="1.0"/> was attacked <pause dur="0.4"/> by <pause dur="0.6"/> the Conservative government at the time <pause dur="0.2"/> Margaret Thatcher explicitly accused these councils <pause dur="0.4"/> of interfering with the market mechanism <pause dur="1.6"/> imposing unreasonable demands on what would otherwise be a free market <pause dur="2.2"/> and perhaps <pause dur="0.5"/> the most controversial of all <pause dur="0.5"/> of those local authority initiatives <pause dur="0.4"/> was what was regarded <pause dur="0.2"/> or was # <pause dur="0.2"/> commonly <pause dur="0.7"/> # called <pause dur="0.3"/> race awareness training <pause dur="0.7"/><vocal desc="sniff" iterated="n"/><pause dur="2.3"/> race awareness training <pause dur="0.4"/> initiatives <pause dur="0.4"/> were essentially <pause dur="1.9"/> promoting <pause dur="0.5"/> the idea that <pause dur="0.5"/> if one could change people's views on race <pause dur="1.4"/> at the local level <pause dur="0.2"/> if one could <pause dur="0.2"/> challenge existing prejudices <pause dur="3.3"/> then perhaps one could get some institutional <pause dur="0.4"/> cultural change <pause dur="0.5"/> in <pause dur="0.5"/> prevailing racist ideas <pause dur="0.7"/> at the local level <pause dur="2.5"/> now again race awareness training <pause dur="0.2"/> was regarded <pause dur="0.4"/> by the right as brainwashing <pause dur="2.9"/> again <pause dur="1.2"/> not again <pause dur="2.1"/> ironically <pause dur="0.5"/> race awareness training was attacked from the left <pause dur="1.0"/> as <pause dur="0.5"/> emphasizing <pause dur="2.4"/> or misemphasizing <pause dur="1.5"/> individual activity <pause dur="0.6"/> when you should have been emphasizing <pause dur="0.2"/> institutional <pause dur="0.8"/> results <pause dur="5.3"/> and race awareness training 
really was the pinnacle moment <pause dur="0.4"/> of this whole process <pause dur="0.4"/> it was the point where local authorities <pause dur="0.2"/> actively got involved <pause dur="0.3"/> to try and change people's minds about race <pause dur="4.6"/> and there's nothing obviously good about that <pause dur="1.6"/> and in the practice of race awareness training some of you may even have gone through it <pause dur="2.4"/> the realities of race awareness training are <pause dur="0.5"/> that it is <pause dur="0.4"/> in effect in its practice <pause dur="0.2"/> was bullying <pause dur="1.3"/> in effect local authorities did not reach a moment where they could genuinely say <pause dur="0.5"/> that they were introducing some cultural change <pause dur="0.3"/> into the organized institutions of local <pause dur="0.3"/> politics in Britain <pause dur="10.8"/> that is the management of race in Britain <pause dur="1.4"/> in its most significant forms <pause dur="1.6"/> what we see today in terms of the sensitivities <pause dur="0.2"/> that we may acknowledge that councils have <pause dur="0.5"/> that we may acknowledge in terms of employers' <pause dur="0.8"/> commitments to <pause dur="0.2"/> some level of equal opportunities <pause dur="0.3"/> have come through that history <pause dur="0.6"/> we'll explore the <pause dur="0.4"/> more recent developments of that in the next lecture
