<u who="nm1172"> # <pause dur="0.8"/> i'm going to talk about European politics but more particularly i'm going to talk about the European Union <pause dur="1.2"/> that's the E-U <pause dur="0.2"/> and the changing character of the European Union <pause dur="0.3"/> and # the reason for choosing this topic <pause dur="0.5"/> the reason for <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> suggesting that we might tackle this topic <pause dur="0.5"/> is that we are <pause dur="0.5"/> # on the eve of a very important change <pause dur="0.2"/> in the European Union because of the <pause dur="0.5"/> imminence <pause dur="0.4"/> of the Economic and Monetary Union <pause dur="0.3"/> EMU <pause dur="0.5"/> E-M-U <pause dur="0.5"/> and the creation in Europe of a single currency that will be coming within the next year or two and preparations for doing that are already well advanced <pause dur="0.5"/> and <pause dur="0.3"/> not only will that mean that <pause dur="0.2"/> a new <pause dur="0.4"/> unit of currency the euro will be created for use <pause dur="0.3"/> throughout those members of the European Union who decide to join the # E-M-U <pause dur="1.0"/> # but it will also mean a considerable increase in the powers <pause dur="0.5"/> of the <pause dur="0.5"/> central institutions of the European Union and in particular it will mean the creation of a central European bank <pause dur="0.5"/> which will have quite important 
powers <pause dur="0.3"/> in relation to money and taxation <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> with respect to all those <pause dur="0.4"/> member states who have joined <pause dur="0.4"/> the union <pause dur="0.2"/> so <pause dur="0.7"/> # # because of its topicality and because of its importance this seems to be a <pause dur="0.3"/> topic <pause dur="0.3"/> to which <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> i can talk and which you might be interested in <pause dur="0.9"/> a a further element in the interest <pause dur="0.7"/> of the <pause dur="0.3"/> # in the European Union is more long term that is to say that <pause dur="0.8"/> in a great many <pause dur="0.4"/> areas of the country <pause dur="0.3"/> of the world i should say <pause dur="0.5"/> both <pause dur="0.2"/> in North America <pause dur="0.3"/> and in East Asia <pause dur="0.5"/> there is a certain amount of experimentation <pause dur="0.4"/> with <pause dur="0.5"/> # entities new regional entities <pause dur="0.4"/> which <pause dur="0.2"/> are <pause dur="0.3"/> more or less <pause dur="0.7"/> # # modelled on or inspired by <pause dur="0.4"/> the European Union <pause dur="0.5"/> # not that these <pause dur="0.2"/> other <pause dur="0.3"/> # organizations in other parts of the world <pause dur="0.3"/> have copied <pause dur="0.5"/> # strictly <pause dur="0.2"/> the formulae which had been reasonably successful in a European context that obviously wouldn't have been appropriate <pause dur="0.5"/> but <pause dur="0.4"/> the <pause dur="0.3"/> # success <pause dur="0.3"/> in quotes of the European Union as a regional economic and political organization <pause dur="0.4"/> has inspired countries in some 
other regions to come together <pause dur="0.4"/> # in order to do something rather similar <pause dur="0.3"/> and therefore <pause dur="0.3"/> when we're talking about the European Union we're talking about something which is of <pause dur="0.3"/> worldwide and of global interest <pause dur="0.5"/> and of course <pause dur="1.0"/> finally underlining the importance of our topic <pause dur="0.8"/> # <trunc>an</trunc> and thirdly <pause dur="0.4"/> we are <pause dur="0.2"/> living in a period in which <pause dur="0.6"/> we are more and more conscious <pause dur="0.3"/> of the <pause dur="0.7"/> global <pause dur="0.5"/> operation of the economy especially with regard to <pause dur="0.4"/> currency stability <pause dur="0.5"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> potential currency devaluations <pause dur="0.5"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> in a world of that kind the European Union <pause dur="0.4"/> will <pause dur="0.2"/> once it has its own currency <pause dur="0.4"/> be a major player <pause dur="0.4"/> alongside the United States <pause dur="0.3"/> # and Japan <pause dur="0.6"/> and therefore any <pause dur="0.2"/> kind of understanding of the way in which <pause dur="0.4"/> world <pause dur="0.2"/> politics and especially the economic aspects of world politics operates <pause dur="0.3"/> requires us to understand what sort of an animal <pause dur="0.3"/> the European Union is </u><gap reason="break in recording" extent="uncertain"/> <u who="nm1172" trans="pause"> i've tried to organize the lecture <pause dur="1.1"/> around three broad questions <pause dur="0.6"/> which i thought <pause dur="0.8"/> # might be of interest <pause dur="1.2"/> the first question <pause dur="0.4"/> is why was 
the European Union created in the first place <pause dur="0.7"/> and <pause dur="1.1"/> implicit in that <pause dur="0.2"/> question is also another question <pause dur="0.6"/> not only why was it created but why has it persisted why has it grown why has it prospered relatively speaking <pause dur="0.5"/> in the period since its creation in nineteen-fifty-eight <pause dur="1.5"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> it's it's a it's a forty year old institution now so clearly we need to know something if we're going to understand it about the forces that were at work at its birth <pause dur="0.4"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> even more importantly since its nature has changed over time <pause dur="0.4"/> those forces that have had an impact on it subsequently <pause dur="0.3"/> and have allowed it to persist and to grow <pause dur="1.6"/> the second <pause dur="0.2"/> question <pause dur="0.3"/> # i want to <pause dur="0.3"/> ask <pause dur="0.8"/> is what kind of an entity <pause dur="0.8"/> is this <pause dur="0.5"/> union <pause dur="0.2"/> is this European Union which exists <pause dur="0.8"/> we are accustomed to think of the world as divided into <pause dur="0.8"/> however many it is a hundred-and-fifty two-hundred <pause dur="0.4"/> nation states all of which enjoy a degree <pause dur="1.0"/> of independence from one another sometimes described as national sovereignty <pause dur="1.1"/> # and clearly when 
regional organizations <pause dur="0.3"/> are created and when they begin to acquire <pause dur="0.5"/> at least some degree of power <pause dur="0.2"/> over their <pause dur="0.2"/> member states <pause dur="0.5"/> then some new kind of entity which is not a national state <pause dur="0.9"/> and perhaps is not a even a supranational state <pause dur="0.4"/> <trunc>i</trunc> is being created and therefore i want to in my second question <pause dur="0.4"/> reflect a little on what sort of entity <pause dur="0.6"/> # is being created here <pause dur="0.3"/> is it a new national state <pause dur="0.4"/> on a larger scale <pause dur="0.5"/> or is it something rather different from that which i i think is <pause dur="0.6"/> more likely to be the the answer that we're going to reach <pause dur="0.5"/> involved also in that second question <pause dur="0.3"/> of what kind of an entity is the the E-U <pause dur="0.5"/> is <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> an answer in terms of <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> # beneficiaries if you like <pause dur="0.3"/> # <trunc>i</trunc> in politics we're always keen to know who who <pause dur="0.3"/> who's winning and who's losing <pause dur="0.6"/> and therefore it's important for us <trunc>t</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> to as as students of politics to ask <pause dur="0.6"/> who does the creation of the E-U benefit <pause dur="0.5"/> who is it likely to <pause dur="0.3"/> to to assist and who is it likely not to assist <pause dur="0.3"/> or even perhaps positively <pause dur="0.4"/> 
damage or handicap in certain ways <pause dur="0.3"/> in other words in terms of power <pause dur="0.4"/> who is going to benefit from this <pause dur="0.2"/> <trunc>i</trunc> this initiative this innovation <pause dur="0.5"/> in the organization of international relations <pause dur="0.2"/> and who is going to suffer <pause dur="1.9"/> and the third question i <pause dur="0.3"/> i want to <pause dur="0.3"/> ask which i think is probably less <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> less <pause dur="0.2"/> less crucial less fundamental in some ways but no no no <trunc>l</trunc> <pause dur="0.5"/> nevertheless of interest to you i'm sure <pause dur="0.4"/> is <pause dur="0.3"/> more specifically <trunc>relit</trunc> regarding the U-K <pause dur="0.9"/> and that is <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> what is the U-K's particular position vis-à-vis Europe <pause dur="0.4"/> and has that position been altered <pause dur="0.4"/> by <pause dur="0.2"/> the election of a Labour government last year <pause dur="0.2"/> led by Tony Blair <pause dur="0.2"/> in other words <pause dur="0.4"/> has that <pause dur="0.3"/> political change in the U-K which is no doubt significant in certain respects <pause dur="0.3"/> had any <pause dur="0.6"/> # major significance for the relationship between Britain <pause dur="0.4"/> and the European Union <pause dur="0.3"/> which many of you know <pause dur="0.3"/> has often in the past been a rather difficult relationship <pause dur="0.6"/> but my conclusion on that third question will be <pause dur="0.3"/> that it hasn't changed <pause dur="0.4"/> things <pause dur="0.3"/> very 
much </u><gap reason="break in recording" extent="uncertain"/> <u who="nm1172" trans="pause"> right <pause dur="0.7"/> let's begin with our first question then why was the <pause dur="0.2"/> # European Union created <pause dur="0.5"/> and i want to begin by giving you two <pause dur="0.3"/> wrong answers if you like because part of the way of course of answering the question is to is to is to <pause dur="0.4"/> suggest <pause dur="0.3"/> possible answers that you need to reject before you get to the correct answer <pause dur="1.3"/> and a popular <pause dur="0.6"/> well i think it's a popular myth anyway a popular myth that surrounds <pause dur="0.4"/> the <pause dur="0.4"/> motives underlying the creation of # the European Union <pause dur="0.7"/> in the nineteen-fifties <pause dur="0.7"/> was that <pause dur="0.3"/> it was <pause dur="0.5"/> a reaction <pause dur="0.7"/> to the danger of war and the <pause dur="0.5"/> those member states <pause dur="0.2"/> in particular France Germany and Italy who had been most directly affected <pause dur="0.4"/> by the ravages of a second world war <pause dur="0.3"/> decided to create the European Union <pause dur="0.3"/> in order to prevent <pause dur="0.4"/> future wars amongst themselves <pause dur="0.6"/> in other words <pause dur="0.2"/> the argument here which i'm going to suggest is a mistaken argument <pause dur="0.4"/> is that the European Union was conceived of <pause dur="0.3"/> as a solution to <pause dur="0.2"/> security problems <pause dur="0.3"/> as a solution to <pause dur="0.5"/> the problems 
of war and peace <pause dur="0.3"/> and how to secure for <pause dur="1.2"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> Europeans <pause dur="0.5"/> a more stable <pause dur="0.2"/> and a more secure <pause dur="0.2"/> future <pause dur="0.6"/> i think that wasn't in fact the intention <pause dur="0.6"/> # and it wasn't the purpose which the European Union <pause dur="0.3"/> was # designed to serve <pause dur="0.4"/> although <pause dur="0.2"/> subsequently many politicians in order to win support <pause dur="0.6"/> for the European Union <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> have tried to play <pause dur="0.2"/> on people's fear of insecurity <pause dur="0.4"/> as a way of justifying <pause dur="0.4"/> the <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> # the existence of the union and and of and of justifying its expanded role <pause dur="1.1"/> the reason why i reject this argument is that <pause dur="0.7"/> the real threat <pause dur="1.5"/> to security <pause dur="0.7"/> as understood by Europeans in the nineteen-fifties <pause dur="0.5"/> came <pause dur="0.3"/> from the Soviet Union <pause dur="0.5"/> and the solution which was adopted <pause dur="0.6"/> to that threat <pause dur="0.3"/> and <pause dur="0.6"/> what was seen in the nineteen-fifties as a solution to Europe <pause dur="0.2"/> Europe's <pause dur="0.7"/> # security problems <pause dur="0.2"/> was not the European Union but a <trunc>qu</trunc> a quite different sort of organization <pause dur="0.4"/> called <pause dur="0.2"/> NATO the North Atlantic Treaty Organization <pause dur="0.2"/> which was created much earlier <pause dur="0.6"/> # and was <pause dur="0.2"/> explicitly American led <pause dur="0.3"/> as opposed to the 
European Union of course <pause dur="0.2"/> of which America is not a member <pause dur="0.3"/> and which even has some <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> <trunc>c</trunc> <pause dur="0.3"/> some some anti-American or some some independent of American <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> elements in it <pause dur="0.4"/> so <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> it seems to me that <pause dur="0.3"/> NATO was the answer to security difficulties <pause dur="0.4"/> the <pause dur="0.5"/> the answer which <trunc>u</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> Western European countries sought <pause dur="0.4"/> to the security problem in the immediate post-war period <pause dur="0.3"/> was <pause dur="0.3"/> collective security <pause dur="0.3"/> under American leadership <pause dur="0.7"/> and the E-U <pause dur="0.3"/> wasn't concerned with that <pause dur="1.4"/> second wrong answer <pause dur="1.5"/> is to suggest that <pause dur="1.3"/> in some way with advancing prosperity <pause dur="0.7"/> with more international travel <pause dur="0.2"/> with easier and freer communication <pause dur="0.9"/> # between peoples <pause dur="2.0"/> the sense of <pause dur="0.3"/> national identity <pause dur="0.3"/> which Europeans felt <pause dur="0.8"/> was tending to decline <pause dur="1.0"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> a greater sense of <pause dur="0.2"/> if you like cosmopolitan loyalty <pause dur="0.3"/> or of European loyalty <pause dur="0.4"/> or of loyalty to some broader entity <pause dur="0.4"/> beyond one's own country <pause dur="0.6"/> was growing <pause dur="1.4"/> so there's a there's a kind of an optimistic myth <pause dur="0.2"/> underlying <pause dur="0.4"/> much talk about the E-U that says <pause dur="0.4"/> well of course we live in an age <pause dur="0.2"/> when people <pause dur="0.5"/> # 
are no longer as obsessed as they once were <pause dur="0.4"/> by their own particular national identities <pause dur="0.2"/> they travel more they have more foreign friends <pause dur="0.3"/> and they have freed themselves <pause dur="0.2"/> of these <pause dur="0.3"/> <trunc>th</trunc> national <pause dur="0.4"/> and limiting <pause dur="0.2"/> perspectives and as a consequence <pause dur="0.3"/> forms of international organization and forms of regional organization <pause dur="0.4"/> which were once impossible <pause dur="0.7"/> # now become <pause dur="0.3"/> not only possible but <trunc>a</trunc> also perhaps desirable <pause dur="0.5"/> <trunc>th</trunc> that doesn't seem to me to be <pause dur="0.3"/> # in any sense part of <pause dur="0.2"/> the real story <pause dur="0.3"/> of how the European Union was created <pause dur="0.4"/> because <pause dur="0.6"/> # the European Union has always acknowledged <pause dur="0.8"/> and worked within <pause dur="0.4"/> the constraints established <pause dur="0.3"/> by <pause dur="0.2"/> national loyalties <pause dur="0.2"/> in other words <pause dur="0.2"/> it's not a club <pause dur="0.5"/> which has ever set its face <pause dur="0.3"/> against <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> national identity <pause dur="0.6"/> and <pause dur="0.5"/> it has always been a club <pause dur="0.4"/> whose members are the national states themselves <pause dur="0.5"/> not <pause dur="0.4"/> the individual <pause dur="0.3"/> European citizens and so <pause dur="0.3"/> in a sense it has from the first been an organization <pause dur="0.4"/> which <pause dur="0.2"/> accepts and works within <pause dur="0.4"/> the notion of national identities <pause dur="0.3"/> and 
national states </u><gap reason="break in recording" extent="uncertain"/> <u who="nm1172" trans="pause"> well i've given you two wrong answers <pause dur="0.4"/> so it's about time i gave you at least one <pause dur="0.3"/> correct answer and this correct answer <pause dur="0.6"/> comes in <pause dur="0.4"/> # <trunc>i</trunc> in three parts <pause dur="1.3"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> broadly speaking the correct answer seems to me to be that <pause dur="0.8"/> the true understanding <pause dur="0.2"/> of <pause dur="0.2"/> the <pause dur="0.3"/> origins of the European Union arises <pause dur="1.4"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> <trunc>m</trunc> <pause dur="0.7"/> or can be best understood by looking at the attitudes of individual European states <pause dur="0.7"/> in other words you have to ask <pause dur="0.4"/> why did the French <pause dur="0.4"/> want the European Union why did the Germans want the European Union <pause dur="0.3"/> why did the Italians why did the Belgians why did the Dutch <pause dur="0.3"/> why did the <pause dur="0.6"/> # Luxembourgers now we we can't go through all of those six cases <pause dur="0.3"/> in detail here <pause dur="0.3"/> but my contention is <pause dur="0.3"/> that <pause dur="0.3"/> <trunc>th</trunc> it's in doing that sort of thing <pause dur="0.2"/> in other words in looking at it from specifically national perspectives <pause dur="0.7"/> that you gain a real understanding <pause dur="0.2"/> of how this <pause dur="0.6"/> # international organization this regional organization was actually created <pause dur="0.3"/> now since we haven't got time to do all six <pause dur="0.3"/> we shall do <pause dur="0.6"/> three things we shall say a word about France <pause dur="0.2"/> we shall say a word about 
Germany because those are the two most important powers <pause dur="0.3"/> in the process of creation <pause dur="0.2"/> and then we shall say a brief word about all the others lumped in together </u><gap reason="break in recording" extent="uncertain"/> <u who="nm1172" trans="pause"> # <pause dur="0.2"/> the first word about France is to say <pause dur="0.5"/> that <pause dur="1.6"/> the French <pause dur="1.1"/> in the immediate post-war period <pause dur="1.7"/> had <pause dur="1.8"/> international ambitions <pause dur="0.6"/> above their station <pause dur="0.2"/> if you like <pause dur="0.2"/> they wanted to exert more power in the world <pause dur="1.3"/> than <pause dur="0.4"/> their <pause dur="0.2"/> military and economic position <pause dur="0.5"/> really permitted them to do <pause dur="0.9"/> so they were ambitious in some sense <pause dur="0.9"/> and <pause dur="0.4"/> they saw <pause dur="0.3"/> the creation of the European Union as the first step <pause dur="0.6"/> towards their being able to do that <pause dur="0.5"/> because they were reasonably confident <pause dur="0.7"/> that in the conditions of the nineteen-fifties when the European Union was created <pause dur="0.3"/> they were likely to be <pause dur="0.2"/> one of the leading if not the leading power within the European Union <pause dur="0.5"/> so that for them to create a European <pause dur="0.5"/> # entity <pause dur="0.5"/> which involved some degree of economic and even possibly political integration <pause dur="0.4"/> was <pause dur="0.4"/> understood <pause dur="0.2"/> as an extension of their 
own power <pause dur="0.3"/> rather than placing limitations upon it <pause dur="0.4"/> in other words they had an optimistic interpretation <pause dur="0.3"/> of the degree of power which they could eventually wield within this new <pause dur="0.6"/> regional association <pause dur="0.2"/> and as a consequence <pause dur="0.3"/> they saw <pause dur="0.2"/> the creation of it <pause dur="0.2"/> as an opportunity <pause dur="0.2"/> rather than a threat <pause dur="0.8"/> and we can't give <pause dur="0.7"/> too much of the background to that <pause dur="0.4"/> but <pause dur="0.7"/> that gives you some notion <pause dur="0.4"/> of the ways in which <pause dur="0.2"/> the French saw the creation <pause dur="0.4"/> of an organization which they sought to dominate <pause dur="0.3"/> and to some degree at least <pause dur="0.4"/> did succeed in dominating <pause dur="0.5"/> as an extension of their own national power <pause dur="0.4"/> you can see how this contrasts with <pause dur="0.3"/> the rather different picture that i was painting in my two <pause dur="0.6"/> false answers <pause dur="0.6"/> now the second <pause dur="0.8"/> the second element i suggested <pause dur="0.6"/> we need to say something about Germany <pause dur="0.2"/> and here the picture is more complicated because clearly <pause dur="0.5"/> Germany had the potential to be as powerful if not more powerful <pause dur="0.4"/> a member of the regional association <pause dur="0.4"/> than the French did and therefore you 
would have thought that if the French expected to create an organization which they would dominate <pause dur="0.4"/> then the Germans would have opposed <pause dur="0.3"/> such a development and that would have prevented it from taking place <pause dur="0.4"/> but what made <pause dur="0.2"/> this development possible of course was that Germany had just been defeated <pause dur="0.5"/> in <pause dur="0.4"/> # in the Second World War <pause dur="0.9"/> and those Germans who had <pause dur="0.2"/> held political power <pause dur="0.6"/> in in Germany in the nineteen-fifties <pause dur="0.2"/> felt a profound sense of responsibility and guilt <pause dur="1.0"/> surrounding the circumstances that had led to the Second World War <pause dur="0.6"/> and they sought in a sense therefore <pause dur="0.3"/> somehow to pay the price <pause dur="0.7"/> which they felt as a nation they ought to pay <pause dur="0.5"/> for <pause dur="0.5"/> the damage <pause dur="0.3"/> and the difficulties <pause dur="0.7"/> which <pause dur="0.4"/> Hitler's Germany in the past <pause dur="0.2"/> had caused <pause dur="0.6"/> in a sense therefore they were seeking international rehabilitation <pause dur="0.5"/> they wanted to be readmitted to the club of internationally respectable states <pause dur="0.5"/> and in order to be readmitted <pause dur="0.3"/> they were willing to pay a high price <pause dur="0.6"/> and that was why they were willing <pause dur="0.4"/>

the nineteen-thirties when Germany was growing in power and influence <pause dur="0.3"/> and in the period before nineteen-fourteen and there were <pause dur="0.3"/> faint but nevertheless <pause dur="0.9"/> definite echoes <pause dur="0.4"/> in the reactions of many <pause dur="0.7"/> French and British politicians <pause dur="0.8"/> mostly in private but occasionally in public <pause dur="0.7"/> # to <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> to this <pause dur="0.5"/> reunification <pause dur="0.5"/> and therefore enlargement <pause dur="0.3"/> of the German state <pause dur="0.3"/> so what was the solution to be <pause dur="0.3"/> under those circumstances <pause dur="0.7"/> well <pause dur="0.2"/> the the French thought first of all about trying to prevent it from happening <pause dur="0.6"/> and so did the British <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> but <pause dur="0.4"/> # they couldn't <pause dur="0.8"/> and therefore they decided well we'll have to make the best of it <pause dur="0.5"/> and <pause dur="0.5"/> the best of it seemed <pause dur="0.5"/> # particularly to the French to be well <pause dur="0.5"/> if we're going to <pause dur="0.6"/> # if we're going to harness <pause dur="0.7"/> German power and German ambition in a constructive way and to avoid the problems of rivalry between Germany <pause dur="0.3"/> and other European powers <pause dur="0.2"/> what we need to do is to integrate Germany more tightly <pause dur="0.4"/> into the European Union <pause dur="0.6"/> and as a consequence of that the French <pause dur="0.3"/> 
developed a project which they put to the Germans and which eventually led to the Maastricht Treaty <pause dur="0.3"/> which said okay <pause dur="0.4"/> under these new circumstances <pause dur="0.2"/> we move forward quickly <pause dur="0.9"/> we want <pause dur="0.2"/> national states to be more tightly integrated <pause dur="0.3"/> into this regional association <pause dur="0.2"/> now what do you see there you see exactly the same mechanisms <pause dur="1.0"/> # French ambition <pause dur="0.7"/> French fear of <pause dur="0.2"/> # Germany <pause dur="0.3"/> and a willingness on the part of the Germans <pause dur="0.2"/> to make sacrifices <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> in order <pause dur="0.4"/> to <pause dur="0.5"/> create a new form <pause dur="0.3"/> of <pause dur="0.3"/> regional association <pause dur="0.3"/> because they themselves <pause dur="0.3"/> are fearful <pause dur="0.4"/> of the possible consequences <pause dur="0.3"/> of German nationalism and they like the French <pause dur="0.2"/> want to see Germany tied into <pause dur="0.4"/> a stable <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> international order </u><gap reason="break in recording" extent="uncertain"/> <u who="nm1172" trans="pause"> now <pause dur="0.9"/> that <pause dur="0.2"/> is not exactly the same as the nineteen-fifties <pause dur="0.2"/> but it's a little bit similar to the story that i told you about the creation <pause dur="0.4"/> of the European Union <pause dur="0.7"/> now <pause dur="0.7"/> when i posed the question <pause dur="0.2"/> are things the same now in the nineteen-nineties <pause dur="0.3"/> are the mechanisms of persistence very much the same as the

could find a way of doing it <pause dur="0.6"/> well <pause dur="0.3"/> they <pause dur="0.2"/> they can't find a way of doing it for the time being <pause dur="0.3"/> but they can find a way of doing it partially <pause dur="0.5"/> of creating some degree of stability <pause dur="0.3"/> and that's what the European Monetary Union is partly about <pause dur="0.4"/> so <pause dur="0.3"/> to some degree <pause dur="0.6"/> the spur to more recent European <pause dur="1.1"/> integration <pause dur="0.2"/> has been the search <pause dur="0.2"/> for a mechanism <pause dur="0.3"/> which will allow Europe to enjoy greater currency stability <pause dur="0.8"/> and that is new <pause dur="0.3"/> because the currency stability problem <pause dur="0.2"/> was not a problem <pause dur="0.4"/> at the outset </u><gap reason="break in recording" extent="uncertain"/> <u who="nm1172" trans="pause"> i said that my second question was what sort of an entity <pause dur="0.3"/> is the European Union is it a new state some kind of a superstate with a much extended role <pause dur="4.1"/> and <pause dur="0.7"/> # again i want to begin by <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.9"/> # by <pause dur="0.9"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> giving you some <pause dur="0.3"/> some wrong answers if you like the first wrong <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> well <pause dur="0.9"/> let's let let's just say that the simple answer to this question is no <pause dur="0.7"/> the European Union is a new sort of <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> political organization <pause dur="0.3"/> it's a one-off organization it's not a repeat version <pause dur="0.4"/> of or a replica <pause dur="0.4"/> of 
forms of political organization which have already existed <pause dur="0.3"/> it's an attempt to create something new <pause dur="0.4"/> which is neither a confederation or a federation <pause dur="0.4"/> or an extended national state or a supranational state or an empire <pause dur="0.2"/> or any of the other sorts of political animals <pause dur="0.4"/> # that we're familiar with <pause dur="0.2"/> from earlier history <pause dur="0.8"/> and what makes me say then that it's not <pause dur="1.2"/> it's not a state <pause dur="0.4"/> or even a nascent <pause dur="0.4"/> # national state in any sense <pause dur="0.7"/> the first reason for rejecting the notion of the E-U as a state <pause dur="0.3"/> is that it has no <pause dur="0.5"/> not as yet anyway <pause dur="0.3"/> no significant <pause dur="0.5"/> diplomatic <pause dur="0.5"/> or <pause dur="0.4"/> defence <pause dur="0.3"/> responsibilities <pause dur="0.6"/> as far as the use of <pause dur="0.2"/> force is concerned <pause dur="1.0"/> and as far as the use of international diplomacy as as it were a preliminary to the use of force <pause dur="1.6"/> the form of organization which remains most relevant for the modern world <pause dur="0.5"/> is still <pause dur="0.2"/> the nation state <pause dur="0.7"/> and the E-U <pause dur="0.6"/> the European Union although it has acquired centrally in Brussels <pause dur="1.0"/> powers in a range of policy areas <pause dur="0.2"/> has not yet significantly <pause dur="0.3"/> made any moves <pause dur="0.4"/> 
to acquire <pause dur="0.3"/> genuine authority <pause dur="0.7"/> in matters of diplomacy <pause dur="0.7"/> # and in matter of defence <pause dur="0.3"/> and these are <pause dur="0.5"/> extraordinarily important areas <pause dur="0.3"/> not that there haven't been attempts to do so <pause dur="0.8"/> and occasional very minor successes <pause dur="0.3"/> where concerted action between European powers <pause dur="0.3"/> has emerged <pause dur="0.2"/> but on the whole it's fair <pause dur="0.4"/> as a statement to say <pause dur="0.3"/> that this organization <pause dur="0.4"/> is irrelevant <pause dur="0.5"/> to <pause dur="0.8"/> defence and almost entirely irrelevant <pause dur="0.2"/> to <pause dur="0.2"/> diplomacy <pause dur="1.5"/> the second thing that we need to <trunc>s</trunc> to understand in order to <pause dur="0.8"/> be clear that the E-U is not a state <pause dur="0.6"/> is to say <pause dur="0.4"/> that <pause dur="1.0"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> in most areas it still makes decisions <pause dur="0.2"/> according to what we <pause dur="0.3"/> in politics call the unanimity rule <pause dur="1.0"/> in other words <pause dur="0.4"/> it does not possess <pause dur="0.5"/> any kind of <pause dur="1.0"/> majority <pause dur="0.9"/> or collegial <pause dur="0.2"/> form of decision making <pause dur="0.4"/> the the fundamental form of decision making that operates within the <trunc>u</trunc> E-U <pause dur="0.3"/> in <pause dur="0.2"/> most areas although not admittedly all but in most areas and certainly the most crucial ones <pause dur="0.4"/> is the unanimity rule which is to say <pause dur="0.3"/> that until everybody that is 
to say until all the nation state members of the E-U <pause dur="0.3"/> are agreed <pause dur="0.2"/> on a new initiative <pause dur="0.5"/> that initiative cannot take place <pause dur="0.9"/> this is an extraordinarily <pause dur="0.3"/> cumbersome <pause dur="0.5"/> an extraordinarily conservative principle on which to operate <pause dur="0.5"/> it limits the freedom of manoeuvre of the European Union enormously <pause dur="0.4"/> and of course it is intended to <pause dur="1.0"/> # # and what it means is that <pause dur="0.4"/> the dynamics of the European Union the speed with which it can act <pause dur="0.4"/> the vigour with which it can act are enormously <pause dur="0.4"/> below <pause dur="0.4"/> what is possible <pause dur="0.3"/> within national states <pause dur="0.3"/> where this kind of unanimity principle <pause dur="0.3"/> generally speaking does not apply <pause dur="1.9"/> the third reason <pause dur="0.9"/> for not treating the European Union either as a state or as some kind of state <pause dur="0.4"/> in the process of becoming a state <pause dur="0.5"/> is to point to the question of <pause dur="0.3"/> individual attitudes which i touched on earlier <pause dur="0.5"/> here <pause dur="0.7"/> i think we can say without much doubt that in almost all the member states of the European Union <pause dur="0.8"/> individual citizens look to their own national governments <pause dur="0.2"/> 
principally <pause dur="0.5"/> for the supply of services <pause dur="0.4"/> for the provision of security <pause dur="0.3"/> for all the things that we as individuals look to our political leaders for <pause dur="0.8"/> and in so far as they are aware of the the European Union which they are of course in most cases <pause dur="0.3"/> they understand <pause dur="0.3"/> that it has <pause dur="0.2"/> contact with them <pause dur="0.3"/> which is largely indirect <pause dur="0.3"/> in other words it passes through <pause dur="0.4"/> their national governments <pause dur="0.3"/> the direct contact between the E-U and individual European citizens <pause dur="0.2"/> or citizens of European states <pause dur="0.5"/> is relatively unimportant <pause dur="0.6"/> we don't pay any for example we don't pay any direct taxes <pause dur="0.5"/> to the E-U and the E-U has no mechanisms of its own <pause dur="0.2"/> for collecting taxation <pause dur="0.4"/> all the taxation which the E-U receives <pause dur="0.3"/> is merely passed on to it <pause dur="0.4"/> as a consequence of agreements reached <pause dur="0.3"/> with member states <pause dur="0.3"/> and that makes an enormous difference if you were to say for example <pause dur="0.3"/> to to the American federal government okay <pause dur="0.3"/> you <trunc>d</trunc> you have no longer any power to tax American citizens directly <pause dur="0.2"/> the only revenue which you had 
is revenue which comes to you <pause dur="0.3"/> through agreements that you can reach with the member states <pause dur="0.4"/> New York Texas California whatever <pause dur="0.5"/> you would radically change and radically weaken <pause dur="0.9"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> American federal government <pause dur="0.4"/> and that's the sort of position in which <pause dur="0.5"/> the # <pause dur="0.2"/> E-U has to operate </u><gap reason="break in recording" extent="uncertain"/> <u who="nm1172" trans="pause"> now i said that this second question about what sort of an animal the E-U is would be answered in two parts firstly by <pause dur="0.9"/> asking is it a state <pause dur="0.2"/> and i've answered that by saying no it's not a state <pause dur="0.9"/> # and and certainly not a national state <pause dur="0.7"/> and secondly i said well we want to know who benefits from this <pause dur="0.4"/> in other words <pause dur="0.5"/> in terms of power <pause dur="0.5"/> who has gained and who has lost as a consequence of the <pause dur="2.0"/> creation of a European Union <pause dur="0.9"/> and there are three points that i want to make <pause dur="0.9"/> in answering that question <pause dur="1.7"/> the first is that <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="1.1"/> today <pause dur="0.2"/> strangely in many European countries <pause dur="0.9"/> a lot of the support for the European Union <pause dur="1.5"/> comes from <pause dur="0.2"/> those who are <pause dur="0.4"/> in the centre of politics or even a bit to the left of centre <pause dur="1.0"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> in 
France <pause dur="0.2"/> the French Socialist Party led by Jospin is a strongly European party <pause dur="0.6"/> in the U-K <pause dur="2.0"/> the <pause dur="0.3"/> # Labour Party led by Blair is clearly more sympathetic although <pause dur="0.8"/> we don't know exactly how much more sympathetic <pause dur="0.4"/> but it's clearly more sympathetic to the European Union and British involvement in it <pause dur="0.4"/> than the Conservative Party led by <pause dur="0.2"/> William Hague <pause dur="1.3"/> and therefore in a sense there seems to be <pause dur="0.6"/> # in facts of that sort a suggestion <pause dur="0.4"/> that <pause dur="0.5"/> # <trunc>th</trunc> there is something <trunc>s</trunc> if you like progressive there is something left of centre there is something socially <pause dur="0.4"/> desirable <pause dur="0.3"/> in the European Union <pause dur="0.4"/> and the European Union itself <pause dur="0.4"/> tries through a range of programmes to promote itself <pause dur="0.6"/> in terms of <pause dur="0.6"/> # human rights <pause dur="0.6"/> it it it tries in a sense to sell itself to <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> a left of centre public <pause dur="0.4"/> as a socially progressive entity <pause dur="0.6"/> and some people <pause dur="0.8"/> both in Britain and in France and other European countries <pause dur="0.3"/> on the left <pause dur="0.4"/> who have despaired <pause dur="0.2"/> at the conservative character <pause dur="0.6"/> and the right wing domination of their 
own national politics <pause dur="0.2"/> have looked to the European Union <pause dur="0.3"/> where they think perhaps <pause dur="0.2"/> the centre of gravity in political terms <pause dur="0.3"/> lies a little bit further to the left <pause dur="0.9"/> now <pause dur="0.3"/> my feeling is that this is entirely misguided <pause dur="0.8"/> and <pause dur="0.3"/> that <pause dur="0.4"/> # that <pause dur="0.2"/> if they think that or pretend to think that then they are profoundly mistaken <pause dur="0.8"/> because it seems to me that <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> anybody with left of centre <pause dur="1.8"/> ambitions of any kind <pause dur="0.5"/> must be concerned <pause dur="0.6"/> with the power of the state to act collectively <pause dur="0.3"/> in order to realize collectively agreed goals <pause dur="0.6"/> if you have <pause dur="0.2"/> as you have in the case of the E-U as i've just pointed out <pause dur="0.4"/> a rather weak state <pause dur="0.6"/> which doesn't have the capacity to tax <pause dur="0.2"/> which doesn't have the capacity to spend <pause dur="0.3"/> which doesn't have the capacity to organize new public services <pause dur="0.3"/> directed at particular groups <pause dur="0.6"/> then you don't have the instrument <pause dur="0.4"/> for increased social justice at your disposal <pause dur="0.5"/> and therefore to my mind <pause dur="0.5"/> the first thing that we can say about who benefits and who loses in regard to the European 
Union is <pause dur="0.2"/> that the European Union is not <pause dur="0.3"/> going to be and cannot be in its present form <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> the tool <pause dur="0.3"/> for the realization of greater social justice <pause dur="0.5"/> it's not some kind of <pause dur="0.4"/> substitute <pause dur="0.3"/> for national states that have drifted in a right wing or a conservative direction <pause dur="0.4"/> that's what people would like you <pause dur="0.2"/> <trunc>tho</trunc> those of a pro-European disposition <pause dur="0.3"/> would like you to believe it's what the commissioners <pause dur="0.4"/> # and the members of the European Parliament would like us to believe <pause dur="0.3"/> but it seems to me to be <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> to be to be wrong <pause dur="0.3"/> because the European Union <pause dur="0.2"/> as an administrative as a political instrument <pause dur="0.3"/> doesn't possess the the authority or the power <pause dur="0.4"/> or the competence <pause dur="0.2"/> to do that sort of thing <pause dur="0.5"/> my second point of the three that i want to make here <pause dur="3.3"/> is that <pause dur="0.2"/> the E-U <pause dur="0.4"/> presents itself <pause dur="1.9"/> in wishing to appeal to a more right of centre <pause dur="0.3"/> public <pause dur="0.7"/> as an entity capable <pause dur="0.8"/> of enlarging the sphere of market exchange in other words it <pause dur="0.2"/> it presents itself <pause dur="0.5"/> as an entity capable <pause dur="0.4"/> of creating more free trade <pause dur="0.4"/> more free movement of 
labour more free movement of capital <pause dur="0.4"/> and through that <pause dur="0.4"/> creating increased prosperity <pause dur="1.2"/> and this seems to me to be a valid claim <pause dur="1.4"/> in other words if you believe <pause dur="0.6"/> that <pause dur="0.4"/> what Europe needs <pause dur="0.5"/> are larger <pause dur="0.4"/> and freer markets and that there are important advantages to be gained <pause dur="0.3"/> from breaking down existing barriers <pause dur="0.6"/> to the operation <pause dur="0.2"/> of <pause dur="0.4"/> large and competitive markets <pause dur="0.8"/> and if you believe that you or the groups with whom <trunc>wi</trunc> with whom you identify are going to benefit from a process of that kind <pause dur="0.3"/> then the E-U is on your side <pause dur="1.0"/> now of course <pause dur="1.0"/> there are all sorts of controversies about who benefits and how much <pause dur="0.5"/> from the growth <pause dur="0.3"/> in the operation of free markets <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> and and i don't want to enter into those <pause dur="0.3"/> but <pause dur="0.3"/> what i will say is that <pause dur="0.4"/> if you <pause dur="0.2"/> are <pause dur="0.2"/> <trunc>i</trunc> as it were generally pro-market <pause dur="0.2"/> in your dispositions <pause dur="0.3"/> then the E-U is for you <pause dur="0.5"/> and if you fear markets and wish to see them regulated <pause dur="0.2"/> and controlled <pause dur="0.2"/> and believe that only social <pause dur="0.2"/> that social justice can in certain important respects <pause dur="0.4"/> only 
be realized <pause dur="0.5"/> # through the use of regulatory powers of various sorts and in the use of taxation for redistributive purposes <pause dur="0.3"/> then the E-U is not going to help <pause dur="0.2"/> it might not necessarily stand in your way <pause dur="0.3"/> but it's not actually going to help you very much <pause dur="0.4"/> in in that particular <pause dur="1.1"/> battle <pause dur="0.4"/> the third point that i want to make about the E-U is that the E-U is on the whole bad news <pause dur="0.2"/> for the Third World <pause dur="1.3"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> because <pause dur="0.3"/> what the E-U has done above all things <pause dur="0.3"/> during its long period of operation is to subsidize <pause dur="0.3"/> the creation of an excessive amount of food in Europe <pause dur="0.3"/> for which it pays <pause dur="0.7"/> farmers <pause dur="0.3"/> well above market prices <pause dur="0.4"/> having bought this food from farmers it doesn't know what to do with it <pause dur="0.7"/> and what it then generally does is to dump it at way below market prices <pause dur="0.2"/> in the Third World <pause dur="0.3"/> where it disrupts <pause dur="0.7"/> the the domestic markets of those Third World producers <pause dur="0.3"/> and has very bad consequences <pause dur="0.3"/> on Third World food production <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> so <pause dur="0.5"/> <trunc>i</trunc> it looks to me <pause dur="0.7"/> like a relatively conservative organization <pause dur="0.2"/> let's put it

distance between E-U purposes <pause dur="0.3"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> British purposes <pause dur="1.3"/> the second point i want to make <pause dur="0.2"/> is # more specifically about the Labour Party <pause dur="0.3"/> and that is that for most of the history of the E-U <pause dur="0.4"/> that is to say during the period between <pause dur="0.8"/> nineteen-fifty-eight <pause dur="0.3"/> and <pause dur="0.8"/> i suppose about the mid-nineteen-eighties <pause dur="0.3"/> the British Labour Party was quite strongly opposed <pause dur="1.0"/> or many elements in it <pause dur="0.2"/> the party was often divided but there were significant elements within the Labour Party <pause dur="0.3"/> that were quite strongly opposed <pause dur="0.4"/> to Britain's joining the European Union and to any further integration of the British <pause dur="0.6"/> state within that <pause dur="0.2"/> union <pause dur="1.2"/> and <pause dur="1.7"/> # for much of that time one could have quite fairly said that the Conservative Party was the pro-European party <pause dur="0.4"/> and the Labour Party or <trunc>l</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> a large part of it <pause dur="0.3"/> was <trunc>s</trunc> was significantly anti-European <pause dur="0.8"/> the position is now the opposite of that <pause dur="0.3"/> the Labour Party pretends to be <pause dur="0.2"/> pro-European <pause dur="0.3"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> the Conservative Party is probably genuinely <pause dur="0.4"/> # anti-European <pause dur="0.5"/> but this 
conversion of the Labour Party is quite recent <pause dur="0.4"/> and to a very large degree opportunistic <pause dur="1.4"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> when i say opportunistic what i mean by that is <pause dur="0.4"/> that <pause dur="0.6"/> having <pause dur="0.4"/> suffered <pause dur="0.5"/> a succession of very serious <pause dur="0.5"/> electoral defeats within the U-K <pause dur="0.4"/> the Labour Party felt <pause dur="0.5"/> that <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> # there was advantage for the left advantage for the trade union movement advantage <pause dur="0.4"/> # for left of centre causes <pause dur="0.3"/> in trying to associate Britain <pause dur="0.5"/> with an entity where <pause dur="0.3"/> at least the centre of gravity politically seemed a little further to the left <pause dur="0.3"/> than it was <pause dur="0.3"/> in a Britain dominated by Mrs Thatcher and her Conservative Party <pause dur="0.6"/> so in a sense <pause dur="1.0"/> the attachment of the Labour Party to the European ideal seems to me to be very largely built <pause dur="0.3"/> on this opportunistic <pause dur="0.3"/> response <pause dur="0.3"/> to their weakness and their difficulties <pause dur="0.2"/> within a <pause dur="0.2"/> domestic <pause dur="0.5"/> arena <pause dur="4.5"/> you might say <pause dur="0.2"/> well okay but <pause dur="0.2"/> you know opportunism is <pause dur="0.8"/> not to be discounted <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> it's the basis for many important political initiatives and # if the Labour Party is European for <pause dur="0.3"/> what are <pause dur="0.3"/>

then those divergencies can persist <pause dur="0.3"/> and it seems to me therefore that the basic answer is <pause dur="0.3"/> yes it is possible to have a monetary union <pause dur="0.3"/> without having a political union there seem to me to be a wide range of policies <pause dur="0.3"/> that can still be pursued <pause dur="0.3"/> distinctively at the national level <pause dur="0.4"/> whilst <pause dur="0.3"/> everyone agrees that <pause dur="0.3"/> everything that is necessary to protect the value of the newly created currency <pause dur="0.3"/> is done </u> <pause dur="3.2"/> <u who="nm1174" trans="pause"> one more question </u><u who="nm1172" trans="overlap"> that's a difficult question </u><gap reason="break in recording" extent="uncertain"/> <u who="sm1173" trans="pause"> how do you see the future of the European Union </u><pause dur="0.9"/> <u who="nm1172" trans="pause"> <trunc>h</trunc> how do i see the future of the European </u><u who="sm1173" trans="overlap"> # i mean in terms of joining <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> remaining countries after in Europe </u><pause dur="1.3"/> <u who="nm1172" trans="pause"> <trunc>cou</trunc> could you <unclear>just repeat</unclear> the <trunc>la</trunc> the last bit <pause dur="0.2"/> i got the future but <trunc>wha</trunc> in terms of what did you say </u><pause dur="0.2"/> <u who="sm1173" trans="pause"> the remaining countries after Europe # # to get joining in the European Union <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/></u><pause dur="0.4"/> <u who="nm1172" trans="pause"> did you get </u><u who="nm1174" trans="overlap"> expansion </u><pause dur="0.5"/> <u who="nm1172" trans="pause"> expansion </u><u who="nm1174" trans="latching"> yeah </u> <u who="nm1172" trans="latching"> ah expansion expansion eastward <pause dur="0.7"/> ah okay <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="1.3"/> i'm not sure
