<u who="nf1336"> # our topic this morning is # collaborative learning <pause dur="0.7"/> now <pause dur="0.7"/> the reason that we have this session is actually because a few years ago i think it was four years ago <pause dur="0.7"/> students on the M-A course actually suggested <pause dur="0.6"/> that we do this session at the beginning of the year <pause dur="0.9"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> we were talking about collaborative work <pause dur="0.3"/> and i was using it a lot in my classes <pause dur="0.4"/> and i was doing some research some study of collaborative work <pause dur="0.4"/> and i gave a talk at the end of the year to which M-A students were invited <pause dur="0.4"/> and they said at the end of that talk <pause dur="0.6"/> we think you should do a talk like that at the beginning <pause dur="0.2"/> of the year so that people become aware <pause dur="0.3"/> of the issues in collaborative work <pause dur="0.3"/> because a lot of the tutors <pause dur="0.2"/> use it in their classes <pause dur="0.3"/> and you may well have experienced it already <pause dur="0.4"/> perhaps tutors have asked you to sit together <pause dur="0.3"/> in a small group or to prepare something together out of class <pause dur="0.3"/> in <pause dur="0.2"/> a group <pause dur="0.8"/> # so that's really my role this afternoon i'm acting as a kind of intermediary <pause dur="0.4"/> 
between previous students <pause dur="0.2"/> and yourselves to pass on <pause dur="0.3"/> some of their thoughts about <pause dur="0.2"/> collaborative work <pause dur="0.2"/> okay <pause dur="0.5"/> i think it would probably be a good idea <pause dur="0.3"/> just to explain <pause dur="0.4"/> what i mean by collaborative work because it can take many shapes and forms <pause dur="0.6"/> it can be fairly straightforward and simple <pause dur="0.5"/> # in other words <pause dur="0.2"/> a short <pause dur="0.6"/> # group discussion task <pause dur="0.3"/> # during class time <pause dur="0.3"/> just to give you a quick example and i'm taking the examples <pause dur="0.3"/><kinesic desc="puts on transparency" iterated="n"/> from my own classes <pause dur="0.3"/> one that i've often used with teachers <pause dur="0.3"/> # which i used <pause dur="0.2"/> many years ago when i was working with <pause dur="0.3"/> <gap reason="name" extent="2 words"/> which is why his name is there <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> it was at the beginning of a psychology course and we asked teachers to think <pause dur="0.4"/> about <pause dur="0.2"/> the sorts of <pause dur="0.6"/> opinions or assumptions that they had about learning <pause dur="0.5"/> and we gave them some <pause dur="0.2"/> to think about okay <pause dur="0.5"/> # these are statements <pause dur="0.2"/> about language learning in the English language classroom <pause dur="0.6"/> and we wanted the teachers first to look at it together <pause dur="0.7"/> and then to compare their 
opinions with those of colleagues in a small group <pause dur="0.5"/> now that task usually took <pause dur="0.4"/> # fifteen to twenty minutes and then there was a plenary <pause dur="0.2"/> afterwards <pause dur="0.3"/> and students tended to be grouped <pause dur="0.2"/> as they were sitting <pause dur="0.3"/> in the classroom and that's probably happened to you <pause dur="0.3"/> already just turn to the few people around you <pause dur="0.3"/> and talk about the particular <pause dur="0.3"/> topic <pause dur="0.3"/> and exchange opinions <pause dur="0.4"/> so that's a fairly short simple <pause dur="0.3"/> example of collaborative work <pause dur="0.4"/> <kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="8"/> but then i think you'll find during the year <pause dur="0.3"/> that there will be more <pause dur="0.3"/> complex and longer <pause dur="0.4"/> tasks which you're asked to do <pause dur="0.3"/> this is another one <pause dur="0.6"/> # and this takes about an hour <pause dur="0.3"/> in the classroom <pause dur="0.4"/> and it's from the topic of extensive reading the idea of setting up <pause dur="0.3"/> a class library <pause dur="0.3"/> of reading material for learners <pause dur="0.5"/> # and you can see <pause dur="0.3"/> that it it's a task that will take quite some time <pause dur="0.3"/> because the teachers are going to select <pause dur="0.2"/> a set of readers <pause dur="0.2"/> that they think would be useful <pause dur="0.2"/> for their classes <pause dur="0.4"/> so we take 
into the classroom a huge pile of graded readers <pause dur="0.4"/> ask students to work in groups of four or five <pause dur="0.3"/> and together <pause dur="0.3"/> sort through <pause dur="0.3"/> and decide what they would choose and as they do that <pause dur="0.3"/> think what criteria <pause dur="0.2"/> they are using <pause dur="0.3"/> to make those decisions <pause dur="0.3"/> so at the end of the task <pause dur="0.3"/> they will have <pause dur="0.2"/> a set of criteria <pause dur="0.2"/> for selecting reading material for learners <pause dur="0.4"/> and then we ask them to <pause dur="0.2"/> prioritize <pause dur="0.2"/> the criteria <pause dur="0.6"/> # i think you can appreciate that in asking a group of teachers to do that <pause dur="0.5"/> it gives plenty of time for them to reflect <pause dur="0.6"/> to make sense <pause dur="0.3"/> of this to use their experience to use their own opinions <pause dur="0.3"/> and perceptions <pause dur="0.3"/> and it's likely to be far more effective <pause dur="0.4"/> than somebody just standing up and saying <pause dur="0.3"/> this is a useful list of criteria <pause dur="0.2"/> for selecting <pause dur="0.3"/> reading material in the classroom <pause dur="0.5"/> # it's what some people call <pause dur="0.4"/> deep <pause dur="0.2"/> learning because you become involved <pause dur="0.4"/> in the topic in the task <pause dur="0.3"/> # and you learn by applying <pause dur="0.3"/> your own knowledge your own experience as it were <pause dur="0.5"/> so those are just two 
examples <pause dur="0.4"/><event desc="turns off overhead projector" iterated="n"/> but there is also more complex <pause dur="0.3"/> still <pause dur="0.3"/> # types of collaborative <pause dur="0.2"/> learning <pause dur="0.8"/> sometimes you may be asked to work with a group of two or three other students to prepare a presentation <pause dur="0.4"/> of an article <pause dur="0.3"/> on a particular topic that the class is looking at <pause dur="0.4"/> and you will need to work together outside the classroom <pause dur="0.3"/> to decide how you're going to organize the presentation <pause dur="0.4"/> who's going to talk about what <pause dur="0.4"/> and and you will need to build a relationship a rapport with your colleagues in order to do that <pause dur="0.3"/> successfully <pause dur="0.7"/> and later on in the year in the professional practice courses certainly in mine and i think in <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/>'s <pause dur="0.2"/> i don't know <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/>'s so well <pause dur="0.5"/> but <pause dur="0.3"/> you will be asked to form # what we call a design syndicate <pause dur="0.4"/> because part of the purpose of the professional practice courses <pause dur="0.3"/> is that you design materials <pause dur="0.2"/> and you learn through the process of designing them <pause dur="0.6"/> and quite a lot of that design will go on outside <pause dur="0.4"/> the classroom <pause dur="0.5"/> and you will be given the opportunity to work with 
who you wish to work with <pause dur="0.3"/> but with the tutor's help if you need help <pause dur="0.3"/> but by that time you probably have got to know people <pause dur="0.3"/> and will know who you might work successfully with <pause dur="0.6"/> and again in groups of four or five <pause dur="0.3"/> you will be asked to design <pause dur="0.2"/> a particular kind of material <pause dur="0.3"/> and then come back to the next week's class and present it <pause dur="0.3"/> to your colleagues who will evaluate it <pause dur="0.3"/> critically <pause dur="0.4"/> # and give comments and opinions and so on <pause dur="0.3"/> as feedback <pause dur="0.4"/> to your work <pause dur="0.7"/> # and as i said a lot of that work will go on <pause dur="0.3"/> outside the classroom so it will be your responsibility <pause dur="0.3"/> to get together <pause dur="0.3"/> to organize yourselves <pause dur="0.3"/> and and to work successfully <pause dur="0.3"/> together <pause dur="0.7"/> now <pause dur="0.6"/> there are obviously <pause dur="0.4"/> great advantages i say obviously i hope it's obvious to you as teachers <pause dur="0.5"/> that there are great advantages <pause dur="0.3"/> in working collaboratively <pause dur="0.6"/> <event desc="puts on transparency" iterated="n"/> # i have to say that this summer <pause dur="0.4"/> # i have been doing a small-scale research study <pause dur="0.3"/> with last year's M-A students before 
they went home <pause dur="0.5"/> and it involved interviewing <pause dur="0.5"/> # teachers who were on the course last year <pause dur="0.4"/> the topic of the study was actually about <pause dur="0.4"/> the ways in which they felt the course had helped them to develop <pause dur="0.4"/> as teachers as creative <pause dur="0.3"/> as autonomous as resourceful <pause dur="0.2"/> teachers <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> and i interviewed about twenty-two <pause dur="0.3"/> of the teachers from last year and i was very <pause dur="0.3"/> pleased to hear that they <pause dur="0.2"/> all but one <pause dur="0.4"/> # felt that they had <pause dur="0.4"/> developed <trunc>con</trunc> substantially <pause dur="0.3"/> # in terms of their their teaching their creativity and so on <pause dur="0.9"/> and when i asked them what in particular <pause dur="0.4"/> had helped them to develop <pause dur="0.7"/> i was i was quite surprised actually <pause dur="0.4"/> but without <trunc>excepti</trunc> well <trunc>w</trunc> with the exception of one <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> they all said <pause dur="0.7"/> that the main <pause dur="0.4"/> prompt <pause dur="0.9"/> towards their development was working with other teachers <pause dur="0.2"/> in the group in the different kinds of collaborative work <pause dur="0.4"/> that they had been doing <pause dur="0.3"/> during the year that they had learned a very great deal <pause dur="0.5"/> not just from the reading not just from the tutors the input <pause dur="0.3"/> but from working with 
other people <pause dur="0.2"/> sharing ideas <pause dur="0.3"/> and learning that people all round the world have the same kinds of problems and issues <pause dur="0.2"/> in the English language classroom <pause dur="0.3"/> and have found lots of ideas for resolving them <pause dur="0.3"/> so it was sharing of that kind <pause dur="0.4"/> that they felt particularly useful <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> here are some quotations <pause dur="0.2"/> from teachers <pause dur="1.4"/><kinesic desc="turns on overhead projector showing transparency" iterated="n"/> <reading>i found <pause dur="0.3"/> that this collaborative work really helped me <pause dur="0.3"/> in finding solutions to problems which i couldn't find entirely <pause dur="0.3"/> from my own experience <pause dur="0.3"/> or from the theory i had learned</reading> <pause dur="0.6"/> okay <pause dur="1.4"/><kinesic desc="reveals covered part of transparency" iterated="n"/> here's another one <pause dur="0.5"/> # and this was # a teacher who was also a teacher trainer <pause dur="0.4"/> okay <pause dur="0.6"/> so <pause dur="0.3"/> she said <reading>i think in a teachers' workshop such a method is indispensable <pause dur="0.4"/> and i would surely apply it <pause dur="0.5"/> to get teachers feeling they are part of the learning <pause dur="0.4"/> to draw from their experience <pause dur="0.2"/> and knowledge</reading> <pause dur="1.1"/><kinesic desc="reveals covered part of transparency" iterated="n"/> here's another one <pause dur="1.1"/> <reading>working in a group <pause dur="0.4"/> sharing my opinion with others was instructive i learned a lot <pause dur="0.3"/> 
from my colleagues</reading> <pause dur="1.0"/><kinesic desc="reveals covered part of transparency" iterated="n"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> this was an interesting one <pause dur="0.6"/> <reading>i should try to work with someone i don't like <pause dur="0.9"/><vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" n="ss" dur="1"/> this is important to me as a teacher trainer <pause dur="0.3"/> who has to work together sometimes with someone i don't like</reading> <vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" n="ss" dur="1"/> i think that was a very sensible <pause dur="0.3"/> approach to take <pause dur="0.4"/><kinesic desc="reveals covered part of transparency" iterated="n"/> and this one i found very interesting he was a university lecturer from India <pause dur="0.8"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> he was somebody who was a bit irritated by group work but nevertheless <pause dur="0.2"/> felt that it was important look what he says <pause dur="0.7"/> <reading>group work i sometimes felt to be irritating and so polarized <pause dur="0.3"/> so much time is spent before intersubjectivity is achieved <pause dur="0.3"/> and discussion seems to progress <pause dur="0.5"/> so often <pause dur="0.3"/> i've been tempted to chip in <pause dur="0.4"/> and to direct the discussions the way i think <pause dur="0.2"/> is right <pause dur="0.4"/> but group work is a cooperative process that necessarily <pause dur="0.2"/> involves a warming-up period <pause dur="0.5"/> and interpersonal skills <pause dur="0.3"/> i shan't push the river</reading> <pause dur="0.2"/> that's a very nice metaphor <pause dur="0.4"/> 
i shan't push the river <pause dur="0.4"/> <reading>it makes me realize what i ask of my students <pause dur="0.2"/> in discussion</reading> <pause dur="0.5"/> because it is standard practice now in many parts of the world <pause dur="0.3"/> to get students in the language learning classroom <pause dur="0.3"/> to work together <pause dur="0.3"/> so when you experience it as a teacher <pause dur="0.3"/> it can be quite a salutary <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> # experience <pause dur="0.6"/> so there are very positive things that teachers <event desc="takes off transparency" iterated="n"/> report on <pause dur="0.6"/> but of course group work <pause dur="0.8"/> has <pause dur="0.6"/> implicit in it <pause dur="0.4"/> quite a lot of potential <pause dur="0.2"/> problems and issues <pause dur="0.4"/> # <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> <pause dur="0.3"/> that # teacher <pause dur="0.3"/> said it can be very irritating <pause dur="0.3"/> and sometimes he wanted to direct it <pause dur="0.4"/> # in his own way <pause dur="0.7"/> # i remember reading an article in the Higher Education Journal a British journal <pause dur="0.5"/> # and it was about collaborative learning on undergraduate courses <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> where students had to work in a team for six months <pause dur="0.2"/> and produce materials and give presentations <pause dur="0.4"/> and some of the students were interviewed <pause dur="0.4"/> about what they had learned from that 
experience <pause dur="0.3"/> and i always remember one of them said <pause dur="0.8"/> i learned how not to do murder <pause dur="0.5"/> just <pause dur="0.7"/><vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" n="ss" dur="2"/> # and that that was really her main reaction it had been so difficult and so painful at times she wanted to murder <pause dur="0.4"/><vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" n="ss" dur="1"/> her colleagues <pause dur="0.4"/> # and i remember a course i ran some years ago <pause dur="0.3"/> it was a diploma course a practical diploma course <pause dur="0.3"/> where teachers were practising teaching together <pause dur="0.3"/> and i had a party at home and invited everybody home <pause dur="0.4"/> and i said to one of them Caroline i said <pause dur="0.4"/> i'm very impressed about the way <pause dur="0.2"/> the group has got together this year everybody seems to be getting on it's gelled very well <pause dur="0.4"/> and there's been none of the usual screaming and shouting that you get before that happens <pause dur="0.3"/> and she said <pause dur="0.5"/> oh <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> there was plenty of screaming and shouting going on <pause dur="0.2"/> but it was in our heads <vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" n="ss" dur="2"/> right <pause dur="0.7"/> so <pause dur="0.7"/> what students from previous years really want me to pass on to you <pause dur="0.5"/> are some of the issues that arise in 
group work <pause dur="0.4"/> things to think about when you find yourself working in a group <pause dur="0.4"/> with other people on the course <pause dur="0.6"/> i'm going to give you an example <pause dur="0.4"/> # of one oh i in <trunc>f</trunc> fact it's in your handout <pause dur="0.2"/> on pages two and three <pause dur="0.6"/> you'll find an example <pause dur="0.3"/> of some group work going on <pause dur="0.3"/> and this was on this M-A course # <pause dur="0.3"/> a couple of years back <pause dur="1.0"/> if you have a look at page two <pause dur="0.5"/> # oh sorry i haven't <vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" n="ss" dur="2"/> given them out <pause dur="1.7"/> okay <pause dur="0.3"/> if you have a look at pages two and three <pause dur="0.4"/> you'll find that one <event desc="passes out handouts" iterated="n"/> </u><gap reason="break in recording" extent="uncertain"/> <u who="nf1336" trans="pause"> now as i said this is a transcript <pause dur="0.5"/> from <pause dur="1.9"/> a group discussion <pause dur="0.6"/> a few years ago <pause dur="2.1"/> and it's right at the beginning <pause dur="0.6"/> of the professional practice course <pause dur="3.9"/> and the task that students have been given <pause dur="0.5"/> is a design task so they're working in what we call design syndicates <pause dur="0.6"/> # and as you can see in this group there were five people <pause dur="0.6"/> <vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/> and it was a multicultural group <pause dur="0.6"/> <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> <pause dur="0.3"/> <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> <pause dur="0.4"/> <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> <pause dur="0.4"/> and <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> <pause dur="0.8"/> from different countries <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.8"/> all European countries in this in this group <pause dur="0.2"/> in fact <pause dur="0.8"/> and what they were doing <pause dur="0.3"/> was designing <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> a presessional course <pause dur="0.8"/> we chose a 
presessional course because some of them had experience of that <pause dur="0.6"/> # and could inform the group <pause dur="0.3"/> but we wanted <pause dur="0.3"/> a course that <pause dur="0.3"/> everybody could think about not a course that would be specific to any particular country <pause dur="0.7"/> and this is how they started off on the discussion <pause dur="0.3"/> because they were looking <pause dur="0.4"/> at the scores the IELT scores <pause dur="0.3"/> that the group of students had it was a simulation so they had information <pause dur="0.3"/> about a group of students their IELT scores <pause dur="0.3"/> their needs for the future and so on <pause dur="0.5"/> and they just started off trying to talk <pause dur="0.3"/> about the information that they had <pause dur="0.8"/> now <pause dur="0.2"/> if you take time to read this at length <pause dur="0.3"/> you will find that it's rather a nervous <pause dur="0.3"/> discussion <pause dur="0.8"/> because the group <pause dur="0.2"/> was in <pause dur="0.2"/> the very early stages of forming <pause dur="0.4"/> what we know <pause dur="0.4"/><kinesic desc="turns on overhead projector showing transparency" iterated="n"/> from a lot of research into <pause dur="0.4"/> groups and group development <pause dur="0.3"/> is that they usually go through four stages and this is something worth thinking about <pause dur="0.5"/> what we have here is an 
example <pause dur="0.3"/> of stage one <pause dur="0.5"/> which is usually called forming <pause dur="1.1"/> that's a nice set of words here because they're <pause dur="0.3"/> four verbs <pause dur="0.2"/> # which rhyme <pause dur="0.7"/> forming storming norming and performing <pause dur="0.8"/> and at the forming stage <pause dur="0.2"/> you can imagine it i think people are sort of <pause dur="0.3"/> eyeing each other up <pause dur="0.4"/> wondering what they're like <pause dur="0.4"/> wondering who's going to become dominant who's going to want to lead the group <pause dur="0.6"/> # who's going to be silent why are they silent <pause dur="0.4"/> # how they're going to manage to get on with people who's going to do the work who might not do the work and so on <pause dur="0.4"/> so it's a kind of <pause dur="0.2"/> edgy <pause dur="0.2"/> nervous getting to know people <pause dur="0.3"/> as the group <pause dur="0.3"/> forms <pause dur="0.4"/> and you need a bit of time <pause dur="0.2"/> to get through <pause dur="0.2"/> that stage <pause dur="0.4"/> and then we have <pause dur="0.2"/> storming <pause dur="0.4"/> you can imagine from the word <pause dur="0.3"/> what that involves very often <pause dur="0.3"/> you then get a difficult stage <pause dur="0.3"/> where people start clashing <pause dur="0.3"/> personalities clash <pause dur="0.5"/> or aims clash <pause dur="0.5"/> or people clash because they <pause dur="0.2"/> they each want to control the group <pause dur="0.3"/> you've got two strong personalities who want to be the chair <pause dur="0.2"/> and direct 
everything <pause dur="0.6"/> so you get that stage of storming <pause dur="0.4"/> and then gradually <pause dur="0.5"/> the group will <pause dur="0.4"/> work out <pause dur="0.3"/> its routines its procedures <pause dur="0.2"/> if they're going to rotate the chair <pause dur="0.2"/> how are they going to function together <pause dur="0.3"/> and will reach the stage of <pause dur="0.3"/> norming <pause dur="0.2"/> they've sorted it out <pause dur="0.5"/> and after <pause dur="0.2"/> they have <pause dur="0.3"/> normed they will be able to perform <pause dur="0.3"/> effectively <pause dur="0.3"/> now bear that in mind <pause dur="0.4"/> if you're in a design syndicate <pause dur="0.2"/> next term <pause dur="0.3"/> you need probably to go through <pause dur="0.3"/> those stages you need to be aware <pause dur="0.4"/> that that that's normal <pause dur="0.7"/> and and you don't need to get worried <pause dur="0.3"/> about the storming phase because normally it will sort itself out <pause dur="0.3"/> and things will fall into place and routines <pause dur="0.3"/> will form <pause dur="0.6"/> now <pause dur="0.2"/> i've given you that # <pause dur="0.5"/> transcript <pause dur="0.4"/> in your handout but let me show you <pause dur="0.3"/> what i discovered because i think it illustrates this and it shows some of the issues <pause dur="0.5"/> because <pause dur="0.2"/> while the groups were working <pause dur="0.4"/> i asked them to write diaries about what was going on <pause dur="0.6"/> some of them wrote things down as they were actually working in the group every 
so often <pause dur="0.3"/> they stopped and wrote something in their diary <pause dur="0.3"/> and some of them wrote diaries afterwards immediately afterwards <pause dur="0.2"/> so i was able to take things from the diaries <pause dur="0.5"/> and <pause dur="0.3"/> relate them to what was going on <pause dur="0.2"/> in the group and it was <kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="4"/> really very very interesting let me show you some of the things <pause dur="0.3"/> so here we have <pause dur="0.5"/> the transcript <pause dur="0.8"/> and this is what they wrote in their diaries <pause dur="0.3"/> here's one <pause dur="0.7"/> <reading>i don't like to work in a group with her <pause dur="0.6"/> she's too straightforward in expressing her ideas <pause dur="0.2"/> opinions <pause dur="0.3"/> and rude in rejecting other people's opinions</reading> <pause dur="0.4"/> <vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" n="ss" dur="1"/> right <pause dur="0.9"/> or this one <pause dur="0.6"/> <reading>i cannot progress at my own pace but at the pace of the group <pause dur="0.4"/> one member had to beg for explanations as she could not follow</reading> <pause dur="0.7"/> right <pause dur="0.3"/> perhaps some of you will recognize these feelings <pause dur="0.3"/> from when you've been working in groups <pause dur="0.6"/> <reading>pity we're all saying the same thing and don't realize it</reading> <pause dur="1.5"/><vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" n="ss" dur="1"/> <reading>i tried to butt in several times and repeat my

queries <pause dur="0.5"/> # and he asked a question <pause dur="0.3"/> and Winston just opened his mouth to start answering and <pause dur="0.2"/> this teacher Matthew said no no wait i've got another question <pause dur="0.9"/> # and people looked a bit shocked but Matthew just ploughed on and and asked another question <pause dur="0.5"/> and Winston waited till he finished and <pause dur="0.3"/> just started to speak and <trunc>m</trunc> no i haven't finished yet i've got another question <pause dur="0.9"/> <vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" n="ss" dur="1"/> and he actually went through five questions by which time Winston had <pause dur="0.2"/> got his notebook out <pause dur="0.3"/> and was <vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" n="ss" dur="1"/> jotting then down <pause dur="0.6"/> now <pause dur="0.5"/> that was actually very fortunate because after it had happened <pause dur="0.4"/> one of the students in the group who was quite direct said to Matthew <pause dur="0.6"/> is that the way you do things in your country <pause dur="0.3"/> and he looked very surprised and said well <pause dur="0.6"/> well yes what's the problem <pause dur="0.6"/> <vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" n="ss" dur="1"/> and and the other people said well <pause dur="0.6"/> we wouldn't do it like that in my culture you know <trunc>pe</trunc> people might get a bit offended and it's difficult to 
remember all the questions <pause dur="0.4"/> so we were able to move into <pause dur="0.2"/> a useful discussion <pause dur="0.5"/> about cultural differences <pause dur="0.2"/> in the group <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> all sorts of things like <pause dur="0.8"/> what are the polite ways in # a British context or in a multicultural setting <pause dur="0.4"/> to <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> get your way into a conversation if there's # a seminar discussion going on <pause dur="0.3"/> and you want to say something <pause dur="0.3"/> what are the ways in which it's acceptable <pause dur="0.2"/> to do it <pause dur="0.2"/> that won't offend other people <pause dur="0.5"/> do you just butt in <pause dur="0.4"/> and and speak over another person <pause dur="0.4"/> or <pause dur="0.4"/> well what are the ways what strategies would you use <pause dur="0.3"/> if somebody's talking perhaps you think they've been talking too much and you want to say something <pause dur="0.3"/> and there's a group of eight of you sitting around <pause dur="0.3"/> what would you do to get into the conversation </u><pause dur="1.2"/> <u who="ss" trans="pause"> excuse me </u><u who="nf1336" trans="overlap"> excuse me so you would use verbal excuse me <pause dur="0.3"/> and then you'd try to say something what

class <pause dur="0.4"/> is it because their car broke down on the way to work and they're worried about what it's going to cost <pause dur="0.3"/> to fix it <pause dur="0.6"/> right is it because they were cruel to their cat and they're feeling guilty <pause dur="0.4"/><vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" n="ss" dur="1"/> i mean there could be lots and lots of reasons why people are silent in class <pause dur="0.3"/> what is the significance of silence <pause dur="0.3"/> and if somebody is silent <pause dur="0.4"/> what can you do <pause dur="0.2"/> as another member <pause dur="0.2"/> of the group to perhaps <pause dur="0.3"/> draw them <pause dur="0.3"/> in <pause dur="0.4"/> okay <pause dur="0.4"/><kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="3"/> so there are lots of things going on in groups <pause dur="0.3"/> some of them we may be aware of some of them we may not be <pause dur="0.7"/> when i analysed all the diaries i found that the things <pause dur="0.3"/> teachers were particularly concerned about <pause dur="0.4"/> were these i've just built some categories <pause dur="0.4"/> # and these are there in in the handout for you <pause dur="1.9"/> interpretation <pause dur="0.9"/> you are given a task by a tutor <pause dur="1.3"/> and sometimes people get <pause dur="0.4"/> # different impressions of what they're supposed to do <pause dur="0.5"/> and it's always worth spending the first few minutes of the say half-hour that you've got <pause dur="0.3"/> to do the task <pause dur="0.4"/> just talking through what it is you're supposed to do if 
somebody says okay what are we doing <pause dur="0.6"/> # how are we going to tackle this <pause dur="0.4"/> so that you're sharing interpretations <pause dur="0.2"/> of the task <pause dur="0.4"/> # and especially if you're working by yourselves out of class <pause dur="0.2"/> it's very useful if somebody <pause dur="0.3"/> takes on that role and says okay <pause dur="0.4"/> <trunc>w</trunc> what are we doing <pause dur="0.3"/> # and how are we going to go about doing it <pause dur="0.6"/> which <trunc>d</trunc> which leads us on to procedures <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="1.0"/> the need for some organized constructive <pause dur="0.2"/> approach <pause dur="0.5"/> # and somebody here comments on <reading>it took a long time to form the group <pause dur="0.5"/> to clear the backgrounds to find a way of working <pause dur="0.2"/> together</reading> <pause dur="0.7"/> so it's always a good idea if you've been put together by <pause dur="0.2"/> the tutor <pause dur="0.5"/> just to say who you are <pause dur="0.3"/> where you're from <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> and then to move on to interpreting <pause dur="0.3"/> the task <pause dur="0.3"/> and to make decisions <pause dur="0.3"/> about how you're going to proceed <pause dur="0.2"/> i'll give you an example later on of what one group decided <pause dur="0.3"/> because they actually put together <pause dur="0.3"/> a set of procedures that they wanted to use for group work <pause dur="0.3"/> and they 
published it <pause dur="0.2"/> and circulated it to all of the tutors <pause dur="0.2"/> in the department this is how we <pause dur="0.2"/> want to do group work when you ask us to do it <pause dur="0.5"/> okay <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> participation <pause dur="0.8"/> being aware <pause dur="0.4"/> of <pause dur="0.3"/> turn-taking <pause dur="0.5"/> making sure that you're not being too dominant that you're giving other people a chance <pause dur="0.3"/> trying to contribute <pause dur="0.3"/> and if people aren't contributing <pause dur="0.3"/> trying to <pause dur="0.2"/> draw them in i'll say a bit more about that later <pause dur="1.4"/> relationships often get in the way especially in the early stages you want to get to know people you're not sure about them perhaps you want to impress them <pause dur="0.6"/> and <pause dur="0.4"/> your relationship with other members of the group <pause dur="0.5"/> and this student this teacher has said <reading>overrode the need <pause dur="0.3"/> for objectivity or efficiency in carrying out the task</reading> <pause dur="0.3"/> now that's something <pause dur="0.2"/> that may happen in the early stages you're so busy getting to know <pause dur="0.3"/> other people <pause dur="0.3"/> and finding a way of working together you're not focusing sufficiently <pause dur="0.3"/> on the task but you do need to get <pause dur="0.2"/> through 
that <pause dur="0.2"/> as it were <pause dur="0.8"/><kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="4"/> and the other things <pause dur="0.2"/> disputes <pause dur="5.2"/> and perhaps <pause dur="0.3"/> ideally <pause dur="0.5"/> you do need <pause dur="0.4"/> # a stage of storming <pause dur="0.6"/> where you can actually say look <pause dur="1.0"/> i don't actually agree with the way that we're doing this could we possibly consider another way of doing it <pause dur="0.2"/> or <pause dur="0.6"/> i do feel perhaps you're talking <pause dur="0.2"/> a bit too much and <pause dur="0.4"/> other people <pause dur="0.4"/> perhaps should have a chance to talk <pause dur="0.5"/> and if it's done <pause dur="1.3"/> politely <pause dur="0.2"/> pleasantly <pause dur="0.3"/> # it usually works i i find that teachers <pause dur="0.4"/> are usually <pause dur="0.2"/> very collaborative people <pause dur="0.4"/> # it it's part of the the ethos of education <pause dur="0.6"/> i might regret saying that this year but <vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" dur="1"/><pause dur="0.3"/> # i do i do think that that's often the case teachers want to be <pause dur="0.3"/> collaborative people and are anxious to get on <pause dur="0.3"/> with others <pause dur="0.8"/> time was something that came up again and again and this is worth thinking about <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> <reading>i think the collaborative work was much more productive when we started to feel the time pressure</reading> <pause dur="0.6"/> and you'll see when i show you <pause dur="0.4"/> the procedures that one M-A group came up with is 
they decided <pause dur="0.3"/> that whenever they had group work they would appoint a chair <pause dur="0.3"/> who would keep the discussion going <pause dur="0.4"/> a secretary who would make notes for the feedback <pause dur="0.3"/> and a timekeeper <pause dur="0.7"/> so if the task had like four parts to it <pause dur="0.2"/> it was the timekeeper's job to say we've got twenty minutes <pause dur="0.2"/> five minutes on each <pause dur="0.2"/> okay <pause dur="0.2"/> and the timekeeper would keep an eye <pause dur="0.3"/> on the watch <pause dur="0.2"/> and <trunc>k</trunc> and keep the group moving <pause dur="0.3"/> so even if you didn't finish one bit of it you could move on and think about <pause dur="0.3"/> another part of the task <pause dur="0.7"/> and achievement as well and this is something for the tutor too <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> <reading>i have the feeling that the group is limited by its own ideas there must be many ideas in other groups <pause dur="0.2"/> that we haven't used</reading> <pause dur="0.5"/> now your tutor <pause dur="0.3"/> will have some method of feedback either a plenary discussion <pause dur="0.5"/> or you may be asked to # <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> to appoint a spokesperson who will speak for the group <pause dur="0.4"/> or you may be asked to write notes on a poster <pause dur="0.3"/> which is then put up on the wall and people can wander round <pause dur="0.4"/> and 
see the things <pause dur="0.2"/> that you've written <pause dur="0.4"/> or somebody might be asked to write a short report for the next <pause dur="0.2"/> meeting of the class <pause dur="0.5"/> # different ways of <pause dur="0.2"/> plenary work <pause dur="0.5"/> if you find that a tutor hasn't done that <pause dur="0.4"/> you may like to organize it for yourselves if you want to know what's been happening in other groups <pause dur="0.2"/> suggest it <pause dur="0.3"/> don't be afraid to suggest things <pause dur="0.3"/> in class <pause dur="1.0"/><kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="5"/> so those are the sorts of issues that have come up <pause dur="0.4"/> # over the years as it <pause dur="0.2"/> were <pause dur="1.2"/> and <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> i just wanted to give you <pause dur="0.3"/> a couple of ideas about <pause dur="0.2"/> how you might tackle <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> these sorts of issues if you look at page six <pause dur="1.1"/> in the handout <pause dur="0.6"/> i've given you there <pause dur="0.6"/> what's called a self-perception <pause dur="0.3"/> inventory <pause dur="0.6"/> of functions in group work <pause dur="1.4"/> the research that has gone on <pause dur="0.9"/> # and a lot of it has gone on not in education but in a business context <pause dur="0.4"/> where people for example in multinational companies <pause dur="0.3"/> have to meet <pause dur="0.3"/> and discuss things and <pause dur="0.4"/> cope with cultural differences <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> a lot of that research has 
shown that when a group is working together <pause dur="0.6"/> there are two types of function within that group <pause dur="0.4"/> that will lead to <pause dur="0.2"/> successful or unsuccessful <pause dur="0.2"/> collaborative <pause dur="0.2"/> work <pause dur="0.7"/> # one type of function is called a task <pause dur="0.3"/> function <pause dur="0.5"/> and if you have a look at some of those <pause dur="0.5"/> obviously you need people who will give opinions <pause dur="1.2"/> you you need people who will elicit opinions <pause dur="0.2"/> from colleagues or peers <pause dur="0.8"/> you need somebody who is monitoring the discussion and if something is unclear <pause dur="0.4"/> will say <pause dur="0.3"/> # let's just stop a moment can we clarify that what exactly did you mean <pause dur="0.6"/> okay <pause dur="0.9"/> # you need people <pause dur="0.2"/> who will <pause dur="0.4"/> elaborate who will build on other people's contributions <pause dur="0.3"/> well that's an interesting idea <pause dur="0.4"/> # perhaps we could develop it a bit because it seems to me that this might be possible <pause dur="0.4"/> now these are all task functions that keep the discussion <pause dur="0.2"/> going <pause dur="0.3"/> and get the job of work done <pause dur="1.0"/> but groups don't function very well if you don't also have <pause dur="0.3"/> what we call <pause dur="0.2"/> team <pause dur="0.2"/> functions <pause dur="0.7"/> you need somebody as i said earlier <pause dur="0.3"/> who will draw in <pause dur="0.3"/> the 
silent people <pause dur="0.6"/> and actually say what do you think <pause dur="0.5"/> okay <pause dur="0.3"/> it may be that person is silent <pause dur="0.2"/> especially in a multicultural group <pause dur="0.7"/> because the discussion is going quickly <pause dur="0.7"/> and it takes some people time <pause dur="0.3"/> not just to think what they want to say <pause dur="0.3"/> but to think how to say it in English <pause dur="0.8"/> # some people feel more confident in the English language <pause dur="0.3"/> and they start to dominate <pause dur="0.2"/> and may think <pause dur="0.3"/> well there are some very quiet people in this group i i ought to say something or we're not going to get anywhere <pause dur="0.6"/> but in fact perhaps all it needs is to say <pause dur="0.2"/> what what do you think have you got an opinion and give somebody <pause dur="0.3"/> time <pause dur="0.3"/> to formulate their thoughts in English and <pause dur="0.3"/> and get them out as it were to express them <pause dur="0.7"/> so <pause dur="0.3"/> we need encouragers we need people to <pause dur="0.4"/> encourage <pause dur="0.5"/> we need people <pause dur="0.4"/> to <pause dur="0.4"/> respond <pause dur="0.7"/> when they're listening <pause dur="0.5"/> to actually say things like <pause dur="0.4"/> that's an interesting idea <pause dur="0.3"/> you know what do you think <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> to get people together working together <pause dur="0.6"/> or if people start disagreeing to say <pause dur="0.2"/> you know wait a minute 
we seem to have a disagreement here <pause dur="0.3"/> let's try and sort it out <pause dur="0.8"/> and teams groups don't really work unless there are people doing <pause dur="0.3"/> that <pause dur="0.4"/> now <pause dur="0.4"/> a couple of years back <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> i was using <pause dur="0.7"/> research instruments like this all the way through <pause dur="0.2"/> a term <pause dur="0.3"/> and at the end of a term <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> i asked the students to write about their experiences of <pause dur="0.2"/> group work <pause dur="0.3"/> and i've given you one example i've called it case study one <kinesic desc="holds up handout" iterated="n"/> here <pause dur="0.6"/> this was a teacher <pause dur="0.2"/> from <pause dur="0.3"/> Eastern Europe <pause dur="0.6"/> she was a teacher trainer <pause dur="1.0"/> and here she's reflecting <pause dur="0.6"/> on the way in which she felt she was able <pause dur="0.3"/> to change <pause dur="0.5"/> her contributions to group work <pause dur="0.5"/> as she said <pause dur="1.5"/> to begin with she felt that she was very dominant very hyper she always wanted to talk she always wanted to make contributions <pause dur="0.4"/> but as the term progressed she tried more and more <pause dur="0.5"/> to take on some team functions to draw other people in <pause dur="0.4"/> to be a responsive <pause dur="0.3"/> listener <pause dur="0.3"/> to conciliate <pause dur="0.3"/> when there were disagreements <pause dur="0.4"/> and at the end of the course she said <pause dur="0.2"/> that was one of the most useful things that 
she had learned <pause dur="0.3"/> because she had developed skills <pause dur="0.3"/> of interacting with other people in groups <pause dur="0.2"/> which she had to do a lot <pause dur="0.3"/> in her work <pause dur="0.3"/> so she felt she had developed skills that were transferable <pause dur="0.3"/> to her job when she went <pause dur="0.2"/> home <pause dur="0.2"/> okay <pause dur="0.6"/> so <pause dur="0.3"/> think about <pause dur="0.4"/> those <pause dur="1.0"/> functions as they're described <pause dur="0.4"/> and perhaps when you're doing group work <pause dur="0.5"/> afterwards just have a look at that list and think <pause dur="0.4"/> which functions did i perform <pause dur="0.6"/> # and are there some others <pause dur="0.2"/> that i could do <pause dur="0.3"/> in the group <pause dur="0.3"/> okay <pause dur="0.5"/> # and the other thing that you might like to think about is how you actually set up <pause dur="0.4"/> your group work this is the <pause dur="0.3"/> thing i talked about earlier <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> that the M-A course participants published to tutors <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> and they said okay <pause dur="0.7"/> <reading>tutors should have primary responsibility for designating the members of each group <pause dur="0.5"/> in order to ensure variety throughout the year</reading> <pause dur="0.8"/> okay <pause dur="1.1"/> <reading>tutors should indicate the approximate amount of time available <pause dur="0.3"/> for the completion of the task</reading> sometimes we forget to do that <pause dur="0.4"/> right <pause dur="0.4"/> so it would 
be very good if somebody <pause dur="0.3"/> in the group in your group actually said # how long have we got for this <pause dur="0.2"/> very nicely if the tutor forgets to tell you <pause dur="0.3"/> 'cause then you can organize yourselves <pause dur="0.2"/> you know how much time you've got <pause dur="0.9"/> <reading>that each group should appoint its own chair <pause dur="0.3"/> secretary spokesperson and timekeeper</reading> <pause dur="0.6"/> right <pause dur="0.6"/> and the roles of the above are as follows <reading>the chair is to guide discussion and ensure progress <pause dur="0.4"/> the secretary is to take notes for later feedback <pause dur="0.5"/> either <pause dur="0.3"/> in clear written form for typing and display or as the basis for oral reporting <pause dur="0.4"/> the timekeeper <pause dur="0.3"/> is to remind the group of its deadlines</reading> <pause dur="0.5"/> and <pause dur="0.3"/> the fifth <pause dur="0.4"/> point <reading>that the product of the discussion or task <pause dur="0.3"/> should be either <pause dur="0.3"/> presented in written form <pause dur="0.4"/> or <pause dur="0.2"/> reported by the secretary</reading> and this was useful <pause dur="0.4"/> <reading>with additions from the other group members</reading> <pause dur="0.3"/> that you never leave it entirely to one person <pause dur="0.5"/> but that you make it possible for other people to chip in <pause dur="0.3"/> with something that the 
spokesperson <pause dur="0.4"/> might have forgotten <pause dur="1.0"/> so <pause dur="0.3"/> those are just things to think about <pause dur="0.3"/> when you find yourself involved in group work <pause dur="0.2"/> here <pause dur="0.7"/> but there's one other point that i would like <pause dur="0.2"/> to make because <pause dur="0.4"/> again <pause dur="0.5"/><event desc="turns off overhead projector" iterated="n"/> this is something that has developed <pause dur="0.4"/> over the years <pause dur="0.5"/> students <pause dur="0.4"/> on the M-A course have found it very very useful <pause dur="0.3"/> to set up their own <pause dur="0.2"/> learning <pause dur="0.3"/> syndicates <pause dur="0.2"/> now the last page of the handout <pause dur="0.5"/> # gives you some information about that <pause dur="1.3"/> they have functioned extremely well <pause dur="0.8"/> and when i was doing my interviews this summer <pause dur="0.5"/> this was the kind of group work that people found particularly <pause dur="0.2"/> useful <pause dur="0.6"/> what do we mean by a learning syndicate <pause dur="0.7"/> it's a self-<pause dur="0.2"/>chosen <pause dur="0.2"/> self-help <pause dur="0.2"/> group <pause dur="0.5"/> you get together <pause dur="0.3"/> with other students <pause dur="0.5"/> the numbers are usually four five or six not more than that <pause dur="0.4"/> and it's a group that meets <pause dur="0.2"/> outside of classes <pause dur="0.5"/> nothing to do with the organization of tutors <pause dur="0.3"/> as i said self-selecting <pause dur="0.7"/> # making your own decisions about when to 
meet where to meet <pause dur="0.3"/> and what to do <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="1.0"/> and really <pause dur="0.2"/> its goal is to cooperate in order to support <pause dur="0.3"/> whatever work you're involved in <pause dur="0.4"/> at different times of the year <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="1.3"/> it is independent from tutors but what i found over the years and it's very helpful <pause dur="0.4"/> is that if a learning syndicate has come up with some kind of problem or issue <pause dur="0.7"/> perhaps to do with a coursework assignment and they want to meet with the tutor <pause dur="0.6"/> then they arrange a joint meeting with the tutor <pause dur="0.4"/> so that six people <pause dur="0.2"/> will go to see me or <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> or <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> together <pause dur="0.4"/> to talk about the same issue <pause dur="0.3"/> and that is very very economical <pause dur="0.3"/> for you and for us because there are a lot of you <pause dur="0.5"/> # and a discussion in a group usually yields more <pause dur="0.5"/> # than just a discussion between two people <pause dur="0.4"/> but i've listed here some of the things <pause dur="0.3"/> that learning syndicates can <pause dur="0.2"/> do <pause dur="0.5"/> # there are some things that you <pause dur="0.2"/> are very well advised to do and some that you really should avoid <pause dur="0.4"/> doing <pause dur="0.3"/> so i've put things here like sharing library books and articles <pause dur="0.2"/> 
that's a very useful thing <pause dur="0.3"/> to do <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> sharing lecture notes or recordings as well <pause dur="0.7"/> # and taking turns at producing a set of notes if you've got three classes in one day <pause dur="0.5"/> you might have three different people in your syndicate <pause dur="0.2"/> making the notes and then sharing them <pause dur="0.4"/> and it's a lot less work for everybody <pause dur="1.0"/> buying textbooks together <pause dur="0.6"/> that's a good way of sharing it <pause dur="0.3"/> and establishing a private syndicate library <pause dur="0.4"/> okay <pause dur="0.8"/> # reading each others' drafts of coursework assignments and commenting on them <pause dur="0.4"/> trying to see any language problems <pause dur="0.3"/> or saying whether you feel something is clear <pause dur="0.3"/> or not <pause dur="0.8"/> practising giving seminar presentations you're all going to be asked to give presentations <pause dur="0.3"/> at some point in the year <pause dur="0.3"/> good idea to practise it and get feedback <pause dur="0.4"/> from colleagues <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> or just providing help on demand somebody rings you up can you help me with this <pause dur="0.2"/> okay <pause dur="0.4"/> or just giving moral support <pause dur="0.3"/> if somebody begins to feel stressed or a bit low <pause dur="0.3"/> about things giving <pause dur="0.2"/> moral support can be very 
useful <pause dur="0.8"/> what you must avoid <pause dur="0.9"/> is doing your assignments together <pause dur="0.9"/><vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" n="ss" dur="4"/> because tutors become very <pause dur="0.2"/> aware of that <pause dur="0.4"/> and we don't have a policy in CELTE <pause dur="0.4"/> of doing work <pause dur="0.2"/> together because it has to be assessed <pause dur="0.3"/> individually <pause dur="0.7"/> it may be possible later in the year if you choose similar topics for dissertations <pause dur="0.4"/> to work together on some kind of <pause dur="0.4"/> research <pause dur="0.2"/> instrument <pause dur="0.4"/> # i've just marked two dissertations from my own students and they wanted to investigate <pause dur="0.3"/> staff appraisal <pause dur="0.3"/> as a topic <pause dur="0.4"/> and we found that there were only about twenty people <pause dur="0.3"/> on the M-A course and among staff <pause dur="0.3"/> who had experience of staff appraisal in schools <pause dur="0.3"/> and i said it's not a good idea if you both <pause dur="0.3"/> try to give those twenty people a questionnaire <pause dur="0.3"/> you're not going to get complete returns <pause dur="0.3"/> so they worked together <pause dur="0.4"/> on the questionnaire and designed it <pause dur="0.3"/> and administered it <pause dur="0.3"/> but then i made <pause dur="0.2"/> two lots of copies <pause dur="0.2"/> and they analysed it and wrote it up completely <pause dur="0.2"/> separately <pause dur="0.4"/> so <pause dur="0.3"/> collaboration may be possible 
to a certain extent <pause dur="0.3"/> but your written work should always be <pause dur="0.2"/> your own <pause dur="0.4"/> and tutors will <pause dur="0.2"/> recognize immediately if three people have turned out the same essay <pause dur="0.3"/> so it's not a very good thing to do <pause dur="0.2"/> okay <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="1.5"/> you will find classrooms empty <pause dur="0.3"/> in the late afternoon <pause dur="0.7"/> the period between about four and six <pause dur="0.3"/> a lot of the rooms are free <pause dur="0.4"/> and you just need to ask in the office <pause dur="0.4"/> # if there's a room that you can use <pause dur="0.2"/> for your group <pause dur="0.4"/> okay <pause dur="0.6"/> but do <pause dur="0.3"/> do think about that because we've had such positive feedback <pause dur="0.4"/> from members of the course <pause dur="0.2"/> about the usefulness the value <pause dur="0.3"/> of these self-help groups during the year <pause dur="0.4"/> may not be something you're familiar with <pause dur="0.5"/> but certainly something worth trying <pause dur="0.4"/> okay <pause dur="0.6"/> and that really brings me to the end of the messages that i'm passing on <pause dur="0.3"/> from previous students <pause dur="0.3"/> # how are we doing it's nearly two o'clock does anybody have a burning question at all <pause dur="5.2"/><vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" n="ss" dur="1"/> no <pause dur="1.2"/> okay well i hope that's given you some ideas for the year
