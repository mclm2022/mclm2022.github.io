<u who="su">my exercise for the day </u>
<u who="nf5395">yes  right # so we're doing gender and globalisation today and # i suggest that we have two groups this time so is that ok # maybe some latecomer will arrive in which case we'll set up another group # so let's go straight into the into the group discussion and # well are you happy to have a group here and a group there ok so but please move round because # you can't talk in straight lines </u>
<gap reason="moving to form groups" extent="uncertain"/>
<u who="sf5397"><gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> the weakening of the state and the <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> breaking down of the barriers between nation states <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> that division disappears </u>
<u who="sf5396">but what i mean is is that <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> </u>
<u who="sf5397">ok so but but the result of distinguishing between these two levels in the end <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/></u>
<u who="sf5399"><gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/></u>
<u who="sf5397">what <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> there ceases to be such a division </u>
<u who="sf5399">yes </u>
<u who="sf5396">yeah ok that's fair enough but # there's less of a nation state but the thing is that's something else that's interesting is that # that the theory is that <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> but in practice it's more of an international sort of development rather than global as such it's about communication between nation states it's not actually you know nation states still do a certain amount of talking <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/></u>
<u who="sf5397">yes but it was thought to it was going to </u>
<u who="sf5396">the theory behind it </u>
<u who="sf5397">yeah the theory behind it is some kind of global government group </u>
<u who="sf5396">yeah</u>
<u who="sf5399"><gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> when some one country do this it's affect the other countries <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> because if you decide that nation nation nation state nation nation state is only one countries when this last last world war second world war was it changed globalisation </u>
<u who="sf5396"><gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> did anyone ever say specifically when it they never do do they </u>
<u who="sf5397"><gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> it is a nineteen-eighties trend isn't it but # </u>
<u who="sf5396"><gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> product of # globalisation </u>
<u who="sf5397">yeah it's a <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> without without without the internet without the global network i don't know if it's </u>
<u who="sf5396"><gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> transportation</u>
<u who="sf5397">that's it</u>
<u who="sf5396">we wouldn't be able to fly to Australia</u>
<u who="sf5399"><gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/></u>
<u who="sf5397">exactly and information the thing is i mean like <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> transport of food actually i have never seen it how does all that food come <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> does it just come on planes with just fruit i don't know like lorries</u>
<u who="sf5396"><gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> </u>
<u who="sf5397">yes but they are but i think still they are travelling <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> i mean like cheap package tourism started during the sixties <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> yeah i mean they're sort of drawn into the consumer # pressure <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/></u>
<gap reason="new phase of event" extent="uncertain"/>
<u who="sf5403">and yeah the western countries have also have to implement the structure for them as well and it means that cutback of the social spendings and everything</u>
<u who="sf5402"><gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> # yeah as far as the women are concerned </u>
<u who="su"><gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/></u>
<u who="sf5402"><gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> # yeah they do create jobs and they do give more independence <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> on the other hand <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> it's basically ok here is # ok this bit </u>
<u who="sf5401"><gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/></u>
<u who="sf5402">no in different parts of the world </u>
<u who="su">what are you looking at </u>
<u who="sf5402"><gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> and women were taken as as # very elastic labour like that you could hire and fire as you want yeah as you want yeah but also in their domestic environments because it means they do get paid <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> but on the other hand <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> the values still have to be regarded as patriarchic <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> yes that's right <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> a lot of # organisations were created by woman or women and these women were very much involved in those organisations plus the job plus their roles inside inside the house but the point is that men if they get that paid jobs <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> isn't as highly valued as a public one <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/></u>
<u who="sf5401">is it their choice <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/></u>
<u who="sf5402"><gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> stay home or do both right</u>
<u who="sf5400">it has been said that <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> in terms of benefits particularly into financial benefits there aren't any because they're paid so low</u>
<u who="sf5402">yeah</u>
<gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/>
<u who="sf5400">and that's that's the whole thing with globalisation is that the impact on the so called <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> is that it's post colonialism i can't describe it in any other way <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> because all they do is to partake for them that the globalisation has been they call it <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> of the markets and it is because it allows them to go in and exploit the workers' means so for instance Marks and Spencer's Marks and Spencer's renowned itself on being British and always because everything they made was made in Britain the textiles came from Britain they've now gone into the third world because they found that they could not compete with the cost of wages </u>
<u who="sf5402"><gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/></u>
<u who="sf5403"><gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/></u>
<u who="sf5402"><gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/></u>
<u who="sf5400">yeah <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> in particular <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> whose values and norms are being taken on in the process of globalisation <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> there certainly isn't <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> and and the impact of that is that now you got # <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> the environment is being destroyed <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> </u>
<u who="sf5400">actually it's quite interesting because McDonald's opened in Barbados and they lost in a few months literally Barbados three months because Barbados wouldn't support it </u>
<u who="sf5400">they don't eat fast foods like # you won't have what's the chicken people </u>
<u who="su">Kentucky</u>
<u who="sf5400">Kentucky they're there and they they work because it's chicken but they have what they call # <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> i'm trying to remember the name of the company it's a <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> based company it's actually going round the world and it does one it's very similar to KFC but it's kind of Caribbean style # and they have chicken products and that's another one and and like McDonald's has # not McDonald's KFC has <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> its own competition with it the Caribbean and but McDonald's <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> because they said they didn't want it like that to begin with but then that's part and parts of the whole evils of multinationals they feel that they can go into anywhere <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> it's very focussed it's it's they call it the <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> because it is it is renowned the to be the one of the most forward looking countries in terms of <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> and that's that whole ban thing you know they said # at the summit what they were looking at is that the stipulations because of course you borrow money under certain conditions and the conditions were that you cut down on education cut down on welfare cut down on health and at the time <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> who was the prime minister he said what he said health education and welfare is the main stand of that economy once we do that <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> but it shows that it can work if you're determined enough to do it and if you've got the people behind you it will work because Barbados a second example now from the Caribbean Trinidad Islands and Tobago Trinidad and Tobago had oil went into <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> and now it's it's just totally been <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> because of the stipulations they put on it <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> </u>
<u who="sf5403"><gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/></u>
<u who="sf5402"><gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> it has it has the best of both though it's taken on a lot <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/></u>
<u who="sf5403"><gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> you know it's just not so good </u>
<u who="sf5402">what you were saying coming back to <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> that happened a lot <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> especially in eastern European countries when they were forced to well not forced to but when their economies were liberalised # well a lot of their <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> </u>
<u who="sf5400"><gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> look at our system and i mean you know we're talking about a first world country </u>
<u who="su">yes</u>
<u who="sf5400">mm so if you equate that to them popular ones in saying this is the way to move for countries # that are dependent where the people are dependent on state welfare then think oh well this is the model to follow because the west says it's so <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/></u>
<u who="sf5402">and the thing is like </u>
<u who="sf5400"><gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/></u>
<u who="sf5402">and the thing is as soon <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/></u>
<u who="sf5400">it's unfair yeah</u>
<u who="sf5402"><gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> who  suffers the most i mean definitely and like they give the example of India </u>
<u who="sf5400"><gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> one of these articles  actually said in poor countries you have poor men but you have poor women <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/></u>
<u who="sf5396"><gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> in various articles that # that actually it just that's just increasing women's burden because they still largely have domestic responsibilities as well as others </u>
<u who="sf5397">yeah i suppose they take it for granted </u>
<u who="sf5396">but then they they do suggest that # you know <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> again as we said they're not secure</u>
<u who="sf5397">they're not secure</u>
<u who="sf5398">no</u>
<u who="sf5396">but then also it's it's # because men are being # expected to change their perception of who the responsibility lies with in the domestic situation so women may be being given equal opportunities in the sort of public sphere if you like but # they're still being considered responsible for the domestic as as well so it's actually just it's rather reallocation of the roles <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/></u>
<u who="sf5397">it's just an extra thing</u>
<u who="sf5396">what they have to do <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> argues that that # that that actually it's still a process of exploitation and it's still in a sense a gender divide # because it's based on the assumption that women's time can extend </u>
<u who="sf5397">yes without any it's yes yes </u>
<u who="sf5396">we're definitely responsible for as much or as little as we you know what we're paying <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> i think that's the idea but does that lead into question three or or am i just ahead of myself </u>
<u who="sf5397">no just for question two isn't it i would i would again i'd like to redefine what what # structural adjustment programmes are what are they <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> </u>
<u who="sf5399"><gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> it's talk about <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/></u>
<u who="sf5397">but <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> by the world bank and the International </u>
<u who="sf5399">#</u>
<u who="sf5397">Monetary Fund are they <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> something imposed it's something imposed from the west on the <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> </u>
<u who="sf5399"><gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> you give informations <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/></u>
<u who="sf5396"><gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> it's about isn't it isn't it about the # what what # the stake holder systems and # <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> # taking away its own limited help for # health care nutrition <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> </u>
<u who="sf5397">yes</u>
<u who="sf5396">childcare # they may be limited but progress must have been made <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> it's now being taken away</u>
<u who="sf5397">yes</u>
<u who="sf5396">i think there's some examples in i think in Latin America where they're saying that in fact the situation was getting better <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> and it wasn't </u>
<u who="sf5404">i i wouldn't blame I-M-F <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> it is the government <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> these countries that fail it's not IMF</u>
<u who="sf5396">no no but # </u>
<u who="sf5404">no it's not redevelopment <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> it's grasped by a few persons a few privileged persons there was no development of the country so you you can't  blame the westerner's monetary organisations or the west</u>
<u who="sf5396">yeah</u>
<u who="sf5397">but who but who <trunc>impo</trunc> who imposes these programmes the the local government</u>
<u who="sf5404">no it's just they have to make reforms because the economy was too planned but they have to make reforms anyway but it's their own responsibility</u>
<u who="sf5397">hm </u>
<u who="sf5399">this is all similar similar between # United Nations and NGO to discussing about the <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> how to how to improve improve the women life </u>
<u who="sf5396"><gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> but they do make an # effort to come inline with a with a global position which is why they're dominated but if they hope to get on in the global market then they're sort of being forced to make certain structural changes that they can't cope with </u>
<u who="sf5404">but it's not</u>
<u who="sf5396"><gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> it's not the same </u>
<u who="sf5404">but it's not just <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> it's just they can't go on with such a debt it's not because of western western imperialism or anything it's just they can't go on but it isn't economically it's not possible </u>
<u who="sf5396">but this is the whole point of the drop the debt campaign isn't it it's that the campaigners in the west who will say don't <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> when they're still being held up for owing the west huge amounts of money that the westerners still <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> you know</u>
<u who="sf5397">and the west <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/></u>
<u who="sf5396">so if we drop the debt it would at least that would alleviate a huge problem in a lot of countries </u>
<u who="sf5404">yeah but i'm not sure if in these countries they can not <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> at current times i mean the governments are not that good solving problems i mean drop the debt it's not going to be a miracle everything is going to be alright</u>
<u who="sf5396">what are you going to make to improve the situation <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> i mean it may not be alright over night but it would actually i think you know improve we couldn't make it worse could we take away the debt surely </u>
<u who="sf5404">i think we do have to pay for the mistakes of other countries </u>
<u who="sf5396">oh oh<vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" dur="2"/></u>
<u who="sf5397">so what are their mistakes that we that you're talking about corruption</u>
<u who="sf5404">yes</u>
<u who="sf5397">yeah</u>
<u who="sf5404">yeah they had resources they had money and they didn't use it in a proper way so </u>
<u who="sf5397">you mean after independence</u>
<u who="sf5404"># well Latin America is not a question of independence </u>
<u who="sf5396"><gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/></u>
<u who="sf5399">because in these countries they receive the # idea from the west to improve their country country so but it's different 'cause in in the west # the policy makers make for their people but in the in the third world countries it's different idea is different and and it has # the different resource # different people different everythings so they can't use the same idea to improve their countries so maybe it's <trunc>mis</trunc>  yeah it's mistake # in only their own countries but <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> because they get receive they get the the idea from the west to improve their countries</u>
<u who="sf5396">exactly <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> with this idea we're going to a global market excuse me but but it's very dominated by very few countries you know so but it's kind of it's in a situation where it's more than independent countries you know it's more i mean in a political sense than in a geographical sense # you know of of being kind of being kind of forced to adopt if they're going to get on in any way <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> even if it's not part of their you know their traditional you know makeup <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> do you know what i mean am i making sense </u>
<u who="sf5397">yes no yes i know what you mean</u>
<u who="sf5399">because in Thailand in the case of Thailand yeah the government is has a caution <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> yeah many many caution from # the politician or the # the officials in the government but first of all most of all they get the idea from the west and try to improve their by by form the policies or something like that try to because of this in the rural area there they try to use # the budget to improve infrastructure or something like that but the people # the rural peoples they don't know how to use it but is it is important for them to to use it because they are already poor they have no education so this when when when the government # build a building or # building the roads # some <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> so # then and # it's only only the building cost nobody come and used it</u>
<u who="sf5396">right ok</u>

<u who="sf5402">i don't think i don't think it gets into any individual level <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> a broader economic level </u>
<u who="sf5400">i think she's right though</u>
<u who="sf5402">yeah yeah i mean the men are <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/></u>
<u who="sf5400">because because what they do is when they implement these policies or they want policies to be implemented what they do is they speak to the men even if it's not the men who deal with that particular issue</u>
<u who="sf5402">yeah yeah </u>
<u who="sf5400">and so what women can't what what effectively they do is they and i think they've said it in those one of the ways <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> is to just not do it you know when there have been programmes on or projects and it's not going to benefit them it's just not to do them and that's one of them then what they have to take aboard is that they need to decide for themselves what they need to do <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> one of the reasons of coming forward is that they have to take on board the responsibilities of determining their lives and once they do they make their <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> for them what's essential and then <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> i mean there are a lot of things women can do i mean i know union organisation in the old fashioned sense is dying but it's a way of having force and it's a way of exerting power and maybe third world people need to reunionise or unionise themselves in order to perform some force out  to get more wages because if they were to decide to pull out of the wage market they would need an employee at a higher salary which they would have to do or they would have to pay more to the women but when women are fragmented and continue to be paid the pityings then </u>
<u who="sf5402">that's it yeah but it's very how plausible is it how</u>
<u who="sf5400">it takes time like most things but it does actually work because <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> of domestic violence and of all these things</u>
<u who="sf5402">yes yeah</u>
<u who="sf5400">you know if <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> women decided that you know we're gonna <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> men first # women had to kill their husband <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> the women's movement came behind and <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> women technically the law women cannot <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> a man but a woman can <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> a man you know and the women's movement # in the sixties were quite harsh in Britain <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> and usually violence ended up in a man dying because </u>

<u who="sf5400">well <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> but something that will work it will take time it will take organising but it's a way </u>

<u who="sf5400">yes yes</u>

<u who="sf5400">yes yes and but it's at grass root level where they were it's the</u>
<u who="sf5402">it has to be at the grass roots level </u>
<u who="sf5400">they're communianising because if you looked at Britain in the forties and fifties for better working conditions that's what they did in Britain <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> so productions came to standstill and they had to listen to the people because then they had a representative so <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> representing the force of the people and maybe that's a way women will have to structure themselves in terms of moving forward because that's the only thing they have but it's quite powerful</u>
<u who="sf5402">it's a very powerful thing </u>
<u who="sf5400">but i don't think they've actually realised that they do have that power and that they can exert that power</u>
<u who="sf5402">that's what i mean it's very difficult to convince them that they do have that power </u>
<u who="sf5400">yeah</u>
<u who="sf5402">because if you've been if you've been </u>
<u who="sf5400">it's educated </u>
<u who="sf5402">yeah</u>
<u who="sf5400">educated mostly</u>
<u who="sf5402">and if you've been like yeah your whole life it's very difficult to get out of that trap to actually think independently </u>

<u who="sf5402">and it is very important that it is grass roots because if you get if you do get the elites going back and actually even trying to <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> these women it comes out very differently </u>
<u who="sf5400">it's a different language as well isn't it it's a whole different language because if you if you look at the # if you look at the language that's used in a university and the language that's used on community level it's completely different so if you don't use the same language as they use they don't take any notice and it's a resentment because they <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/></u>

<u who="sf5400"><gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/></u>
<u who="sf5402">yeah it's it's </u>
<u who="sf5401"><gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/></u>
<u who="sf5402">it's like you said to me you're a new # elite role model it's you know what i mean and how</u>
<u who="sf5403"> how could they <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> that</u>
<u who="sf5402">most of us <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> educated we go back </u>
<u who="sf5400">you see they have programmes in the Caribbean for instance # we call them popular theatre programmes and when you have projects to do you use popular theatre to do it you go into the communities because popular theatre speaks a language that crosses boundaries it crosses gender it crosses racial boundaries so you go in because what it allows you to do and in the Caribbean what we have what we call # we do skids and things what it allows you to do it allows you to go in you become a facilitator as opposed to # a tutor a lecturer or whatever you facilitate something predominantly what we do is you you teach the people the skills to do whatever it is they want to do so by the time we finish with the programme <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> and we got out of them in a week what nobody else had been able to do now we didn't ask any specific questions we just facilitated the <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> and gave them the tools in which to <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> themselves to express what it is they wanted to say it was at a particular hospital the hospital staff came back and said similar things would have to</u>
<gap reason="break in recording" extent="unknown"/>
<u who="nf5395">what is globalisation then does anybody know what globalisation is </u>
<u who="sf5396">we said we said a process on several levels but # the sort of the political # level of globalisation we talked about # deregulation mobilisation # and the sort of # economics we talked about the free market and # globalisation <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> economically # which was something we said that globalisation is rooted in nations of capitalism # as well that's quite important and in terms of political set up it's also rooted in nations of democracy there's a perception that all states would be democratic # <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> globalisation is sort of an element of it as well as perhaps a consequence of it is # mass media and mass communication networks and # the improvement in rapid transportation all across the world that those are the kind of key areas we looked at </u>
<u who="nf5395">and what else any</u>
<u who="sf5402">well basically that but we also said this # basically breaking down of any national or state boundaries where you get very much a blurring of what belongs where even politically and economically both as well </u>
<u who="sf5396">what what we were saying that that that may be the theory that that globalisation's theory is to break down these barriers but that the reality in practice it's not so much a global system as a kind of international system if you like i mean the nation state hasn't actually deteriorated </u>
<u who="sf5402">no not at all</u>
<u who="sf5396">i mean it does still exist i mean there may be theoretically i think yeah you're right that that's what globalisation is aimed at <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> </u>
<u who="sf5402">but but the idea that a person that people from very different parts of the world can be employed in one single company that's that's i mean practically broken down a barrier that's literally broken down so</u>
<u who="nf5395">yeah can you give us some other examples of how i mean it's right that that # much of it is is internationalised # but there are examples of where # national boundaries are breaking down so can you think of other examples of that i mean you know why has this idea of globalisation arisen # what what other examples can you see </u>
<u who="sf5397">well within Europe </u>
<u who="nf5395">yes yeah </u>
<u who="sf5397">the workers can can move freely</u>
<u who="nf5395">right yeah  what what</u>
<u who="sf5397">no it's just</u>
<u who="nf5395">did you did you think of other examples of where some why has why has the idea of globalisation arisen now do you think because in many ways it's something that's been happening for a long time not not just recently but why is globalisation such such a popular concept now </u>
<u who="sf5400"><gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> and movements of capital and # economic movements where # particularly from multinationals where profit is the key to everything they do so obviously the cheaper the labour they'd get the more profit they can make and globalisation is a legal way if you like of being able to do that is to transport labour # from one part of the world to another # but in the true sense globalisation doesn't happen because then that that money if you like the investment doesn't stay in the country in which it goes or where the development is actually taking place so you will always have inequalities # even though the the point of or the whole point of globalisation should be for a fairer for a freer world but it's freer for whom and fairer for whom because it's not really fair and it's not free </u>
<u who="nf5395">yeah so i one of the reasons that that globalisation is a # an important concept currently is because of the way # # companies are able to move across national boundaries and there's no state control or at least state control of of # # industry has broken down to a great extent </u>
<u who="sf5397">so it's economic interdependence actually</u>
<u who="nf5395">yeah yeah which as you'll recognise has has been going on for a long time you know # since colonial times # but it's intensified in particular ways in recent years and the other i suppose the other really big example is # the fact that rich and poor aren't so clearly separated between geographical areas now so that there are # sort of important examples of where industrialisation has begun so <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> </u>
<u who="sf5396"><gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> </u>
<u who="nf5395">ey </u>
<u who="su">other culture</u>
<u who="nf5395">yeah but i mean in <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/></u>
<u who="su">areas of the world</u>
<u who="nf5395">yeah areas of the world </u>
<u who="sf5397">as in in south east Asia </u>
<u who="nf5395">yeah i mean that you know that's a key one where where # it's no longer the case that it's the west that's that's industrialised # and the third world that is <trunc>agra</trunc>  agrarian # so particularly in south east Asia but also in other areas and in other smaller areas in different parts of the world that kind of clearcut polarisation between rich and poor is changing # so that's another reason that # you know the old theories don't really work any more because they were based on that kind of polarisation # so there is greater change now it's it's not it's not something that's particularly different from what's been happening since colonial times but but there are more changes and globalisation is trying to take the term globalisation is trying to take account of those those changes which don't really fit into modernisation theory and interdependency theory so very well ok what are the effects of globalisation then  in different areas of the world </u>
<u who="sf5400">in the in the developing world it's it's had a great effect on women in particular because it means that their role as individual people has expanded # from the caretaker of their home # from domestic work from agricultural work into low pay employment so instead of just having the family and the fields to look after they now have the onus of going on jobs and also in terms of migration for men and that has an impact then on production and reproduction # </u>
<u who="sf5402">well one advantage that's been cited is that it does give women more independence well # for instance just being just getting money for instance from these NGOs that operate there but that's the only advantage 'cause like you said then they they have their job but they all but it's having earning money doesn't mean that the job they're doing in the domestic domestic sphere like at home doesn't so it doesn't decrease at all and their role as i mean it's still a patriarchal family so her role doesn't increase either it doesn't so it's the idea of stretching her time stretching women's time </u>
<u who="sf5396">we were also saying that that women's employment is still very insecure there's no kind of stability to it whatsoever # and that it would help if there was a a sort of reappropriation of roles within the domestic area but there isn't </u>
<u who="sf5402">no there isn't yeah</u>
<u who="sf5396">it's not women coming into the workforce a little bit and men starting to take some of the domestic responsibility </u>
<u who="sf5402">the idea that the man is still the breadwinner still lingers on although she although the women are now earning as well</u>
<u who="sf5396">so that the the exploitation is now rooted in in this idea that women's time and resources is endlessly expandable</u>
<u who="sf5402">yeah infinite time yeah</u>
<u who="nf5395">yeah what other effects what about this group what did you </u>
<u who="sf5403">actually i was thinking about the first world women as well because you know now big companies have moved you know to use cheap labour in the in the third world countries right so women in the first world also lose their jobs at the same time so you know it doesn't mean that women in the first world will gain benefit from globalisation yeah because they have something to lose as well</u>
<u who="nf5395">right and that's an example of that kind of change when it doesn't easily fit into the old theories # so that you're getting you know increasing pockets of poverty in rich countries and certain areas of growing # richness in so called poor countries so yeah</u>
<u who="sf5401">and i also feel that # globalisation has has has opened Africa the countries in Africa put gender on the agenda national agendas</u>
<u who="nf5395">yeah yeah</u>
<u who="sf5401">cause # from Namibia # in ninety-five when the country was made aware through globalisation of the Beijing conference and it is the first time in since Namibia's independence that it can really participate on gender issues nationally and after that five years after that Namibia started a gender ministry for the first time so i feel globalisation in a way forced African countries' men who were in authority to recognise that gender can also be discussed in this country and it obviously affects any woman's activities in the country from agricultural level to economic level and things so globalisation is then a positive thing but what happens after that now the ministry's established gender is on the agenda it's how it is going further on it is the question now but just to make it present recognised in the country in the first place globalisation has done a tremendous effect on this</u>
<u who="nf5395">that's that's a really interesting idea actually isn't it because it's it's kind of it's legitimising these certain kinds of issues which i'm sure have always been there # but have not been recognised </u>
<u who="sf5401">there's too much pressure from the outside from the first world countries on the third world countries to recognise the value of women's work in third world countries </u>
<u who="sf5396">but i think one of the interesting things about that as well is that in improving the situation for women because women are often responsible and things like in developing countries but # sustenance and those of agriculture so it's actually you know in addressing their concerns you're you're improving the situation of the society at large you know for # sort of the families as well as # you know the men and so it's i think that's starting to be recognised # you know it's not just about making the situation better for women but it will actually have wider you know widespread effects </u>
<u who="nf5395">yeah but i i think Kathleen's point is really important because there's a tendency to focus all on the negative aspects and how effective globalisation and increasing integration across the world # just spreads all the bad things about # the global economy but Kathleen's example shows that actually it can be used by other forces it can it can we can use it the way we want # the fact that that you know transport and communication is easier can be used by by the women's movement # so yes it's a it's it's really important to kind of have that that idea that it can be a positive force as well because that's the only way we'll make it a positive force yes what other effects does globalisation have in other parts of the world  what did this group discuss</u>
<u who="sf5397">we talked about # # about the effects # on the families # but # from what from what from what we i've read # it varies a lot and so # the patriarchal structures you're talking about i think in some cases # things are things are changing a little # </u>
<u who="nf5395">yeah can you give an example for that do you remember any </u>
<u who="sf5397">well there it was the article on on Chile it it they said they found it very difficult to generalise because because # it varied so much from family to family and that # # during the working months women women who are earning and sometimes they earn actually more than than the men in their jobs and # yeah in some in some cases # the men were you know changing changing their roles at home and others they didn't at all so it's <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> and again in the winter months they reverted back to traditional roles but still it shows a change yeah</u>
<u who="nf5395">yeah and again that's that's interesting because it shows that the effects of globalisation aren't even they aren't even you know so you can't you can't just assume that because an effect's in one place is like this to be the same somewhere else there are there are very uneven # impacts in different places of the world and different locations and that's why # that's why the idea the concept of globalisation is often linked with the concept of local the local or that horrible word localisation # because you in other words you need to look at the specific location and examine what the effects are there within that particular context # because because # there can be such great differences in the effects # so it's important to remember that it's you know uneven in its impact</u>
<u who="sf5402"><gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/>  </u>
<u who="nf5395">yeah sorry sorry <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> was going to say something </u>
<u who="sf5402">i was going to say # with mm especially in eastern Europe i read something about that # with political liberalisation and economic liberalisation state welfare was cut back a lot and usually it's the women who suffer the consequences when state welfare's cut back so that's # </u>
<u who="sf5403">i feel again it happens everywhere like in Thailand like in in nineteen-ninety-seven we have that financial crisis and then the world bank and IMF came to help us they said they help us by giving us some loans but under the conditions that we have to cut back of the social spendings especially those related to health care and education so women # basically affected yeah the most by the cutbacks yeah </u>
<u who="nf5395">yeah has anybody read anything about # why women are affected why is it why are women particularly affected by the by structural adjustment schemes</u>
<u who="sf5396">for for example when we were talking about <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> cutback on certain <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> social spendings so there's a reduction in education services for example and <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> they were saying that it tends to be # a reduction in women's education in women's adult literacy in you know it's the # it's the girls who then stay at home and they're considered not to you know need the education as much as the boys do because there's still this kind of patriarchal structure so they're actually losing out on education more # or if you know food subsidies are reduced whatever what we've talked before about sort of # the patriarchal situations within the family you known it tends to be the women who who lose out more who</u>
<u who="sf5397">and childcare childcare reduced </u>
<u who="sf5396">yeah because the area of cutbacks tends to be more in the social and domestic sphere which is obviously where women are sort of you know primarily are at the moment </u>
<u who="nf5395">right yeah so i mean you know when the when the state is drawing back from # services of various kinds it's almost always the women who're taking up the difference in in the family so if # if if there are educational cutbacks # cutbacks in health spending it's women who are who are having to do those in unpaid time so what was in in the paid economy has moved over to the unpaid economy so that's why structural adjustment programmes are particularly bad for women because it's it's actually and of course there's no recognition of this by the world bank or the IMF # but when they introduce those kinds of programmes they they're actually # i mean the idea is to improve the economy but they're improving the economy by using women's unpaid labour # in in areas where it used to be paid where where those kinds of services were paid for # so it's you can actually see a very direct link</u>
<u who="sf5400">there's also some places where # it has added poverty that's already been there and that people are in fact poorer because of globalisation than perhaps they were before # and i mean one </u>
<u who="nf5395">you mean structural difference <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/></u>
<u who="sf5400">sort of yes yeah</u>
<u who="nf5395">yeah yeah <u who="sf5400"># i mean because for instance in the Caribbean you look at places like Jamaica and compare that to Barbados Barbados who wouldn't take IMF loans and Jamaica that did and the whole economy structure has are are completely different and because Barbados was not prepared to lose the welfare it gave or to reduce its education or health because they saw that as prime factors for any nation that was looking to develop they had to have good education they had to have good welfare and they had to have # good health infrastructure and so for them that was key to their economic development and they would not # adjust those and at the time the Barbados prime minister said well if those are the conditions under which we get a loan we'll not have the loan # and so they rejected it and they rejected their loan a couple of years after someone like Trinidad and Tobago and Trinidad and Tobago is now sunk into poverty because of the rates that they have to pay back on that loan and their education system is well it hasn't demolished it they still have got education but they that was because they decided that they would maintain that at the cost of other things so for some places it hasn't really had the impact that maybe it was meant to have </u>
<u who="nf5395">that's a really interesting comparison </u>
<u who="sf5400">very unique i think i think that kind of <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> is very difficult to </u>
<u who="sf5402">yeah but as we said it it takes the will of the people the people have to be behind politicians in order to push that <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> through because # Barbados the whole of Barbados was up in arms about it lose our education they've gotta be kidding # and so it was it made <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> life easier because he knew that he could reject it because the people were behind him and so <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> it is and we talked about that in terms of mobilisation of women mobilising themselves and how at a grass roots level they could do that but they needed to have confidence and perhaps some form of education in which they could have the confidence to actually say well hold on a minute you know we've just been used as cheap labour and as <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> # and and look at the whole implications of that but because the they look at the financial aspects and because that's what's portrayed with capitalism i guess it's a false ideology # what what it can bring forth </u>
<u who="nf5395">well did did any other # did you discuss # what women should might do to tackle some of the negative effects negative effects of structural adjustment programmes it's called</u>
<u who="sf5400"><gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> it's quite an old concept but we thought it might be useful for grass roots women to actually go back to that because with</u>
<u who="nf5395">it's an old concept in the west i'm not sure it is in other places </u>
<u who="sf5400">that's right and that's that's what i was going to say for for the west it is an old concept but for # underdeveloped or developing countries it would be a new <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> but it would be a force that they could use but it would mean that they would have to # mobilise themselves and have a form of action in order to do that but they say strength is in or power is in strength and if you can get the people to actually condense themselves and to organise in that kind of movement then that could be one way where they could actually start demanding more for their labour # and get clearer boundaries as to what because this thing they talk a lot about this flexibility but i mean flexibility begins begins with its insecurities and for both men and women </u>
<u who="nf5395">ok did anybody read of any examples </u>
<u who="sf5396">we were saying we noticed that most of the stuff we looked at was quite pessimistic that # that it sort of charted # the action as being sort of female activism as as being generally quite specific and and localised as as in saying therefore not necessarily having any major impact on sort of structural adjustment programmes on a sort of national level because they were having sort of whilst you know you can't i don't want to say that any kind of programmes isn't worthwhile because it is and in these local contexts it's got to be seen as a positive thing that they're doing something and that their voice is being heard but it's not actually effective you know on a greater scale # and also there's an an example in the <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> article we were talking about # the return to fundamentalism in some places that as a sort of backlash against # this sort of notion of of modernisation and globalisation there's there's this kind of we'll we'll refer back to to sort of kind of traditionalist fundamentalist ideas which aren't you know either way this isn't improving the situation for for anyone but not not for women certainly so # it's all a bit depressing really isn't it </u>
<u who="nf5395">ok we talked a lot about # structural and economic aspects of globalisation but what about the cultural argument how far does cultural globalisation spread do you think we're all becoming one culture</u>
<u who="sf5396">Americanisation i think</u>
<u who="nf5395">yeah to an extent </u>
<u who="sf5396">in lots of ways </u>
<u who="nf5395">what do you think about that</u>
<u who="su"><gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> what</u>
<u who="sf5396">Americanisation  i mean you know there's McDonald's in Moscow it's gotta be bad you know and i think that's the thing that it's not necessarily # in the same way that economically # you know interdependence is kind of # a rather friendly term because what it actually means is that there is but a few leading world powers and lots of countries that are really heavily dependent economically but i think there's a a worry that you know culturally that could start to happen as well it's like some cultural ideas could dominate when they shouldn't you know</u>
<u who="sf5402">i think there is an idea that there is one particular way that we should strive to be like it's cool to wear a jeans and drink Coca Cola kind of thing i think that's actually penetrated a lot of cultures other cultures </u>
<u who="nf5395">yes and the examples you've just quoted are very significant because they you know they're mass produced commodities aren't they </u>
<u who="sf5402">yeah it's it's </u>
<u who="nf5395">so there's a there's a kind of strong cultural drive towards # encouraging people to have to have the desire to buy those things </u>
<u who="sf5402">yeah it's i think we were saying that globalisation plays a lot on people's greed that's why it's very difficult to cut cut it because she was saying can you actually hold it hold it back and you were saying that you know it's i can't see it happening in our lifetime because it plays so much on greed 'cause it's the idea that you know if they have it why shouldn't we have it so it's </u>
<u who="sf5400">there was an interesting thing there with this Miss World competition coming up though it might seem not relevant but it was because they were talking about culture and cultural boundaries and they were saying that now for Miss India there were specific this debate it was on radio four was really looking at India and Indian women and how they have actually now # if you like modelled the typical western woman that they would like to see on the stage for Miss World and so the poor the fat people who have # cultural who who are dressed in cultural dress who speak with any kind of dialect is not going to be looked at for the Miss World competition because they go out to win and they were saying that India has won six time five times in the last six years or the last six times and because for now they have decided if they're entering it and they said rather than now pick a woman a Miss India woman it will be all these factors of the west are taken into consideration so cultural norms as India sees them are no longer valid for a Miss World Miss Universe # competition and i think that shows the ways in which talking about culture cultures are emerging because they see this as the as what is expected what will win</u>
<u who="sf5402">with with that Miss World thing i think there's # a whole section of these cultures who're actually fighting fighting it a lot because what you said about Miss World when Miss World came back back to India after winning the competition there was a great uproar when she came at the airport and stuff because she'd actually worn a swimming suit on stage and they were saying you shouldn't have done that 'cause that's not part of us so <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> so there's a lot of fighting about it as well fighting <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/></u>
<u who="nf5395">yeah that's right i think that's true # and also i mean i think you now the example you've showed is very significant because it's a particular model of woman who that is being exported isn't it and it's not the one that any of us would want to to export you know # you know it's</u>
<u who="sf5400">that's the whole point and i think taking back this point about # McDonald's in Moscow i mean i was just saying to these McDonald's lost in three months in Barbados literally they built it it was like forced they didn't Barbados did not want it McDonald's decided</u>
<u who="nf5395">how wonderful that really cheers me up</u>
<gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/></u>
<u who="sf5400">it was there for three months and they actually said they had ten customers in three months and it was pulled down <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> people up Barbados is just if we want it we'll get it if we don't we won't don't come in here without our permission 'cause</u>
<u who="sf5396"><gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> when it opened in Moscow is that basically the price of a Big Mac for a lot of people was a week's wages but they would spend it because there was this kind of you know this idea of you know this is something i don't know luxurious almost and something exciting and new look we must you know this this notion of of really having to buy into this kind of western culture is is is really you know powerful</u>
<u who="sf5403">i think that might be a result of the international technology as well i mean internet and mass media you know they keep pushing this subject ahead yeah so that is i think that is part of the globalisation as well i mean globalisation of international communication and technology you know even the people in in Africa or you know in in Burma or in Cambodia they have access to the internet now so you know this kind of information does fly into the into your country you know </u>
<u who="nf5395">right but the question is can it come back the other way you know i mean it is two ways it is possible to resist it # </u>
<u who="sf5396"><gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> but # you know maybe the American culture they could be informed more by # sort of other cultures <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> coming the other direction because i think at the moment it's a bit of a sort of token and stick # effort you know so i don't know Madonna wears a sari <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> you know it's sort of not enough it's i think you know it'd be really nice to be informed rather than having just certain stereotypical or <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> taking on of other peoples' cultures </u>
<u who="sf5402">the thing is what you said about the sari what you'll find in the fashion world now sari's become a big thing but it's in such a western way <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> you'll find women in India actually wearing their saris like they're done on the stage as it is in London which doesn't it's completely beside the point so it's</u>
<u who="nf5395">so what do you think about the globalisation of culture then do you think it</u>
<u who="sf5400">i think it's a sign of <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> because i think we're losing so much by a lot of cultures are </u>
<u who="nf5395">but you think it's really happening</u>
<u who="sf5404">human rights is kind of an effect of globalisation and that's a very positive thing </u>
<u who="nf5395">hm yes that's true </u>
<u who="sf5404">and the women rights also is you know </u>
<u who="nf5395">yeah yeah </u>
<u who="sf5396">i i think also # you know it doesn't have to mean # assimilation that that sort of that we're talking about cultural globalisation doesn't have to mean that we will all become the same but but </u>
<u who="sf5402">but the problem is yeah </u>
<u who="sf5396">but do you think that's the way it's happening in the world</u>
<u who="sf5402">i think the problem is when you actually get down to an individual level you'll find that i mean i'm just talking about the <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> i mean you'll find that every almost every single person wants to actually look like a western person so but i think on an individual level that's how it really works i mean it's it's a lot of try really hard to look American it's very <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> i think</u>
<u who="nf5395">and the danger i think is what what someone said earlier that that in order to resist that people will retreat into things like you know # well for instance fundamentalist Hinduism which is happening in India # and what what people who are trying to resist it in India who are who are not going in that direction and don't agree with that direction are saying is that you know let us go our way it's not just a choice between # # kind of American global culture # and fundamentalist Hinduism but that there are alternatives we can take what we want from from any culture but maintain our own without retreating into this very #</u>
<u who="sf5396">i think it'd be nice if we could use our positive points and sort of celebrate difference and learn about each other's cultures you know i think there would be potential for that to happen and i think you know that'd be nice because what worries me about # with globalisation people started talking about this sense of losing their identity and that worries me as well because that could so easily just sort of tip over into notions you know sort of really racist notions of # and that you know if people feel too strongly they have to protect their own identity that's when you're gonna get a conflict and i you know that's what i think that the <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> feel that their identity is is jeopardised but you know</u>
<u who="sf5400">what i'm saying <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> people don't want to be pointed at because they're different you you want to fit in and so you conform and there is this whole sense i know you say that it but but i mean racism is built around the notion of assimilation that you should assimilate that you should look the same that it's accepted you know that if you want to be accepted you conform you conform to the norms and values of a particular culture which is western culture # because anything else is really not acceptable and so while it's nice as you say that maybe if people were to celebrate other cultures and actually look at cultures in positive ways what you can learn take the good from whichever ones you like but in in real terms that doesn't happen because there's an expected way that you're expected <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> there's an expected expectation of you and particularly when you're a child and you're growing up and you don't want to be different and so the notion of west will always be influential because of grown colonialisation and # what has happened in slavery et cetera et cetera i mean in fact African people have in across the African diaspora there is this notion go back to our roots which was very heavily influential in the eighties you know hence <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> movement became really big on the agenda because it was about identification people wanted to be identified for their for themselves as part of being part of a a melting pot if you like </u>
<u who="sf5402">i think what you said about people don't want to be pointed at as different when you find now i think # a Muslim woman wearing the full veil you it's like when you see it it's like oh horror god fundamental what's her husband done to her so it's that it is isn't it i mean you don't even myself being a Muslim and even when i see it a Muslim woman with a complete veil like face covered and stuff i don't think her <trunc>cul</trunc>  well i mean her culture in that bit you think that she must be so fundamental and her husband must be so fundamental that she's forced into that veil i mean you don't think it might be her choice actually to 'cause it is her it is her religion it is her culture and there is a lot of pointing at if you do find a woman dressed in</u>
<u who="nf5395">yeah and you know very # rigid use of what of what liberation means # and the the example that comes to mind is actually <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> it's you know in Iran when #  when the the Shah # actually forced women to take the veil off you know well and he was doing that because of he he was aligned with # west the western powers and trying to push westernisation and trying to change to actually you know bring about western culture # part of that was as he saw it and as the west saw it liberating women but what an extraordinary way to liberate women to rip off their clothing you know it's not it's a very one dimensional view of what liberation means <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> could i ask you because Japan has industrialised # and do you think how far do you think # western culture has also been absorbed with the industrialisation or not</u>
<u who="sf5398">yes # Japan is # not so completely with west # in some way yes we have traditional but # i think Japan is # peculiar specific # country because westernisation and the # Japan alteration of Japan is integration integration so we for example clothes # we ordinary we wear clothes just like the clothes but # the wedding ceremony # or # the graduation ceremony we wear the Japanese traditional kimono and # for example the the religion is # we you have many gods and # Christian and Bhuddist Shintuism Shintuism is a traditional Japanese it's a very very # i think it's a strange country for # for foreigners but we we are we are so accustomed to integration westernisation tradition really </u>
<u who="nf5395">i think Japan is such a wonderful example because you have fully followed capitalism advanced capitalism in Japan and but it's still very Japanese i mean you haven't lost Japanese culture it's very integrated # you've taken aspects of other cultures that you like but it's it's still very Japanese</u>
<u who="sf5402">yes things like the economy </u>
<u who="nf5395">yeah</u>
<u who="sf5402">it's it's strictly it's very Japanese and that's </u>
<u who="sf5398">economy but # the well as far as the women's as far as for women i think it's # behind of industrialised countries we still patriarchy insist in Japan and # still women's # expected to play role of mother yes it's very strict <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/></u>
<u who="sf5396">they are here too and so they are in America it's you know i think i thinks that's a a common perception i've i've sort of certainly realised like # this term with meeting more and more sort of international students who said oh you know # it must be so much better for you here and i'm like well you know in in sort of some ways there may be sort of certain you know i mean maybe the economic situation and things like that that i you know i can't argue although you know we got it just as bad but you know i said well you know patriarchy isn't you know we're still talking about it i mean it's not as though it's been eradicated so and i think # people i've spoken to were actually quite surprised by that because they'd come here thinking they would see these empowered happy women all over the place who were all like you know no problems at all # they were kind of a bit surprised with that as in you know how it is so i think it's quite you know it's interesting </u>
<u who="nf5395">yeah i agree with <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> there it's a mistake to think that # gender and power relations don't exist here</u>
<u who="sf5402">it's been an assumption though i think that it doesn't</u>
<u who="nf5395">that it does it's an assumption that it does you mean </u>
<u who="sf5402">no that it doesn't like when you get away from the west i think there's a big assumption that everyone all the women here must be very empowered and very powerful </u>
<u who="nf5395">and why why do you think that is why do people outside the west think women are you know liberated here when we know it's not true </u>
<u who="sf5396">male PR</u>
<u who="nf5395">well it is <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> but i mean i mean it goes back to our first week you know looking at gender and imperialism because the west used to and still does use that whole idea of gender relations to maintain its power so so i mean people think that oh well obviously women in the west must be really free because they're criticising us for it but it's not true</u>
<u who="sf5401">i think it's # when structural adjustment programmes when they come to Africa they're more perceptive welcomed by women than by men because i in the in the programmes that you see in southern Africa it is mostly based on agriculture how to improve land and how to how to # through development so that you don't deteriorate land so much and have different forms of cultivation and blah blah blah teaching women but in order to do this programme you need to take the women out of the house to show her how to do these things and that causes family breakdowns men become aggressive you're never here the house is not clean the house it's not cooked the children you know what i mean so i think structural adjustment programmes in southern Africa i can speak of is is not so much well accepted by men than by women</u>
<u who="nf5395">really</u>
<u who="sf5401">yeah and # the the problem with women and structural problems also is they've got a very high expectation # of the result they've been promised if we come in we'll do this to you if you do the programme this way in which you haven't done it in the past this and this will be the result if it is not achieved women become very what's the English word</u>
<u who="su">disheartened </u>
<u who="sf5401">yeah dismayed disillusioned ach you people come in from the west and you told me it won't be like this you're nothing else but the imperialists and you know what i mean so when you come into a country that has not experienced structural adjustment programmes before you must be very careful and honest you know what i mean be honest with the people and say look we can try but if it doesn't work it will not work so it depends on you don't come in there if it will work and just give us a chance because this is how they come in through NGOs in in Namibia especially and women they are scared of their men and women they are scared of authority even the government and state so anything that fails will just make them not participate any more so it takes a while again to uplift the women's movements again mobilise women's activities you know what i mean so sometimes the expectations of the women are too high it's like everything will be fixed within a week and it's not like that they must be honest and say these things will take time the next five years your own daughter will maybe have a better standard or something of something so but that's not what's really happening so it is also how you come in with a policy and not just say the policy is there the money is there now give your feedback it's also the approach to the grass root level which i feel is important</u>
<u who="nf5395">but are you saying Kathleen that you think structural adjustment programmes are beneficial</u>
<u who="sf5401">i would say they're beneficial if there's clarity and what do you say transparency in the process but there is</u>
<u who="nf5395">why do you think they're beneficial</u>
<u who="sf5401">because it does help i mean there's an example i work in there's an NGO coming in through # say Oxfam UK Oxfam Canada and they would go to rural area but they will first approach the ministry they love working through the government first and then # women are the ones collecting the water in Namibia in the rural areas so they would target the ministry of water first and # say # we've got this new pipe system pumping system they can pump ten litres of water in a minute so we'll go out into the regions and # install them and show the locals how it worked and then the women don't have to go so far fetch they walk like five kilometres to fetch the water now they will go into the regions these consultants and they would install their pump and they'll show the men of the community how it is worked and then the men would go off into towns and go and work and then the women are the ones who operate these pumps within three months the pumps are broken and the consultant is gone the programme was just for three months </u>
<u who="nf5395">right but i mean</u>
<u who="sf5403">that's not a restructuring programme</u>
<u who="nf5395">you're talking about development projects i mean i was # </u>
<u who="sf5401">okay</u>
<u who="nf5395">i was asking about structural adjustment programmes which are trying to # restructure the economy so that you know they're trying to # stop government spending # liberalise the economy and improve basically improve capitalism improve profits that's what that's what it's trying to do increase profits # very sound economy # i mean actually very similar to what # president Reagan did in the US and what # prime minister Thatcher did in in the UK they're i mean actually they're structural adjustment programmes too they're just not called that but it's it was all about restructuring the economy getting rid of industry that needed subsidy everything had to be self financing # so it i mean it had been happening all over the world i mean even here people complained a lot about the effects of it # so i mean the the question is whether it has been beneficial in in third world countries and i mean sometimes it is and for some people for some groups it can be very beneficial</u>
<u who="sf5401">she said that the # the social welfare was a lot cut back in Namibia it's now increasing they increased the maintenance for illegitimate children and for women's work equal payment in the workforce you know things like that so it's not really that down it's an improvement i would say when it comes to adjustment</u>
<u who="nf5395">so the state's actually yeah </u>
<u who="sf5401">yeah </u>
<u who="nf5395">given services </u>
<u who="sf5397">but does that mean that structural programmes are <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/></u>
<u who="sf5401">yeah they are but # two years a year after independence they came in strongly but now they're not so much any more 'cause some fail and some don't and some women don't want and something it's so you know but there's the the state itself has given more to welfare now they increased they spend more on and now with the <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> war in the central Africa Namibia has sent troops there and this government they spend a lot of money on defence and the women are the first to speak up no why do you spend money on defence why don't you spend it on <trunc>we</trunc>  or on # education on so that that movement of women's movement uprising in the country to speak against what they also need and what is necessary is stronger now than it was before </u>
<u who="sf5403">and it's a part of the globalisation <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/></u>
<u who="sf5401"><gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> i would say so </u>
<u who="nf5395">so # do you feel that you know what globalisation is now <vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" dur="2"/></u>
<u who="nf5395">not really well and you know again it's one of those concepts that people disagree on # although it's it's defined as increasing integration of the of the world economy # lots of people disagree about how that happens why it's happening and what its manifestations are and and they disagree about whether it's beneficial or or detrimental overall you know largely depending on on what their view of capitalist industrialisation is because really that's that's the root of globalisation and then there're all these other questions about whether how for that impact on culture too so it is a complex question but # i mean i think it's interesting because it's it's a very current concept and it's linked to the debt crisis and attempts to deal with the debt crisis in all parts of the world not just in the third world # ok would you like some notes of mine on gender and globalisation # who didn't get a a course evaluation form <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> would you like to take one of those can you bring it next week please and also if you want to take if you want this list just a couple of things bring that back next week please and that is a review form and that's just a couple of handouts ok and have you have you all arranged to meet for next week you're all organised for next week your presentations</u>
