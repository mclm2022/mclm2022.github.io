Order Act of nineteen-ninety-four <pause dur="1.0"/> # which # as you should know by now is <pause dur="0.2"/> closely modelled on <pause dur="0.6"/> the # Northern Irish <pause dur="0.3"/> # legislation which is the Criminal # <pause dur="0.7"/> Procedure <pause dur="1.0"/> # or or it <pause dur="0.4"/> the Northern Ireland Criminal # <pause dur="0.2"/> Procedure Order of nineteen-eighty-eight <pause dur="1.9"/> # <pause dur="1.3"/> we're going to look at the individual provisions of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act <pause dur="0.3"/> # and focus in on the different stages <pause dur="0.5"/> # at which silence can be treated as evidence <pause dur="1.0"/> # and the first # <pause dur="0.2"/> stage <pause dur="0.2"/> is <pause dur="0.3"/> in relation to silence <pause dur="0.5"/> during <pause dur="0.3"/> a formal police interview <pause dur="1.2"/> # which is dealt with by section thirty-four of the act <pause dur="1.7"/> if we ask ourselves well what is section thirty-four all about <pause dur="1.3"/> think we're aware by now it's <pause dur="0.4"/> # to prevent ambush defences <pause dur="1.0"/> # to prevent the possibility of the defendant raising an unexpected <pause dur="0.3"/> defence <pause dur="0.3"/> at trial <pause dur="0.8"/> which might wrong-foot <pause dur="0.2"/> the prosecution <pause dur="0.7"/> and which might lead to an unmerited acquittal <pause dur="1.5"/> # <pause dur="1.1"/> so it it it does that by really putting the the defendant under pressure to speak <pause dur="0.5"/> in the hope that # <pause dur="0.4"/> if he's going to raise a defence it will be 
raised at # <pause dur="0.3"/> <trunc>i</trunc> in the interview <pause dur="0.9"/> # secondly <pause dur="0.7"/> # the <pause dur="0.8"/> procedure is <pause dur="0.2"/> designed to encourage more defendants to speak <pause dur="1.0"/> # and that of course is <pause dur="1.0"/> not simply for the purpose of <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> finding out what any defence might be <pause dur="0.8"/> but also i think that there is an assumption <pause dur="0.7"/> that once a defendant or suspect is speaking <pause dur="0.8"/> # there's more likelihood of getting <pause dur="0.2"/> either damaging admissions <pause dur="0.6"/> or some <pause dur="0.2"/> confession <pause dur="0.3"/> for him <pause dur="1.1"/> and that of course is <pause dur="0.2"/> # linked <pause dur="0.6"/> to # <pause dur="0.2"/> some faith <pause dur="0.8"/> in the interviewing skill of the police <pause dur="0.6"/> in as it were breaking down <pause dur="0.7"/> # a story which the defendant might raise <pause dur="0.6"/> # as we saw last week i think <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> all the empirical evidence suggests the police aren't really actually very good at that <pause dur="0.8"/> but there's no doubt about it that this is one of the purposes of the legislation <pause dur="0.7"/> get the suspect to speak <pause dur="0.6"/> the idea is once he's speaking <pause dur="0.7"/> even if he's <pause dur="0.2"/> trying to raise a false defence it could be broken down <pause dur="1.6"/> i'm not going to raise section thirty-four <pause dur="0.3"/> # i've set it out on the sheet you can have a look at it <pause dur="0.6"/> # what i would like to do 
is to really <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> pinpoint some of the key aspects of it <pause dur="2.3"/> # <pause dur="2.4"/> first of all # it applies only <pause dur="0.3"/> in relation to <pause dur="0.4"/> # a defendant who raises a defence in court <pause dur="3.5"/> so the starting point is the defendant who puts up some defence <pause dur="0.8"/> # and that probably means <pause dur="0.3"/> something more <pause dur="0.2"/> than simply putting the prosecution to proof <pause dur="1.2"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> <trunc>a</trunc> as you know one <pause dur="0.5"/> possible way of defending yourself in court <pause dur="0.6"/> is just to allow your lawyer or counsel <pause dur="0.4"/> to attack the prosecution evidence <pause dur="0.7"/> to <pause dur="0.5"/> test it for weaknesses <pause dur="0.9"/> # <pause dur="1.7"/> if that's all the defendant does if he doesn't rely upon any particular facts <pause dur="0.3"/> in court himself if he doesn't bring forward any evidence <pause dur="0.7"/> # then <pause dur="0.2"/> section thirty-four won't apply <pause dur="1.2"/> second <trunc>retat</trunc> requirement is that <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> or is that <pause dur="0.6"/> at any time before he's charged <pause dur="0.8"/> # on being questioned under caution by a constable <pause dur="1.1"/> where that constable is investigating an offence <pause dur="0.9"/> # the defendant has failed <pause dur="0.2"/> to mention <pause dur="1.5"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> some facts <pause dur="1.1"/> or fact <pause dur="1.0"/> which he <pause dur="0.3"/> later relies upon in his defence <pause dur="0.6"/> there must be a defence raised <pause dur="0.4"/> there must be a failure to mention that <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> at <pause dur="0.4"/> interview formal 
interview under caution <pause dur="1.2"/> # or alternatively <pause dur="0.2"/> a failure to mention <pause dur="0.5"/> # the relevant fact when the defendant is actually <pause dur="0.2"/> charged <pause dur="1.0"/> the two possible relevant stages <pause dur="0.4"/> # where the defendant might be silent <pause dur="0.8"/> and in in the course of interview <pause dur="0.6"/> later on when he's informed <pause dur="0.2"/> that he will be charged <pause dur="2.3"/> # <pause dur="2.0"/> in those circumstances inferences can be drawn against the defendant <pause dur="3.1"/> provided <pause dur="0.7"/> that <pause dur="0.3"/> in all the circumstances of the interview <pause dur="0.6"/> it would have been reasonable <pause dur="0.7"/> for him to mention <pause dur="0.2"/> the fact <pause dur="0.6"/> which it is alleged <pause dur="0.5"/> # he has failed to mention <pause dur="4.8"/> okay well that's an outline of section thirty-four <pause dur="0.9"/> what can we say about it <pause dur="0.9"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> well <pause dur="0.4"/> the inferences that can be drawn under this section <pause dur="1.2"/> # can be drawn in a number of circumstances they're all listed in section thirty-four i've picked out two <pause dur="0.7"/> under <trunc>s</trunc> two-C <pause dur="0.6"/> # where the court or <trunc>jur</trunc> # the court is determining <pause dur="0.3"/> whether there is a case to answer <pause dur="0.8"/> and under D <pause dur="0.6"/> # where the where the court or jury is determining <pause dur="0.5"/> whether the accused is guilty of the offence charged <pause dur="0.7"/> so the suggestion there is that <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> inferences can support <pause dur="1.0"/> 
the first stage <pause dur="0.3"/> is there a case to answer <pause dur="0.5"/> and also support a finding of guilt <pause dur="1.8"/> # <pause dur="1.8"/> there's one oddity here <pause dur="0.7"/> # it had certainly been the intention <pause dur="0.5"/> of the legislation in nineteen-ninety-four <pause dur="1.0"/> that <pause dur="0.4"/> # inferences from silence <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> might have <pause dur="0.3"/> # operated not only at trial <pause dur="0.9"/> but also at <pause dur="0.4"/> the earlier stage of committal proceedings <pause dur="1.2"/> # the stage at which <pause dur="1.1"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> traditionally the court has satisfied itself <pause dur="0.6"/> that there is sufficient evidence <pause dur="0.5"/> for the defendant to be put on trial <pause dur="1.3"/> # and it was certainly the intention and the act actually allowed for that <pause dur="1.4"/> however <pause dur="0.2"/> # in nineteen-ninety-six # the nature of committal proceedings were changed <pause dur="0.8"/> committal proceedings were streamlined <pause dur="0.6"/> by the Criminal Proceedings and Investigations Act <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> and <pause dur="0.4"/> under the new streamlined form of committal proceedings <pause dur="0.9"/> only the prosecution <pause dur="0.5"/> gives its evidence <pause dur="0.8"/> # normally in documentary form <pause dur="1.2"/> there's no scope for the defendant to give evidence at committal proceedings <pause dur="1.2"/> # and there's no scope for the defendant to <pause dur="0.6"/> question <pause dur="1.0"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> items of 
prosecution evidence <pause dur="0.6"/> # or to cross-examine prosecution witnesses <pause dur="1.2"/> so if you like the adversarialism <pause dur="0.4"/> has been taken out of committal proceedings in nineteen-ninety-six <pause dur="0.6"/> very little scope for the defence <pause dur="1.0"/> the effect of that is of course that at committal proceedings <pause dur="0.4"/> # there's no way <pause dur="0.6"/> the defendant can <pause dur="0.2"/> rely upon a <pause dur="0.3"/> # can raise a defence <pause dur="0.8"/> # and rely upon facts in doing so <pause dur="1.0"/> defendant isn't allowed to do anything much at committal proceedings any more <pause dur="0.5"/> as a result <pause dur="0.5"/> # whereas i think # before nineteen-ninety-six <pause dur="0.6"/> # it would have been possible to rely upon <pause dur="0.2"/> a possibility of an inference against the defendant <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> in order to <pause dur="0.8"/> indicate that there was sufficient evidence to put him on trial <pause dur="0.6"/> that's been swept away and inferences will be relevant only <pause dur="0.7"/> # <trunc>a</trunc> in the court of trial <pause dur="2.1"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> second point to <trunc>me</trunc> notice is that <pause dur="0.2"/> although <pause dur="0.4"/> i think drawing an inference <pause dur="0.6"/> # clearly means <pause dur="0.3"/> treating the silence as evidence <pause dur="0.9"/> section thirty-eight-three <pause dur="0.5"/> of the <trunc>nineteen-ni</trunc> ninety-four act <pause dur="0.5"/> does make clear <pause dur="0.6"/> it's 
necessary to do so <pause dur="0.7"/> that <pause dur="0.4"/> you can't sustain a conviction <pause dur="0.8"/> purely <pause dur="0.4"/> on the basis of <pause dur="0.2"/> an inference from silence <pause dur="1.4"/> # and that makes sense in a way <pause dur="0.3"/> i mean <pause dur="0.7"/> it would be very odd wouldn't it if # <pause dur="1.3"/> when you got to trial the only <pause dur="0.8"/> bits of the prosecution case that stood up were inferences <pause dur="0.4"/> from the fact that the defendant has said nothing <pause dur="1.6"/> # and section thirty-eight-three says you cannot <pause dur="0.2"/> be convicted <pause dur="0.5"/> purely on the basis of an inference <pause dur="0.5"/> from the fact that <pause dur="0.5"/> the defendant was silent under accusation <pause dur="0.8"/> there is however one oddity in section thirty-eight-three <pause dur="1.5"/> does tell us <pause dur="1.1"/> that <pause dur="0.7"/> there can be no <pause dur="0.2"/> conviction solely <pause dur="0.2"/> on the basis of <pause dur="0.2"/> an inference <pause dur="0.7"/> singular <pause dur="1.3"/> and i suppose at least technically <pause dur="1.0"/> that would leave open the possibility <pause dur="0.7"/> # that a defendant <pause dur="0.2"/> might be <pause dur="0.2"/> found guilty <pause dur="0.9"/> # on the basis of multiple inferences <pause dur="1.7"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> when we look at this legislation <pause dur="0.9"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> an inference can be drawn <pause dur="0.9"/> from the fact that you <pause dur="0.4"/> don't raise your defence in the police station <pause dur="0.5"/> under section thirty-four <pause dur="1.1"/> but also inferences can be 
drawn <pause dur="0.2"/> as we shall see <pause dur="1.3"/> # from your failure to account <pause dur="0.5"/> for the bloodstains on your clothes <pause dur="0.6"/> or from your failure to account <pause dur="0.2"/> for the fact that you were at the scene of the crime <pause dur="1.0"/> and inferences can be drawn <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> where you'd fail to # <pause dur="1.1"/> give evidence testify in court <pause dur="0.8"/> well <pause dur="0.8"/> section thirty-eight-three doesn't say that <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> it's impossible for you to be convicted on if you like a collection of inferences <pause dur="0.4"/> from progressive silence <pause dur="0.4"/> throughout the process <pause dur="0.5"/> in the police station at charge <pause dur="0.4"/> and at trial <pause dur="0.4"/> having said that it's # <pause dur="0.4"/> as i said almost inconceivable <pause dur="0.6"/> # that a judge would allow a <pause dur="0.4"/> a case to go to the jury where <pause dur="0.8"/> the only substantial evidence was inferences <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> and one would hope that juries would <pause dur="0.4"/> would have the good sense if you like if they discounted other evidence <pause dur="0.5"/> not to rely simply on the fact that <pause dur="0.4"/> the defendant had failed to answer <pause dur="0.6"/> charges against him or her <pause dur="2.0"/> okay well <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> the whole edifice of # <pause dur="0.8"/> inferences from silence in the police station <pause dur="0.5"/> is built upon <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> a form of words <pause dur="0.8"/> which must be spoken 
to the defendant <pause dur="0.9"/> # before he's questioned <pause dur="0.4"/> which is called a caution <pause dur="1.2"/> # the old caution which # <pause dur="0.9"/> is # <pause dur="1.2"/> # # sanctified in numerous # <pause dur="0.6"/> police and detective stories et cetera <pause dur="1.0"/> was along the lines you don't have to say anything <pause dur="1.0"/> # but i warn you if you do anything you do say may be taken down in evidence <pause dur="1.0"/> very familiar sort of wording for those of us who used to watch Dixon of Dock Green and Z Cars <pause dur="1.0"/><vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" n="ss" dur="1"/>  # <pause dur="2.7"/> that caution though had to go and the reason it had to go was of course <pause dur="0.8"/> # if we are going to allow inferences from silence <pause dur="0.8"/> it would have been a bit of a trap wouldn't it <pause dur="0.7"/> we actually said to defendants <pause dur="0.2"/> you don't have to say anything <pause dur="1.2"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> with the defendant said okay i'll i won't <pause dur="0.3"/> and then found that they were subject to inferences <pause dur="0.7"/> subject to their <pause dur="0.3"/> silence being treated as evidence that would have been unfair and a trap <pause dur="0.7"/> # accordingly # when the new legislation came into force in nineteen-ninety-five <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> a new caution was drafted <pause dur="0.7"/> # and included in the # <pause dur="0.5"/> code of practice <pause dur="0.5"/> relating to interrogation <pause dur="0.8"/>

seem a bit odd doesn't it if we <pause dur="0.7"/> allow for the legal adviser by law we <trunc>s</trunc> <pause dur="0.8"/> tell the defendant <pause dur="0.3"/> you can rely upon this <pause dur="0.2"/> this character the legal adviser <pause dur="1.2"/> and then when the legal adviser's advice is given it would seem very odd if we then said well <shift feature="voice" new="laugh"/>hard luck <shift feature="voice" new="normal"/><pause dur="0.6"/> it was bad advice <pause dur="1.2"/> because # <pause dur="0.3"/> he may have told you to <pause dur="0.2"/> be silent but # hard luck we're going to treat your silence as evidence against you <pause dur="1.1"/> very strange if the defendant was led into that trap <pause dur="1.7"/> on the other hand # looking at it from the alternative perspective <pause dur="1.1"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> the purpose <pause dur="1.1"/> of changing the law in nineteen-ninety-four <pause dur="1.1"/> was to put pressure on suspects <pause dur="0.3"/> to speak at interview wasn't it <pause dur="2.1"/> now <pause dur="0.8"/> if <pause dur="0.9"/> any legal adviser <pause dur="1.5"/> could simply go into <pause dur="0.8"/> # the police station <pause dur="0.8"/> advise the client to say nothing <pause dur="0.9"/> in the certain knowledge <pause dur="0.2"/> that by doing that <pause dur="0.5"/> the client would be insulated <pause dur="1.1"/> from adverse inferences <pause dur="0.9"/> would be insulated from the adverse effects of being silent <pause dur="0.7"/> # <trunc>i</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> if a legal adviser could do that <pause dur="0.4"/> many would say well there's very little having the legislation <pause dur="1.5"/> 
if you like the the <pause dur="0.3"/> legal adviser can negate the <pause dur="0.5"/> could be able to negate the effect of the legislation <pause dur="0.4"/> simply by advising silent <pause dur="0.6"/> <trunc>fi</trunc> silence <pause dur="0.4"/> i think that was really the dilemma <pause dur="0.3"/> which the court had to deal with <pause dur="1.5"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> the approach of the court <pause dur="0.9"/> # <trunc>i</trunc> in a very # <pause dur="0.4"/> important judgement given by # <pause dur="0.6"/> Mr Justice Stuart Lord Justice Stuart-Smith <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="0.9"/> was to say that <pause dur="1.1"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> the <pause dur="0.5"/> lawyer's advice did not <pause dur="0.3"/> preclude <pause dur="0.2"/> the drawing of inferences <pause dur="1.2"/> # <pause dur="1.0"/> the court pointed out that <trunc>i</trunc> although the <trunc>advi</trunc> lawyer had advised <pause dur="0.3"/> silence on medical grounds <pause dur="0.9"/> # the police doctor had made known <pause dur="0.5"/> his view <pause dur="0.4"/> the <pause dur="0.6"/> Condrons were fit <pause dur="0.9"/> and that was made known to the Condrons <pause dur="0.7"/> and to the <pause dur="0.2"/> legal adviser so that Condrons would have been aware that the force <pause dur="1.0"/> surgeon the doctor <pause dur="0.2"/> medical expert was saying they were fit <pause dur="1.7"/> # <pause dur="0.9"/> and <pause dur="0.8"/> the <pause dur="1.4"/> the the court was very reluctant to <trunc>a</trunc> allow the # lawyer's advice <pause dur="0.2"/> to be a way of preventing <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> inferences being drawn <pause dur="0.4"/> and actually used the phrase that <pause dur="0.6"/> # if that was allowed to prevent inferences that would drive a coach and horses <pause dur="0.6"/> through the nineteen-ninety-four 
act <pause dur="1.1"/> so very very keen <pause dur="0.4"/> if you like to <pause dur="1.7"/> enforce <pause dur="0.6"/> # this new system of trying to put pressure on defendants to speak <pause dur="2.0"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> the <pause dur="1.0"/> court <pause dur="0.9"/> # also <pause dur="1.1"/> # had to # <pause dur="1.8"/> deal with # <pause dur="0.6"/> # another issue <pause dur="1.1"/> which was <pause dur="0.2"/> well <pause dur="2.7"/> if <pause dur="1.3"/> the <pause dur="0.6"/> if the defendant wants to rely upon legal advice <pause dur="1.2"/> if the court <pause dur="0.3"/> won't accept it as precluding inferences <pause dur="1.1"/> just as a flat statement my lawyer advised me <pause dur="0.9"/> not to say anything <pause dur="0.4"/> <trunc>wo</trunc> wouldn't accept that <pause dur="1.8"/> could it be possible for <pause dur="0.4"/> # lawyer <pause dur="0.2"/> or the client to give greater details about precisely why legal advice was given <pause dur="1.9"/> if you like <pause dur="0.3"/> could the court get into that <pause dur="0.3"/> collateral issue of <pause dur="0.3"/> why was the advice given <pause dur="1.3"/> court said yes <pause dur="1.3"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> what the court said was this <pause dur="0.7"/> they said that <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="1.0"/> legal advice could be at least a factor to be considered by the court <pause dur="0.5"/> in deciding whether or not it was reasonable to draw inferences <pause dur="1.2"/> but <pause dur="0.3"/> if a defendant wanted to rely upon legal advice <pause dur="0.8"/> # it would be necessary <pause dur="0.7"/> to go further than to give a bald statement <pause dur="0.5"/> this is what my lawyer advised me <pause dur="0.6"/> # and to actually give details of why the advice was given <pause dur="1.6"/> now <pause dur="0.9"/> there is a 
bit of a problem there <pause dur="1.0"/> which is of course <pause dur="1.1"/> we normally think of the discussion <pause dur="0.8"/> between <pause dur="0.4"/> legal adviser and client <pause dur="0.7"/> as being subject to what we call legal professional privilege <pause dur="1.9"/> and legal professional privilege <pause dur="0.9"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> is a <pause dur="0.4"/> a right <pause dur="1.5"/> and the person who's been given advice <pause dur="1.2"/> to have the <pause dur="0.7"/> nature of the advice <pause dur="0.9"/> and indeed <pause dur="0.5"/> things passing between the adviser and the client <pause dur="0.4"/> kept <pause dur="0.2"/> secret and confidential <pause dur="1.9"/> so what the court are really saying is well <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.8"/> if you want to rely upon legal <trunc>asvi</trunc> <trunc>as</trunc> <pause dur="0.3"/> legal advice <pause dur="0.4"/> # as a basis for saying that inferences shouldn't be drawn <pause dur="1.0"/> you must tell us what the nature of the advice was <pause dur="0.9"/> # and the court <pause dur="0.9"/> accepted that that would involve waiving <pause dur="0.7"/> legal professional privilege <pause dur="1.3"/> and rather interestingly the court also made it clear that <pause dur="1.1"/> once legal professional privilege had been waived <pause dur="1.2"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> then <pause dur="0.5"/> it it was waived completely <pause dur="1.1"/> # <trunc>th</trunc> the lawyer and the client couldn't agree <pause dur="0.3"/> for instance <pause dur="0.5"/> as to which bits <pause dur="0.5"/> of the advice session <pause dur="0.7"/> they would tell the court about and which bits they would keep secret <pause dur="1.3"/> 
what was suggested in in this case <pause dur="0.7"/> # Condron and Condron <pause dur="0.5"/> and in fact confirmed in a later case called Roble <pause dur="0.6"/> R-O-B-L-E <pause dur="0.6"/> # was that once <pause dur="0.9"/> privilege had been waived <pause dur="0.7"/> then if you like the lawyer and the client <pause dur="0.2"/> be cross-examined about <pause dur="0.3"/> everything <pause dur="0.5"/> that passed <pause dur="0.2"/> between <pause dur="0.4"/> lawyer and client <pause dur="1.7"/> very unusual <pause dur="0.2"/> a very surprising decision in some ways <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="1.6"/> the notion of legal professional privilege <trunc>h</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> <trunc>i</trunc> is is one which is <pause dur="0.4"/> dear to the hearts of many lawyers <pause dur="1.0"/> # in a and in a case called Derby Justices fairly recently the House of Lords <pause dur="0.7"/> # upheld legal professional privilege <pause dur="1.0"/> stating that <pause dur="0.6"/> # if you like it was <pause dur="1.4"/> of paramount public interest <pause dur="0.8"/> that <pause dur="0.6"/> individuals charged with crime should be able to consult lawyers <pause dur="0.4"/> to get advice <pause dur="0.5"/> and <pause dur="0.3"/> be confident that they could be completely frank with their lawyer <pause dur="1.7"/> # <pause dur="2.1"/> in the safe knowledge that what was said would not be disclosed <pause dur="0.6"/> rather interesting this earlier case the House of Lords was saying yes we will uphold legal professional privilege <pause dur="1.3"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> in Condron and Condron <pause dur="0.5"/> the <pause dur="0.2"/> the Court of Appeal is saying <pause dur="0.5"/> 
well <pause dur="0.9"/> if you want to rely upon legal advice you've got to tell us what your lawyer told you <pause dur="0.8"/> what's more <pause dur="0.8"/> # once you've done that the whole of the discussion between lawyer and client can be exposed to cross-examination by the prosecution <pause dur="1.6"/> and of course <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> that might be <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.9"/> # might be a consequence which many defendants would would wish not to occur <pause dur="0.7"/> they might not wish # their discussions with their lawyer to be <pause dur="0.2"/> disclosed <pause dur="1.0"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> the effect of Condron and Condron therefore i think is to <pause dur="1.1"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> create some considerable <pause dur="0.6"/> # dilemmas <pause dur="2.7"/> first of all there are dilemmas for the legal adviser <pause dur="1.5"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> there may be circumstances where the legal adviser thinks that <pause dur="1.4"/> in <pause dur="0.3"/> his or her client's best interests <pause dur="0.7"/> # it it should be a no comment <pause dur="0.3"/> interview a silent <pause dur="0.2"/> interview <pause dur="1.1"/> # for instance where the # <pause dur="0.4"/> person is incredibly upset <pause dur="0.6"/> young <pause dur="0.2"/> immature <pause dur="0.9"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> easily suggestible <pause dur="0.7"/> any of these factors may be factors where the the lawyer may say <pause dur="0.6"/> my client wouldn't <pause dur="0.4"/> wouldn't stand up to interrogation <pause dur="0.7"/> might say something which they didn't really mean <pause dur="0.7"/> might be led into <pause dur="0.3"/> into answering <pause dur="0.7"/> in a way they <trunc>d</trunc> wouldn't want to <pause dur="0.5"/> i should advise silence <pause dur="0.8"/> if the <pause dur="0.3"/> lawyer <pause dur="1.5"/> takes that course the the lawyer <pause dur="0.3"/> just 
doesn't know what the result would be <pause dur="1.1"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> really Condron leaves it hit and miss <pause dur="0.5"/> Condron says well if the lawyer advises silent <pause dur="1.2"/> silence <pause dur="1.4"/> the court at a later stage could say well inferences can be drawn or they could accept <pause dur="0.6"/> the lawyer's advice was bona fide and not draw inferences but <pause dur="0.2"/> the lawyer just doesn't know <pause dur="0.9"/> so whereas lawyers normally <pause dur="0.7"/> if you like <pause dur="0.6"/> # are trying to advise on what can be predicted from certain <trunc>cours</trunc> courses of action <pause dur="0.9"/> this makes it very difficult <pause dur="0.2"/> 'cause they wouldn't be able to predict <pause dur="0.2"/> what the result of silence would be <pause dur="2.0"/> secondly <pause dur="0.2"/><vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> if there was any prospect <pause dur="1.0"/> of <pause dur="0.4"/> the client <pause dur="0.3"/> being <pause dur="0.6"/> wholly or partially silent <pause dur="2.0"/> on legal advice <pause dur="0.9"/> it would seem that the <pause dur="0.5"/> lawyer would have to say to the client well i must warn you <pause dur="1.2"/> if you're going to be silent and you're going to rely upon the advice i've given you <pause dur="1.7"/> bear in mind <pause dur="0.4"/> that if you want to raise that in court as an excuse <pause dur="0.5"/> on the grounds that an inference is not being drawn <pause dur="0.4"/> the court <pause dur="0.9"/> can then have me cross-examined to find out 
everything that's passed between us <pause dur="1.0"/> so <pause dur="0.4"/> i warn you if you want to <trunc>rela</trunc> to be silent in interview <pause dur="0.3"/> think carefully about what you're going to tell me because i might have to tell the court what you've been telling me today <pause dur="1.1"/> and of course that is really the antithesis of the <pause dur="0.5"/> professional confidential relationship between lawyer and client we normally expect <pause dur="1.0"/> so that decision really does raise a number of difficulties for legal practice <pause dur="0.5"/> # and for <pause dur="0.2"/> defendants <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="1.0"/> having said that in terms of <pause dur="1.4"/> furthering the <pause dur="0.3"/> # aims of the government in passing the legislation <pause dur="0.5"/> # it's a very efficient decision doesn't it isn't it <pause dur="1.2"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> it really minimizes the possibility of escaping inferences <pause dur="1.9"/> # and therefore if you like maximizes <pause dur="0.2"/> the pressure on the defendant to speak <pause dur="2.5"/> # <pause dur="7.1"/> Argent # was a case # <pause dur="0.5"/> discussed in Rosemary Pattenden's article in the # <pause dur="0.5"/> materials <pause dur="0.5"/> # which really follows on from Condron <pause dur="0.8"/> # Argent was a a case where <pause dur="1.1"/> # the defendant was charged with # <pause dur="0.6"/> murder <pause dur="1.8"/> it was a stabbing outside a nightclub late at night <pause dur="1.2"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> where the defendant <pause dur="1.1"/> # had

particular circumstances surrounding the interview or interrogation <pause dur="1.6"/> if you look at section thirty-four <pause dur="1.5"/> # inferences can only be drawn <pause dur="0.6"/> when in all the circumstances of the interview <pause dur="0.4"/> it would have been reasonable <pause dur="0.4"/> to mention the fact <pause dur="0.7"/> which is later relied upon in court <pause dur="1.2"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> and so if you like <pause dur="0.2"/> before inferences can be drawn the court really has to analyse <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="0.9"/> the interview <pause dur="0.3"/> look at what questions were asked what was the state of knowledge of the parties et cetera <pause dur="0.9"/> # and the case of N i think the <trunc>n</trunc> the name's Nicholson it's been reported elsewhere since <pause dur="0.3"/> and <trunc>o</trunc> originally it's just R-V-N <pause dur="0.7"/> # is a case where really the court failed <pause dur="0.2"/> to <pause dur="0.2"/> properly analyse <pause dur="0.6"/> # the state of fact state of knowledge at the time of the interview <pause dur="1.6"/> # what happened in this case was that the defendant was charged with # <pause dur="0.6"/> # a sexual offence with a little girl <pause dur="1.1"/> and <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> in court <pause dur="0.6"/> the trial judge <pause dur="1.0"/> invited the jury <pause dur="0.7"/> to # <pause dur="0.8"/> draw inferences <pause dur="0.8"/> from the defendant's failure to to give an account <pause dur="0.2"/> at interview <pause dur="1.5"/> and in particular <pause dur="0.9"/> the jury <pause dur="1.0"/> were invited <pause dur="0.6"/> that 
they could draw inferences from the fact that the <pause dur="0.6"/> defendant had no explanation <pause dur="1.1"/> for the fact that # <trunc>s</trunc> <pause dur="1.0"/> what was tested to be his semen <pause dur="0.6"/> # was found on the little girl's nightdress <pause dur="1.8"/> so the trial judge said well <pause dur="1.0"/> he was interviewed by the police but somehow or other he didn't mention <pause dur="0.5"/> or he didn't give any any reason any explanation how his semen had got on this little girl's nightdress <pause dur="1.0"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> the <trunc>s</trunc> court pointed out <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> at the time <pause dur="0.2"/> of the interview the police had not mentioned <pause dur="0.3"/> to him <pause dur="0.4"/> that semen was found on the nightdress <pause dur="1.2"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> and so <pause dur="0.2"/> it couldn't really be said that it would have would have been reasonable for him to explain this fact away <pause dur="1.4"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> if it hadn't been put to him <pause dur="1.6"/> wasn't clear that he would even have known <pause dur="0.2"/> that how it was an issue <pause dur="0.8"/> # and # <pause dur="0.7"/> his conviction was quashed because of the problem that the <pause dur="1.3"/> the # <pause dur="0.4"/> court <pause dur="0.4"/> the jury may have <pause dur="0.3"/> drawn an inference there quite wrongly <pause dur="1.6"/> # <pause dur="8.6"/> # another case i think where <pause dur="0.3"/> # the court really failed to properly analyse <pause dur="0.5"/> whether the if you like the structure of the case <pause dur="0.5"/> and work out whether it was 
appropriate to draw inferences under section thirty-four <pause dur="0.5"/> the recent case of Bowers Taylor and Millan <pause dur="0.9"/> # that was a <trunc>c</trunc> a case where the three of them were charged with importing # cannabis <pause dur="1.4"/> # <pause dur="1.3"/> one of them # <pause dur="1.2"/> Bowers i think it was who mysteriously is described as <pause dur="0.2"/> G in my <shift feature="voice" new="laugh"/>notes <vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" dur="1"/><shift feature="voice" new="normal"/><pause dur="0.5"/> think that should read a B <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.8"/> one of them had failed <pause dur="0.3"/> to <pause dur="0.2"/> give any sort of explanation for fairly incriminating <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> drug paraphernalia <pause dur="0.8"/> paraphernalia for <pause dur="0.7"/> weighing and cutting and storing drugs et cetera <pause dur="1.5"/> and all three were silent in court <pause dur="2.3"/> all three were silent in court <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.9"/> trial judge <pause dur="0.3"/> invited the jury <pause dur="1.3"/> that <pause dur="0.3"/> they could draw inferences <pause dur="0.9"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> from <pause dur="0.6"/> failures to explain facts at interview <pause dur="2.9"/> they were convicted and appealed <pause dur="1.1"/> and their criticism of the trial judge's # ruling was that <pause dur="0.7"/> of course <pause dur="0.7"/> section thirty-four applies <pause dur="0.6"/> not simply by virtue of silence in police interview <pause dur="1.1"/> but rather <pause dur="0.2"/> where <pause dur="0.7"/> a defence is raised later in court <pause dur="1.2"/> about which <pause dur="0.3"/> the defendant had been silent in interview <pause dur="1.7"/> so it's not just failure to give an explanation 
<trunc>i</trunc> it's a situation where oh you're trying to rely upon a defence in court <pause dur="0.6"/> isn't it fishy that you didn't mention it <pause dur="0.5"/> when you had an opportunity earlier on <pause dur="0.3"/> in interview <pause dur="1.3"/> # <pause dur="0.8"/> and the question rose really whether this was a case where the defendants could have been said to have relied upon any facts <pause dur="0.4"/> in their defence in court <pause dur="1.8"/> what the court said was this they said that <pause dur="1.2"/> it was not a requirement <pause dur="1.4"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> that the defendant must give evidence in court <pause dur="1.5"/> before section thirty-four can apply <pause dur="2.3"/> as the court pointed out <pause dur="0.8"/> # a defendant can rely upon facts in court <pause dur="0.6"/> in various ways <pause dur="1.5"/> the defendant himself <pause dur="0.7"/> might give evidence of those facts and rely upon them <pause dur="1.3"/> the defendant may call a witness <pause dur="0.6"/> to those facts <pause dur="1.0"/> very often the case <pause dur="0.7"/> the defence make their <trunc>d</trunc> <pause dur="0.5"/> decision of we will call this witness they choose that witness <pause dur="0.5"/> 'cause they're relying upon the facts in that witnesses' statement <pause dur="0.6"/> another way of relying upon facts by way of defence <pause dur="1.0"/> and even <pause dur="0.5"/> # the defendant could <pause dur="0.5"/> rely upon facts which 
were elicited from a prosecution witness <pause dur="0.9"/> in the course of cross-examination <pause dur="0.6"/> on behalf of the defendant <pause dur="1.8"/> so <pause dur="0.2"/> it doesn't matter that the defendant's silent in court he can still rely upon facts <pause dur="1.0"/> with the evidence of another witness or perhaps even through cross-examination <pause dur="0.6"/> of a prosecution witness <pause dur="1.0"/> but <pause dur="0.2"/> said the court in this case <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> here the jury should have been directed not to draw inferences because <pause dur="0.5"/> # as well as the defendant being silent <pause dur="0.6"/> # there <trunc>ha</trunc> really was no reliance upon facts <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> this really was a case where the <pause dur="0.6"/> # line of defence was just to test <pause dur="0.9"/> the <pause dur="0.3"/> evidence for the prosecution <pause dur="0.9"/> see how far it went <pause dur="0.7"/> # there were no actual factual allegations no alternative <pause dur="0.8"/> # propositions <pause dur="0.8"/> # on which the defence was based <pause dur="0.5"/> # and therefore <pause dur="0.2"/> it wasn't a case in which section thirty-four <pause dur="0.3"/> should have applied <pause dur="2.2"/> # <pause dur="1.8"/> does that makes sense <pause dur="0.8"/> yeah simple enough <pause dur="0.9"/> move on # <pause dur="0.9"/> a very important case i think is # the very recent case or fairly recent case of McGarry in nineteen-ninety-eight <pause dur="2.0"/> # <pause dur="2.9"/> what happened in McGarry <pause dur="0.2"/> was 
that <pause dur="7.1"/> McGarry # had been silent in <trunc>cour</trunc> # in in interview <pause dur="3.6"/> and <pause dur="0.9"/> # that fact was made known to the jury at his trial <pause dur="1.1"/> # <pause dur="1.4"/> who heard <pause dur="0.2"/> a a a transcript <pause dur="1.3"/> of the # <pause dur="0.7"/> questions <pause dur="0.7"/> and answers <pause dur="0.7"/> between the police and McGarry so <pause dur="0.6"/> McGarry had been silent in interview <pause dur="0.8"/> and the jury <pause dur="0.5"/> were made known <pause dur="0.9"/> made aware of that <pause dur="0.4"/> rather <pause dur="1.1"/> # <pause dur="1.1"/> the <trunc>jur</trunc> the judge simply left the issue to the jury <pause dur="0.4"/> the question of guilt <pause dur="0.5"/> and didn't say anything about section thirty-four or inferences <pause dur="1.5"/> this wasn't a case where section thirty-four could have applied <pause dur="1.0"/> didn't rely upon any particular <pause dur="0.5"/> facts in court <pause dur="0.3"/> she hadn't mentioned in interview <pause dur="0.6"/> so the judge said nothing about section thirty-four <pause dur="1.1"/> the first round of McGarry's appeal was that <pause dur="1.5"/> if section thirty-four doesn't apply <pause dur="1.7"/> McGarry should be entitled <pause dur="1.0"/> to a judge's direction in his favour <pause dur="1.2"/> telling the jury that no inferences could be drawn <pause dur="3.2"/> so if you like <pause dur="0.7"/> # lawyers <pause dur="0.5"/> in the McGarry case were really saying well okay <pause dur="0.7"/> in certain circumstances inferences can be drawn against the defendant <pause dur="0.9"/> so if you like the law <pause dur="0.7"/> can 
operate so as to <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> create evidence <trunc>aga</trunc> against the defendant <pause dur="0.4"/> but <pause dur="0.5"/> where that doesn't operate where section thirty-four isn't applicable <pause dur="0.9"/> the defendant's entitled to <pause dur="0.4"/> if you like <pause dur="0.6"/> an equivalent protection <pause dur="0.8"/> to prevent juries <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> off their own back perhaps assuming that silence was in some way evidence of guilt <pause dur="1.0"/> and yes said the Court of Appeal <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> if section thirty-four wasn't applicable <pause dur="0.7"/> the defendant had been silent <pause dur="0.7"/> # the defendant was entitled to that <pause dur="0.3"/> direction in his favour <pause dur="0.9"/> the judge should tell the jury <pause dur="0.4"/> well members of the jury <pause dur="0.4"/> he's been silent but he's got a right to be <pause dur="0.6"/> and you shouldn't attach any significance <pause dur="0.2"/> to his silence <pause dur="2.1"/> # and that's important <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.9"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> something which defence lawyers <trunc>w</trunc> will no doubt exploit <pause dur="1.6"/> the <pause dur="1.2"/> second # <pause dur="0.3"/> and perhaps <pause dur="0.3"/> # less <pause dur="0.3"/> focused upon <pause dur="0.2"/> issue in this case <pause dur="1.2"/> # was <pause dur="1.2"/> that the <pause dur="0.3"/> # lawyer <pause dur="0.6"/> advising McGarry <pause dur="0.9"/> # <pause dur="1.2"/> adopted a tactic which <pause dur="0.2"/> has <trunc>w</trunc> had been much discussed <pause dur="0.9"/> and the tactic <pause dur="0.5"/> is <pause dur="0.8"/> to say to the defendant well <pause dur="0.4"/> as an alternative to <pause dur="0.4"/> submitting to interview <pause dur="1.2"/> # you don't you don't want to speak to 
the police <pause dur="0.4"/> but <pause dur="0.3"/> it may be a good idea to give your story to <trunc>av</trunc> avoid <trunc>a</trunc> <pause dur="0.3"/> adverse inferences being drawn <pause dur="0.4"/> so as an alternative to answering questions <pause dur="0.9"/> why don't you and i sit down we will <trunc>rep</trunc> <pause dur="0.4"/> prepare a statement <pause dur="0.6"/> of what your defence is going to be <pause dur="1.1"/> walk into the interview room <pause dur="0.9"/> tape switched on caution given saying well here you are police officer <pause dur="0.3"/> here's my statement <pause dur="0.8"/> # i've set out what my defence is there <pause dur="0.4"/> you've got it i'm not going to say anything more <pause dur="0.9"/> and that was the tactic in McGarry <pause dur="1.1"/> and what was interesting <pause dur="0.7"/> in this case was the # <pause dur="0.4"/> the court said well <pause dur="1.4"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> this was a case where no inferences should be drawn <pause dur="1.0"/> # McGarry did raise a defence in court <pause dur="1.0"/> but it was precisely the one he'd given notification of <pause dur="0.6"/> to the police <pause dur="2.6"/> nothing new <pause dur="1.1"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> and it was suggested that no inferences could be drawn against the defendant <pause dur="2.1"/> because it couldn't be said that he hadn't notified the police of this defence <pause dur="1.0"/> at the stage of interview <pause dur="2.4"/> let's # <pause dur="1.2"/> let's talk about that <pause dur="1.1"/> well <pause dur="0.4"/> i think it's <pause dur="1.3"/> i suppose from <pause dur="0.4"/> a point 
of view of the police project it's a very unfortunate decision <pause dur="1.7"/> # <pause dur="1.6"/> as we said right at the beginning in the introduction <pause dur="0.9"/> # one of the reasons the police campaigned to change the law <pause dur="1.5"/> on silence one of the reasons the police campaigned to <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> be able to draw inferences from silence <pause dur="0.6"/> # in police interview <pause dur="0.5"/> was that they wanted to be able to put pressure on suspects to speak <pause dur="1.0"/> the idea is they want suspects who are speaking <pause dur="0.7"/> for all sorts of reasons if they speak and raise a defence that can be broken down <pause dur="0.9"/> if they have to speak quickly <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> soon after the crime they may not may not have time to fabricate a good defence <pause dur="0.4"/> if they <trunc>fabrica</trunc> <pause dur="0.3"/> fabricate a defence on the spot <pause dur="0.4"/> there may be weaknesses in it it may be easy to break that down et cetera <pause dur="0.4"/> so the police really do want <pause dur="0.6"/> to create a dialogue <pause dur="0.2"/> they don't just want to hear what the defence is <pause dur="1.1"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> if McGarry is followed <pause dur="0.7"/> # it should be possible for defence lawyers <pause dur="0.5"/> to avoid <pause dur="0.7"/> # the risks inherent in a dialogue between <pause dur="0.3"/> police and suspect <pause dur="1.1"/> # and a if you like <pause dur="0.5"/> put 
the defence lawyer or the defendant right back in the driving seat <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> if McGarry's right the defence lawyer lawyer <pause dur="0.3"/> or <trunc>i</trunc> if it's followed the defence lawyer should be able to <pause dur="0.4"/> as it were just construct a good defence <pause dur="0.5"/> a statement <pause dur="0.4"/> and as long as it matches what is said <pause dur="0.4"/> eventually in court <pause dur="0.6"/> # no inferences can be drawn <pause dur="1.6"/> # <pause dur="1.1"/> i'm interested to see really what will happen to McGarry <pause dur="0.6"/> # as i said i think it wasn't quite what the government had in mind <pause dur="1.0"/> # <pause dur="1.1"/> and certainly cause problems for the police and # <pause dur="0.7"/> if you do get judges who are really <pause dur="0.7"/> in favour of the idea that <trunc>s</trunc> suspects really should speak in interview <pause dur="0.7"/> # 
then we may find that courts <pause dur="0.4"/> are either overturning McGarry or at least distinguishing it <pause dur="1.0"/> # and of course <pause dur="0.7"/> it would be possible to distinguish McGarry <pause dur="0.2"/> for instance if there was only an outline statement given in the police station <pause dur="0.6"/> where we'd <trunc>bu</trunc> but a much fuller defence with more details given in court <pause dur="0.7"/> # if that occurred <pause dur="0.6"/> # i think it <pause dur="0.5"/> it would be possible to say well <pause dur="1.5"/> the fact that there there was <trunc>o</trunc> this only <pause dur="0.2"/> bare <trunc>out</trunc> only a bare outline might suggest it hadn't been fully worked out <pause dur="0.6"/> maybe an inference can be drawn that it shouldn't be believed <pause dur="0.9"/> who knows <pause dur="0.8"/> # shall we # take a break there and # <pause dur="1.7"/> i'll move on to <pause dur="0.4"/> talk about other inferences <pause dur="0.5"/> after a break
