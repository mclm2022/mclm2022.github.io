i guess you've heard a bit about it it <trunc>wel</trunc> it it organizes <pause dur="0.2"/> things <pause dur="0.4"/> and generally as a result of what people want to do <pause dur="0.7"/> social events visiting speakers <pause dur="0.4"/> and and i <trunc>g</trunc> i guess it will continue to do so now it's up and going it'll respond to whatever you want to do <pause dur="0.5"/> so that'll be partly what that meeting is about <pause dur="0.5"/> and secondly there is this <pause dur="0.2"/> Cumberland Lodge now that seems to be <pause dur="0.2"/> up and running now <pause dur="0.7"/> people seem to be interested and it's going to go <pause dur="0.8"/> there are <pause dur="0.3"/> # we have some speakers arranged i guess you i guess you've heard enough about what it is it's a residential weekend away in <pause dur="0.4"/> in Windsor Park et cetera and <pause dur="0.2"/> i think you all <pause dur="0.3"/> you all know what the event is do you <pause dur="0.7"/><kinesic desc="nod heads" iterated="n" n="ss"/> <trunc>b</trunc> <pause dur="1.0"/> okay well it's <trunc>b</trunc> it's being organized <trunc>e</trunc> deposits have been taken from some people <pause dur="0.3"/> and we have some speakers now i happen to know we i think we've got <pause dur="0.4"/> a hypnotherapist set up <pause dur="0.8"/> and we've got somebody who's from the M-R-C <pause dur="0.7"/> # Medical Research Unit in Cambridge who'll talk about cognitive rehabilitation <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> after 
brain damage so <pause dur="0.4"/> people with <pause dur="0.3"/> brain damage from accidents so there's a sort of <trunc>neur</trunc> <pause dur="0.3"/> the practical end of neuropsychology <pause dur="1.0"/> and we have a speaker <pause dur="0.4"/> who analyses it's Peter Bull actually <pause dur="0.4"/> # from University of York <pause dur="0.4"/> whose interest is <trunc>i</trunc> is in <pause dur="0.2"/> political rhetoric the analysis of political spee<pause dur="0.7"/>ches and he's always pretty entertaining <pause dur="0.6"/> lots of speeches of politicians <pause dur="0.4"/> telling the truth or otherwise <pause dur="0.8"/> and so his interest is <pause dur="0.2"/> his interest is in sort of political rhetoric so <pause dur="0.3"/> there are some speakers arranged as <pause dur="0.2"/> and as i as i think you know <pause dur="0.4"/> Cumberland Lodge is a mixture of <pause dur="0.5"/> outside speakers who are either sort of academic or professionally orientated <pause dur="0.4"/> and internal home-grown <trunc>s</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> talks as well which can be sort of brief <pause dur="0.6"/> and we'll be trying to organize some of those you don't want members of staff giving them there will be about forty or so <pause dur="0.3"/> psychology students going and about sort of five <pause dur="0.5"/> five or so members of staff going <pause dur="0.4"/> we'll try and organize some brief speeches <pause dur="0.3"/> talks <pause dur="0.5"/> on <pause dur="0.2"/> topics of interest <pause dur="0.3"/> from # <pause dur="0.5"/> 
those who go and i hope a lot of you will go very rewarding and interesting it is too <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="1.8"/> i think there's some even some talk of subsidizing <pause dur="0.4"/> the cost of going for anyone who wants to talk while they're there <pause dur="0.3"/> but there's <trunc>m</trunc> more about that in due course <pause dur="0.2"/> are any of the people <pause dur="0.2"/> on that list there <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> and <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> are you here i think there are some </u><u who="sf1215" trans="latching"> yeah </u><pause dur="0.7"/> <u who="nm1213" trans="pause"> are you all in a row the committees we're going to talk about committees and groups <pause dur="0.3"/> is there anything you want to say this is your chance <pause dur="0.5"/> camera's on </u><pause dur="0.6"/> <u who="su1221" trans="pause"> no <vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" n="ss" dur="1"/></u><u who="nm1213" trans="overlap"> <vocal desc="laugh" iterated="n"/> <pause dur="0.6"/> is there about about Cumberland Lodge </u><pause dur="0.4"/> <u who="sf1214" trans="pause"> yeah it it should be it should be good i mean if anybody has any suggestions about what what kind of speakers that they'd # like to hear there </u><u who="nm1213" trans="overlap"> mm </u><u who="sf1214" trans="latching"> as well <pause dur="0.3"/> # it's a bit kind of <pause dur="0.2"/> kind of open <pause dur="0.5"/> # </u><u who="nm1213" trans="overlap"> yes </u><pause dur="0.5"/> <u who="sf1214" trans="pause"> i mean it should just be good fun really <pause dur="0.2"/> # i think the places are going quite quickly anyway so # <pause dur="0.4"/> if you well # i think

won't be a place <pause dur="0.6"/> right secondly <pause dur="0.3"/> i i <pause dur="0.5"/> i needed to say something about just briefly about the seminars <pause dur="0.3"/> the last <trunc>rou</trunc> we we've done one round of <trunc>pra</trunc> <pause dur="0.3"/> presentations of the practical work jolly good they were very interesting <pause dur="0.3"/> and next Wednesday <pause dur="0.4"/> we have the next the the <pause dur="0.5"/> the other two groups <pause dur="0.4"/> so there'll be eight <pause dur="0.3"/> eight more presentations hopefully to do <pause dur="0.4"/> and i said in the last week <pause dur="0.4"/> it turned out talking to the other seminar group that we really needed to arrange <pause dur="0.3"/> four seminars in the last week of term i was going to make the <trunc>w</trunc> the seminars <pause dur="0.5"/> in week ten <pause dur="0.8"/> gear them to the the assessed essays there seemed to be a lot of interest in this <pause dur="0.4"/> and i said # <pause dur="0.5"/> i asked how many would come and it seemed that <pause dur="0.2"/> nearly all the people from the seminar groups this week <pause dur="0.2"/> would come in week # <pause dur="0.8"/> # in week ten <pause dur="0.3"/> and # so i suspect the the <pause dur="0.3"/> people coming to seminars <pause dur="0.2"/> in week nine <pause dur="0.2"/> would also come to these ones in week ten so <pause dur="0.2"/> we might <pause dur="0.3"/> i was going to cram everybody into those two <pause dur="0.4"/> those two slots 
at eleven o'clock and twelve o'clock on Wednesday <pause dur="0.3"/> but that won't do <pause dur="0.5"/> it seems that'll be too crowded there'll be too many people to go in the rooms if we try and to combine two groups into one for the last week <pause dur="0.7"/> # so <pause dur="0.5"/> the suggestion is that we have four seminars in the last week <pause dur="0.3"/> and each one is geared towards one particular assessed essay title and you can choose to come to one or more of them so you won't be sitting around for <pause dur="0.4"/> fifty minutes waiting for just ten minutes on an essay that's relevant to you <pause dur="0.3"/> so i'm going to have to find two more seminar slots <pause dur="0.3"/> i assume that eleven and twelve as usual are free everybody can make eleven or twelve in <pause dur="0.2"/> in principle <pause dur="0.6"/> and i'm looking at your second year timetable here <pause dur="0.2"/><event desc="looks at timetable" iterated="n"/> can i just check that the <pause dur="0.2"/> i haven't been in touch with timetables yet but can i just check that all these times are available <pause dur="0.5"/> for instance twelve o'clock on a Monday it seems free on your timetable would that be all right if it 
if it were available would everyone be able to come at that time <pause dur="0.7"/> okay <pause dur="0.6"/> then i see that two o'clock on Monday would also be free on your timetable is that in principle free </u><pause dur="0.2"/> <u who="ss" trans="pause"> yeah </u><u who="nm1213" trans="overlap"> i don't know whether these will be the times yeah </u><u who="sf1215" trans="latching"> yeah </u><pause dur="0.7"/> <u who="nm1213" trans="pause"> then looking on Tuesday it's <trunc>s</trunc> see that eleven o'clock and twelve o'clock there's a methods lecture but only in weeks four to eight is in principle <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> Tuesday <pause dur="0.7"/> # eleven or twelve would that in principle be free </u><pause dur="0.5"/> <u who="sf1216" trans="pause"> twelve <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> </u><u who="nm1213" trans="latching"> twelve no <pause dur="0.7"/> can i cross out twelve <pause dur="0.5"/> i can't cross out twelve 'cause i've not brought anything to write <unclear>at</unclear> <event desc="knocks microphone off" iterated="n"/><pause dur="3.2"/><vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" n="ss" dur="2"/> ah <vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" n="ss" dur="2"/><pause dur="1.9"/><event desc="tries to reattach microphone" iterated="y" dur="12"/> mm <pause dur="0.2"/> right i've got to put this little thing back on here <pause dur="1.8"/> <vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" n="ss" dur="11"/> sorry about the <pause dur="0.4"/> technology <pause dur="2.8"/> oh dear <pause dur="1.5"/> mm <pause dur="2.4"/> does it matter if it's off </u><u who="om1220" trans="overlap"> <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> </u><u who="nm1213" trans="overlap"> all right <pause dur="0.5"/> i i've been in make-up for an hour this morning you know <vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" n="ss" dur="2"/><vocal desc="laugh" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.5"/> <shift feature="voice" new="laugh"/>i <vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" dur="1"/><pause dur="0.2"/> then they <trunc>deci</trunc> <shift feature="voice" new="normal"/> they decided 
there wasn't anything they could do so i've come as i am <pause dur="0.5"/> <vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" n="ss" dur="2"/> # # <pause dur="0.4"/> i wanted the <trunc>j</trunc> Julian Clary look but there we were <vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" n="ss" dur="1"/><pause dur="0.3"/> okay so <pause dur="0.3"/> we can't <pause dur="0.8"/> we can't make twelve and <trunc>ju</trunc> i yeah i'd better i'd better get a few 'cause the timetable is very crowded and i'd like sort of smallish rooms and in Humanities so i don't have to walk too far as well <pause dur="0.4"/> so what about eleven o'clock on Wednesday would that be in principle free <pause dur="0.4"/> yeah <pause dur="0.4"/> and eleven o'clock on # sorry <pause dur="0.5"/> # not eleven o'clock <pause dur="0.3"/> # we have one anyway then don't we <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> ten o'clock on Wednesday would that be free the hour before this start okay i'll try that one <pause dur="0.3"/> and another one <pause dur="0.4"/> # Thursday at <trunc>t</trunc> ten o'clock <pause dur="1.5"/> yeah </u><u who="sm1217" trans="overlap"> yeah </u><pause dur="0.6"/> <u who="nm1213" trans="pause"> that would be free </u><pause dur="0.4"/> <u who="ss" trans="pause"> <gap reason="inaudible, multiple speakers" extent="1 sec"/></u><u who="nm1213" trans="overlap"> okay <pause dur="0.4"/> or is that not a very good idea is that 'cause you don't have anything on Thursday </u><u who="ss" trans="latching"> yeah </u><u who="nm1213" trans="overlap"> oh right i'll scrub that out i <trunc>le</trunc> that i'll only do that in an emergency so 
it'll probably be <pause dur="0.3"/> one of those times on Monday or Tuesday or Wednesday then two seminar slots </u><pause dur="0.3"/> <u who="sf1218" trans="pause"> <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> </u><u who="nm1213" trans="latching"> yes </u><u who="sf1218" trans="latching"> Wednesday at ten o'clock </u><pause dur="0.2"/> <u who="nm1213" trans="pause"> sorry </u><pause dur="0.6"/> <u who="sf1218" trans="pause"> # can't do Wednesday ten o'clock </u><pause dur="0.3"/> <u who="nm1213" trans="pause"> you can't do Wednesday ten o'clock <pause dur="0.2"/> right okay <pause dur="1.0"/> might be Monday or Tuesday i'll see what we can find <pause dur="0.6"/> right <pause dur="0.2"/> so that's the seminars that's Cumberland Lodge <pause dur="0.2"/> let us now turn our attention to the <pause dur="0.4"/> matter in hand <pause dur="0.3"/> which is to start doing <pause dur="0.4"/> well it's to look at groups group performance group decision making things that go on in groups <pause dur="0.9"/> and <pause dur="0.3"/> # i suppose this marks try to see how the <pause dur="0.2"/> the lectures <pause dur="0.4"/> are grouped together <pause dur="0.2"/> we're going to be doing three lectures now <pause dur="0.5"/> which are about group <pause dur="0.2"/> orientated phenomena <pause dur="1.4"/> and <pause dur="1.3"/> we'll look at things that go on within groups we'll look at the concept of groups <pause dur="1.3"/> see what we shall do <pause dur="2.3"/><kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="12"/> we'll try and get through some of these things here although i think <pause dur="0.5"/> not <pause dur="0.2"/> all of them but <pause dur="6.9"/> these <pause dur="0.5"/> # more about things that go on within small groups the decision making the performance the impact of being around small numbers of people this week <pause dur="0.5"/> and 
then move on next week to begin to look at things that go on within between groups prejudice discrimination intergroup relations cooperation <pause dur="0.3"/> and conflict <pause dur="2.8"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> other <pause dur="0.2"/> other <pause dur="0.2"/> points about this <pause dur="0.3"/> i think <pause dur="0.9"/> they are <pause dur="1.4"/> # <pause dur="1.3"/> relevant very very much to the <trunc>s</trunc> the stuff that Ian Morley talks about in his third year course <pause dur="0.3"/> Ian Morley's third year <pause dur="0.2"/> option is called Applied Social Psychology <pause dur="0.3"/> its its particular emphasis <pause dur="0.3"/> is on <pause dur="0.2"/> applied social psychology in organizational contexts and those are mainly <pause dur="0.4"/> sort of <pause dur="0.4"/> <trunc>i</trunc> <pause dur="1.4"/> # or <trunc>in</trunc> sorry industrial <trunc>organi</trunc> no <trunc>t</trunc> <pause dur="0.4"/> that's just not the quite <pause dur="0.3"/> work organizations i mean the word organization can be very loose but he <pause dur="0.3"/> he has a fairly specific <pause dur="0.6"/> # view of that <pause dur="0.2"/> and therefore some of these concepts particularly i shall talk about group think towards the end and group polarization and and leadership <pause dur="0.5"/> will be topics that he picks up again so this can serve as a sort of an introduction <pause dur="0.3"/> to some of the literature which will be picked up in 
greater depth next year <pause dur="0.8"/> it also <trunc>rai</trunc> it all <trunc>c</trunc> comes back <trunc>t</trunc> as well to the difference <trunc>t</trunc> <trunc>b</trunc> between <pause dur="0.5"/> people as perceivers and participants we've had <pause dur="0.5"/> we've had this <pause dur="0.7"/> come up so far <pause dur="0.3"/> on the course <pause dur="0.2"/> and here i think we're moving to <pause dur="0.3"/> back to sort of people as participants things people do when they interact with each other but <pause dur="0.4"/> but both <pause dur="0.4"/> both are really irrelevant there's <trunc>al</trunc> there's something about the representation of knowledge <pause dur="0.4"/> here within groups but it's more about how people are influencing each other in groups <pause dur="1.6"/> okay so <pause dur="0.2"/> i'll certainly <trunc>sa</trunc> try and <pause dur="0.2"/> say something about <pause dur="0.5"/> functions and dimensions of groups <pause dur="0.2"/> say something about <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="2.4"/> performance just the impact of having people around one <pause dur="0.4"/> i'll skip over this a bit decision making in groups and aspects of group processes <pause dur="0.3"/> but i will mention it because <pause dur="0.2"/> when we come on to looking at # group think which is a really <trunc>d</trunc> <pause dur="0.7"/> can be summed up as defective <pause dur="0.5"/> # group decision making <pause dur="0.9"/> that will # alert us to some of 
the things <pause dur="0.2"/> that aren't being done <pause dur="0.3"/> i'll try and say something about leadership <pause dur="1.1"/> <trunc>r</trunc> role differentiation leadership <pause dur="0.3"/> risk taking so <pause dur="0.2"/> it'll really be mostly about <pause dur="0.3"/> what is a group performance in groups <pause dur="0.2"/> and then going on to <pause dur="0.8"/> roles and influence in groups <pause dur="0.2"/> risk taking and group think <pause dur="0.3"/> now <pause dur="1.7"/> the word <pause dur="0.9"/> the word group <pause dur="3.6"/><kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="4"/> emerges all over the place in social psychology just like it emerges all over the place in everyday language <pause dur="0.3"/> group is the collective noun <pause dur="0.3"/> of persons you have flocks of sheep <pause dur="0.3"/> herds of goats groups of people <pause dur="0.5"/> and it means <pause dur="0.3"/> it means a whole lot of things group group can <trunc>r</trunc> refer to <pause dur="0.4"/> a small number of face to face interacting individuals of course <pause dur="0.2"/> a a group <pause dur="0.2"/> a family or a committee or a jury <pause dur="0.5"/> but we also use the word to describe aggregates <pause dur="0.5"/> of people <pause dur="0.3"/> and people who are just identified by <trunc>c</trunc> some common concept we talk about blood groups you don't know all the people who are O-positive <pause dur="0.5"/> there's a lot of them <pause dur="0.8"/> sixty to seventy isn't it sixty per cent of the 
room you don't know who they are but somehow <pause dur="0.4"/> you know if you needed blood <pause dur="0.8"/> you'd want to know who they were <pause dur="1.1"/> and people who share religion common national ethnic origin they are groups as well we refer to them as groups but there <pause dur="0.4"/> there it's a sort of an abstract <pause dur="0.5"/> quality a phenomenon <pause dur="0.3"/> something with which one <trunc>migh</trunc> # i might identify <pause dur="0.4"/> something which <pause dur="0.2"/> influences behaviour <pause dur="0.3"/> influences attitudes <pause dur="0.3"/> does have an effect on what you do <pause dur="0.8"/> but <pause dur="0.2"/> in a in a sort of <pause dur="0.4"/> an abstract sort of sense <pause dur="0.4"/> but other times <pause dur="0.6"/> a group means a set # a group of people small number of people <pause dur="0.3"/> with whom you're actually interacting with whom you're actually talking put together for the purposes <pause dur="0.2"/> of doing something or saying something or making some sort of decision <pause dur="0.6"/> so <pause dur="0.8"/> it <pause dur="0.2"/> # it applies certainly <pause dur="0.3"/> to both of those two senses <pause dur="0.2"/> this week it'll be more about the face to face <pause dur="0.5"/> aggregates of people things we do when making decisions in groups <pause dur="0.3"/> what happens to us when we have people around us looking at us <pause dur="0.6"/> but next week 
when we deal with intergroup relations <pause dur="0.6"/> there is a sense sometimes intergroup relations when you have two football teams or two sports teams playing against each other when <pause dur="0.2"/> the competition is about people <pause dur="0.3"/> all of whom know <pause dur="0.4"/> who it is <pause dur="0.5"/> competing against them <pause dur="0.2"/> but more usually when we talk about intergroup relations we're talking about <pause dur="0.8"/> concepts <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="1.0"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> abstract notions of groups who have some sort of territorial dispute <pause dur="0.4"/> or some ideological dispute <pause dur="1.2"/> okay <pause dur="0.3"/> some examples just to sort of prime us a bit to what we're talking about i've <pause dur="0.2"/> got down some examples here <pause dur="0.4"/> things we do just to sort of alert us to what what happens here <pause dur="0.3"/> i mean we work and play in groups so you know example seminars <pause dur="0.3"/> production teams and sports teams <pause dur="0.4"/> we socialize in the technical sense as well as the non-technical sense the so <pause dur="0.3"/> the technical sense in the sense of <pause dur="0.6"/> inducing <pause dur="0.4"/> children <pause dur="0.2"/> into the world of adult values <pause dur="0.4"/> so there's that sort of <trunc>s</trunc> the psychological sense but of course we socialize in the 
sense of <pause dur="0.2"/> hanging about <pause dur="0.4"/> in groups <pause dur="0.8"/> families peer groups and friends <pause dur="0.4"/> we derive important aspects of our identity <pause dur="0.5"/> from groups gender <pause dur="0.4"/> race <pause dur="0.6"/> class nationality <pause dur="0.3"/> we make important decisions in groups <pause dur="0.6"/> oh and important decisions about us <pause dur="0.5"/> are made by groups <pause dur="0.3"/> exam boards <pause dur="0.6"/> and then of course there's committees interview panels and juries and so on <pause dur="0.7"/> so <pause dur="0.5"/> the dimensions of groups there are a number of ways i've already sort of hinted at this <pause dur="0.2"/> <trunc>f</trunc> the face to face versus the <pause dur="0.3"/> the concept dimension <pause dur="0.4"/> i mean the the numbers of individuals comprising the group obviously is a dimension <pause dur="0.4"/> we have sort of committees <pause dur="0.6"/> families there are two person families i suppose <pause dur="0.4"/> so <pause dur="0.3"/> two is the minimum number i suppose for a group although that's <pause dur="0.3"/> not really a group <pause dur="0.3"/> three is more like a group because there's a possibility that two people will talk and the other person listens <pause dur="0.4"/> there's the possibility of coalitions and lots of interesting things <pause dur="0.3"/> happen once you get beyond two to three but some <trunc>peo</trunc> 
some <trunc>psy</trunc> social psychologists talk about groups as if they were three <pause dur="1.8"/> as if they were <trunc>t</trunc> and <trunc>th</trunc> a two person group could be a group # <pause dur="0.6"/> the length of time people remain in groups they can be quite transient a pub crawl or a jury <pause dur="0.3"/> or on the other hand they can be quite long lasting like a family or a nation <pause dur="0.3"/> they could be structured and formal <pause dur="0.9"/> so <pause dur="0.2"/> we can have # <pause dur="1.1"/> they could be <pause dur="0.3"/> structured like police <pause dur="0.3"/> or freemasons <pause dur="0.5"/> actually it occurs to me they're the same group so <pause dur="0.3"/> it's not a <shift feature="voice" new="laugh"/>very <vocal desc="laugh" iterated="n"/><vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" n="ss" dur="1"/> not a very good <shift feature="voice" new="normal"/>example there <pause dur="0.4"/> there are day trippers <pause dur="0.5"/> there for the time <pause dur="0.2"/> supporters associations <pause dur="0.3"/> all sorts of different purposes <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> they can be <trunc>pur</trunc> well they can be purposeful or purposeless assembly lines local action groups street gangs <pause dur="0.2"/> local communities <pause dur="0.2"/> are all aggregates of people that have been studied by social psychologists <pause dur="0.5"/> then then well # they could be organized in different ways they can be autocratic they can be democratic they can be laissez-faire <pause dur="0.5"/> 
looking at the armed forces or the Mormons <pause dur="0.2"/> as opposed to say students sharing a flat or <pause dur="0.4"/> well <trunc>peo</trunc> members of a university department <pause dur="1.0"/> so we have all those <pause dur="0.4"/> dimensions <pause dur="0.3"/> to look at <pause dur="3.9"/> okay <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.8"/> let's <pause dur="6.7"/><kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="8"/> i should just <pause dur="0.6"/> refer back of course <pause dur="0.9"/> to <pause dur="0.7"/> those the <trunc>vor</trunc> the course that was called <trunc>intr</trunc> # <pause dur="0.2"/> further <pause dur="0.6"/> Foundations of <shift feature="voice" new="laugh"/>Psychology <shift feature="voice" new="normal"/>last year it's now called Further Psychology this year <pause dur="0.4"/> just to remind you and those that did it that <pause dur="0.6"/> the the work we did last year two lectures on social influence and those of you that didn't do the course <pause dur="0.3"/> you can look up <pause dur="0.3"/> social influence in in the Hogg and Vaughan textbook and see what was talked about <pause dur="0.4"/> but they're such classic studies <pause dur="0.5"/> even those of you that didn't <pause dur="0.2"/> do the two-plus-two students for instance can hardly have escaped the sorts of studies <pause dur="0.8"/> such as the Ash study on compliance Sherif <pause dur="0.4"/> on normative influences within social groups <pause dur="0.4"/> Latané on bystander apathy <pause dur="0.3"/> those are all <trunc>ex</trunc> <pause dur="0.3"/> all studies <pause dur="0.2"/> on groups the impact of <pause dur="0.4"/> face to

put it up again <pause dur="1.0"/> # suggest that <trunc>s</trunc> remember <trunc>s</trunc> it's a study of social influence processes in the presence <pause dur="0.3"/> or absence you know in the real or imagined presence of other people <pause dur="0.5"/> and there's a <trunc>n</trunc> there are a number of <pause dur="0.3"/> studies <pause dur="0.3"/><vocal desc="sniff" iterated="n"/> areas of social psychology which look at the <trunc>e</trunc> impact of other people <pause dur="0.5"/> first of all <pause dur="0.3"/> we've <pause dur="0.3"/> mentioned this before <pause dur="0.3"/> the effect of mere presence social facilitation is something we have to bear in mind <pause dur="0.2"/> having other people around us whether they're in groups or not <pause dur="0.5"/> seems to <pause dur="0.8"/> impact on what we do <pause dur="1.3"/> remember <trunc>tri</trunc> triplet study cyclists <pause dur="0.8"/> child winders <pause dur="0.4"/> and then the triplets <pause dur="0.5"/> <trunc>w</trunc> wonderful wonderful <pause dur="0.4"/> tasks to give people get them to wind <pause dur="0.2"/> a reel <pause dur="0.7"/> a fishing reel because you actually measure how much they've done by how much fishing line <pause dur="0.3"/> is left at the end <pause dur="0.4"/> <shift feature="voice" new="laugh"/>it's a hundred <shift feature="voice" new="normal"/> years old but it's a very good dependent variable i think getting people to <shift feature="voice" new="laugh"/>wind <shift feature="voice" new="normal"/>a fishing reel <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> people go faster people are generally razzed up when there are other people around them and they do more and 
they do faster things <pause dur="0.3"/> but then it it turns out it's slightly more complicated sometimes they do better <pause dur="0.2"/> sometimes they do worse <pause dur="0.5"/> this <pause dur="1.6"/> # confusion <pause dur="0.2"/> is sort of sorted out by Robert Zajonc in his articles in Science nineteen-sixty-five onwards <pause dur="0.7"/> suggesting that <pause dur="0.3"/> what we're dealing with here <pause dur="0.2"/> is arousal it's a sort of drive theory explanation of why people sometimes do better <pause dur="0.3"/> and sometimes do worse you've probably had the experience sometimes <pause dur="0.3"/> you just do better if there's other people <pause dur="0.2"/> sometimes <pause dur="0.2"/> your whole act you're about to do your party piece <pause dur="0.7"/> and suddenly it all falls to pieces when people are around you watching <pause dur="1.4"/> and that's <pause dur="1.2"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> that's what really what <trunc>zajan</trunc> Zajonc addresses <pause dur="0.3"/> and his drive theory approach is what's really going on is here is we're generally being wound up <pause dur="0.2"/> and the dominant responses <pause dur="0.2"/> are the ones that # come to the fore <pause dur="0.2"/> and if it's something very easy we do better <pause dur="0.5"/> and if it's something rather difficult <pause dur="0.6"/> where <pause dur="0.2"/> the dominant response is <shift feature="voice" new="laugh"/>not necessarily 
the <shift feature="voice" new="normal"/>correct one <pause dur="0.2"/> we tend to do worse <pause dur="0.3"/> so that's <pause dur="0.2"/> sort of tidying up this <pause dur="1.0"/> this finding <pause dur="0.3"/> now there have been various developments which i can <trunc>dir</trunc> direct you to in Hogg and Vaughan <pause dur="0.3"/> particularly Cotterill's work in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology nineteen-sixty-eight <pause dur="0.4"/> audience evaluation has to come in here <pause dur="0.3"/> it depends who these people are who are watching you i think this is very important <pause dur="0.5"/> it seems a bit simplistic just to think well are there people there or not <pause dur="0.4"/> what <pause dur="0.3"/> what we're really thinking about is what is their attitude what are they doing <pause dur="0.2"/> are they evaluating us or not <pause dur="0.4"/> and <pause dur="0.3"/> that's really what Cotterill's work is about <pause dur="0.4"/> looking at the sort of if you like mindset or attitude of the people who are around us when we're in groups are they friendly or unfriendly <pause dur="0.4"/> are they <pause dur="0.4"/> better than us or <pause dur="0.5"/> are they are they evaluating us <pause dur="1.6"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> and then we've also got <pause dur="0.7"/> <trunc>ad</trunc> that's advanced as an experimental social psychology the Baron reference <pause dur="0.3"/> a development of

voting <pause dur="0.6"/> which sort of orientates you and then you go on and on <pause dur="0.6"/> and on discussing <pause dur="0.3"/> so <pause dur="0.5"/> <trunc>m</trunc> decision schemes are an important part <pause dur="0.3"/> 'cause <pause dur="0.2"/> <trunc>pe</trunc> <pause dur="0.4"/> people go into groups with ideas about how it should be done <pause dur="0.3"/> and some or sometimes it just emerges about <pause dur="0.6"/> how this <pause dur="0.2"/> how the decision will emerge <pause dur="0.9"/> right <pause dur="0.4"/> now <pause dur="0.4"/><event desc="takes off transparency" iterated="n"/> like to <pause dur="0.3"/> to move on now <pause dur="0.8"/> to to say something about leadership <pause dur="0.3"/> and then <pause dur="1.5"/> then to go on to talking about group think <pause dur="0.4"/> now <pause dur="0.5"/> so much it's a huge area so much is written <pause dur="0.3"/> about leadership <pause dur="0.4"/> and i can't really begin to do it justice here <pause dur="1.0"/> i'd like to <trunc>s</trunc> <trunc>su</trunc> suggest <pause dur="0.3"/> that <pause dur="0.5"/> it's really <pause dur="0.2"/> obviously it's an example of group processes <pause dur="0.3"/> it's something to do with # <pause dur="0.2"/> some sort of role differentiation obviously that emerges within a group <pause dur="0.3"/> but we've already seen that groups can be face to face in <pause dur="0.5"/> interacting units <pause dur="0.2"/> or there could be <pause dur="0.3"/> large scale aggregates of people <pause dur="0.2"/> and # obviously <pause dur="0.2"/> the sort of person <pause dur="0.3"/> or the sort of role that we'd call leadership is very different <pause dur="0.3"/> you know <pause dur="0.9"/> a small group like a family or a 
jury they have their foreman or foreperson or they have their <pause dur="0.2"/> their leader <pause dur="0.8"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> it's a very different set of <pause dur="0.2"/> circumstances and a very <trunc>s</trunc> different set of activities as a role perhaps <pause dur="0.3"/> from someone who is a dictator <pause dur="0.2"/> or a prime minister <pause dur="0.8"/> and not all groups of course have leaders there isn't a leader of the people who are group O-positive <pause dur="0.6"/> # and lots # the the lots of <pause dur="0.3"/> things that are very <pause dur="0.7"/> you know very solidly understood as groups don't have leaders <pause dur="0.4"/> so <pause dur="0.4"/> there are very different types of groups therefore we'd expect <pause dur="0.2"/> the sorts of roles <pause dur="0.5"/> that <pause dur="0.8"/> we'd call leadership to vary <pause dur="0.9"/> but i think <pause dur="0.7"/> one thing you can say and i think this makes some sort of sense <pause dur="0.5"/> is to say that <pause dur="0.3"/> <trunc>o</trunc> it's a role <pause dur="0.2"/> but it's a role that's to do with influence <trunc>leadersh</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> the <pause dur="0.4"/> thing about leaders is they <pause dur="0.5"/> have a particular <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> role with respect to influence within the group <pause dur="0.3"/> so we're talk we're back to social influence again <pause dur="0.3"/> leadership is about social influence it's a particular case <pause dur="0.3"/> of social 
influence in that it's a particular role that emerges <pause dur="0.4"/> from a group <pause dur="0.2"/> well i say emerges it doesn't have to be <trunc>em</trunc> it doesn't have to emerge it can be <pause dur="0.4"/> imposed from the outside <pause dur="1.2"/> so <pause dur="0.7"/> think roles <pause dur="0.7"/> think variety of groups <pause dur="0.2"/> and particularly think of social influence <pause dur="0.2"/> and of course once again once we start to talk about social influence we're reminded of compliance we're reminded of identification <pause dur="0.3"/> and we're reminded of internalization <pause dur="0.3"/> and all three of those processes of social influence <pause dur="0.3"/> can <pause dur="0.2"/> bring about a role of influence <pause dur="0.3"/> compliance <pause dur="0.3"/> if one has the power <pause dur="0.3"/> or the authority in a group <pause dur="0.8"/> or the political might <pause dur="0.3"/> or one's just very strong <pause dur="2.0"/> one's going to have some sort of influence 'cause you can force people to be influenced by you <pause dur="0.4"/> if one is particularly attractive or charismatic <pause dur="0.5"/> wears the right clothes is very good at <trunc>some</trunc> doing something <pause dur="0.4"/> people like to be like you you're going to have <pause dur="0.2"/> you're going to emerge <pause dur="0.2"/> as having the role of social influence in a group <pause dur="0.3"/> and similarly if 
you're right this is internalization <pause dur="0.3"/> if your ideas are good effective or useful or people say yes that's right why didn't i think of that people will be <pause dur="0.5"/> following you and be influenced by you <pause dur="0.3"/> because of the process of <pause dur="0.5"/> internalization so we're back <pause dur="0.5"/> we're back with social influence we're back with those three processes <pause dur="1.4"/> now <pause dur="0.3"/> let's look at some classic studies <pause dur="0.3"/> of <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> of <pause dur="0.3"/> leadership <pause dur="0.3"/><kinesic desc="puts on transparency" iterated="n"/> we can move on to looking at # <pause dur="0.3"/> although really <pause dur="1.1"/> i mean ah well <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> roles emerge for division of labour <pause dur="0.5"/> expectation self-definition i <trunc>s</trunc> <pause dur="0.3"/> that's <trunc>r</trunc> <pause dur="2.6"/> the functional aspect <pause dur="0.9"/> of # leadership <pause dur="0.3"/> i wanted to # <pause dur="0.9"/> just look at some of the <pause dur="0.4"/> classical studies <pause dur="0.2"/> the <pause dur="0.3"/> one of the one of the earliest studies is this one by Lippett and White on leadership style this is done i think in # # # <trunc>ninet</trunc> <pause dur="0.3"/> nineteen-forty-three <pause dur="0.3"/> they were the first people to really <pause dur="0.5"/> i mean classic studies in a way really because <pause dur="0.4"/> they were some of the earliest studies to <pause dur="0.3"/> to <pause dur="0.9"/> to <trunc>l</trunc> look at <trunc>ex</trunc> <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> experimentally truly 
experimentally <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> <trunc>s</trunc> group phenomenon perhaps <trunc>bef</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> you know some of the first <pause dur="0.4"/> group <trunc>stud</trunc> <pause dur="0.3"/> studies ever done <pause dur="0.5"/> and they were interested in styles of leadership <pause dur="0.4"/> i guess you can look at the political context of nineteen-forty-three and work out <pause dur="0.3"/> why people are interested in <pause dur="0.4"/> in leadership there were some beefy dictators around in the early nineteen-forties in Spain and Italy and Germany <pause dur="0.6"/> and i suspect that has something to do with suddenly this interest in leadership <pause dur="1.6"/> they they studied boys' clubs <pause dur="0.3"/> and they looked at the imposition of types of leaders they're the first people really to <pause dur="0.2"/> start looking at the personalities of leaders addressing this question are orders <pause dur="0.2"/> are leaders <pause dur="0.4"/> born <pause dur="0.3"/> or are they made by the circumstances <pause dur="0.3"/> and they were they <pause dur="0.2"/> they were interested in the <pause dur="0.5"/> the personality of people imposed in in groups of boys so <pause dur="0.2"/> there's all sorts of specific situations here <pause dur="0.3"/> there's a there's a an authority <pause dur="0.2"/> in any case that we're talking about adults and children <pause dur="0.2"/> and 
we're talking about <pause dur="0.2"/> a leader imposed from the outside as is the case in sort of boys' clubs <pause dur="0.3"/> and so on <pause dur="0.2"/> but they interesting they studied <pause dur="0.3"/> autocratic leaders democratic leaders and laissez-faire leaders <pause dur="0.6"/> autocratic leaders organized activities gave orders were aloof and focused on the task in hand <pause dur="0.3"/> democratic leaders asked for suggestions <pause dur="0.5"/> # discussed plans acted as ordinary club <pause dur="0.4"/> members laissez-faire leaders <pause dur="0.4"/> just sort of hung back and did not much <pause dur="0.5"/> and <pause dur="1.0"/> the results if you think about them i guess were quite predictable <pause dur="1.0"/> and democratic led groups had a better atmosphere <pause dur="0.3"/> laissez-faire had a good atmosphere with play-related activities but not with other activities <pause dur="0.4"/> # the democratic <trunc>ac</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> leaders had <pause dur="0.2"/> better atmosphere for task-related activities <pause dur="0.6"/> the autocratically <pause dur="0.4"/> led groups had high productivity when the leader was present <pause dur="0.3"/> not very high productivity as soon as the leader was gone <pause dur="0.2"/> so obviously the autocratic leaders are working by <pause dur="0.5"/> compliance <pause dur="0.5"/> and <pause dur="0.5"/> and so on now <pause dur="0.3"/> you can <pause dur="0.2"/> you can look in Hogg and Vaughan or any of the textbooks and you can see a bit more detail 
about the sorts of findings <pause dur="0.3"/> but at <trunc>l</trunc> <pause dur="0.3"/> but it <trunc>sh</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> it showed that the different styles of leaders produced different styles of behaviour <pause dur="0.4"/> and that had implications for <trunc>whe</trunc> you know for how for how the group performed <pause dur="0.2"/> especially whether the leader was there or not what could be relied upon within the group <pause dur="0.5"/> this work was picked up by Bales again <pause dur="0.5"/> who <pause dur="0.3"/> looking more at groups where leaders evolved <pause dur="0.2"/> this research was more about adults <pause dur="0.3"/> more about <pause dur="0.3"/> groups <pause dur="0.2"/> that were just were allowed to get on with tasks they were <trunc>u</trunc> usually laboratory tasks experimental tasks like <pause dur="0.3"/> rank order <pause dur="0.7"/> a group of <trunc>eq</trunc> <pause dur="0.3"/> # a <trunc>s</trunc> set of equipment for if you were stranded on a desert island you know compass needle <pause dur="0.5"/> eight gramophone records copy of Hogg and Vaughan <shift feature="voice" new="laugh"/>et cetera <vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" n="ss" dur="1"/><shift feature="voice" new="normal"/> things you'd have on a <pause dur="0.3"/> things you'd have on a desert island <pause dur="0.3"/> and # and ask them to sort of rank them <pause dur="0.3"/> tasks like that i think <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> and then what he <trunc>s</trunc> what he discovered were that there were 
different types of influence for going on it wasn't just all about the task <pause dur="1.3"/> and particularly he's <pause dur="0.2"/> well known his work for distinguishing two types of leader <pause dur="0.3"/> a sort of task orientated role getting things done ordering people around <pause dur="0.3"/> getting <pause dur="0.3"/> getting the job done <pause dur="1.1"/> certainly <pause dur="0.7"/> individuals emerged who had more influence in doing that <pause dur="0.4"/> but at the same time another another role emerged which was vital for group performance <pause dur="0.2"/> and that was what Bales called the socio-emotional <pause dur="0.4"/> leader <pause dur="0.4"/> the someone who sort of kept people together <pause dur="0.2"/> put an arm round someone who'd been moaned at or wasn't doing very well <pause dur="0.3"/> cracked a joke lightened the atmosphere <pause dur="0.3"/> and he found that his most effective groups were groups where both these roles <pause dur="0.2"/> <trunc>w</trunc> <pause dur="0.3"/> were seen to emerge <pause dur="0.2"/> and thought to have emerged <pause dur="0.2"/> by the people participating <pause dur="0.4"/> so here's <pause dur="0.2"/> his example of <pause dur="0.2"/> more than one <pause dur="0.4"/> social influence function <pause dur="0.2"/> needs to take place for a group to be <pause dur="0.2"/> effective <pause dur="0.4"/> now this is picked up by <pause dur="0.6"/> by # <pause dur="0.2"/> Fiedler who's not on this file <pause dur="0.2"/> <kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="6"/> 
# he gets a he gets an O-H-P to himself <pause dur="0.6"/> and in the sixties and then onwards and i still think Fiedler is probably the most influential <trunc>peo</trunc> <pause dur="0.3"/> influential person <pause dur="0.4"/> in <pause dur="0.5"/> in the study of groups certainly was all throughout the sixties and seventies <pause dur="0.4"/> and onwards <trunc>peop</trunc> <pause dur="1.8"/> people may <pause dur="2.3"/> other <pause dur="0.7"/> and it's a lot of work <pause dur="0.4"/> which Ian will no doubt tell you more about next year <pause dur="0.3"/> on leadership <pause dur="0.6"/> but <pause dur="0.2"/> it's still set in the context of Fiedler's work most people are sort of <pause dur="0.3"/> he's a sort of shadow cast over <pause dur="1.0"/> the # the <pause dur="0.2"/> the world of <pause dur="0.6"/> # <trunc>l</trunc> leadership studies <pause dur="0.4"/> and <pause dur="0.4"/> he was interested in Bales' work and his his own research <pause dur="0.3"/> comes out of Bales' work <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> and he <pause dur="1.6"/> looked <pause dur="1.0"/> it's sometimes called a contingency theory of leadership it's usually called a contingency theory of leadership actually <pause dur="0.3"/> and it <pause dur="0.2"/> and the the the message here is that the sort of style of leader is contingent upon the circumstances within the group <pause dur="0.3"/> so he's <pause dur="0.5"/> interested in classifying <pause dur="0.3"/> the tasks that confronted a 
group <pause dur="1.2"/> and he saw there as <pause dur="0.2"/> he saw there being at least three important bases for classifying <pause dur="0.4"/> what was going on in a group the <trunc>situ</trunc> the circumstances in which the group <pause dur="0.6"/> leader might emerge <pause dur="0.9"/> there were the leader-member relations were they good or bad <pause dur="2.0"/> the task structure <pause dur="0.3"/> was it high or low <pause dur="0.9"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> the power of the leader <pause dur="0.3"/> was it high <pause dur="0.2"/> or low <pause dur="0.3"/> don't think they don't think <pause dur="0.4"/> don't need too much <pause dur="0.2"/> description <pause dur="0.4"/> there <pause dur="0.4"/> so <pause dur="0.2"/> that actually made you can <trunc>m</trunc> <pause dur="0.4"/> eight types of groups theoretically and indeed he's claims to have found <pause dur="0.4"/> examples of each one of those two groups you know you can have <pause dur="0.5"/> marvellous relationships with lots of power and lots of structure or or <pause dur="0.3"/> various combinations you can work on that yourself <pause dur="0.6"/> <trunc>w</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> he also <pause dur="0.4"/> going # <pause dur="0.2"/> going on from <pause dur="0.3"/> # Bales' work he could see that there were these two functions <pause dur="0.4"/> the sort of getting down to it regardless of what people were up to <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> and <pause dur="0.3"/> and helping people <pause dur="0.6"/> task socio-emotional <pause dur="0.7"/> and he <trunc>v</trunc> <pause dur="0.8"/> his <trunc>c</trunc> one of his contributions was to find a way 
of measuring that <pause dur="0.3"/> he started actually out measuring <pause dur="0.3"/> getting everybody to sort of rate the difference between themselves <pause dur="0.3"/> and the worker they most preferred <pause dur="0.3"/> and themselves <pause dur="0.2"/> and the worker they least preferred <pause dur="0.2"/> that was his first way of measuring things <pause dur="0.3"/> but then <pause dur="0.3"/> after doing that for a while <pause dur="0.3"/> realized that everybody saw themselves as being their <trunc>m</trunc> like their most preferred coworker the difference between <pause dur="0.2"/> individuals' ratings of themselves <pause dur="0.2"/> and their most preferred coworker <pause dur="0.2"/> were very small almost non-existent 'cause people are like that <pause dur="0.3"/> and the difference between <pause dur="0.4"/> the most <trunc>prefer</trunc> themselves and the least preferred coworker <pause dur="1.0"/> is was big <pause dur="0.3"/> so he cut out <pause dur="0.2"/> the middle person the the <trunc>s</trunc> the self <pause dur="0.3"/> and just asked his subjects to <pause dur="0.4"/> rate <pause dur="0.4"/> their most preferred coworker <pause dur="0.2"/> and their least preferred coworker <pause dur="1.0"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> and <pause dur="0.5"/> he <pause dur="0.4"/> his <trunc>depend</trunc> his measure is really the difference between <pause dur="0.5"/> the ratings you give to your most preferred coworker <pause dur="0.3"/> and the ratings you give to your least preferred 
coworker <pause dur="0.3"/> basically <pause dur="0.3"/> there is # <pause dur="0.3"/> it it it's a measure of discrimination you've got <pause dur="0.2"/> you know people who <pause dur="0.4"/> for whom that difference is big <pause dur="0.2"/> discriminate a lot <pause dur="0.3"/> people <pause dur="0.5"/> # for whom that difference is <pause dur="0.6"/> small <pause dur="0.4"/> like everybody and don't discriminate very much at all <pause dur="0.5"/> now <pause dur="0.2"/> he set this <pause dur="0.4"/> against his <trunc>th</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> types of groups <pause dur="0.3"/> and found <trunc>s</trunc> basically <pause dur="0.3"/> when <pause dur="0.6"/> the <pause dur="0.2"/> things were good for the group and the task structure was high <pause dur="0.2"/> when the leader has lots of power <pause dur="0.2"/> and the leader and <pause dur="0.5"/> follow-up relationships were good <pause dur="1.0"/> then <pause dur="0.2"/> it was best to have <pause dur="0.4"/> someone <pause dur="0.3"/> who discriminated a lot <pause dur="0.3"/> someone who just got on with it 'cause it was an easy task to do <pause dur="0.4"/> when things were really bad for the group <pause dur="1.1"/> number of you know the <trunc>m</trunc> the <pause dur="0.2"/> # the leader-member relations is bad task structure low <pause dur="0.6"/> power of the leader is low <pause dur="0.3"/> then it's also <pause dur="0.3"/> best <pause dur="0.2"/> to have <pause dur="0.7"/> # the autocractic style of leader the one who makes big discriminations <pause dur="0.3"/> it's when things are in the middle <pause dur="0.9"/> then you need <trunc>s</trunc> then you need someone who's <pause dur="0.2"/> much more sort of <trunc>s</trunc> <pause dur="0.3"/> much more 
sort of subtle <pause dur="0.4"/> # # the besser better leaders when in in the intervening <pause dur="0.8"/> intermediate stages <pause dur="0.3"/> is someone who makes <pause dur="0.2"/> <trunc>le</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> fewer discriminations between these two preferred coworkers <pause dur="0.2"/> so the message coming up from Fiedler simply is you know <pause dur="0.3"/> if things are very good <pause dur="0.5"/> just get on with it doesn't matter what the leader's like <pause dur="1.0"/> # if things are very bad it doesn't really matter <pause dur="0.2"/> you know whether the leader is sort of very friendly <pause dur="0.2"/> and in all all other cases it's better to have someone who is a bit more subtle in distinguishing between people <pause dur="1.0"/> right <pause dur="0.9"/> so <pause dur="0.3"/> that <pause dur="0.3"/> that's <pause dur="0.2"/> Fiedler's contingency <pause dur="0.2"/> model of leadership and there's a lot of research <pause dur="0.2"/> stimulated by it <pause dur="0.2"/> and it is <pause dur="0.2"/> you know and a lot of research support it which you can look <pause dur="1.2"/><kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="10"/> <trunc>fur</trunc> <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.9"/> further to <pause dur="0.7"/> now <pause dur="0.6"/> coming back to <pause dur="0.2"/> or moving on really to with <pause dur="0.2"/> decision making groups i'd like now to look at <pause dur="0.5"/> risk taking and polarization <pause dur="0.4"/> as a particular <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="1.6"/> as a particular instance <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/><pause dur="0.6"/> example <pause dur="0.2"/> <trunc>th</trunc> this <pause dur="0.4"/> this is <pause dur="0.2"/> <trunc>m</trunc> this is moving 
back temporarily to really decision making within groups <pause dur="0.2"/> but particularly types special types of decision making <pause dur="0.3"/> and then i think if we can move on <pause dur="0.5"/> one <pause dur="0.2"/> <trunc>un</trunc> <pause dur="0.4"/> with what we know about risk taking and group polarization and what we know about leadership <pause dur="0.3"/> that leads into <pause dur="0.3"/> group think <pause dur="0.2"/> which i'm not sure whether i shall finish today but we might do that next week look at the beginning of next week <pause dur="0.4"/> now <pause dur="2.5"/> been quite an important topic in social psychology # i think the amount of research it's generated far outweighs its importance but i suppose it's something that worked and therefore it attracted social psychologists <pause dur="1.0"/> this <pause dur="0.2"/> risk taking <pause dur="0.3"/> really was the discovery <pause dur="0.2"/> that <pause dur="0.3"/> if you <pause dur="0.6"/> if you get groups <pause dur="0.3"/> groups of people making decisions <pause dur="0.2"/> they're not averages they're not boring <pause dur="0.2"/> you know committees aren't necessarily boring <pause dur="0.2"/> but when but when people made decisions involving risk in groups they tended to be riskier than individuals <pause dur="0.2"/> and they tend to be quite a robust sort of finding <pause dur="0.3"/> the 
paradigm here would be <pause dur="0.3"/> you have <pause dur="0.2"/> <trunc>es</trunc> well in fact the original research had a series of sort of life dilemmas <pause dur="0.4"/> the difference between <pause dur="0.3"/> <trunc>t</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> moving to a new job which was <pause dur="0.2"/> <trunc>m</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> might pay a lot in a few years' time <pause dur="0.8"/> but there is a risk you might be sort of lose the job <pause dur="0.3"/> or taking a safe job with a sort of gold watch and a pension you never earn much but you always keep that sort of job <pause dur="0.3"/> or another example is <trunc>s</trunc> someone playing <pause dur="0.4"/> in a chess match you've got a risky move you can make <pause dur="0.4"/> yeah mean it might <pause dur="0.4"/> result in you losing the chess <pause dur="0.3"/> chess match <pause dur="1.6"/> but it might just get you some really sneaky victory <pause dur="0.5"/> so <pause dur="0.6"/> when i play chess with my son he always tries fool's mate do you ever play chess <pause dur="0.3"/> in sort of three moves you can see it coming the queen comes out the bishop comes out and you see it coming you sort of <pause dur="0.2"/><shift feature="voice" new="laugh"/> move something <shift feature="voice" new="normal"/>in the way and <pause dur="0.2"/> then you're all you're all to pieces afterwards it's a risky move <pause dur="0.2"/> <trunc>co</trunc> if the other person sees it coming good move if they 
don't see it coming <pause dur="0.8"/> so <pause dur="1.7"/> that's one of the dilemmas <pause dur="0.2"/> but the the paradigm is you get individuals to sort of <pause dur="0.2"/> deal with these dilemmas individually <pause dur="0.2"/> then you get them to discuss them to consensus <pause dur="0.2"/> they argue and argue until they can agree <pause dur="0.4"/> on a on a on a decision <pause dur="0.6"/> and then you get them to # # to rate them <pause dur="0.3"/> individually afterwards so you've got predecision individual measures you've got a group consensus you've got a post-<pause dur="0.5"/>group consensus <pause dur="0.3"/> individual measure that's the paradigm <pause dur="0.4"/> and you can <pause dur="0.2"/> look <pause dur="0.2"/> at the mean of the individual decisions <pause dur="0.3"/> and compare it with the consensus <pause dur="0.8"/> 'cause usually these are <pause dur="0.5"/> # you know <pause dur="0.5"/> fixed on bipolar scales <pause dur="0.2"/> in fact the dependent variable for the risk taking <pause dur="0.3"/> experiments is <pause dur="1.1"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> the minimum odds of success you would <trunc>c</trunc> you would accept before you take the risky decision <pause dur="0.6"/> and and lo and behold <pause dur="1.5"/> the the the consensus was more risky than the the average <trunc>w</trunc> or you know what you'd have expected if it <trunc>wa</trunc> if you just looked at the average of the initial 
decisions <pause dur="0.4"/> now <pause dur="1.3"/> there are <pause dur="0.9"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> a lot of <pause dur="0.4"/> well a variety of explanations that go on here <pause dur="0.2"/> and certain they take us back to the Deutsch <pause dur="0.2"/> and Gerard <pause dur="0.4"/> normative and informational aspects of group influence are wheeled out to discuss this <pause dur="0.3"/> you've got two types of <pause dur="0.4"/> <trunc>dis</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> two types of explanation here <pause dur="0.4"/> on the one hand there is actually what is said in the groups <pause dur="0.2"/> if you if you look at the <pause dur="0.3"/> interactions <pause dur="0.6"/> people say different things oh i wouldn't take that job and they bring in information <pause dur="1.6"/> and # <pause dur="1.0"/> you know there's a sort of informational social influence going on here in these groups <pause dur="0.5"/> but there is also <pause dur="0.4"/> <trunc>th</trunc> as a normative type of explanation as well <pause dur="0.3"/> risk is risk is cool you know being risky is a bit cool rather than being sort of boring <pause dur="0.6"/> and <pause dur="0.4"/> in as much as <pause dur="0.6"/> wider values are evoked and preferences which are really embodied in norms and values <pause dur="0.8"/> you we get an explanation <pause dur="0.3"/> in terms of the cultural values for for risk <pause dur="0.8"/> there's something else a bit of a problem with these studies <pause dur="0.3"/> and that is that 
sometimes people get cautious as well <pause dur="0.3"/> on some types of dilemmas people get cautious <pause dur="0.3"/> but on some dilemmas <pause dur="0.2"/> people <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> go for risk it's not always risky <pause dur="0.3"/> and that really led to <pause dur="0.2"/> a development of the risk taking <pause dur="0.5"/><kinesic desc="reveals covered part of transparency" iterated="n"/> literature <pause dur="0.3"/> group polarization it was suggested that really <pause dur="0.3"/> risk taking <pause dur="0.3"/> was quite possibly just a <pause dur="0.3"/> a specific <pause dur="0.5"/> # instance <pause dur="0.2"/> of a more general <pause dur="0.9"/> # <pause dur="1.4"/> tendency <pause dur="0.2"/> for groups to <pause dur="3.8"/> to make more extreme decisions on anything they happen to be talking about <pause dur="0.3"/> than individuals <pause dur="0.4"/> this was introduced by Moscovici and Zavalloni Journal of Personality and Social Psychology nineteen-sixty-nine <pause dur="0.3"/> and much developed <trunc>af</trunc> developed afterwards in subsequent years <pause dur="0.7"/> but <pause dur="0.5"/> polarization <pause dur="0.7"/> really refers to the fact that <trunc>i</trunc> if there is a tendency <pause dur="0.3"/> for a group in one direction <pause dur="0.5"/> or another <pause dur="0.4"/> that after a group discussion <pause dur="0.2"/> they will move more in that direction <pause dur="1.4"/> the word <trunc>l</trunc> you can talk about extrematization just becoming more extreme <pause dur="1.0"/> polarization is really a <trunc>s</trunc> # # an example of extrematization within a 
group <pause dur="0.4"/> if there is a <pause dur="0.3"/> a tendency for the group to <pause dur="0.2"/> have leaned in one direction to be for an issue or against an issue <pause dur="0.4"/> before a particular attitude or a point of view <pause dur="0.2"/> before it starts <pause dur="1.3"/> after group discussion <pause dur="0.2"/> they will tend to realize that point of view <pause dur="0.3"/> more than they did before they started <pause dur="1.2"/> and that's quite an <pause dur="0.3"/> important and quite a robust finding and feeds into a lot of <pause dur="0.3"/> a lot of aspects of group decision making <pause dur="1.4"/> now <pause dur="2.3"/> there are <pause dur="2.1"/> once again a variety unfortunately of explanations for this <pause dur="0.2"/> and they all seem to work <pause dur="0.3"/> the literature is full of studies which show that this works <pause dur="0.2"/> and then <pause dur="0.4"/> another study which shows <pause dur="0.2"/> well this works too <pause dur="0.2"/> if you if i try to isolate the variables that are behind this group extrematization <pause dur="0.4"/> but basically they come down to <pause dur="0.6"/> four types of explanation <pause dur="0.3"/> affective cognitive statistical and interactive <pause dur="0.3"/> and i think as i've <pause dur="0.4"/> spent too too long at the beginning <pause dur="0.2"/> i think i'll go this <pause dur="0.2"/> thus far <pause dur="0.3"/> rather than well i'm not going to be able to whip through 
group thinking in <pause dur="0.2"/> five minutes 'cause it'll take about ten minutes to talk about 'cause it is <pause dur="0.3"/> it is rather important so <pause dur="0.3"/> i'll just just <pause dur="1.0"/> go this far and talk about group polarization <pause dur="0.2"/> and then squeeze in i think it'll be quite comfortable next week to <pause dur="0.2"/> to squeeze in <pause dur="0.3"/> the group think factor <pause dur="0.4"/> now <pause dur="1.1"/> what have we got then <pause dur="0.2"/> are <pause dur="0.4"/> affective cognitive statistical and interactive explanations <pause dur="0.2"/> and all these <pause dur="0.2"/> are <pause dur="0.4"/> relevant <pause dur="0.4"/> to <pause dur="0.7"/> group decision making <pause dur="1.6"/> in this sort of paradigm when we're comparing <pause dur="0.4"/> individual <pause dur="0.6"/> positions <pause dur="0.2"/> with a group position <pause dur="0.4"/> affective <pause dur="0.4"/> means <pause dur="0.7"/> that <pause dur="0.2"/> that the explanation <pause dur="0.7"/> the well that the effects of discussion <pause dur="0.7"/> # are on how one feels about the issue so this is about attitude change in a way <pause dur="0.2"/> but really especially the affective how one feels <pause dur="0.2"/> how one values something after you've after you've talked about it <pause dur="1.4"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> but clearly this is also <pause dur="0.5"/> while <pause dur="0.3"/> in passing we should <pause dur="0.4"/> we should mention <pause dur="0.3"/> that <pause dur="0.2"/> we're really talking about attitude change here as well <pause dur="1.0"/> as another <pause dur="0.3"/> sort of an 
interactive effect on attitude change <pause dur="0.4"/> we talked about attitude change <pause dur="0.2"/> in terms of # <pause dur="0.6"/> persuasion <pause dur="0.9"/> we talked about attitude <trunc>cherm</trunc> attitude change <pause dur="0.3"/> in terms of <pause dur="0.2"/> consistency theories <pause dur="0.2"/> reminded you of functions <pause dur="0.2"/> but there are interactive effects as well <pause dur="0.3"/> when one's dealing with attitudes looking round group effects well what does the group think you know how is this making me feel <pause dur="0.2"/> and so on <pause dur="0.3"/> so we've got <pause dur="0.5"/> we've got affective <pause dur="0.5"/> # and under this heading as well as as how how changing how one feels about the issue under discuss <pause dur="0.2"/> discussion <pause dur="0.4"/> are <pause dur="0.4"/> concepts like <pause dur="0.2"/> diffusion of responsibility <pause dur="1.0"/> you know we don't feel quite so responsible <pause dur="1.1"/> or <pause dur="0.5"/> the social comparison looking around and seeing how everybody else feels <pause dur="0.3"/> or impression management <pause dur="0.4"/> mm i don't want to be <pause dur="0.3"/> look dull or sad on this issue i'd better sort of change <pause dur="0.2"/> what i say and what i do <pause dur="0.5"/> these these are all <pause dur="0.4"/> <trunc>b</trunc> could affect how one feels about <pause dur="0.2"/> the issue under discussion <pause dur="1.0"/> and then there are cognitive explanations <pause dur="0.7"/> here <pause dur="0.6"/> here <pause dur="0.2"/> what 
<trunc>hap</trunc> this is the <trunc>inf</trunc> about the information content in the interaction <pause dur="1.5"/> # you just hear things that you didn't know before <pause dur="0.2"/> people give statistics people give information <pause dur="0.4"/> people <pause dur="0.2"/> give examples and of course here we're open to all those # <pause dur="0.3"/> heuristics and biases for representation people talk about what their granny did well i've already done that you know oh that that means it yes i'll take notice of that <pause dur="0.6"/> so <pause dur="1.1"/> as well as affect of course <pause dur="0.2"/> there's the information in the group <pause dur="0.4"/> is done <pause dur="0.4"/> now <pause dur="0.5"/> there are also # <pause dur="0.8"/> explanations which are really up <pause dur="0.3"/> to <trunc>she</trunc> suggests it's really artefactual <pause dur="0.4"/> if you <trunc>s</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> if you have a lot of people if you have a wide distribution i suppose i could <pause dur="1.7"/> let's draw this <pause dur="0.5"/> if you had if you <trunc>s</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="4"/> if <pause dur="0.3"/> if we could somehow imagine that this was sort of positive <pause dur="0.6"/> and this was negative <pause dur="0.2"/> and we had a sort of wide distribution <pause dur="0.6"/> of opinion and this represented neutrality couldn't care or was sort of individual <pause dur="0.3"/> <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="5"/> if you had some people in the group who 
were sort of out this way <pause dur="0.8"/> and some people a couple of people who are out this way <pause dur="0.4"/> something like that <pause dur="0.3"/> now <pause dur="0.3"/> the mean position if you were to <trunc>m</trunc> measure and these experiments do measure it <pause dur="0.3"/> of their positions i guess would be somewhere around <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="1"/> here before you start <pause dur="0.3"/> now <pause dur="0.5"/> in discussing <pause dur="0.3"/> they all might become more <pause dur="0.3"/> they all might become more reasonable if you like <pause dur="0.3"/> more neutral so <pause dur="0.2"/> they could all sort of <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="10"/> shift in <pause dur="1.0"/> but these might shift in a bit more <pause dur="1.1"/> than those <pause dur="0.2"/> now <pause dur="0.4"/> the sort of the means of this new range of positions might be something like this <pause dur="1.1"/> so they've all moved to less extreme positions <pause dur="0.2"/> but the group mean would probably have <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="1"/> gone <pause dur="0.6"/> out to there <pause dur="0.7"/> so <pause dur="0.6"/> we're we're we're to <pause dur="0.2"/> we're to take care <pause dur="0.5"/> in this sort of paradigm that not all <pause dur="0.2"/> apparent extrematization of the group <pause dur="0.3"/> represents extrematization or polarization of opinions <pause dur="0.3"/> it is the case 
in some of these experiments are quite <pause dur="0.4"/> are quite naughty in in <trunc>a</trunc> in overlooking this <pause dur="0.3"/> that <pause dur="0.6"/> it is possible for individual members all to converge <pause dur="0.9"/> to a <pause dur="0.6"/> to a sort of central position <pause dur="0.2"/> but the group <trunc>i</trunc> but for it to appear as if the group <trunc>mu</trunc> mean <pause dur="0.3"/> has # <pause dur="0.2"/> moved to a <pause dur="1.1"/> # a more extreme position <pause dur="1.3"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> and then <pause dur="0.3"/> there are <pause dur="0.4"/> also <pause dur="0.4"/> <trunc>wh</trunc> what we might call interactive <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="3.0"/> explanations <pause dur="0.3"/> i'll just i'll just <pause dur="0.2"/> <trunc>j</trunc> <trunc>j</trunc> just make this the penultimate point <pause dur="0.4"/> and that is that <pause dur="0.5"/> just <trunc>di</trunc> different people have different styles of arguing <pause dur="0.3"/> some people are more forceful <pause dur="0.2"/> some people just say more <pause dur="0.2"/> it's not the information but it's just how relentless they are <pause dur="0.5"/> they might appear <pause dur="0.6"/> once again they might appear more influential they might appear more knowledgeable <pause dur="0.3"/> they might appear more confident they might look more attractive <pause dur="0.2"/> et cetera <pause dur="0.3"/> there are these <pause dur="0.3"/> these are variables <pause dur="0.2"/> which <pause dur="0.3"/> which <trunc>sugge</trunc> you know perhaps it is the the more polarized people <pause dur="0.2"/> just are more confident about their attitudes <pause dur="0.2"/> and 
there's a differentiation <pause dur="0.2"/> in the amount of influence that the <trunc>indi</trunc> that each individual has within the group <pause dur="0.5"/> so <pause dur="0.2"/> we've got four types of # <pause dur="0.3"/> interaction there <pause dur="0.3"/> and once again <pause dur="0.2"/> we can split these up <pause dur="0.2"/> back to <trunc>deu</trunc> Deutsch and Gerard's normative and information influence within groups <pause dur="0.3"/> it's either the the information that goes on in in groups <pause dur="0.2"/> or it's something about the relationship between people and their feelings that go on within groups <pause dur="0.6"/> and <pause dur="0.4"/> it seems that <pause dur="0.4"/> one way of sort of clarifying which of these explanations is going to be the more useful <pause dur="0.2"/> the more <pause dur="0.5"/> yes the more useful in describing why we get this polarization within groups <pause dur="0.3"/> is <pause dur="0.3"/> when <pause dur="0.7"/> <trunc>i</trunc> is to look really at the type of task that's in front of us <pause dur="0.3"/> if it's one that's really heavy on information <pause dur="0.9"/> and the the the right decision will just really be based <pause dur="0.2"/> not so much on attitudes or values but it'll be just knowing the right things to do working out the calculations and so on <pause dur="0.4"/> then <pause dur="0.4"/> the then obviously we're going to be in the realm of cognitive <pause dur="0.6"/> informational <pause dur="0.6"/> persuasive arguments <pause dur="0.3"/> <trunc>interac</trunc> you know <pause dur="0.5"/> persuasive 
arguments type of <pause dur="0.3"/> type of # <pause dur="0.4"/> explanations <pause dur="0.4"/> <trunc>s</trunc> <pause dur="0.4"/> on the other hand <pause dur="0.3"/> if what we're talking about in the group <pause dur="0.5"/> is something that involves <pause dur="0.2"/> values <pause dur="0.2"/> and preferences <pause dur="2.4"/> and # <pause dur="0.7"/> yes values and preferences <pause dur="0.2"/> values # and preferences <pause dur="0.2"/> then <pause dur="0.2"/> we're we're going to be more in the role <pause dur="0.2"/> # more in the domain of affective <pause dur="0.6"/> types of explanations <pause dur="0.7"/> so <pause dur="0.4"/> that's there's a # you'll see if you read accounts of this there's a lot of  <trunc>diff</trunc> <pause dur="0.5"/> disagreement <pause dur="0.5"/> in which <trunc>o</trunc> which is the most important explanation for the polarizing effect of groups <pause dur="0.3"/> but it really does depend <pause dur="0.4"/> on us taking a wide <pause dur="0.4"/> sort of stance on the sorts of <pause dur="0.5"/> causes that there could be <pause dur="1.7"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> looking carefully at the task and then working out <pause dur="0.3"/> # how the <trunc>sor</trunc> how each of these influences could interact with the task <pause dur="0.4"/> now <pause dur="0.5"/> i think the <trunc>ta</trunc> i think that's a good place to stop i've overrun anyway <pause dur="0.3"/> and <pause dur="0.3"/> i'm going to follow this up to talk about group <pause dur="0.9"/> group think next week <pause dur="0.3"/> which will be a sort of synthesis <pause dur="0.2"/> of what we know about leadership <pause dur="0.8"/> and what we know <pause dur="0.5"/> about <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> decision making <pause dur="0.4"/> and and we'll look to see how group <pause dur="0.4"/> decisions are are defective <pause dur="0.3"/> okay
