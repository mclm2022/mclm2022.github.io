<u who="nm1141"> <kinesic desc="overhead projector is on showing transparency" iterated="n"/> two sets of handouts coming round # the blue handout which you've now all got <pause dur="0.5"/> and a single white sheet <pause dur="0.8"/> i should just explain that i was experimenting <pause dur="0.4"/> # scanning and then taking things into this handout and that has meant that some of the material isn't <pause dur="0.4"/> as clear as it should be <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> and i will remedy that by giving you a supplementary sheet which has those images <pause dur="0.3"/> clearer next time we meet <pause dur="0.7"/> # so that's <pause dur="0.3"/> <trunc>th</trunc> <trunc>th</trunc> the second sheet is a white sheet which is just an extra one which i hadn't # <pause dur="0.6"/> included as i worked on the lecture <pause dur="1.1"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> i should say <pause dur="0.3"/> as we go through this lecture <pause dur="0.5"/> <trunc>the</trunc> there's there's a lot of illustrations on <trunc>thi</trunc> in this lecture <pause dur="0.5"/> and i may not follow the handout slavishly in other words everything that's on the handout will be covered but not necessarily in the order that it's # on the handout <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> what i suggest you do is that i will try to make <trunc>s</trunc> i'm going to sort of <pause dur="0.2"/> talk without slides to start with <pause dur="0.8"/> # the introductory remarks <pause dur="0.4"/> and then # <pause dur="0.6"/> we'll go into sort of slides and 
so on # and <pause dur="0.2"/> what you really <trunc>ne</trunc> need to try and do is to use the handout as a kind of aide-memoire <pause dur="0.6"/> of the issues and so on that we're talking about <pause dur="0.8"/> now <pause dur="0.3"/> you might also think that # high technology T-V has hit us <pause dur="0.5"/> # <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> is from # the Centre for Applied Language Studies <pause dur="0.4"/> they are doing some research into the vocabulary it's funny <trunc>int</trunc> <trunc>int</trunc> isn't it interesting you went quiet when i started this there was a kind of <pause dur="0.6"/> a a buzz while i was talking until the high technology bit came in <pause dur="0.4"/> and you thought i was in in for it <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> they are doing some research into the vocabulary which # different academics use <pause dur="0.4"/> # in order that they can better equip students international students coming here with the kinds of things that we say <pause dur="0.4"/> swings and roundabouts was the expression given as an example to me just now <pause dur="0.5"/> which was apparently used in four times in a lectures or in four <trunc>pe</trunc> four </u><u who="of1142" trans="overlap"> four times in thirty lectures </u><u who="nm1141" trans="overlap"> four times in thirty lectures and they hadn't <pause dur="0.2"/> realized 
it you know swings and roundabouts might be a phrase we would use a lot but international students wouldn't recognize <pause dur="0.4"/> so here i am <pause dur="0.3"/> # strapped up <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> fortunately # Jeremy Paxman isn't in the audience <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> and hopefully # <pause dur="0.2"/> <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> will get some useful material <pause dur="1.5"/> okay today's topic is <pause dur="0.2"/> trends in office design and development <pause dur="1.3"/> and as the opening quote says # <pause dur="0.5"/> yeah <reading>office buildings are one of these great icons of the twentieth <trunc>se</trunc> century</reading> <pause dur="0.5"/> and i'm going to show some slides in a minute which which perhaps give some <trunc>il</trunc> illustration of that <pause dur="0.5"/> an a <reading>visible index of economic activity <pause dur="0.2"/> social technology financial progress <pause dur="0.7"/> they've come to symbolize much of what this century is about</reading> <pause dur="0.8"/> # what i'm going to be doing during the course of this lecture is <pause dur="0.4"/><kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="7"/> taking you through <pause dur="0.3"/> different periods if you like # of office development <pause dur="1.3"/> # and <pause dur="0.2"/> the factors if you like <pause dur="0.5"/> # that condition <pause dur="0.2"/> the <trunc>u</trunc> the the types of buildings we create <pause dur="0.4"/> how we create them <pause dur="0.4"/> how we use them <pause dur="1.3"/> and also and this is very significant in the 
context of property development <pause dur="0.4"/> # whilst <pause dur="0.2"/> work patterns change very fast by office cultures change perhaps very fast <pause dur="0.4"/> of course the fabric is essentially rather static <pause dur="0.5"/> you build a building and you might traditionally have expected it to been there sixty years <pause dur="0.5"/> well we've got some nineteen-sixties we've got <trunc>m</trunc> some much older office buildings <pause dur="0.5"/> some of which # <trunc>s</trunc> certainly # <pause dur="0.5"/> are <trunc>n</trunc> <pause dur="0.5"/> are still there but are pretty redundant <pause dur="0.4"/> others have been through various processes of alterations <pause dur="0.3"/> others soon will have to be altered <pause dur="0.3"/> the fact is the stock of buildings <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> <trunc>i</trunc> is very fixed <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> despite the types of changes that are going on <pause dur="0.3"/> # in the demands we make on those buildings <pause dur="0.5"/> so i want to after some introductory remarks # cover these sort of different periods of of office development the nineteen-sixties' and as i've said seventies' building <pause dur="0.7"/> the b√ºrolandschaft which is a sort of open plan office building buildings of the nineteen-eighties <pause dur="0.5"/> big bang offices <pause dur="0.2"/> big bang is something 
which has kind of probably passed you by <pause dur="0.4"/> it was the deregulation of the Stock Exchange in the mid-nineteen-eighties <pause dur="0.4"/> # and that resulted in certain sorts of office buildings being created particularly in the City of London <pause dur="0.6"/> nineteen-nineties' office buildings <pause dur="0.4"/> i've put on the handout this issue of office buildings and the city <pause dur="0.4"/> the impact that buildings have <pause dur="0.4"/> on the form if you like and character of our towns but i'm not going to talk too much about that <pause dur="0.6"/> and then some # concluding <kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="12"/> remarks <pause dur="1.7"/> so let's start with <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> this the introduction before we go into the <pause dur="0.3"/> lights down <pause dur="0.5"/> visuals on and all the rest of it <pause dur="2.6"/> on the handout i say that there are four <pause dur="0.2"/> aspects # <pause dur="0.4"/> if you like which you need to understand in trying to understand office development <pause dur="0.7"/> and i've also given you to sort of <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/><kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="8"/> flesh that out which i <trunc>wa</trunc> just want you to have in the back of your mind as you go through the talk <pause dur="0.4"/> this diagram <pause dur="0.6"/> # which in a kind of way are also four aspects aspects to do with the workplace <pause dur="0.4"/> 
systems <pause dur="0.3"/> culture and finance just have that <pause dur="0.8"/> # in the back of your mind and you can come back and and reread it <pause dur="0.7"/> # because it kind of provides a context for what we're going to be talking about <pause dur="0.8"/> but the four that i've listed on the handout came from <pause dur="0.4"/> # a a a <pause dur="0.2"/> a <pause dur="0.6"/> an article or a series of articles that now appear annually a thing called Trends in Office Design <pause dur="0.8"/> and you'll see that in the handout i've listed <pause dur="0.4"/> the last # five of them or the last four and say i'm expecting <pause dur="0.2"/> Office Design Two-Thousand to come any minute <pause dur="0.8"/> but in the nineteen-#-ninety-six # version of Trends in Office # Design or Office Trends <pause dur="0.7"/> # Saxon # who is an architect talked about these four areas the changing nature of work <pause dur="0.4"/> and the way buildings <pause dur="0.5"/> locate <pause dur="0.7"/> just think about that <pause dur="0.3"/> how <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> patterns of work have changed and are changing <pause dur="0.2"/> we talk these days about things like hotdesking <pause dur="0.4"/> we talk about hotelling <pause dur="0.7"/> how different that is <pause dur="0.3"/> from the patterns of work in offices let's say in the nineteen-sixties and seventies and i'll 
illustrate that as we go through <pause dur="1.5"/> there are issues to do with development and investment how how do we <pause dur="0.2"/> go about procuring and producing office buildings <pause dur="0.7"/> one of the things i want to do is to highlight different traditions <pause dur="0.6"/> between the sort of <trunc>traditio</trunc> the # what i would call the Anglo-Saxon North American tradition of speculative office buildings <pause dur="0.7"/> and a more European tradition of what one might call bespoke <pause dur="0.2"/> or custom-built office buildings buildings that are commissioned by the occupiers <pause dur="0.4"/> rather than just lenting renting any building that comes along <pause dur="0.9"/> issues to do with how the urban system works where we locate our offices <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> what do planning policies have to say about office locations <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> you'll all know that we're trying to move away from greenfield developments <pause dur="0.4"/> that implies more urban office developments <pause dur="0.3"/> what does that mean for the form of offices <pause dur="1.3"/> and then issues to do with the design of the workplace and construction <pause dur="0.5"/> some of us recently <pause dur="0.5"/> in Berlin were seeing 
different office buildings different standards of construction and many others of you will be going on <pause dur="0.4"/> visits when hopefully you'll be looking at office buildings <pause dur="0.4"/> so <pause dur="0.3"/> there are different when we talk about <pause dur="0.3"/> trends in office design and development <pause dur="0.2"/> you need to keep these different sorts of areas <pause dur="0.3"/> in mind it's not just simply the building <pause dur="0.6"/> it's all the factors the circumstances which are surrounding the construction the development <pause dur="0.2"/> the design <pause dur="0.3"/> the use the occupation <pause dur="0.2"/> the management of those buildings <pause dur="1.3"/> so this is also a lecture where <pause dur="0.4"/> for example those of you who have had some of Ginny Gibson's material on <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> property use management maintenance and so on <pause dur="0.4"/> <trunc>wi</trunc> can begin to <trunc>fi</trunc> fit into what we've been talking about here facilities management <pause dur="0.2"/> that's an aspect that comes into the equation <pause dur="1.6"/> so <pause dur="0.2"/> that's some of the # the ground i want to cover <pause dur="0.5"/> now <pause dur="0.3"/> i also want you to <kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="13"/> have in mind <pause dur="0.5"/> as we go through today's session <pause dur="0.7"/> this diagram you have in your handout <pause dur="1.6"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> these different sorts of # <pause dur="0.3"/> 
office buildings <pause dur="2.1"/> i'll start by talking it's on the back of your handout <pause dur="0.6"/> i'll be starting by talking about this traditional British speculative office building very much a product if you like <pause dur="0.4"/> of the nineteen-fifties the sixties into the nineteen-seventies <pause dur="0.4"/> a sort of slab it might be a a straight slab it might be <pause dur="0.3"/> an L-shaped it might be T-shaped <pause dur="0.2"/> but it has particular characteristics and i'll be talking about that <pause dur="1.0"/> as we move into the nineteen-seventies and so on we get this <pause dur="0.4"/> this type of office the open plan office <pause dur="0.6"/> # called b√ºrolandschaft in its in its particular form from Germany <pause dur="0.3"/> # but deep floor space and i'll be talking about some of <pause dur="0.3"/> its influences and characteristics <pause dur="1.0"/> we have other types of offices the the the the deeper plan floor plates that you find in places like Broadgate and Stockley Park i'll be illustrating that <pause dur="1.0"/> we might be talking a little bit about the North American but we'll also particularly be talking about what on this diagram is called the <pause dur="0.5"/> # new 
north European tradition <pause dur="0.7"/> examples of office buildings which <pause dur="0.5"/> are <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> designed <pause dur="0.2"/> with let's say <pause dur="0.2"/> this is being a bit simplistic <pause dur="0.3"/> with the user <pause dur="0.6"/> rather than the developer <pause dur="0.2"/> in mind <pause dur="0.3"/> and i'll explain what i mean by that later on <pause dur="0.3"/> an emphasis on <pause dur="0.3"/> usability <pause dur="0.4"/> adaptability from the point of view of who's occupying it a specific occupier <pause dur="0.4"/> rather than the idea that you design an office building that <pause dur="0.4"/> any number of organizations can # <pause dur="0.2"/> occupy <pause dur="0.4"/> so <pause dur="0.2"/> again as we go through the lecture apart from having in mind those different <pause dur="0.2"/> areas of change if you like <pause dur="0.4"/> just keep <pause dur="0.3"/> your bearings on the fact that we're talking in essence about <pause dur="0.5"/> different configurations of buildings different shapes different plan forms and so on <pause dur="5.2"/><kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="9"/> okay just <pause dur="0.2"/> # back to that <pause dur="0.4"/> so <pause dur="0.4"/> what we're seeing then is a situation in which # <pause dur="0.5"/> you know we have we start <pause dur="0.2"/> the period that we're looking at with a kind of fairly standard office building it'll be the slab and i'll explain that in a minute <pause dur="1.0"/> and if we move through the different decades <pause dur="0.5"/> different <pause dur="0.4"/> 
innovation <pause dur="0.2"/> innovation takes it has an effect it <trunc>i</trunc> <trunc>ha</trunc> it impacts if you like on the design of office buildings <pause dur="0.4"/> but not in a very <pause dur="0.4"/> clear focused way <pause dur="0.4"/> # just to give you an illustration of that <pause dur="0.2"/> i will <pause dur="0.2"/> in the course of the lecture <pause dur="0.8"/> when we're talking about the nineteen-eighties refer you to a building designed by a man called Niels Torp <pause dur="0.6"/> who was a Scandinavian architect who built the headquarters <pause dur="0.3"/> for the # Scandinavian Airlines 
interesting building fascinating building <pause dur="1.6"/> when you get to the nineteen-nineties late nineteen-nineties you'll discover that <pause dur="0.7"/> B-A <pause dur="0.4"/> British Airports some of you might have seen it have been have had the new headquarters built <pause dur="0.6"/> by the same architect <pause dur="0.6"/> ten years later therefore we have the Scandinavian ideas <pause dur="0.2"/> impacting on British office design <pause dur="1.2"/> another illustration of that might be # <pause dur="0.2"/> you'll discover it in the course of the lecture that some of the factors which are driving <pause dur="0.4"/> the unusual sometimes configuration of <pause dur="0.5"/> office buildings on the continent 
not always but sometimes <pause dur="0.6"/> are to do with employment legislation <pause dur="0.4"/> workers' councils employers' rights employees' rights <pause dur="1.0"/> any consequence to us <pause dur="0.6"/> well not much at the moment <pause dur="0.6"/> but we're part of the European Union <pause dur="0.6"/> we could be there in five or six years time some of the factors which have driven <pause dur="0.4"/> the design of # European offices <pause dur="0.3"/> might have an effect on us <pause dur="0.4"/> so we've got this kind of diffusion of innovation of regulation of pressures and so on <pause dur="1.7"/> i've already mentioned this question of custom and speculative office buildings that's another strand that's going to run through the lecture <pause dur="1.0"/> it's said and it's a character a sort of a <pause dur="0.3"/> i suppose a maybe it's a myth i don't know i think it's more than that <pause dur="0.7"/> but in this country we own our houses and we rent our offices <pause dur="1.0"/> the converse is very often said about Europe <pause dur="0.7"/> they rent their houses and they own their office buildings <pause dur="0.8"/> now there's a <trunc>n</trunc> there's a significant there's a consequence to that <pause dur="0.3"/> it's not always true of course but it is a kind of trend <pause dur="0.4"/> a generality <pause dur="0.4"/> 
which influences if you like the way they approach # buildings <pause dur="2.6"/> office development cycles another factor which you need just to have in the back of your mind <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> i've shown you a diagram along the way of <pause dur="0.2"/> the development process <pause dur="1.5"/><kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="6"/> you'll remember this horrible diagram <pause dur="0.6"/> you've got it in your handouts <pause dur="0.7"/> remember it <pause dur="0.4"/> groan groan <pause dur="0.9"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> the point of that though is that <pause dur="0.8"/> you know you're <pause dur="0.5"/> if we're talking about offices that are being built over the decades they're going to be influenced by where they sit in the development cycle <pause dur="1.7"/> in the nineteen-<pause dur="0.2"/>eighties <pause dur="0.8"/> a lot of office development was driven by <pause dur="0.5"/> people <pause dur="0.2"/> wanting to invest in offices <pause dur="0.4"/> it was investment led <pause dur="0.9"/> and therefore the financial institutions as i mentioned last week <pause dur="0.6"/> had certain criteria that they applied to buildings that they bought as investments <pause dur="0.6"/> and those criteria then impacted on the design of those buildings <pause dur="1.4"/> you move to the nineteen-nineties and we move to <pause dur="0.4"/> what's said to be the customer is king a seller's market if you 
like <pause dur="0.4"/> position where the tenant prospective tenant is very # <pause dur="0.2"/> # dominant <pause dur="1.2"/> we begin to find that those <pause dur="0.2"/> criteria which the institutions applied <pause dur="0.3"/> are taking a back seat <pause dur="0.4"/> # and they're not playing such an important role <pause dur="0.3"/> because <pause dur="0.3"/> the cycle's moved on <pause dur="0.3"/> different factors are affecting <pause dur="0.2"/> # the <pause dur="0.7"/> situation <pause dur="1.1"/> but again set as i said <pause dur="0.4"/> changing market conditions <pause dur="0.2"/> but we've got a <pause dur="0.2"/> essentially a fixed stock <pause dur="1.1"/> of course we're building new offices all the time <pause dur="0.6"/> but institutions are left holding offices <pause dur="0.5"/> that they bought they invested in <pause dur="0.3"/> from the nineties from the eighties <pause dur="0.4"/> from the seventies sometimes from the sixties <pause dur="0.4"/> what do they do with those buildings how adaptable are they <pause dur="0.5"/> how easily can you change them to meet the new requirements <pause dur="0.7"/> so that's the kind of context i think i want you to have # in the back of your mind <pause dur="0.5"/> # as we go through # the lecture today <pause dur="1.9"/><kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="10"/> and as i say we're going to be <pause dur="1.0"/> spending a lot of time with the lights down low <pause dur="0.6"/> and # <pause dur="1.2"/> slides # showing <pause dur="2.9"/> okay <pause dur="0.9"/> nineteen-sixties and as it says on the handout <pause dur="0.3"/> 
in brackets <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> also the nineteen-<pause dur="2.4"/>eighties let's just <pause dur="0.5"/> let's try that <pause dur="0.8"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> okay <pause dur="2.5"/> before we get there <pause dur="2.0"/> remember that slide <pause dur="1.2"/> right at the end of the lecture <pause dur="0.5"/> we'll come back to that slide but there'll be an addition <pause dur="1.3"/> and remember that first quote office buildings are one of the great icons of the twentieth century <pause dur="0.6"/> this is downtown <pause dur="0.3"/> Dallas <pause dur="3.5"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> downtown Toronto <pause dur="0.3"/> yeah just think about the the dominance that office buildings play on the townscape <pause dur="1.1"/> and also instead of just thinking about those as forms <pause dur="0.6"/> think about <pause dur="0.4"/> what's going on in those buildings what's giving rise to that form <pause dur="0.3"/> why are many of them downtown Toronto downtown Dallas so tall <pause dur="0.4"/> # think about the configuration the basic configuration of the buildings <pause dur="0.5"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> # they they fatten out well that's a product of light and planning requirements and so on but essentially they're # they're tall thin buildings <pause dur="2.1"/> that is downtown City of London <pause dur="0.8"/> # doesn't have quite the same # <pause dur="0.7"/> visual image Saint Paul's is just off to the right and it's a <trunc>sho</trunc> a

developments like <pause dur="0.3"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> # Stockley Park <pause dur="1.0"/> # which <pause dur="0.3"/> there obviously is a connection i want to explain what that connection is in terms of their layout and organization <pause dur="2.0"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> and buildings like this which are # designed the headquarters of what was then the C-E-G-B <pause dur="0.2"/> # in Bristol <pause dur="0.7"/> # designed by Ove Arup and Partners who i mentioned last week to you <pause dur="0.5"/> # but <pause dur="0.3"/> some very significant lessons in the design of this essentially suburban office building <pause dur="0.3"/> feeding back through to the design of <pause dur="0.4"/> # # urban offices <pause dur="0.7"/> so <pause dur="0.3"/> in the back of your mind i want you to <trunc>ha</trunc> realize that offices are not just offices <pause dur="0.3"/> there are all sorts of different office buildings different ages <pause dur="0.5"/> different factors have influenced their design they have different characteristics <pause dur="0.3"/> they are more or less adaptable to change <pause dur="0.5"/> they reflect the kind of organization <pause dur="0.5"/> that <pause dur="0.5"/> was <pause dur="0.4"/> prevalent <pause dur="0.2"/> when those office buildings were conceived <pause dur="0.6"/> and if we change the patterns of work <pause dur="0.5"/> work is changing how we work how many people work and so on <pause dur="0.4"/> in a building <pause dur="0.4"/> then 
those buildings themselves have to adapt <pause dur="0.2"/> change <pause dur="0.4"/> or they become redundant <pause dur="2.1"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> okay so let's # talk about our nineteen-sixties' <pause dur="1.3"/> i refer the to this as what i call the bargain basement approach to office design <pause dur="1.2"/> you'll remember that last week i talked about the good enough approach the idea that why build anything to a higher standard when you have a market <pause dur="0.4"/> that will take the building at <pause dur="0.3"/> the lower standard which perhaps takes less <trunc>e</trunc> less effort <pause dur="0.4"/> # and so on <pause dur="0.8"/> well that's kind of characteristic of the nineteen-sixties' and nineteen-seventies' design of office building <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="0.9"/> it was a building boom period of building boom <pause dur="0.8"/> 
the office buildings we had of this period were essentially cellular office buildings <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> single rooms <pause dur="0.2"/> easily provided providing for corridors <pause dur="0.4"/> # along <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> along their floor plate i don't know whether you can see this terribly clearly but here we have an L-shaped building <pause dur="1.0"/> you can see that we've got glazing on both sides we have a corridor running down the middle <pause dur="0.4"/> # as it happens where the two buildings connect we've got service courts lift courts and so on <pause dur="0.6"/> here's a straight building <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> essentially a <trunc>s</trunc> a slab in which the <pause dur="0.3"/> # let me just find my <pause dur="0.7"/> pen <pause dur="2.7"/> the # the core of the building is at one end and the escape staircase is at the other <pause dur="0.9"/> now <pause dur="0.2"/> if you were to study this building in some detail you would discover for example that characteristically <pause dur="0.5"/> it is about <pause dur="0.3"/> # thirteen metres side to side <pause dur="1.3"/> course we didn't talk about metres then we talked in imperial terms it was about forty to forty-five feet either side <pause dur="0.8"/> # there was a 
set sort of column spacing <pause dur="0.3"/> the windows were very commonly round about four feet the mullions <pause dur="0.4"/> one to another <pause dur="0.9"/> four four to five feet something like that <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> and <pause dur="0.8"/> net to gross of a building like this in other words the amount of floor space that was available to let <pause dur="0.7"/> as against the amount the gross floor area of the building <pause dur="0.3"/> was often round about seventy per cent <pause dur="0.3"/> so <pause dur="0.3"/> you had a building like this and seventy perhaps a little bit more per cent of the floor space was available to let <pause dur="0.4"/> and therefore you could attach the rental value to that and capitalize it and you would come up with the <pause dur="0.4"/> value of the building <pause dur="2.0"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> that illustrates the layout very well again <pause dur="0.5"/> idea of a central corridor escape staircase <pause dur="0.4"/> # core at this end <pause dur="0.4"/> and we've got a building which can be let into these sort of cellular offices <pause dur="0.9"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> that # what does that do it means you've got privacy privacy to work <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> it's a kind of time-honoured way of <pause dur="0.2"/> controlling how you <pause dur="0.3"/> ventilate these sorts of buildings <pause dur="0.5"/> and how you light these 
buildings <pause dur="0.4"/> because <pause dur="0.2"/> what was driving the width of the building from that side to that side was essentially <pause dur="0.8"/> the <pause dur="0.2"/> depth natural light would penetrate <pause dur="0.2"/> the offices <pause dur="0.4"/> at the sort of latitude we're at <pause dur="0.9"/> and also the amount of ventilation that you could get through just <pause dur="0.3"/> # opening a window <pause dur="0.2"/> these are not <pause dur="0.5"/> air-conditioned buildings <pause dur="0.7"/> these are essentially natural <trunc>bu</trunc> naturally lit buildings <pause dur="0.5"/> and they are essentially <pause dur="0.3"/> # sorry naturally ventilated buildings and they are essentially naturally lit buildings <pause dur="0.3"/> of course there was lighting but you just switch the lights on when the light <pause dur="0.6"/> went down you know <trunc>w</trunc> when it was getting dark <pause dur="1.3"/> # conventional floor plans wasteful if sublet <pause dur="0.9"/> why was it wasteful if sublet because you had to create more corridor space and the net to gross began to go down <pause dur="0.6"/> and you can see it's very basic we've got a floor slab we've got columns we've got a ceiling <pause dur="0.4"/> we've got lights hanging from the ceiling <pause dur="0.4"/> kind of reminds you of FURS doesn't it <pause dur="0.9"/> that's the FURS building <pause dur="0.4"/> the 
essence of it <pause dur="0.8"/> no suspended # floor no <trunc>s</trunc> no raised floor no suspended ceiling <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> plugs and sockets well there might be a few dotted around the edge <pause dur="0.3"/> # but <pause dur="0.2"/> no more than that <pause dur="3.2"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> and those were the sorts of # devices that you got up to to sort of try and and <trunc>seg</trunc> segment the office to break it up you can see that the partitions which aren't full height or they might be glazed at the extra height <pause dur="0.5"/> running into the mullions <pause dur="0.5"/> people working in rather cramped conditions <pause dur="1.2"/> so <pause dur="0.2"/> that sort of was the characteristic if you like of nineteen-sixties' # offices <pause dur="1.0"/> now just think about it though <pause dur="0.6"/> does everybody need a cellular office <pause dur="0.9"/> if they don't need a cellular office <pause dur="0.5"/> isn't this really very difficult doesn't it look very cramped <pause dur="0.6"/> giving those people in any more than one <trunc>o</trunc> one person per office you know if you imagine you went into <pause dur="0.3"/> my room in FURS <pause dur="0.4"/> and you found two or three people in there <pause dur="0.3"/> it would seem very claustrophobic and and crowded <pause dur="0.8"/> so it <pause dur="0.2"/> it was wasteful of space <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> the 
partitions would be expensive to move if you wanted to restructure the building all sorts of issues like that <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> but essentially the design of the building was being <pause dur="0.4"/> fixed by <pause dur="0.5"/> a question of cost and economy <pause dur="0.3"/> it was an easy building to construct to design <pause dur="0.3"/> and hopefully to let and that was good for the developer <pause dur="2.3"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> finally just to # put it <pause dur="0.2"/> <trunc>m</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> make a point which we're going to be coming back to later on <pause dur="0.3"/> just think about things like solar gain <pause dur="0.8"/> you know again think about FURS <pause dur="0.2"/> you know you hear the <pause dur="0.6"/> the rain on the roof <pause dur="0.5"/> # when the sun comes in <pause dur="0.3"/> most of the heat gets transferred into the buildings the rooms heat up <pause dur="0.3"/> there's no ventilation it gets pretty unpleasant <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> you know quite a lot quite a lot of problems with this kind of # building <pause dur="3.4"/> nevertheless there are some fine examples of buildings like that <pause dur="1.4"/> buildings which had in their own way a huge influence on the kinds of buildings that we were producing <pause dur="0.7"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> this is # the building known as the Seagram S-E-A-G-R-A-M building <pause dur="0.3"/> in New

nineteen-sixties' approach to the design of offices <pause dur="2.3"/> well <pause dur="0.8"/> there was an alternative approach to what i would call the slab office building <pause dur="2.5"/> it became known <pause dur="0.2"/> in its developed form as <pause dur="0.6"/> b√ºrolandschaft offices <pause dur="1.0"/> but essentially what it is it's the idea of a pool <pause dur="1.3"/> think about the the the the archetypal image of a typing pool <pause dur="1.2"/> in which there are lots and lots of people working in ordered desks arranged formally <pause dur="0.4"/> in a large open space <pause dur="2.0"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> this is the the Larkin building nineteen-twenty-four <pause dur="0.4"/> # which was # a mail order company in the United States <pause dur="0.4"/> i believe <pause dur="0.4"/> # and <pause dur="0.8"/> all the desks were laid out in this very formal way <pause dur="0.4"/> and if you really were to study this thing you'll find that you've got <trunc>a</trunc> all the typists running down the middle and they're servicing <pause dur="0.4"/> # a number of people on either side and there seems to be some supervisors <pause dur="0.5"/> watching what's happening <pause dur="0.6"/> all all good sort of keep people in their place kind of situation <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> and you can imagine that there are certain 
advantages of this sort of office building <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> one of which is it's clearly very well suited <pause dur="0.2"/> to routine tasks <pause dur="0.9"/> you can supervise <pause dur="0.4"/> very easily <pause dur="0.2"/> you can keep an eye on what everybody's doing <pause dur="0.7"/> somebody goes along to is away from their desk too long for # a cup of tea <pause dur="0.6"/> # or to go to the toilet you can soon sort of record what's happening <pause dur="1.4"/> any of you worked in # <pause dur="0.6"/> telecentre sales <pause dur="0.2"/> place <pause dur="1.4"/> just think about the parallels you know when your calls are being monitored and if you're away for too long if you don't answer too many calls somebody starts ringing you up and saying <pause dur="0.4"/> hang on you haven't answered too many does that happen </u><pause dur="0.5"/> <u who="sf1143" trans="pause"> <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> </u><pause dur="0.4"/> <u who="nm1141" trans="pause"> yeah </u><pause dur="0.2"/> <u who="sf1143" trans="pause"> <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> </u><u who="nm1141" trans="latching"> not going to not going to say but i mean <pause dur="0.6"/> you can begin to see the parallels here we here we have an organization that is doing repetitive tasks <pause dur="0.4"/> # it's got a hierarchical organization <pause dur="0.3"/> it wants to keep close control over <pause dur="0.2"/> what its people are doing <pause dur="0.5"/> # it's pretty easy to make change <pause dur="0.2"/> as it happens not in 
# the Larkin building because all the desks were fitted down and so on but that's by the by <pause dur="0.2"/> the principle is there <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> but the disadvantage is you can see it's the kind of classroom effect <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> easily to be distracted <pause dur="0.4"/> you know if somebody if something unusual happens perhaps when the tea trolley does come down here <pause dur="0.4"/> all eyes away from the desk to the tea trolley and you think whether you going to have a Mars bar or <trunc>w</trunc> what you're going to do is it going to be coffee today or is there some nice <trunc>s</trunc> soft drink <pause dur="0.6"/> # and so on <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> there other issues like <pause dur="0.6"/> usually it's difficult to have any sort of outward expression of your status <pause dur="1.1"/> if you're in an organization that is hierarchical <pause dur="0.3"/> not that we are there much now but that certainly was the case <pause dur="0.4"/> how do you express the status of different people <pause dur="0.5"/> the joke used to be in the Civil Service you know that the <pause dur="0.3"/> the junior had one drawer <pause dur="0.2"/> next person up had two drawers the next person up had drawers on both sides the next person had a carpet on the floor <pause dur="0.5"/> and so on <pause dur="0.2"/> very difficult # to have that sort of expression of status if that's 
what you're about <pause dur="1.0"/> and also there's a lack of control <pause dur="0.5"/> and i'll come back to this issue later on in the lectures you can't alter your environment readily <pause dur="1.4"/> # because you can't open the windows you know you can't sort of readily <pause dur="0.4"/> # stick up posters of your holiday <pause dur="0.5"/> # destinations and so on because it's you know very much # shared space <pause dur="0.7"/> now <pause dur="0.6"/> in the nineteen-#-<pause dur="0.3"/>#-seventies and nineteen-sixties <pause dur="0.4"/> some # German space planners # set up this team and created what was <trunc>ca</trunc> became called as the b√ºrolandschaft offices you've had the background <pause dur="0.8"/> which was this idea of essentially much deeper floor plates <pause dur="0.8"/> forget about this <pause dur="0.5"/> # thirteen metres fourteen metres side to side <pause dur="0.3"/> here we're talking about perhaps thirty metres perhaps forty metres <pause dur="0.4"/> from building to building <pause dur="1.2"/> now how could they do it <pause dur="0.9"/> well because of course technology had moved on the kinds of things that you couldn't do in the nineteen-sixties <pause dur="0.5"/> permanent <pause dur="0.2"/> artificial lighting <pause dur="0.6"/> air conditioning <pause dur="0.2"/> the technology <pause dur="0.2"/> wasn't there i'm sorry 
going further back than the sixties <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> of course became more commonplace in the in the sixties and into the seventies <pause dur="0.4"/> so you could solve the problems of handling ventilating lighting these deep floor plates <pause dur="0.4"/> and then you could start packing people in <pause dur="0.8"/> and you could <pause dur="0.4"/> in the conventional way you'd have packed them in in a formal sense <pause dur="0.5"/> but the key to b√ºrolandschaft was <pause dur="0.3"/> that you created the landscaped office which is what b√ºrolandschaft means <pause dur="0.3"/> the landscaped office <pause dur="0.4"/> in which you can <pause dur="0.2"/> lay out the desks in a more informal irregular way <pause dur="0.5"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> create some kind of landscaping # between them you can create sort of zones and areas of activity and specializations you could perhaps have some cellular offices <pause dur="0.3"/> perhaps around the perimeter which would allow for those staff that felt their <pause dur="0.8"/> # status depended on it <pause dur="0.5"/> and you could create some kind of privacy you could have areas for <pause dur="0.4"/> # you know # staff assessment <pause dur="0.2"/> which weren't going to be out in the open <pause dur="0.7"/> and it was a sort of 
compromise <pause dur="1.3"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> and this is # an illustration of that sort of thing laid out in the <trunc>ful</trunc> Ford building in Cologne <pause dur="1.0"/> what of course you also got in this time was <pause dur="0.6"/> furniture manufacturers providers of office furniture beginning to respond to <pause dur="0.4"/> the possibilities and creating <pause dur="0.6"/> interlocking <pause dur="0.2"/> modular furniture <pause dur="0.3"/> which you could sort of create and # different organizational areas and so on <pause dur="2.9"/> you'll notice here <pause dur="0.2"/> and i'll come back to that <pause dur="0.6"/> there are not too many cables are there <pause dur="1.4"/> we're still in an era when the typewriter ruled okay <pause dur="0.3"/> you had a desk you didn't have a computer you had a typewriter you didn't have a printer <pause dur="0.6"/> the telephone was a very basic telephone system <pause dur="0.6"/> so the problems which we come on with later on hadn't really begun to hit <pause dur="0.2"/> this sort of office <pause dur="2.4"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> that is # the <pause dur="0.3"/> headquarters of # <pause dur="0.9"/> a district council in the north-east which for the moment i've forgotten <pause dur="0.5"/> it'll come back to me <pause dur="0.5"/> # this this was their open-plan office <pause dur="0.4"/> # and you can see the kind of pattern that i've been talking about again not many sign of cables you won't find many computers if any computers <pause dur="0.5"/> on here <pause dur="0.4"/> # fairly generous space provision <pause dur="0.7"/> typical if you like open-plan b√ºrolandschaft office of this period <pause dur="1.8"/>

created by linked by corridors and space <pause dur="0.4"/> and it's not just a two-dimensional <pause dur="0.5"/> fragmentation if you like of work areas <pause dur="1.6"/> it's also a vertical fragmentation of work areas with views out into this sort of central lit <pause dur="0.5"/> area atrium if you like <pause dur="0.4"/> you can see a cafe a <trunc>s</trunc> or sitting areas here <pause dur="0.3"/> that's people having coffee communal meeting areas and so on <pause dur="1.0"/> so that's <pause dur="0.3"/> if you like <pause dur="0.3"/> the the north European spin being put on <pause dur="0.3"/> to this idea of open-plan <trunc>o</trunc> office floor space <pause dur="0.6"/> now <pause dur="1.0"/> in the reading you <trunc>ha</trunc> i hope you'll do you'll come across this scheme without any doubt at all it had a huge <pause dur="0.6"/> # if you like impact on architects and designers <pause dur="0.7"/> but none i have to say on property developers there never was a scheme <pause dur="0.3"/> <trunc>i</trunc> in the U-K and so far as i know in the U-S which kind of picked up on these things <pause dur="0.3"/> but some of the ideas you see here <pause dur="0.7"/> we'll revisit <pause dur="0.5"/> those of you who've ever seen the Ark <pause dur="0.8"/> that building as you approach London on the M-four <pause dur="0.6"/> # designed by the English architect Ralph Erskine but for a

just to think about the office building <pause dur="1.0"/> but also think about its impact on <pause dur="0.2"/> the form and shape of cities <pause dur="1.3"/> when i showed you those slides of <pause dur="0.2"/> New York <pause dur="0.9"/> of Toronto <pause dur="0.3"/> and many other cities you saw lots of skyscrapers <pause dur="0.7"/> didn't you <pause dur="1.2"/> and that <pause dur="0.3"/> why did they have to go high well there are various reasons some of them to do with planning <pause dur="0.6"/> but one of the main ones was that if your building can only be <pause dur="0.4"/> let's say thirteen fourteen maybe at extreme twenty metres deep <pause dur="0.8"/> and you've got a lot of floor space you've got to go up <pause dur="1.3"/> if on the other hand you can spread your floor space <pause dur="0.9"/> suddenly the drive to go high isn't there any more <pause dur="0.8"/> you can you can have a lot of floor space and you can spread it over a site <pause dur="0.5"/> and you don't have to have the same number of lifts things can get a little bit easier <pause dur="1.2"/> and therefore as you go into the nineteen-seventies you begin to see even in this country <pause dur="0.5"/> architects and developers exploiting the posibility to have high volumes of floor space but with deeper floor 
plans <pause dur="0.9"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> this scheme <pause dur="0.5"/> # is was # developed by the church commissioners <pause dur="0.2"/> it's in Victoria Street in central London <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> and essentially the floor <trunc>spl</trunc> floor <trunc>pl</trunc> # space is spread down a long length of Victoria Street we're heading towards <pause dur="0.3"/> Parliament Square <pause dur="0.4"/> and down that way Victoria Station is behind us <pause dur="1.9"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> just look at the floor plan <pause dur="0.7"/> this is the development <pause dur="1.8"/> and you can see this is a far cry from the slab <pause dur="0.6"/> office floor plan <pause dur="1.5"/> it has some light wells in the middle <pause dur="0.9"/> and it zigs in and out and gets really quite deep and then we get further light wells here and underneath this of course <pause dur="0.3"/> suddenly because we've got a deep floor plate we can put shopping <pause dur="0.5"/> so you've got # <pause dur="0.2"/> department stores <pause dur="0.3"/> and shops unit shops underneath this development <pause dur="1.1"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> and if you like the most memorable thing about this scheme <pause dur="0.2"/> is <pause dur="0.3"/> that's Westminster Cathedral <pause dur="0.5"/> which until this was developed in the nineteen-seventies had been hidden <pause dur="1.3"/> and then suddenly as a result of <pause dur="0.3"/> # planning and development and so on <pause dur="0.4"/> it 
was possible to put the floor space <pause dur="0.2"/> build it up on either side and you suddenly get this <pause dur="0.2"/> dramatic image if you like of <pause dur="0.4"/> # the Westminster Cathedral and and this architecture <pause dur="0.5"/> so <pause dur="0.7"/> have in the back of your mind that that when you're <trunc>d</trunc> thinking about the design of offices <pause dur="0.2"/> how they're designed affects the kind of environment you can achieve <pause dur="0.5"/> that can be applied to Broadgate <pause dur="0.4"/> come on and talk about Broadgate Broadgate would not have been possible <pause dur="0.3"/> had you been designing with slab office buildings <pause dur="3.7"/> right <pause dur="2.7"/> what do we see as we go into the # nineteen-<pause dur="0.2"/>#-<pause dur="0.2"/>eighties <pause dur="3.3"/> i've called this <pause dur="1.8"/> the expansive decade <pause dur="4.8"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> this was this was Thatcher the economy was booming <pause dur="0.8"/> all sorts of things # seemed possible <pause dur="0.9"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> we had a P-C revolution <pause dur="1.4"/> that's the kind of situation <pause dur="0.2"/> which was beginning to occur <pause dur="0.5"/> once you introduce P-Cs and printers and so on then you have telephones and we had P-B-X telephone systems <pause dur="0.3"/> suddenly we've got a lot more cables for telephones <pause dur="0.6"/> and suddenly people wanted more desk space <pause dur="0.7"/> not 
just better provision for cables actually needed more desk space how are we going to provide for that 'cause computers were not small <pause dur="0.5"/> beasts in those days <pause dur="1.3"/> computers <pause dur="0.2"/> tended to get hot <pause dur="1.4"/> you know if we had a problem with natural ventilation natural light <pause dur="0.2"/> in <pause dur="0.2"/> nineteen-sixties' office buildings seventies' office buildings you then add the heat that was coming off these early computers <pause dur="0.4"/> you know you began to need more air conditioning or or air conditioning full stop <pause dur="1.8"/> # <pause dur="0.8"/> so there were there were searches if you like to try and # find ways of accommodating these new # <pause dur="0.2"/> requirements <pause dur="2.2"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> seems funny seeing this the city office of today and the office of tomorrow and that was twenty years ago <pause dur="2.9"/> and the consequence of that is that <pause dur="0.2"/> suddenly from a from a an office building where if you think about the first example you had a slab you had the lighting hanging from the ceiling and then you had a floor <pause dur="0.8"/> we suddenly find we need much more space we've got to raise the floor <pause dur="1.0"/> we've got to raise the 
floor perhaps partly for heating and ventilation <pause dur="0.6"/> but also for cabling <pause dur="1.5"/> we've got to drop the ceiling <pause dur="1.1"/> because the lighting has to be better than just a bit of bolt on ceiling <pause dur="0.3"/> think about this <pause dur="0.7"/> you know the lighting is going to be much more significant it's going to be much more effective we've got to cope with the heat it generates we've got some air conditioning coming into this lecture theatre not that we felt it last week <pause dur="0.4"/> so we opened the fire doors <pause dur="1.1"/> what's the implications of that <pause dur="0.2"/> coping with this new technology for office buildings <pause dur="1.4"/> could the nineteen-sixties' building have coped with it <pause dur="1.6"/> if not why not <pause dur="4.7"/> what was a typical floor to floor height of a nineteen-sixties' building <pause dur="2.0"/> floor to floor here <pause dur="0.3"/> might be something like three-point-six three-point-seven metres <pause dur="1.0"/> floor to floor in a nineteen-sixties' building <pause dur="0.7"/> maybe # two-point-nine <pause dur="0.6"/> maybe three <pause dur="0.4"/> often not <pause dur="0.8"/> in order to accommodate all that space you needed <pause dur="0.7"/> a # a higher <pause dur="0.2"/> building higher floor to floor <pause dur="0.5"/> and many nineteen-sixties' and

and then you've got some additional costs <pause dur="1.2"/> and what you've got then is the rental curve had the building not been refurbished <pause dur="2.1"/> indexed <pause dur="0.5"/> and then the value <pause dur="0.3"/> if you carry out a refurbishment there are obviously cycles in this is the nineteen-seventies' crash <pause dur="0.5"/> rental values increasing <pause dur="0.7"/> and what you can see here is the incentive if you like shown and again <pause dur="0.4"/> # nineteen-eighties refurbishment further refurbishment is that right nineteen-seventy-nine <pause dur="2.7"/> just got to get my mind round that hold on <pause dur="0.7"/> nineteen-seventy-nine <pause dur="2.0"/> 
refurbishment <pause dur="0.3"/> for rent <pause dur="0.6"/> this is where the costs are going that's right that's the that's the original cost indexed out <pause dur="0.4"/> added up <pause dur="0.8"/> sorry i've i've got it that's nineteen-seventy <pause dur="0.3"/> nineteen-sixty nineteen-seventy nineteen-eighty <pause dur="0.3"/> so you've got different stages of refurbishment <pause dur="0.4"/> indexing the cost of construction up <pause dur="0.4"/> but then adding costs of refurbishment and as you can go through you can see the drive the incentive is if you can to refurbish the building <pause dur="0.4"/> because it's <trunc>re</trunc> increasing the rental value above <pause dur="0.3"/> the increase that you get due to the costs of <pause dur="0.4"/> # refurbishment <pause dur="1.2"/> so the the drive is through this period of the nineteen-#-eighties is to refurbish office buildings <pause dur="0.4"/> if you can <pause dur="1.2"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> anybody recognize that building <pause dur="2.1"/> that's the road down to Cemetery Junction that's the road up to Eldon Square this used to be the headquarters in <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> of Scottish

known as Gateway One you'll see them down there if you go down Gateway One Gateway Two they built this <pause dur="0.9"/> it's a deep plan office <pause dur="0.2"/> it's b√ºrolandschaft <pause dur="1.5"/> it has <pause dur="0.3"/> terraces of garden space on top of some of that deep <trunc>s</trunc> plan you've got # <pause dur="0.5"/> balconies covered with grass and so on <pause dur="1.3"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> that was a sort of nineteen-#-seventies office building in the nineteen-eighties they commissioned and moved into this building <pause dur="0.7"/> # which was the second Wiggins Teape building <pause dur="2.0"/> that's it there <pause dur="2.0"/> let me just go back to this <pause dur="1.1"/> and essentially <pause dur="2.0"/> it's like this <pause dur="0.7"/> it's that <pause dur="1.7"/> it's a slab on either side with a core and an atrium <pause dur="2.6"/> but the significant thing about this building <pause dur="1.4"/> is you go into it <pause dur="1.5"/> there's the atrium <pause dur="2.0"/> this is <pause dur="0.5"/> naturally lit <pause dur="0.9"/> this building is actually naturally ventilated <pause dur="0.5"/> there is no air conditioning in this development <pause dur="0.8"/> what you begin what you see now is you've got <pause dur="0.3"/> # internal facades which can be treated very differently a light # more tactile more # <pause dur="1.5"/> <trunc>m</trunc> <pause dur="0.3"/> more domestic # treatment if you like <pause dur="0.2"/> # because it's

to it <pause dur="0.9"/> and you can begin to see new ideas about the laying out of office floor plates <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> the way we might get a central core <pause dur="0.6"/> # and we've got floor plates here <pause dur="0.5"/> that are <pause dur="0.2"/> ranging from twenty-six to <trunc>twen</trunc> forty-two metres <pause dur="1.4"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> a <trunc>f</trunc> a floor plate here <pause dur="0.2"/> again <pause dur="0.4"/> # twenty metres <pause dur="0.4"/> with the cores on the <trunc>ex</trunc> on the outside of the building <pause dur="0.3"/> remember Lloyds <pause dur="1.1"/> again a similar kind of treatment here <pause dur="0.5"/> so what we're finding is <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> different ideas about <pause dur="0.2"/> the kinds of floor plates # that would be possible different configurations <pause dur="1.1"/> now who was going to occupy buildings like this <pause dur="2.4"/> because this is where we begin to make the connection with big bang <pause dur="0.7"/> the idea the demand particularly in the City of London <pause dur="0.4"/> for very large floor plates dealing floor floor plates in which you are going to get lots and lots of people <pause dur="0.3"/> trading stocks trading shares from computers <pause dur="0.5"/> i've put it in the handout <pause dur="0.4"/> i think it's something like # <pause dur="0.5"/> the # <pause dur="1.0"/> terminology i've used <pause dur="0.7"/> trading floors the office's theatre or madhouse it's not my idea this 
comes from another source <pause dur="0.5"/> but the idea <pause dur="0.3"/> that they were <pause dur="0.2"/> they were requirements <pause dur="0.3"/> from certain occupiers for some very deep floor plates they weren't the generality they were particularly in the City of London <pause dur="0.4"/> but it opened up new possibilities for <pause dur="0.4"/> laying out office buildings <pause dur="1.5"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> and then these are examples of floor plates <pause dur="0.6"/> that were constructed in Broadgate and other places in London <pause dur="0.8"/> the Broadgate office building again its cores sometimes on the outside <pause dur="0.6"/> the deep floor plates Billingsgate other examples <pause dur="0.5"/> so <pause dur="0.3"/> we had a situation in which <pause dur="0.4"/> # a combination of new ideas about floor plate layout <pause dur="0.3"/> # new technology <pause dur="0.3"/> # <trunc>d</trunc> demands from the occupiers were giving rise to <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> new and big buildings <pause dur="1.3"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> now i showed you that building last week <pause dur="0.6"/> sitting on top of Charing Cross station <pause dur="0.5"/> that was only possible <pause dur="0.4"/> by moving away from those traditional ideas of office layout <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> necessary because of the need to span over the running tracks of # Charing Cross station <pause dur="0.5"/> but # marketable because there 
was a demand from office suppliers office users for this very deep floor plates <pause dur="2.5"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> and in London <pause dur="0.5"/> that is <pause dur="0.3"/> # this is part of London Wall <pause dur="0.4"/> which is many of you know London part of the Barbican development # a redevelopment in the immediate post-war periods nineteen-fifties nineteen-sixties <pause dur="0.4"/> this was one of those slab office buildings <pause dur="0.7"/> and it was redeveloped in the nineteen-eighties into the nineteen-nineties <pause dur="1.0"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> that's the building <pause dur="0.4"/> # Alban Gate <pause dur="0.5"/> again very deep relatively speaking floor plates <pause dur="3.3"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> and this is the kind of layout we get <pause dur="0.2"/> so we've got a a a building which <pause dur="0.5"/> there we've got twenty-six metres side to side <pause dur="0.2"/> clearly that's going to be even greater than that that's going to be something like thirty to forty metres <pause dur="1.1"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> and what i've got here is a few slides which just show is that back to back no it's okay <pause dur="0.6"/> a few <trunc>sli</trunc> slides which just illustrate this is the this is from the marketing brochures <pause dur="0.5"/> # how the # marketing agents thought this building might possibly be laid out <pause dur="1.4"/> and again 
it's a reflection of the opportunity because you're the City of London to have some very deep floor plates <pause dur="0.5"/> very # <pause dur="0.3"/> high <pause dur="0.2"/> densities of occupation <pause dur="0.8"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> another <pause dur="1.5"/> image here <pause dur="0.2"/> and now that's a dealing floor <pause dur="0.9"/> layout there <pause dur="2.2"/> if you were to study this in some detail actually there were problems with this <pause dur="1.3"/> and one of the reasons was <pause dur="0.2"/> all the toilets <pause dur="0.8"/> were here <pause dur="2.3"/> and the reality was that as the market crashed <pause dur="0.4"/> this building proved hard to let <pause dur="0.4"/> why <pause dur="0.6"/> because you could almost only let it floor by floor <pause dur="0.6"/> it couldn't readily <pause dur="0.3"/> be subdivided <pause dur="0.3"/> unless you started introducing additional corridors which meant the net to gross dropped <pause dur="0.8"/> so there's a there's trade-off if you like with these very deep buildings perhaps with all buildings on how you <pause dur="0.2"/> the ratio between <pause dur="0.5"/> where the service cores are where the public toilet facilities are <pause dur="0.4"/> # the escape staircase and the total floor area it has an impact on the building's letability <pause dur="2.9"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> Lloyds # i've mentioned <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> a building in which all those cores were taken to the outside 
of the building <pause dur="1.2"/> which then enabled sorry about that <pause dur="0.4"/> # stand on your heads <pause dur="0.5"/> this very dramatic central atrium to be created <pause dur="0.3"/> because all the services had been pushed to the edge so you get a lot of free space <pause dur="2.0"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> 
and Broadgate <pause dur="0.5"/> that is correct <pause dur="0.5"/> again many of these buildings are are are building around that possibility of deep floor <sic corr="space">splace</sic> <pause dur="3.7"/> # <pause dur="2.1"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> Isle of Dogs Canary Wharf <pause dur="0.5"/> another example of these sorts of buildings what you also see here is some of the innovation that was occurring in the nineteen-eighties <pause dur="0.2"/> into construction techniques terms <pause dur="0.3"/> fast track building <pause dur="0.6"/> # buildings with frame buildings in which you added <pause dur="0.2"/> the panels <pause dur="0.4"/> # the panels which could then be taken off and you could re<pause dur="0.2"/>front the <trunc>elevat</trunc> you could re-elevate the building perhaps in twenty years time <pause dur="0.5"/> you've got that in # in # Canary Wharf you've got it in Broadgate <pause dur="0.5"/> and so on a lot of innovation coming in in the nineteen-eighties <pause dur="0.5"/> # new construction techniques new procurement techniques which # you'll be hearing about later on in this series of lectures <pause dur="0.5"/> # ways of getting the building <pause dur="0.3"/> why were they trying to procure buildings in a different way because if <pause dur="0.2"/> if you could construct a building faster <pause dur="0.2"/> you could let it faster <pause dur="0.5"/> and that meant therefore <trunc>y</trunc> your costs of borrowing were shortened reduced 
because <pause dur="0.2"/> rental income was coming in that much sooner <pause dur="0.4"/> so even if some of these construction methods were more expensive <pause dur="0.5"/> there was considerable # value to be had by <pause dur="0.5"/> building more quickly <pause dur="2.7"/> okay <pause dur="0.9"/> let me # let me move into <pause dur="0.2"/> # the <pause dur="0.6"/> # nineteen-nineties <pause dur="2.9"/> nineteen-eighties then was an expansive period <pause dur="0.5"/> in which # <pause dur="1.1"/> lot of development was taking place <pause dur="0.5"/> # in which there was quite a lot of innovation particularly in offices in the City of London <pause dur="0.8"/> # and London more generally <pause dur="0.7"/> some of that innovation was diffusing if you like to other parts of the country but not <pause dur="0.3"/> on on a on a particularly great scale <pause dur="1.9"/> by the time you get into the nineteen-nineties of course we have the recession <pause dur="0.7"/> # and a lot of worry a lot of <trunc>a</trunc> <trunc>th</trunc> a lot of oversupply of offices <pause dur="0.6"/> a lot of offices founding finding that they didn't have a market that perhaps they weren't suited to tenant requirements <pause dur="0.4"/> they were certainly overspecified <pause dur="0.4"/> that they had been constructed to a standard in terms of lifts of # floor loadings and so on <pause dur="0.5"/> 
standards which had been set by <pause dur="0.2"/> the institutions the financial institutions because they were the ones that were funding the development <pause dur="0.6"/> but which <pause dur="0.3"/> # the occupiers no longer felt they needed <pause dur="1.0"/> # a quote that actually has come back to me <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> <trunc>d</trunc> during the course of marking some essays or some exam questions <pause dur="0.5"/> quote that i gather Ginny Gibson was giving which was on on the effect that <pause dur="0.4"/> # sort of the opulence of the nineteen-eighties office building didn't sit well with companies that were in the <trunc>bus</trunc> business of making staff redundant <pause dur="0.6"/> so you actually had a situation in which the occupiers who were leading now <pause dur="0.2"/> it was a sellers market customer is king <pause dur="0.6"/> were saying we don't want the high standards and specifications and glitziness of these # nineteen-eighties office buildings we don't think it suits <pause dur="0.3"/> the corporate image we ought to be projecting <pause dur="0.7"/> in in the tight business environment of the early nineties <pause dur="1.4"/> we also have a continuation of this sort of research if you like into the
