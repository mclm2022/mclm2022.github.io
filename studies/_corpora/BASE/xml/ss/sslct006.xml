<u who="nm1108"> let me start by telling you two preliminary things # first of all <pause dur="0.4"/> i plan to do this today in one blow in other words <pause dur="0.9"/> no <pause dur="0.2"/> time <pause dur="0.2"/> out <pause dur="0.5"/> i will just speak for roughly <pause dur="0.6"/> one hour and <pause dur="0.2"/> and a half # bit less <pause dur="0.7"/> i have to be at another classroom # <pause dur="0.8"/> at ten-thirty so # <pause dur="0.2"/> i'll kind of finish the whole thing <trunc>w</trunc> in one hour and a half <pause dur="0.9"/> second you see that there is a piece of # equipment here <pause dur="1.0"/> # <gap reason="name" extent="2 words"/> is from the # Language Studies <pause dur="1.1"/> and she is concerned with language used in classrooms one of the # <pause dur="0.3"/> reasons for this is <pause dur="0.2"/> that we <pause dur="0.4"/> have an increasingly large number of international students <pause dur="0.7"/> and this is a perfect class for this you come from at least fifteen different countries to the best of my knowledge <pause dur="0.7"/> # which is really quite wonderful for a group that is not so large <pause dur="0.8"/> and if you take me into account # <pause dur="0.2"/> another non-U-K person then it's really wonderful <pause dur="1.3"/> # <pause dur="1.0"/> so this is a good example that they can use also to help <pause dur="0.3"/> students understand <pause dur="0.4"/> what kind of language is used in classes 
and stuff like this <pause dur="0.3"/> so this has nothing to do with B-B-C or anything of that sort it is just an internal research project <pause dur="2.1"/> okay # <pause dur="0.4"/> what i'm going to do today <pause dur="0.7"/> is based on this <pause dur="0.6"/> two-sheet thing that i gave you the first time we met <pause dur="0.7"/> which <pause dur="0.2"/> sets out my four sessions on <pause dur="0.3"/> say macroeconomic aspects <pause dur="0.4"/> of <pause dur="0.2"/> international construction <pause dur="0.5"/> i told you that <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> and i <pause dur="0.3"/> divide this job roughly along micro <pause dur="0.6"/> and macroeconomic lines <pause dur="0.2"/> he's dealing with construction projects and firms largely <pause dur="0.2"/> and i'm dealing largely with <pause dur="0.4"/> # issues of countries <pause dur="0.3"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> the role of the construction sector as a whole <pause dur="0.3"/> in this business <pause dur="1.8"/> in <trunc>con</trunc> in in in you know the the national economy as a whole <pause dur="0.6"/> now <pause dur="2.3"/> by chance # <pause dur="0.7"/> at the beginning of this year i got this book from the publisher and a number of you have purchased it but it's available in the resource room <pause dur="0.3"/> and the library's supposed to have it so you then don't have to buy it <pause dur="0.3"/> but almost everything that i will be saying <pause dur="0.5"/> # in these four sessions <pause dur="0.2"/> is in this book <pause dur="0.8"/> # also 
by chance another book came out <pause dur="0.4"/> # which looks like this <pause dur="0.3"/> and it is called The Future of International Construction it's a bit closer to what we are doing here by title <pause dur="0.4"/> but it actually contains only the results of an international survey <pause dur="0.3"/> that i run from year to year <pause dur="0.2"/> okay <pause dur="0.2"/> so this book now <pause dur="0.4"/> # contains <pause dur="0.3"/> summary results from this survey from nineteen-ninety-two <pause dur="0.3"/> to nineteen-ninety-eight <pause dur="0.6"/> year nineteen-ninety-nine will appear <pause dur="0.2"/> in a paper <pause dur="0.3"/> that <pause dur="0.2"/> the same fellow <pause dur="0.2"/> whose name is <gap reason="name" extent="2 words"/> <pause dur="0.5"/> and myself <pause dur="0.2"/> have written <pause dur="0.3"/> and will publish in Building Research and Information <pause dur="0.3"/> one of the key <pause dur="0.2"/> journals in our field <pause dur="0.5"/> though remember <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> is my PhD student <pause dur="0.5"/> and we have another PhD student here i'm sorry <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> to bring you out like this <pause dur="0.6"/> # <gap reason="name" extent="2 words"/> from Mexico if you add yet another country # <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> wonderfully to added to our # mix <pause dur="0.3"/> i like # international <pause dur="0.2"/> classes myself <pause dur="0.3"/> so it's really wonderful to <pause dur="0.3"/> see somebody from Mexico as well <pause dur="0.8"/> <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> is now working with me on you 
know related things having to do with international issues and construction <pause dur="0.5"/> and one day she will probably write a book with me on something of this yeah <pause dur="0.3"/> just like <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> </u><pause dur="0.3"/> <u who="sf1109" trans="pause"> <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> </u><pause dur="0.6"/> <u who="nm1108" trans="pause"> now these two books are available for purchase i'm going to # send this around this will tell you a little bit about this new book <pause dur="0.8"/> unfortunately remember i have nothing to do with prices of these things this thing costs forty pounds <pause dur="0.3"/> which is idiotic but that's what they want for this <pause dur="0.4"/> i get it at a discount <pause dur="0.3"/> so <pause dur="0.7"/> we are selling it to you for thirty-two pounds that is the discount <pause dur="0.2"/> you know # nobody's making any money in this <pause dur="0.2"/> and similarly <pause dur="0.2"/> this costs fifty pounds and we are selling you at the discount that i get it at <pause dur="0.3"/> which is forty pounds <pause dur="1.0"/> okay so we bought these books <pause dur="0.2"/> in order to be able to pass them to those of you <pause dur="0.3"/> who actually want to buy them <pause dur="1.2"/> okay <pause dur="0.2"/> now <pause dur="0.5"/> the syllabus doesn't tell you which pages of this book you should go to but it tells you which papers <pause dur="0.4"/> are assigned for 
today's readings yeah <pause dur="0.7"/> so # you should # always be able to tell exactly what is assigned reading for a particular day <pause dur="0.7"/> this is not assigned at all but you will notice that i will be talking about the survey on a number of occasions <pause dur="0.2"/> and whenever i talk about the survey this is the relevant book as well <pause dur="1.1"/> okay these are the preliminaries <pause dur="1.4"/> # even though it is relatively difficult to see this # <pause dur="0.4"/> you will see that i will always put <pause dur="1.3"/> on the overhead projector <pause dur="1.1"/><kinesic desc="puts on transparency" iterated="n"/> a transparency telling which paper i'm dealing with or which chapter <pause dur="0.2"/> okay <pause dur="0.2"/> so this is chapter fifteen The Future of International Construction <pause dur="1.2"/> and # that's a paper that is now reproduced in the book <pause dur="0.2"/> but the paper is listed <pause dur="0.7"/> in the syllabus <pause dur="0.2"/> and it also tells you you can see this <pause dur="0.4"/> two-hundred-and-seventy-five there's the page where you will find it in the book <pause dur="0.2"/> okay <pause dur="0.5"/> i'm sorry for being a bit like # you know talking <pause dur="0.3"/> to kids # but <pause dur="0.2"/> i'm just trying to make sure that you understand exactly what i'm trying to do <pause dur="1.6"/> now remember <pause dur="0.6"/> this paper 
is something that was originally <pause dur="0.5"/> given <pause dur="0.2"/> in year nineteen-ninety exactly ten years ago <pause dur="0.8"/> and it was something that was originally discussed <pause dur="0.9"/> in <pause dur="0.4"/> draft form in Sydney Australia the big conference on construction <pause dur="0.6"/> # with many people around the world present <pause dur="1.2"/> # that was an attempt at that time for me to generate discussion within <pause dur="0.6"/> a working commission of C-I-B <pause dur="0.6"/> which is the French acronym for <pause dur="0.5"/> International Building Council <pause dur="0.6"/> C-I-B <pause dur="0.3"/> International Building Council is one of the largest institutions in the world dealing with research <pause dur="0.4"/> into all kinds of issues <pause dur="0.3"/> relating to construction <pause dur="1.6"/> now <pause dur="0.2"/> C-I-B working commission <pause dur="0.5"/> W-fifty-five <pause dur="1.2"/> in <pause dur="0.2"/> building economics is one group that i have been a a part of for many years <pause dur="0.5"/> we tried <pause dur="0.2"/> to generate discussion by writing a draft of this particular paper <pause dur="0.2"/> and giving people some ideas of how i perceive <pause dur="0.5"/> the role of construction in national economic <pause dur="0.7"/> <unclear>culture</unclear> <pause dur="0.8"/> how does construction relate to an economy <pause dur="0.3"/> and how does it change <pause dur="0.3"/> over different stages of 
economic development so this is what this paper is about <pause dur="0.4"/> but also remember <pause dur="0.6"/> that this paper was finally <pause dur="0.3"/> published in nineteen-ninety-one <pause dur="0.4"/> and it was then the basis for the survey <pause dur="0.6"/> which is published here <pause dur="0.2"/> which was started in nineteen-ninety-two <pause dur="0.7"/> a number of my colleagues <pause dur="0.8"/> from various countries <pause dur="0.3"/> felt a bit uneasy about some of the propositions that i was proposing at that time <pause dur="0.3"/> and i said fine let us try to see <pause dur="0.2"/> what an international survey of these issues will tell us <pause dur="0.8"/> and # then i decided to do it on an annual basis to see <pause dur="0.2"/> to what extent people agreed with some propositions <pause dur="0.2"/> which actually come from this paper <pause dur="0.2"/> and then <pause dur="0.2"/> to see how that agreement or disagreement changed over time <pause dur="0.2"/> so that's basically the story <pause dur="0.2"/> so next time <pause dur="0.2"/> we are going to be talking about the survey and i will present you the results <pause dur="0.5"/> of your <pause dur="0.6"/> responses i i have analysed in some simple way <pause dur="0.2"/> your responses to the survey which i collected the first time we met <pause dur="0.7"/> okay <pause dur="0.3"/> so that's that's that <pause dur="0.2"/> now remember <pause dur="0.2"/> in 
general i not only do not mind but i like when i'm interrupted <pause dur="0.3"/> okay <pause dur="0.2"/> i know how to deal with interruptions of any kind <pause dur="0.2"/> express your opinion <pause dur="0.5"/> freely <pause dur="0.3"/> # tell me that you disagree <pause dur="0.3"/> give me arguments <pause dur="0.3"/> don't be rude <pause dur="0.6"/> be nice <pause dur="0.3"/> but say whatever you wish yeah <pause dur="0.3"/> feel free to talk <pause dur="1.3"/><kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="7"/> # that's a good habit to establish as early as possible <pause dur="0.4"/> in <pause dur="0.8"/> undergraduate or graduate education <pause dur="1.7"/> the first proposition that i would like to put forward <pause dur="0.9"/> in dealing with this question how does construction fit into a national economy <pause dur="0.3"/> and how does that role change over time <pause dur="0.4"/> is one of the main <pause dur="0.4"/> drivers <pause dur="0.3"/> of change <pause dur="0.2"/> in any society <pause dur="1.3"/> at least <pause dur="0.3"/> at our stage of economic development <pause dur="0.6"/> and that is <pause dur="1.0"/> the drive associated with urbanization and industrialization <pause dur="1.7"/> these are things that happened in this country <pause dur="0.4"/> roughly <pause dur="0.3"/> starting <pause dur="0.2"/> two-hundred years ago <pause dur="0.2"/> until <pause dur="0.2"/> roughly <pause dur="0.5"/> hundred years ago <pause dur="1.1"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> but perhaps you know these numbers are too rough <pause dur="0.3"/> it took something like hundred-fifty years in this country for <pause dur="0.2"/> urbanization and industrialization to 
take place <pause dur="0.6"/> now what happens in this process <pause dur="0.5"/> # let me first tell you what these things are <pause dur="0.3"/> L-D-Cs are less developed countries <pause dur="0.4"/> N-I-Cs are <pause dur="0.2"/> newly industrialized countries <pause dur="0.3"/> and A-I-Cs are advanced industrial # industrial countries <pause dur="0.2"/> or if you wish post-industrial countries which <pause dur="0.7"/> emphasize services much more than before <pause dur="1.0"/> what we have on the vertical axis of this diagram <pause dur="0.4"/> is <pause dur="0.2"/> the share of urban population in total population <pause dur="0.2"/> that is some simple measure of urbanization <pause dur="0.7"/> this country would be some place in the eighties or nineties <pause dur="0.4"/> in percentage terms <pause dur="0.6"/> 
a country like Ghana <pause dur="0.2"/> would be in the fives tens fifteens <pause dur="0.3"/> yeah <pause dur="0.3"/> so you start some place around <pause dur="0.3"/> ten fifteen and end up some place around <pause dur="0.3"/> eighty-five ninety per cent <pause dur="0.3"/> because population never will be fully urbanized <pause dur="0.3"/> some people would be <pause dur="0.3"/> in <pause dur="0.2"/> # areas which are less dense <pause dur="0.2"/> so this process <pause dur="0.2"/> from this point <pause dur="0.3"/> to that point in the case of <pause dur="0.2"/> Great Britain <pause dur="0.5"/> took something like a hundred-fifty years very rough numbers <pause dur="0.3"/> okay <pause dur="0.2"/> but for example in China <pause dur="0.3"/> that process will take <pause dur="0.2"/> roughly fifty years <pause dur="1.1"/> so you can imagine <pause dur="0.3"/> that the same diagram applies <pause dur="0.2"/> but the time <pause dur="0.3"/> dimension shrinks <pause dur="0.4"/> so economic development if you wish is ever faster <pause dur="0.3"/> and one reason for that is that people are copying other people <pause dur="0.3"/> there is no reason for the Chinese to invent <pause dur="0.2"/> an elevator motor <pause dur="0.2"/> it exists copy it <pause dur="0.9"/> as long as you can copy <pause dur="0.2"/> you can develop very quickly <pause dur="0.8"/> because everything exists <pause dur="0.2"/> you see we have to figure out how to make it in Beijing <pause dur="0.3"/> and not <pause dur="0.3"/> in <pause dur="0.2"/> i don't know <pause dur="0.4"/> Idaho <pause dur="2.0"/> so 
what happens here is that we have something that is known as a sigmoid <pause dur="0.7"/> or logistic curve <pause dur="0.2"/> an S-shaped furve <pause dur="0.2"/> # curve <pause dur="0.2"/> which says <pause dur="0.2"/> that in early stages <pause dur="0.2"/> of urbanization and industrialization <pause dur="0.5"/> population <pause dur="0.3"/> goes to cities at an increasing rate <pause dur="0.8"/> hits an inflection point <pause dur="0.3"/> and then <pause dur="0.3"/> goes to cities <pause dur="0.3"/> at a decreasing rate <pause dur="0.4"/> and the whole thing evens out at some value <pause dur="0.4"/> yeah <pause dur="0.4"/> so that is one of the main drivers <pause dur="0.3"/> people are coming from rural areas into cities <pause dur="1.3"/> that is not happening any more <pause dur="0.2"/> in the United Kingdom <pause dur="0.5"/> that is happening in a very major way <pause dur="0.2"/> in Malaysia <pause dur="0.8"/> in Thailand <pause dur="1.0"/> in China <pause dur="1.0"/> and it is not yet happening in many parts of Africa <pause dur="0.4"/> people are still in villages <pause dur="0.2"/> they're still not going to <pause dur="0.6"/> cities <pause dur="0.2"/> even though obviously in many countries in Africa you have that process already <pause dur="0.2"/> Nairobi's a big city et cetera <pause dur="1.2"/> so this is one of the main drivers <pause dur="0.2"/> this shift of population <pause dur="0.2"/> shift of <trunc>pop</trunc> of population from <pause dur="0.2"/> rural <pause dur="0.2"/> to urban areas <pause dur="0.2"/> drives <pause dur="0.2"/> the process <pause dur="0.2"/> of <pause dur="0.4"/> # construction <pause dur="0.6"/> okay <pause dur="0.5"/> # it is one of the 
main drivers of that process <pause dur="0.3"/> now <pause dur="0.6"/><kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="6"/> if it is correct to say <pause dur="0.3"/> and i can tell you urban geographers and demographers will tell you that that curve <pause dur="0.3"/> generally speaking <pause dur="0.7"/> holds for any particular country <pause dur="1.6"/> then it stands to reason <pause dur="0.9"/> that the role of construction <pause dur="0.6"/> in a particular country shifts this way over time <pause dur="0.3"/> let me explain what this is <pause dur="1.1"/> now this is a share of construction in G-N-P <pause dur="0.5"/> G-N-P is the <pause dur="0.2"/> total output <pause dur="0.2"/> generated in a country <pause dur="0.2"/> in one year <pause dur="0.9"/> Gross National Product <pause dur="0.7"/> the share of construction in G-N-P is a percentage <pause dur="0.7"/> early on in economic development that percentage is quite low <pause dur="0.3"/> say five per cent <pause dur="2.2"/> at the top <pause dur="0.2"/> of this cycle <pause dur="0.9"/> when a country reaches the newly industrialized country status <pause dur="0.5"/> say Mexico today <pause dur="0.3"/> or Turkey today <pause dur="1.0"/> then <pause dur="0.2"/> you get something like fifteen to twenty twenty-five even per cent of G-N-P <pause dur="0.5"/> is contributed by construction <pause dur="0.9"/> and then it declines again <pause dur="0.4"/> to <pause dur="0.2"/> again something like five per cent so there is no paradox then in a country like Ghana <pause dur="0.2"/> and in a country like United Kingdom <pause dur="0.2"/> you have the 
same share of construction <pause dur="0.3"/> in total output <pause dur="0.5"/> because <pause dur="0.3"/> many many things are already in place roads are there <pause dur="0.3"/> buildings are there <pause dur="0.3"/> schools are there <pause dur="0.2"/> ports are there <pause dur="0.7"/> everything is there but you need to maintain it and so on <pause dur="0.3"/> you add a little bit <pause dur="0.2"/> you destroy an old building and put another one in there you take an old bridge down and put another one there <pause dur="0.2"/> but nevertheless most of the stuff is there and people are not moving around any more <pause dur="1.4"/> so <pause dur="0.3"/> in L-D-Cs and A-I-Cs <pause dur="0.4"/> you would expect roughly the same <pause dur="1.1"/> shares of construction in G-N-P <pause dur="0.3"/> whereas <pause dur="0.7"/> newly industrialized countries would have very high share <pause dur="0.2"/> because <pause dur="1.2"/> concrete is being poured right now <pause dur="0.8"/> industrial capacity is being put in place but with it housing schools everything is happening at the same time <pause dur="0.2"/> enormous reconstruction <pause dur="0.4"/> # benefits from that kind of thing <pause dur="0.7"/> now i haven't mentioned so far what is on the horizontal axis <pause dur="0.2"/> i mentioned time <pause dur="0.4"/> but actually the measure that you see there is G-N-P per capita <pause dur="0.5"/> in other words total 
output divided by total population of a particular country <pause dur="0.6"/> it is a measure <pause dur="0.3"/> of <pause dur="0.5"/> economic development <pause dur="0.7"/> it is not a measure of economic well-being <pause dur="0.8"/> but <pause dur="0.3"/> it is sometimes <pause dur="0.9"/> taken to be you know economic development is taken to be <pause dur="0.3"/> # a kind of measure <pause dur="0.4"/> of well-being <pause dur="0.4"/> people are better off <pause dur="0.2"/> when <pause dur="0.2"/> G-N-P per capita is high <pause dur="0.4"/> in some countries in the world that number is now <pause dur="0.2"/> six seven eight ten-thousand dollars per <pause dur="0.5"/> inhabitant <pause dur="0.5"/> in some other country it is five six-hundred dollars <pause dur="0.2"/> so there's a huge range <pause dur="0.3"/> in which # countries fall <pause dur="0.7"/> but nevertheless you can expect <pause dur="0.5"/> that if this is so <pause dur="0.6"/> and that's the next # <pause dur="0.7"/> diagram <pause dur="0.7"/><kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="7"/> that <pause dur="0.3"/> you will actually over time <pause dur="0.2"/> experience a shift <pause dur="0.7"/> in the same direction <pause dur="0.8"/> so <pause dur="0.3"/> i have the same diagram <pause dur="0.2"/> but here i say time and not G-N-P per capita <pause dur="0.4"/> why <pause dur="0.2"/> because under quote unquote normal conditions <pause dur="0.7"/> a country <pause dur="0.3"/> would be <pause dur="0.2"/> developing <pause dur="0.5"/> but there is no guarantee that a country will be developing <pause dur="0.3"/> a country may be stagnating <pause dur="0.2"/> a country may be going backwards <pause dur="0.3"/> in many parts of the world 
today we have civil wars <pause dur="0.3"/> and different stages of development <pause dur="0.5"/> you know in ex-Yugoslavia where i originally come from <pause dur="0.2"/> # there is a civil war still <pause dur="0.2"/> kind of simmering in the background <pause dur="0.2"/> and obviously <pause dur="0.4"/> not too many people are building there <pause dur="0.3"/> there are no tourists on the coast even though there is no war there <pause dur="0.3"/> but <pause dur="0.2"/> because there are no tourists there are no new hotels added or not too many <pause dur="0.2"/> et cetera <pause dur="0.4"/> but <pause dur="0.2"/> in some countries civil war is going as we speak Sri Lanka is a good example but the Sudan is another <pause dur="0.3"/> so in many of these countries the process of economic development is moving backwards <pause dur="0.6"/> so you can basically use the same graph <pause dur="0.4"/> but looking backwards you know that is what would happen <pause dur="0.2"/> everything will be sliding down <pause dur="0.3"/> everything will be declining <pause dur="0.2"/> yes </u><pause dur="0.3"/> <u who="sm1110" trans="pause"> just ask like # <pause dur="0.4"/> you say that all the <pause dur="0.2"/> the <pause dur="0.3"/> say all <pause dur="0.6"/> most countries now are <pause dur="0.3"/> or half the countries <pause dur="0.3"/> some of whom are N-I-C and some of whom are A-I-C <pause dur="0.2"/> but what happens when <pause dur="0.4"/> all countries which A-I-C <pause dur="0.7"/> does that mean that the G-N-P <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> <pause dur="0.6"/> will <pause dur="0.3"/> go down </u><pause dur="0.7"/> <u who="nm1108" trans="pause"> okay in other words you are saying <pause dur="0.6"/> what you are talking to us about right now <pause dur="0.2"/> has to do with a particular process which will at some point end <pause dur="0.3"/> yeah <pause dur="0.5"/> and what will happen then <pause dur="0.5"/> # the answer is i have no idea <pause dur="1.8"/> i am and 
you know i'm saying # in a number of introductory parts of this paper <pause dur="0.3"/> that i'm actually covering a period of roughly twenty-five years ahead <pause dur="0.8"/> why <pause dur="0.2"/> that's one generation <pause dur="0.5"/> it is still possible to think <pause dur="0.2"/> approximately twenty-five years from now one generation <pause dur="1.4"/> but most of the data that i'm using in order to make these kinds of arguments go back fifty to hundred years <pause dur="0.6"/> two <pause dur="0.2"/> to four generations <pause dur="0.2"/> so it gives me some feeling <pause dur="0.3"/> of how these things may be played out <pause dur="0.7"/> now it is really hard to say <pause dur="0.2"/> what will happen if we assume <pause dur="0.4"/> that the level of development around the globe <pause dur="0.2"/> say fifty years from now hundred years from now <pause dur="0.2"/> will be generally uniform <pause dur="0.8"/> will be generally like the U-K today <pause dur="0.8"/> what will happen then <pause dur="0.8"/> i don't know <pause dur="0.8"/> i understand this particular process <pause dur="0.2"/> because it is still <pause dur="0.3"/> moving <pause dur="0.3"/> i can see what is likely to happen up to some point <pause dur="0.3"/> but after that it's relatively difficult to say <pause dur="0.9"/> however you know many economists would say that the process of economic development will probably never end in that 
sense <trunc>th</trunc> there will be always some approximation <pause dur="0.4"/> # to equality in different parts of the world <pause dur="0.3"/> there may be some movements some parts will be going up some down people will be shifting around <pause dur="0.8"/> just like in this country <pause dur="0.3"/> you know for example Manchester Liverpool <pause dur="0.2"/> were very important industrial centres people moved there to find work <pause dur="0.3"/> now they're moving out <pause dur="0.2"/> which doesn't mean that these places are going to hell it simply means that the industrial employment of the type that <pause dur="0.6"/> they had before <pause dur="0.2"/> are simply <pause dur="0.4"/> now being changed <pause dur="0.3"/> and there is a process of transition <pause dur="0.3"/> so we may have things like this <pause dur="0.3"/> but the main forces <pause dur="0.3"/> of urbanization and industrialization <pause dur="0.2"/> will have been played out <pause dur="0.3"/> say <pause dur="0.2"/> by fifty <pause dur="0.2"/> hundred years from now <pause dur="0.6"/> okay <pause dur="0.3"/> and at that point <pause dur="0.2"/> some other theoretical framework will be needed <pause dur="0.2"/> to explain what is going on and why <pause dur="0.7"/> yeah <pause dur="1.6"/> so what i'm saying here is <pause dur="0.6"/> because in a normal situation in which there is no war there is no economic decline due to <pause dur="0.4"/> # earthquake or you know <pause dur="0.2"/> case of Turkey <pause dur="0.3"/> # 
possible case of Japan we never know when that will happen but Tokyo is a tremendous risk <pause dur="0.2"/> and not only Tokyo <pause dur="0.2"/> huge concentration of people <pause dur="0.3"/> in California <pause dur="0.2"/> is also continuously at risk and may actually take people <pause dur="0.5"/> back into <pause dur="0.3"/> # previous stages of economic development <pause dur="0.2"/> if something bad happens <pause dur="0.2"/><kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="5"/> which will happen the question is only when <pause dur="0.9"/> so if that is true <pause dur="0.6"/> then i am arguing <pause dur="0.6"/> it is also possible <pause dur="0.7"/> that not only the share of construction <pause dur="1.0"/> in G-N-P <pause dur="0.4"/> but that the volume of construction <pause dur="0.2"/> actual volume <pause dur="0.4"/> would also peak <pause dur="0.4"/> would reach some point <pause dur="0.7"/> and then start declining <pause dur="0.4"/> in 
other words <pause dur="0.2"/> there will really be fewer pounds and yen <pause dur="1.3"/> and dollars spent on a on construction <pause dur="0.5"/> having taken care of inflation <pause dur="0.5"/> and in other words the value of yen <pause dur="0.4"/> dollar <pause dur="0.2"/> and pound <pause dur="0.8"/> yes <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> </u><pause dur="0.5"/> <u who="sf1109" trans="pause"> <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 word"/> <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="1.1"/> well we couldn't <pause dur="0.2"/> we wouldn't be able to generalize that for all type of # all types of countries <pause dur="0.5"/> both # let's say for less developed countries <pause dur="0.7"/> you still have a lot of population <pause dur="0.6"/> drawing you know <pause dur="0.5"/> height rate of # <pause dur="0.2"/> population growth <pause dur="0.4"/> <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> secondly <pause dur="0.7"/> perhaps the the <pause dur="0.4"/> if <pause dur="0.9"/> if this process of the government stops it could be because of the economic crisis <pause dur="0.5"/> not exactly  because of the <pause dur="1.1"/> of the process of <pause dur="0.9"/> a lot of people <pause dur="0.2"/> going to the cities and <pause dur="0.2"/> things already being built there </u><u who="nm1108" trans="overlap"> mm </u><pause dur="0.2"/> <u who="sf1109" trans="pause"> and # no no need for building more <pause dur="0.7"/> so <pause dur="0.3"/> # </u><u who="nm1108" trans="overlap"> no i i agree i agree with what you're saying but i would also say that you know what i have in mind in this particular case <pause dur="0.4"/> are countries like # the U-K like # Holland like Denmark </u><pause dur="0.2"/> <u who="sf1109" trans="pause"> yeah </u><pause dur="0.3"/> <u who="nm1108" trans="pause"> # <pause dur="0.2"/> by the way the U-K

talking about so-called secular or long term threats <pause dur="0.2"/> i'm not talking about cyclical behaviour of the construction industry <pause dur="0.2"/> that follows the business cycle <pause dur="0.7"/> business cycles <pause dur="0.3"/> depending <pause dur="0.4"/> on many circumstances <pause dur="0.2"/> would be between <pause dur="0.2"/> traditionally <pause dur="0.2"/> three-and-a-half and five years <pause dur="1.1"/> now <pause dur="0.2"/> the last two business cycles were <pause dur="0.2"/> a bit longer <pause dur="1.7"/> but nevertheless business cycles are short term <pause dur="0.4"/> you have everything <pause dur="0.2"/> or almost everything going up then collapsing then going up again <pause dur="0.2"/> so i'm not talking about that cyclical behaviour <pause dur="0.2"/> that will be going around this thing <pause dur="0.3"/> yeah <pause dur="0.2"/> i'm talking about <pause dur="0.3"/> the average <pause dur="0.4"/> that is moving in some smooth way <pause dur="0.5"/> it is very difficult to actually demonstrate that anything like this is going on statistically <pause dur="0.3"/> because we don't possess good enough data <pause dur="0.2"/> for many countries <pause dur="0.3"/> to make such claims <pause dur="0.3"/> but you will find if you look into this book <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> you will find diagrams which actually suggest these kinds of things <pause dur="0.4"/> i cannot find it right now <pause dur="0.5"/> or i will <pause dur="0.7"/> # there is a 
diagram on page thirty-one by the way <pause dur="0.3"/> you cannot see it terribly well but there is a curve that looks like this and there are many countries plotted <pause dur="0.4"/> # less developed <pause dur="0.2"/> newly industrialized <pause dur="0.2"/> and advanced industrial countries <pause dur="0.4"/> but statistical evidence for anything like this <pause dur="0.2"/> is hard to agree with people because you <pause dur="0.2"/> you are talking about <pause dur="0.2"/> a statistical cloud of points <pause dur="0.2"/> which can be interpreted many different ways <pause dur="0.8"/> at any rate <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.9"/> i personally believe that if we have a long term decline of the share of construction in G-N-P <pause dur="0.2"/> you would ultimately have <pause dur="0.2"/> a volume decline it cannot just go on for a very long period of time <pause dur="0.2"/> and this is something that i will try to argue right now <pause dur="0.6"/> it is in the text i don't have any pictures so let me # try to do it <pause dur="0.3"/> by just talking to you about this <pause dur="2.2"/> people <pause dur="1.1"/> typically <pause dur="0.2"/> will tell you <pause dur="0.5"/> that <pause dur="0.3"/> those sectors of the economy <pause dur="0.4"/> where employment is dropping <pause dur="0.8"/> do not necessarily produce less output <pause dur="0.2"/> because employment is dropping because productivity is going down <pause dur="0.6"/> 
let me show you # <pause dur="0.4"/> then i'll skip # the the next # <pause dur="0.2"/> diagram for the time being <pause dur="0.7"/><kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="5"/> # here is a diagram that shows # employment share <pause dur="0.2"/> of agriculture <pause dur="0.2"/> services in industry <pause dur="0.5"/> according to a number of serious economists who have looked over one-hundred years to see <pause dur="0.3"/> how employment for example <pause dur="0.3"/> shapes up <pause dur="0.3"/> for <pause dur="0.3"/> these broad categories of economic sector <pause dur="1.5"/> in agriculture the drop <pause dur="0.3"/> corresponds to <pause dur="0.2"/> an incredible increase in productivity <pause dur="1.3"/> by the way <pause dur="0.4"/> the construction sector around the globe but especially the United States which is still the most productive society on this planet <pause dur="0.7"/> way more productive than Japan <pause dur="0.7"/> which is catching up with United States but still <pause dur="0.8"/> the productivity <pause dur="0.3"/> not the rate of change of productivity <pause dur="0.4"/> of most American workers is tremendous by comparison with most <pause dur="0.2"/> Japanese workers <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> the change is <trunc>sli</trunc> somewhat different but in the last couple of years <pause dur="0.5"/> the productivity increases in United States have also increased unbelievably <pause dur="0.6"/> so that <pause dur="0.2"/> we have an incredibly productive society <pause dur="0.2"/> 
still <pause dur="0.3"/> agriculture <pause dur="0.4"/> is the <trunc>soci</trunc> is the sector of the national economy in the United States <pause dur="0.2"/> that has shown <pause dur="0.2"/> greatest improvements in productivity since the war <pause dur="0.5"/> # by the war i mean the Second World War <pause dur="1.2"/> # <pause dur="0.8"/> now <pause dur="0.3"/> i can tell you <pause dur="0.4"/> in this particular diagram <pause dur="0.3"/> which comes from the work of one great economist whose name is # <pause dur="2.2"/> # Angus Madison Madison he's mentioned in the in the text <pause dur="0.5"/> this <pause dur="0.2"/> bit which is called industry actually combines manufacturing and construction <pause dur="1.4"/> he sees a very tight relationship between manufacturing and construction <pause dur="0.2"/> and i agree with that particular <trunc>po</trunc> # position and we will <pause dur="0.2"/> talk about these things later on in this course <pause dur="0.8"/> he says <pause dur="0.2"/> that industry experiences <pause dur="0.2"/> this kind of growth up to a point of employment in industry and construction <pause dur="0.2"/> and then it starts declining <pause dur="0.5"/> we know we know that manufacturing is the second major <pause dur="0.7"/> beneficiary <pause dur="0.2"/> of <pause dur="0.3"/> productivity increases in United States and in other parts of the world <pause dur="0.3"/> agriculture and then manufacturing tremendous increases <pause dur="0.8"/> now i can tell 
you one thing <pause dur="1.5"/> the construction sector <pause dur="0.5"/> in most countries according to all serious studies and especially in United States <pause dur="0.4"/> shows no productivity increases since Second World War <pause dur="1.0"/> no productivity increases <pause dur="1.9"/> it is staggering <pause dur="1.0"/> and normally you know many of us who analyse the construction sector <pause dur="0.3"/> would say <pause dur="0.6"/> that <pause dur="0.2"/> that doesn't take into account the quality of buildings and so on we don't do things this way any more <pause dur="0.5"/> we spend much more money on various kinds of electrical mechanical <pause dur="0.2"/> and electronic systems <pause dur="0.3"/> we don't just take <pause dur="0.3"/> bricks and <trunc>morta</trunc> mortar <trunc>bus</trunc> # buildings like this one <pause dur="0.8"/> but nevertheless <pause dur="0.3"/> anybody dealing with any other industries say I-T-related industries will tell you <pause dur="0.4"/> that <pause dur="0.2"/> quality changes there are staggering by comparison with construction <pause dur="0.5"/> so construction is one of the sectors that <pause dur="0.3"/> typically <pause dur="0.2"/> in any serious study comparative or just for one country <pause dur="0.2"/> comparing different sectors and industries <pause dur="0.3"/> shows no productivity increases or slight negative <pause dur="0.3"/> productivity 
increases <pause dur="0.3"/> in other words <pause dur="0.2"/> drop in productivity <pause dur="1.5"/> these are facts <pause dur="0.5"/> so <pause dur="1.1"/> it is also a fact <pause dur="0.4"/> that the number of people working in construction <pause dur="0.3"/> in advanced industrialized countries <pause dur="0.5"/> is dropping <pause dur="1.0"/> we have very strong data about that <pause dur="0.3"/> the more developed the economy <pause dur="0.3"/> the less people work in construction <pause dur="0.7"/> from one point to another however you compare it over time <pause dur="0.8"/> it is dropping <pause dur="0.8"/> if productivity is not increasing <pause dur="0.4"/> where is the volume of construction going to come from </u><pause dur="0.9"/> <u who="sf1111" trans="pause"> maintenance and repair </u><pause dur="0.4"/> <u who="nm1108" trans="pause"> i'm sorry </u><pause dur="0.4"/> <u who="sf1111" trans="pause"> maintenance and repair </u><pause dur="0.3"/> <u who="nm1108" trans="pause"> yes possibly and <kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="8"/> that's why i had this # diagram here <pause dur="1.0"/> on the previous page <pause dur="0.8"/> you know saying that <pause dur="1.2"/> subsectoral share <pause dur="0.5"/> in total construction which will be new construction and then maintenance and repair <pause dur="0.3"/> is changing over time <pause dur="1.0"/> so new construction may be dropping <pause dur="0.6"/> but maintenance and repair is increasing <pause dur="0.8"/> again i will be talking to you about this again but <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> # i have studied together with a colleague from the United States i have studied maintenance and repair 
vis-à-vis <pause dur="0.2"/> new construction in United States <pause dur="0.6"/> it is still a very small proportion of # total construction there <pause dur="0.2"/> it is something like thirty per cent <pause dur="0.6"/> in this country it is believed to be something like <pause dur="0.5"/> forty to fifty per cent <pause dur="1.5"/> # maintenance and repair <pause dur="0.4"/> out of total <pause dur="0.8"/> but <pause dur="0.3"/> we see <pause dur="0.3"/> that maintenance and repair construction is actually much less capable <pause dur="0.2"/> of moving the rest of the national economy <pause dur="0.3"/> than <pause dur="0.2"/> new construction <pause dur="0.6"/> so i like to say that maintenance and repair construction <pause dur="0.3"/> can provide a lower bound on the drop of construction ability <pause dur="1.3"/> you know you will always have <pause dur="0.2"/> replacement of some facilities <pause dur="0.2"/> you will always have an increasing amount of maintenance and repair <pause dur="0.3"/> but that is a declining <pause dur="0.7"/> thing nevertheless <pause dur="0.2"/> in most of the economies we have studied <pause dur="0.4"/> this economy in particular <pause dur="0.2"/> but <pause dur="0.3"/> again <pause dur="0.2"/> countries like Denmark and so on would show <pause dur="0.4"/> in very high <pause dur="0.9"/> # # development <pause dur="0.2"/> # # environments <pause dur="0.3"/> that construction is basically a declining sector <pause dur="0.3"/> in volume terms as well <pause dur="1.0"/> now i am 
stressing all this because many of my colleagues construction economists disagree with this proposition <pause dur="0.8"/> they agree with the <trunc>pr</trunc> # the previous one <pause dur="0.6"/> that <pause dur="0.6"/> the share of construction in G-N-P first goes up and then comes down <pause dur="0.4"/> but that volume first comes down and then comes down <pause dur="0.2"/> later on <pause dur="1.2"/> most of my colleagues disagree <pause dur="0.3"/> about <pause dur="1.0"/> and that is therefore something that we will see you know that is a proposition <pause dur="0.3"/> that i am putting my name behind <pause dur="0.5"/> and one day it will be the proven <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> correct or incorrect <pause dur="0.3"/> but for the time being <pause dur="0.3"/> i don't see any strong reasons <pause dur="0.2"/> to believe that these things would not continue <pause dur="0.2"/> to look like they do <pause dur="1.9"/><kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="4"/> the survey which i will discuss with you next time indicates <pause dur="0.2"/> that people disagree with that proposition and that's interesting <pause dur="0.4"/> you know that's interesting and normally i have to listen to this <pause dur="0.2"/> i have to listen to <pause dur="0.4"/> the <pause dur="0.3"/> common sense <pause dur="0.7"/> within my own professional <pause dur="0.2"/> group <pause dur="1.6"/> now <pause dur="0.2"/> this diagram is a kind of a <pause dur="1.6"/> taking on taking on of the previous one <pause dur="0.2"/> saying <pause dur="0.4"/> that <pause dur="0.3"/> if i'm 
correct about what i am saying right now we would expect something like this with countries <pause dur="0.3"/> which <pause dur="0.2"/> today <pause dur="0.3"/> today have the status of <pause dur="0.3"/> less developed <pause dur="0.6"/> newly industrialized <pause dur="0.3"/> or advanced industrial countries <pause dur="0.9"/> in other words <pause dur="0.2"/> that we can expect to that today's L-D-Cs will <pause dur="0.4"/> continue <pause dur="0.2"/> increasing their volume <pause dur="0.6"/> of 
# construction <pause dur="0.2"/> volume not share only <pause dur="1.1"/> that NICs <pause dur="0.6"/> would at some point reach <pause dur="0.5"/> some kind of peak and then decline <pause dur="1.1"/> in volume <pause dur="0.2"/> as well <pause dur="0.8"/> and that today's A-I-Cs <pause dur="0.4"/> will <pause dur="0.3"/> at some point start experiencing this kind of growth <pause dur="1.5"/> so <pause dur="0.4"/> # that is a kind of summary of all these diagrams <pause dur="0.3"/> now let me tell you something about these diagrams which i didn't mention before <pause dur="0.3"/> they are obviously not meant to show any mathematical relationship <pause dur="0.8"/> they are <pause dur="0.3"/> ideograms <pause dur="0.3"/> something goes up and comes down so i call <pause dur="0.3"/> this kind of curve <pause dur="0.2"/> i call it simply <pause dur="0.2"/> U-shaped <pause dur="1.1"/> that curve i call S-shaped <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> et cetera <pause dur="0.2"/> in order to show <pause dur="0.2"/> the basic relationships <pause dur="0.3"/> if you would actually want to draw these things more correctly <pause dur="0.3"/> you would probably 
have <pause dur="0.4"/> # something like an incline here and a <pause dur="0.4"/> you know some kind of <pause dur="0.3"/> # ramp <pause dur="0.3"/> taking you down to some kind of value <pause dur="0.2"/> obviously doesn't go from zero up and then down to zero <pause dur="0.2"/> it comes to some asymptotic value <pause dur="0.3"/> what was some value that it approximates in the long run <pause dur="0.6"/> but this is simply <pause dur="0.2"/> a simplification <pause dur="0.3"/> to give people a clear picture of what's going on <pause dur="0.5"/> these things would <pause dur="0.2"/> make the whole thing <pause dur="0.2"/> # # too complicated <pause dur="0.2"/> to understand <pause dur="1.5"/> the next point in my argument is <pause dur="0.2"/> like this and this directly relates to the whole <kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="6"/> question of international trade <pause dur="0.4"/> in construction activity <pause dur="1.7"/> in other words international construction as such <pause dur="0.7"/> i'm saying that present <pause dur="0.2"/> patterns of international trade <pause dur="0.4"/> in construction services <pause dur="1.4"/> to a great extent construction materials as well <pause dur="0.3"/> but mainly construction services <pause dur="0.2"/> looks like this <pause dur="0.4"/> the L-D-Cs are recipients of trade from <pause dur="0.2"/> advanced industrial countries <pause dur="0.5"/> but also from <pause dur="0.4"/> newly industrialized countries <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> even ten years ago this was very difficult for people to understand <pause dur="0.6"/> even 
ten years ago <pause dur="0.4"/> you know i had to strain <pause dur="0.2"/> to explain to people that remember <pause dur="0.2"/> only ten to fifteen years ago we would think about Japan as a NIC <pause dur="0.8"/> and not as an advanced industrial <pause dur="0.5"/> country <pause dur="0.6"/> which it is recognized to be today <pause dur="1.2"/> i now don't have to strain so much because <pause dur="0.3"/> it is a fact that many Japanese <pause dur="0.3"/> companies have done extremely well <pause dur="0.2"/> in the United States and Europe <pause dur="0.2"/> and basically left <pause dur="0.2"/> many of these people are not as interested as they used to be <pause dur="0.2"/> in these kinds of markets <pause dur="0.4"/> they are <pause dur="0.5"/> interested in some niche markets but basically they are not <pause dur="0.5"/> at a stage of economic development where that is very interesting for them <pause dur="0.8"/> however <pause dur="0.4"/> we have here we have China here which ten years ago nobody would imagine <pause dur="0.4"/> that Chinese construction companies would be <pause dur="0.2"/> building <pause dur="0.2"/> relatively far from home very complex projects <pause dur="1.6"/> at that time <pause dur="0.2"/> ten years ago it would be surprising that Pakistani companies are building these kinds of things <pause dur="0.2"/> not just Italian companies <pause dur="0.3"/> you know building dams <pause dur="0.2"/> in their region but 
nevertheless quite far from home <pause dur="1.1"/> Turkish companies are building in Moscow <pause dur="0.3"/> i mean there are many things of that sort which are quite different today and i don't have to explain as much <pause dur="0.4"/> what i expect to see in the future <pause dur="0.7"/> so <pause dur="0.6"/> this is the situation that we have right now <pause dur="1.3"/> that actually there is some trade cross-trade going between NICs A-I-Cs <pause dur="0.9"/> # remember South Korea is still classified as a NIC <pause dur="0.8"/> and not as an advanced industrialized country <pause dur="1.0"/> Japan is <pause dur="1.2"/> and China is a NIC only <pause dur="0.5"/> on the two seaboards <pause dur="0.3"/> but inside it's an L-D-C <pause dur="1.0"/> if you go to China you'll see <pause dur="1.0"/> totally rural pastoral areas in the middle of the country <pause dur="0.4"/> there are people <pause dur="0.4"/> you know carrying things like this in buckets <pause dur="0.7"/> on construction sites <pause dur="1.9"/> # and you can actually see just humans building no machinery no nothing <pause dur="0.3"/> in very large part of China <pause dur="0.4"/> on the seaboards obviously it's exactly the same as in Canada there is no difference really <pause dur="1.5"/> now i'm saying <pause dur="0.2"/> if i take this part of the picture to correspond with the 
beginning of my diagram that i just showed you <pause dur="0.4"/> in other words those curve <pause dur="0.3"/> A-I-Cs going down NICs going like this in volume <pause dur="0.3"/> and L-D-Cs going up <pause dur="0.3"/> and i now that's the beginning of that diagram <pause dur="0.2"/> and now this is the end of the diagram <pause dur="0.6"/> i'm saying <pause dur="0.3"/> today's today's L-D-Cs <pause dur="0.2"/> they will not be L-D-Cs that <pause dur="0.2"/> well you know they'll be in the future <pause dur="0.3"/> but today's L-D-Cs <pause dur="0.4"/> will be <pause dur="0.4"/> building in A-I-Cs <pause dur="1.8"/> they will and and <pause dur="0.3"/> <trunc>t</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> today's NICs will still be building in <trunc>a</trunc> A-I-Cs <pause dur="0.2"/> there will be trade between these </u><pause dur="1.1"/> <u who="sf1111" trans="pause"> what is it what would be the <trunc>ou</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> the output of A-<pause dur="0.4"/>I-C </u><pause dur="0.7"/> <u who="nm1108" trans="pause"> well <pause dur="0.3"/> some niche markets obviously you know nuclear reactors # it is not that easy to actually think up that kind of technology <pause dur="0.4"/> and it depends on very special equipment <pause dur="0.2"/> because a nuclear reactor is not a building a nuclear reactor is a piece of equipment <pause dur="0.5"/> in a shroud <pause dur="0.6"/> yeah <pause dur="0.4"/> and you know modern reactors are like this they they just have a little bit of concrete around them <pause dur="0.6"/> # but generally speaking <pause dur="0.3"/> it is equipment that you are selling <pause dur="0.3"/> and the shroud is relatively simple to

Arabia <pause dur="1.0"/> so there are many reasons for this but nevertheless <pause dur="0.3"/> Pakistanis are capable of doing it <pause dur="0.3"/> and they're now doing much more than just providing labour <pause dur="0.4"/> the same thing with Turks <pause dur="0.4"/> you know <pause dur="0.2"/> at some point you had Turkish <pause dur="0.5"/> crews <pause dur="0.2"/> working in a number of different countries in the broader region <pause dur="0.2"/> but now <pause dur="0.3"/> they are run by Turkish construction companies they're not big construction company run by somebody else <pause dur="0.7"/> yeah <pause dur="1.0"/> so you have many things of that nature which are now happening <pause dur="0.3"/> # in Eastern Europe # or <pause dur="0.2"/> closer to Central Europe you would have Polish companies now building in <pause dur="0.2"/> Germany <pause dur="0.3"/> originally it was simply Polish crews <pause dur="0.2"/> run by a German company <pause dur="1.6"/> so there are many changes of that sort i know that for example there there you know similar things <pause dur="0.8"/> in the fringe countries <pause dur="0.2"/> that used to be called <pause dur="0.3"/> Eastern European countries now they like to call themselves Central European countries <pause dur="0.3"/> but all of these countries Poland <pause dur="0.4"/> # Czechland Slovakia and so on are providing many of these

add capacity and thus you grow <pause dur="1.2"/> but the in advanced industrial countries <pause dur="0.2"/> the ideal is actually to add nothing but to improve the efficiency of <pause dur="0.6"/> what you already have <pause dur="0.4"/> intensive <pause dur="0.9"/> economic growth <pause dur="1.1"/> 
so extensive <pause dur="0.6"/> intensive growth <pause dur="0.4"/> and economists since long time ago and i'm quoting them in this book like Kuznets <pause dur="1.3"/> visualized <pause dur="0.2"/> you know many years ago <pause dur="0.8"/> but that was science fiction back then <pause dur="0.4"/> that you could actually have very rapid economic growth without really any addition to your capital stock <pause dur="0.9"/> what you would be adding <pause dur="0.3"/> obviously would be wires and <pause dur="0.3"/> you know <pause dur="0.2"/> pieces of gadgetry and you know things like this <pause dur="0.3"/> electronic <pause dur="0.2"/> components <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> and that all of a sudden <pause dur="0.6"/> is actually driving the <trunc>e</trunc> American economy today <pause dur="0.2"/> you don't need more buildings in New York or more bridges <pause dur="0.3"/> you can use all of that <pause dur="0.2"/> with very little bit that you add in terms of physical equipment <pause dur="1.3"/> and make it so much more productive <pause dur="0.3"/> you know with information technology and so on <pause dur="0.4"/> so <pause dur="0.3"/> many of these propositions that they 
started with ten years ago <pause dur="0.2"/> when the internet was not around and so on <pause dur="0.2"/> sound <pause dur="1.0"/> a bit more plausible <pause dur="0.4"/> and a bit more boring because you know way then people say hey you're crazy <pause dur="0.2"/> now they're saying okay why are you boring us with something which is <pause dur="0.4"/> probably going to happen <pause dur="0.3"/> because it's not real science fiction <pause dur="0.8"/> so remember <pause dur="0.2"/> # i had that kind of situation with # i don't know stories about China <pause dur="0.8"/> # before ninety-three <pause dur="0.3"/> when most of the world's realized that China existed and was extremely important <pause dur="0.5"/> when i would speak to <pause dur="0.3"/> you know many of you here from the M-S-C programme <pause dur="0.3"/> are actually <pause dur="0.2"/> professional people who know what construction is <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> you know i would talk to professionals in construction and they would look at me and they would say <pause dur="1.0"/> where did you get this thing about China <pause dur="0.2"/> # what are you reading that we are not reading <pause dur="1.2"/> now business people very often in my experience behave like <pause dur="0.2"/> idiots you know <pause dur="0.2"/> before they understand <pause dur="0.5"/> before it is written in Time <pause dur="0.2"/> and Newsweek <pause dur="0.2"/> and places 
like this that something is true <pause dur="0.2"/> it's not true <pause dur="0.3"/> and they don't want to even listen <pause dur="0.6"/> but then <pause dur="0.2"/> once they learn it and they learned it in March nineteen-ninety-three <pause dur="0.5"/> after March nineteen-ninety-three they say okay okay what else is new <pause dur="0.6"/> so there is an enormous kind of shift <pause dur="0.4"/> in public opinion <pause dur="0.4"/> in especially in the business circles <pause dur="0.4"/> and business people are very given to fashion <pause dur="0.6"/> okay <pause dur="0.4"/> so <pause dur="0.5"/> you know for example starting to say today that Africa one day will be a great construction market people will say ergh you know <pause dur="0.3"/> you must be crazy <pause dur="1.5"/> and obviously if we deal to some extent with civil war there and so on <pause dur="0.3"/> Africa may become a wonderful market for Europeans <pause dur="0.8"/> Africa and Europe have always been extremely close since # Greek and Roman times <pause dur="0.8"/> and there is no reason why Africa should be a separate continent in that sense that we <pause dur="0.2"/> see it like some place far away where people are black not like us over there <pause dur="0.4"/> yeah <pause dur="0.2"/> exactly the same people we can make kids together <pause dur="0.2"/> so why we shouldn't <pause dur="0.4"/> do 
other things together <pause dur="1.5"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> so in that sense you know i would say that there is very great closedness of mind <pause dur="0.3"/> in many # professional circles about these kinds of questions <pause dur="0.2"/> of where these things are likely to be in twenty-five years <pause dur="0.4"/> now obviously <pause dur="0.2"/> you know business people will tell you <pause dur="0.3"/> if your story doesn't affect me on Monday <pause dur="0.7"/> it's not very interesting because it talks about some kind of long term future <pause dur="0.5"/> obviously that's a correct point <pause dur="1.0"/> but # it is as i said to you the first time we met it is important for a reflective <pause dur="0.4"/> practitioner <pause dur="0.4"/> to have some notion <pause dur="0.5"/> where we came from <pause dur="0.2"/> with the construction industry <pause dur="0.9"/> in our different countries in the world <pause dur="0.3"/> and where that is likely to go over so many years <pause dur="0.2"/> yeah <pause dur="0.2"/> it is important to have some notion of how that <pause dur="0.3"/> works <pause dur="0.3"/> and that is what i am trying to <pause dur="0.2"/> do <pause dur="0.3"/> by one <pause dur="0.3"/> bringing you this particular paper that brings the concepts <pause dur="0.2"/> having to do with my notion of the future of international construction together <pause dur="0.3"/> and two <pause dur="0.2"/> the survey <pause dur="0.2"/> which we will

to work in Germany <pause dur="0.5"/> and that kind of person will <pause dur="0.2"/> produce a job that people would say <pause dur="0.3"/> well <pause dur="0.2"/> what the heck is wrong with us why cannot we take this particular job <pause dur="0.2"/> you know <pause dur="0.5"/> # in in a different country <pause dur="0.9"/> if you have a couple of friends there <pause dur="0.2"/> you have some kind of understanding to the company <pause dur="0.3"/> that can help you understand the rules the law and so on <pause dur="0.4"/> you can <pause dur="0.2"/> obviously build things in Belgium as well <pause dur="0.6"/> so # <pause dur="0.2"/> small firms especially are quite <pause dur="0.4"/> set in their ways <pause dur="0.3"/> they're in Essex and that's it <pause dur="0.9"/> now when a firm becomes dead <pause dur="0.6"/> you know people start thinking about large projects which are abroad <pause dur="0.9"/> but generally speaking i again find # like with any fashion you know one year black is in fashion the other it's like blue whatever <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> these fashions shift quite interestingly from year to year my survey's very much about fashion <pause dur="0.5"/> it is not about <pause dur="0.3"/> what really will happen in the future <pause dur="0.3"/> but how fashions change <pause dur="0.4"/> so for example <pause dur="0.7"/> there was a period <pause dur="0.2"/> when <pause dur="0.6"/> Russia <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> and you know Eastern Europe was extremely popular <pause dur="1.2"/> then 
there was a period when they kind of vanished from the picture because there was too much crime there <pause dur="0.2"/> anybody who went there <pause dur="0.3"/> experienced so much trouble <pause dur="0.4"/> that they didn't want to stay <pause dur="0.3"/> # i mean only Turks and Yugoslavs stayed <pause dur="1.0"/> because they would # they would know how to pull out a pistol if <pause dur="0.3"/> the Russian guy pulls out a pistol <pause dur="0.8"/><vocal desc="laughter" n="ss" iterated="y" dur="1"/> and it's as simple as that you know <pause dur="0.2"/> you protect your perimeter and you say don't come in because we'll shoot you <pause dur="0.2"/> you know <pause dur="0.5"/><vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" dur="1"/> and the Russians understand that perfectly so there is you know the two crews understand each other and that's it <pause dur="0.6"/> everybody else moved out <pause dur="1.1"/><vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" dur="1"/> but now Swedes are buying <pause dur="0.5"/> Finns <pause dur="0.2"/> to go <pause dur="0.3"/> to Russia <pause dur="1.2"/> and when you talk to Finns <pause dur="0.2"/> they all just think about Eastern Europe you you ask them about other markets <pause dur="0.2"/> yeah <pause dur="0.2"/> you know <pause dur="0.2"/> we just love Russia <pause dur="1.9"/> but they're acting as how to say <pause dur="0.3"/> not exactly champions but they're really working for Swedes <pause dur="1.7"/> so Skanska will buy one company another third <pause dur="0.8"/> organizations with

all they couldn't care less <pause dur="0.9"/> so that's interesting you know how <pause dur="0.3"/> people train their vision in some direction <pause dur="0.5"/> the British construction companies have <pause dur="0.4"/> because of the British Commonwealth <pause dur="0.2"/> and because of the British Empire <pause dur="0.3"/> an interest <pause dur="0.3"/> in <pause dur="1.2"/> for example South East Asia <pause dur="1.2"/> you know a Briton is not going to feel very uneasy in Kuala Lumpur <pause dur="0.7"/> like <trunc>wh</trunc> <pause dur="0.4"/> where am i <pause dur="0.5"/> you know how do you eat this <pause dur="0.4"/> they've been there <pause dur="1.1"/> so there is no problem <pause dur="1.5"/> in that sense that's an enormous advantage <pause dur="1.4"/> every country has these kinds of <pause dur="1.3"/><kinesic desc="moves hands to side of face demonstrating blinkers" iterated="n"/> you know <pause dur="0.6"/> blinkers <pause dur="0.7"/> so Portugal will be looking toward Brazil <pause dur="0.5"/> or Mozambique <pause dur="0.7"/> but Ghana <pause dur="0.2"/> mm they don't know about Ghana <pause dur="1.5"/> the Finns will be looking toward Poland and <pause dur="0.5"/> Russia <pause dur="1.1"/> the Germans will be looking that way as well and correctly because huge markets are going to be there <pause dur="0.3"/> once we deal with <pause dur="0.3"/> organized crime that goes all the way to Putin <pause dur="0.5"/> you know or or # <pause dur="0.5"/> Yeltsin there is no question <pause dur="0.4"/> but that organized crime goes all the way to <pause dur="0.4"/> the top of society <pause dur="1.7"/> how do you deal with it <pause dur="0.6"/> most of us are 
not used to you know for example if <pause dur="0.5"/> you know <trunc>y</trunc> some of you may # # feel easier than others <pause dur="0.3"/> paying somebody two-hundred dollars to <pause dur="0.2"/> take your mother into hospital <pause dur="0.6"/> i cannot do that <pause dur="0.5"/> i'm not used to that <pause dur="2.0"/> but it's still a bit different <pause dur="0.3"/> to say <pause dur="0.2"/> okay you know <pause dur="0.4"/> two-million dollars <pause dur="0.4"/> let's build this dam for you <pause dur="0.5"/> their minister <pause dur="1.8"/> that's a bit more difficult who is going to do that kind of stuff many people don't know it in <trunc>a</trunc> in America that's so illegal <pause dur="0.3"/> that business schools have a huge problem <pause dur="0.5"/> how do you have an American organization some place in Pakistan <pause dur="0.5"/> how do you deal with that situation <pause dur="0.9"/> and it's normal in Pakistan to deal that way <pause dur="1.4"/> so either you exclude yourself completely from that world <pause dur="0.3"/> or <pause dur="0.2"/> you learn to do it even though it's not exactly something that you like doing <pause dur="0.4"/> because 
it's a bit <pause dur="0.2"/> unusual <pause dur="0.2"/> you know <pause dur="0.6"/> it's not something that you read in books <pause dur="1.8"/> so there are many questions of that sort which are quite interesting <pause dur="0.5"/> and # one of the things that i like to do with my survey is to look at <pause dur="0.7"/> for example <pause dur="0.2"/> Japanese opinion about their part of the world i don't publish these things because it becomes too desegregated this kind of information <pause dur="0.4"/> but i'm interested in these questions <pause dur="0.3"/> how do <pause dur="0.2"/> Indians look at this if i have a couple of Indians in my survey <pause dur="0.5"/> or how do the Britons look at things <trunc>vis</trunc> vis-à-vis Germans <pause dur="0.4"/> and everybody has different blinkers and they're quite interesting <pause dur="0.7"/> British <trunc>blink</trunc> blinkers <pause dur="0.4"/> and that's good for us and that's reflected here are quite wide because of the British Commonwealth <pause dur="0.9"/> but many Britons don't look toward Germany Germany doesn't exist you look <pause dur="0.3"/> past Germany <pause dur="0.7"/> yeah <pause dur="0.5"/> younger people are different <pause dur="1.2"/> anyway that's the broad answer to your <pause dur="0.7"/> question <pause dur="0.5"/> now let 
me see how are we doing <pause dur="0.5"/> # i would like to <pause dur="0.2"/> # now shift gears and to introduce you to the <pause dur="0.4"/> methodology or technique <pause dur="0.3"/> that i will be using <pause dur="0.6"/> in <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> most of my papers that i will be showing you <pause dur="0.4"/> # these <pause dur="0.9"/> three types we meet <pause dur="2.1"/> # the methodology comes from something that is known as input-output analysis <pause dur="0.7"/> # that particular term exists in many fields but in economics it has a very specific meaning <pause dur="0.9"/> input-output models <pause dur="0.7"/> were invented by a Russian fellow <pause dur="0.2"/> whose name is <pause dur="0.4"/> Wassily Leontief <pause dur="1.4"/> who published in nineteen-thirty-six an important paper while he was a professor at Harvard <pause dur="2.0"/> and he remained professor at Harvard # <trunc>througho</trunc> throughout most of his life <pause dur="1.3"/> and for that paper <pause dur="0.2"/> Leontief got <pause dur="0.4"/> in nineteen-seventy-three <pause dur="1.4"/> quarter of a century ago <pause dur="0.3"/> got his Nobel prize <pause dur="0.5"/> in other words <pause dur="0.2"/> it is a bit of work <pause dur="0.4"/> that is quite important in analysis of national economies <pause dur="1.1"/> is now based on reasonably good data <pause dur="0.3"/> and one can compare different countries with this kind of data so that's what i am doing <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> this book is <pause dur="0.9"/> 
almost all <pause dur="0.5"/> almost hundred per cent about <pause dur="0.4"/> input-output analysis <pause dur="0.5"/> many parts <pause dur="1.0"/> are kind of hairy and mathematical and i would tell you not to touch them so for example part one <pause dur="0.3"/> contains four papers <pause dur="0.2"/> that you should avoid <pause dur="0.2"/> if you want to preserve your eyesight <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="2.6"/><vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" dur="2"/> # if you like # matrix algebra enjoy but # more likely than not you will find it appalling <pause dur="1.2"/> # and that's okay <pause dur="0.4"/> # i don't want you to <pause dur="0.2"/> learn matrix algebra i want you to learn <pause dur="0.3"/> the basic logic of input-output analysis so that's what i'm trying to do <pause dur="0.9"/> now the paper from which <pause dur="0.7"/> i think you should learn about this is this one <pause dur="0.6"/><kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="6"/> it's called Direct and Indirect Resource Utilization by the Construction Sector <pause dur="1.3"/> in the U-S <pause dur="1.6"/> now <pause dur="0.3"/> you have all these some key words in this long and boring title <pause dur="2.9"/> one of the reasons why i'm using input-output <trunc>ana</trunc> analysis is that <pause dur="1.1"/> if you go to a construction site <pause dur="0.4"/> and you ask a question <pause dur="0.4"/> what is passing <pause dur="0.2"/> through the gate <pause dur="1.4"/> # you will learn that # <pause dur="0.7"/> cement is passing through in 
trucks <pause dur="0.4"/> which either <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> or don't <pause dur="0.6"/> you will learn that # rebars are going through you will learn that steel beams are passing through <pause dur="0.2"/> labourers <pause dur="0.3"/> you will see cement you will see <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> various bits and pieces of buildings bricks and so on <pause dur="1.5"/> and if you sat at the gate <pause dur="0.3"/> from <pause dur="0.5"/> day zero <pause dur="0.3"/> to the last day of construction <pause dur="0.4"/> you will get a pretty good picture <pause dur="0.2"/> of what was used in the building <pause dur="0.4"/> if you at the same time look at the plans <pause dur="0.2"/> financial <pause dur="0.9"/> deals made with the company that build this <pause dur="0.6"/> # i don't know loans they got <pause dur="0.4"/> # various kinds of professional advice about <pause dur="0.2"/> foundations and God knows what <pause dur="0.4"/> you will get a pretty good picture of <pause dur="0.3"/> direct inputs into the construction process <pause dur="0.3"/> these are called direct inputs <pause dur="0.2"/> that is going into the site <pause dur="0.4"/> either <pause dur="0.4"/> literally directly <pause dur="0.2"/> or <pause dur="0.2"/> via the construction company in the form of plans and you know things of that sort <pause dur="1.0"/> today <pause dur="0.3"/> much of the plans and <pause dur="0.9"/> # <pause dur="1.0"/> intangible things <pause dur="0.2"/> would be coming via a wire into a computer <pause dur="0.3"/> on the site <pause dur="0.3"/> so you could even measure that <pause dur="0.5"/> you 
can have a little meter <pause dur="0.3"/> to tell you <pause dur="0.4"/> what went in <pause dur="0.3"/> and you could also learn <pause dur="0.2"/> how much that cost <pause dur="0.7"/><vocal desc="cough" iterated="n"/><pause dur="2.1"/> direct inputs are a very small part of what actually happens when you build something <pause dur="1.1"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> let me give you a hypothetical example <pause dur="0.3"/> let's imagine <pause dur="0.3"/> that you don't have a small project because it's a bit difficult to stretch your mind like this <pause dur="0.2"/> but you have a very large project you are building a university <pause dur="1.7"/> new university someplace in the United Kingdom for example <pause dur="1.2"/> well there's a lot of concrete there many new things that you will have to bring to that particular location <pause dur="0.7"/> so you can imagine <pause dur="0.3"/> if there is such an increase <pause dur="0.9"/> of input <pause dur="0.2"/> at a particular location that somebody will build a <pause dur="0.4"/> warehouse relatively close to the site <pause dur="0.7"/> in which <pause dur="0.5"/> various things will be stored before they go to the site <pause dur="0.5"/> there will be someplace close to the site a small plant <pause dur="0.3"/> making <trunc>prefab</trunc> <trunc>b</trunc> prefabricated beams <pause dur="0.6"/> that are required in construction <pause dur="1.6"/> et cetera <pause dur="0.9"/> these would be secondary <pause dur="0.8"/> inputs they come <pause dur="0.9"/> off-site <pause dur="0.9"/> are worked in some 
fashion you use cement and rebars and all that you make the beams and then you ship them <pause dur="0.4"/> to the site itself it's not done on the site because <pause dur="0.2"/> the site is for example not big enough <pause dur="0.2"/> to have <pause dur="0.2"/> a plant that makes rebars or beams or whatever <pause dur="0.9"/> but then <pause dur="0.7"/> you can understand that these rebars come from some <pause dur="0.5"/> foundry <pause dur="0.2"/> which makes various products they make shovels as well <pause dur="0.9"/> so <pause dur="0.3"/> that's one step back that's a third step back <pause dur="1.2"/> but then <pause dur="0.2"/> if you <pause dur="0.2"/> take a chain like this you will realize that someplace along this thing <pause dur="0.2"/> somebody had to buy a new truck because they didn't have enough trucks <pause dur="0.2"/> to build <pause dur="0.3"/> this particular thing so the car industry's affect <pause dur="1.6"/> the car industry <pause dur="0.3"/> if a number of cars <pause dur="0.2"/> are required <pause dur="0.2"/> would all of a sudden say well we need new <pause dur="0.6"/> i don't know metal-bending machinery <pause dur="0.2"/> to produce more cars for this particular project <pause dur="0.5"/> and all these are actually inputs into the construction process but they are just <pause dur="0.2"/> further and further back <pause dur="0.3"/> a very long chain <pause dur="0.8"/> well <pause dur="0.2"/> input-output analysis is about <pause dur="1.2"/> direct 
but also all the indirect <pause dur="0.2"/> effects of a particular purchase <pause dur="1.4"/> so we would say <pause dur="0.2"/> if you increase <pause dur="0.5"/> demand for construction by one pound <pause dur="1.7"/> by how many P will all other industries benefit <pause dur="0.6"/> and i can tell you <pause dur="0.6"/> all other industries will benefit <pause dur="1.9"/> only in the very primitive economy some industries wouldn't benefit <pause dur="0.3"/> for example fishing will <pause dur="1.1"/> be left out <pause dur="0.5"/> because people don't like fish in that country <pause dur="0.3"/> but if people like fish <pause dur="0.6"/> more labourers means more fish for lunches et cetera et cetera <pause dur="2.0"/> so <pause dur="0.7"/> almost everybody's affected by any change even by just one pound <pause dur="0.4"/> but it's difficult to conceptualize <pause dur="0.7"/> in economic analysis these things are <pause dur="0.2"/> known as multipliers <pause dur="0.3"/> so you say <pause dur="0.3"/> one pound spent on construction <pause dur="0.4"/> multiplies into something like <pause dur="0.3"/> two pounds spent on everything <pause dur="0.3"/> including construction but that everything else that you require <pause dur="0.2"/> in order to <pause dur="0.3"/> have <pause dur="0.2"/><kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="8"/> construction services <pause dur="0.3"/> and <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="1.0"/> ultimately a building <pause dur="1.4"/> so <pause dur="0.6"/> input-output analysis is based on <pause dur="0.8"/> input-output <pause dur="0.2"/> tables <pause dur="0.2"/> and an input-output table looks like this <pause dur="2.8"/> 
it has <pause dur="2.5"/> by column <pause dur="0.5"/> a number of industries <pause dur="1.1"/> or industrial sectors <pause dur="0.3"/> and it has by row <pause dur="0.2"/> a number of these sectors <pause dur="0.6"/> we would look at each sector like this we will say <pause dur="0.3"/> sector one <pause dur="1.0"/> say construction <pause dur="0.7"/> produces a certain amount of stuff <pause dur="1.3"/> by using inputs from all the other sectors including itself because construction may be building that shed <pause dur="0.9"/> in which <pause dur="0.2"/> there will be some materials and equipment <pause dur="0.3"/> for the building itself <pause dur="0.8"/> okay <pause dur="0.3"/> or secondary structures or things like this <pause dur="0.4"/> so construction produces a certain amount of <trunc>thi</trunc> # # certain amount of stuff <pause dur="0.3"/> which is <pause dur="0.2"/> here in this particular box <pause dur="0.9"/> it will be <pause dur="1.0"/> appearing in this box as output of the construction sector <pause dur="0.3"/> but a portion of that output goes to intermediate use <pause dur="0.3"/> and a portion goes to <pause dur="0.2"/> final use <pause dur="0.7"/> in the case of construction actually <pause dur="0.5"/> very little goes to <pause dur="0.4"/> intermediate use it is only maintenance and repair <pause dur="0.5"/> that goes to different sectors <pause dur="0.6"/> everything <pause dur="0.6"/> that construction produces is considered to be a capital <pause dur="0.4"/> or <pause dur="0.2"/> investment good <pause dur="0.9"/> which is 
produced whole <pause dur="0.2"/> to be used by other sectors <pause dur="0.2"/> in the next round <pause dur="0.2"/> the of economic production in other words <pause dur="0.2"/> you do not use up a building as you produce something <pause dur="0.5"/> you <pause dur="0.3"/> perhaps <pause dur="0.2"/> depreciate it <pause dur="1.0"/> so a building like this <pause dur="0.5"/> is not used like cement is used <pause dur="0.2"/> you have a bunch of cement and a bunch of sand <pause dur="0.4"/> and water and then you mix them <pause dur="0.6"/> and then <pause dur="0.2"/> cement is kind of lost in concrete <pause dur="0.7"/> well a building is not lost because you set here <pause dur="0.3"/> it is perhaps used a bit more <pause dur="0.3"/> so <pause dur="0.2"/> we will have to paint it a bit <pause dur="0.6"/> sooner <pause dur="0.5"/> 
okay <pause dur="0.3"/> so remember <pause dur="0.3"/> all construction goods are final goods <pause dur="0.7"/> except maintenance and repair services <pause dur="1.5"/> so final goods are then used as capital goods to produce something else with them <pause dur="2.1"/> but <pause dur="0.5"/> something like sand <pause dur="0.6"/> is used by various sectors for various reasons glass manufacturing uses it <pause dur="0.2"/> in order to make glass <pause dur="0.2"/> we use it to make concrete et cetera et cetera <pause dur="1.2"/> so <pause dur="0.3"/> if we look at any one sector <pause dur="0.3"/> we will see <pause dur="0.2"/> by row <pause dur="0.6"/> the output of that sector and we will see where pieces of it are would actually go <pause dur="0.2"/> in the production <pause dur="0.9"/> or 
in the industrial scheme in which everybody uses a little bit of something to make something else <pause dur="1.1"/> if you are making a car you need a little bit of steel you need a little bit of this and that <pause dur="0.4"/> and then you <pause dur="0.4"/> put all of that into a car <pause dur="0.3"/> you assemble <pause dur="0.9"/> construction is an assembly industry <pause dur="0.4"/> and if you look into all the inputs into construction so this is output <pause dur="0.3"/> these are all the inputs into construction <pause dur="0.3"/> you will see which sectors <pause dur="0.2"/> the construction sector buys from <pause dur="0.6"/> it buys from agriculture <pause dur="0.2"/> for example <pause dur="0.2"/> materials for roofing <pause dur="0.4"/> # in Sri Lanka palm trees or whatever <pause dur="0.6"/> that is purchased directly from <pause dur="0.3"/> agriculture <pause dur="0.4"/> in this country obviously <pause dur="0.3"/> fewer such things are purchased directly from agriculture <pause dur="0.6"/> but they are purchased from various materials producers <pause dur="1.4"/> which purchase <pause dur="0.4"/> the basic materials <pause dur="0.2"/> from those who made them <pause dur="0.3"/> say steel <pause dur="0.9"/> say plastic materials in bulk <pause dur="0.6"/> then you shape all of that into something like this and you sell it <pause dur="0.3"/> to <pause dur="0.2"/> the construction sector <pause dur="0.3"/> to store in a building <pause dur="0.8"/> so 
if you look in a particular column <pause dur="0.4"/> you will find <pause dur="0.2"/> where the construction sector buys its products <pause dur="1.4"/> this way you will say you will see where it sells its products in this particular case <pause dur="0.2"/> maintenance and repair services <pause dur="0.7"/> but by looking <pause dur="0.3"/> at the column you will also see <pause dur="0.4"/> the value added component <pause dur="0.7"/> of so-called primary inputs <pause dur="0.7"/> primarily labour <pause dur="1.4"/> but also many other things <pause dur="0.8"/> capital <pause dur="0.6"/> for example <pause dur="0.8"/> also land <pause dur="0.3"/> because this construction company will need land for <pause dur="0.2"/> its equipment and things like this <pause dur="0.9"/> so <pause dur="0.4"/> primary inputs include a number of different things <pause dur="0.3"/> but primarily <pause dur="0.2"/> labour <pause dur="0.6"/> so if you look at the column <pause dur="0.2"/> that corresponds to the construction sector <pause dur="0.3"/> you will see <pause dur="0.2"/> total input down here <pause dur="0.7"/> then you will see various amounts of primary inputs <pause dur="0.2"/> primarily labour <pause dur="0.4"/> you will see all the other industrial inputs that come from other industries <pause dur="0.6"/> and that would form the global input <pause dur="1.1"/> so <pause dur="0.4"/> a table like this <pause dur="0.5"/> is divided into a number of quadrants <pause dur="0.3"/> the first quadrant <pause dur="0.5"/> shows intersectoral demand <pause dur="0.4"/> how different industries buy from 
each other <pause dur="1.8"/> quadrant two shows buying on demand <pause dur="0.7"/> which is <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> going by row for each sector <pause dur="0.2"/> or each industry <pause dur="0.4"/> but by column it would each would include <pause dur="0.3"/> consumption <pause dur="1.1"/> it would include investment <pause dur="0.5"/> it would include government expenditures government would be buying i don't know <pause dur="0.3"/> # a building to put a tank in <pause dur="1.7"/> or they would buying a <pause dur="0.2"/> building to put some kind of <pause dur="0.3"/> water <trunc>resou</trunc> resources <pause dur="0.2"/> unit <pause dur="0.3"/> which is a part of governmental <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> organization <pause dur="1.3"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> it would also include exports <pause dur="0.2"/> exports of <pause dur="0.2"/> construction <pause dur="0.2"/> services in this case <pause dur="0.3"/> not construction goods <pause dur="0.4"/> this building <pause dur="0.7"/> or any other bulding can never be exported <pause dur="0.3"/> it is here <pause dur="0.2"/> and that's it <pause dur="1.2"/> if a building is demountable <pause dur="0.8"/> the thing that is transported according to national economic accounts is materials <pause dur="1.6"/> the act of tying the building to a particular plot of land is construction <pause dur="2.2"/> okay <pause dur="1.8"/> now <pause dur="0.2"/> in this sector here quadrant tree <pause dur="0.2"/> three you have value added <pause dur="0.7"/> value added <pause dur="0.3"/> there are various primary inputs <pause dur="0.2"/> that go into a production of <unclear>anything</unclear> <pause dur="0.5"/> it will be <pause dur="0.5"/> 
labour <pause dur="0.4"/> capital <pause dur="0.4"/> land <pause dur="0.9"/> but also imports <pause dur="0.6"/> products coming from other countries <pause dur="1.1"/> so we have exports going out and imports coming in <pause dur="1.7"/> finally quadrant four <pause dur="0.2"/> includes something that is called <pause dur="0.4"/> direct <pause dur="0.2"/> factor purchases <pause dur="0.3"/> for example <pause dur="0.4"/> when government employees are paid for their work <pause dur="0.5"/> in the tax office <pause dur="0.3"/> these are <pause dur="0.2"/> direct <pause dur="0.4"/> purchases of their labour services <pause dur="0.2"/> by the government <pause dur="0.5"/> they're not a part of the <pause dur="0.2"/> industrial companies <pause dur="1.8"/> a table like this has many features first of all it is square <pause dur="1.3"/> it is square <pause dur="0.2"/> it has an equal number <pause dur="0.8"/> of columns as rows <pause dur="0.2"/> N <pause dur="0.2"/> for <pause dur="0.3"/> intersectoral demand <pause dur="0.2"/> and M for final use but also M <pause dur="0.2"/> for primary inputs <pause dur="0.6"/> so each input-output table is square <pause dur="1.4"/> second <pause dur="1.3"/> each term down here for example <pause dur="0.5"/> total input of one particular industry <pause dur="0.2"/> must be equal to total output of that industry <pause dur="0.2"/> because profits are included <pause dur="1.1"/> so total output is for example this building there's the total output of a firm in one year <pause dur="2.0"/> let's imagine that the construction firm <pause dur="0.3"/> built it from January first <pause dur="0.5"/> to December thirty-first <pause dur="0.3"/> 
of nineteen-seventy-six when this was built <pause dur="1.2"/> that firm <pause dur="0.7"/> would give this building to the university it would be say one-million <pause dur="1.5"/> the firm will have paid various <pause dur="0.8"/> suppliers of materials and services say <pause dur="0.2"/> nine-hundred-thousand and kept <pause dur="1.2"/> hundred-thousand <pause dur="0.8"/> that profit is accounted in the picture <pause dur="0.3"/> because their profit is <pause dur="0.3"/> renumeration for what the company did <pause dur="1.8"/> so output <pause dur="0.5"/> must always be equal to input <pause dur="0.7"/> and when i add all of this up <pause dur="0.5"/> this sum <pause dur="0.2"/> must be equal to this sum <pause dur="0.5"/> this sum must be equal to this sum <pause dur="0.4"/><vocal desc="cough" iterated="n"/><pause dur="1.5"/> so <pause dur="0.2"/> an input-output table is squared <pause dur="0.3"/> and it's also squared away <pause dur="0.2"/> it is made consistent <pause dur="1.0"/> now <pause dur="0.2"/> you can imagine when national income accounts are collected <pause dur="0.3"/> when numbers are collected by statistical office <pause dur="0.5"/> these figures and these figures don't tally up <pause dur="1.3"/> there are all kinds of mistakes <pause dur="0.3"/> in statistical <pause dur="0.2"/> procedures like this <pause dur="0.7"/> and an input-output table is squared away by various mathematical tricks <pause dur="0.3"/> you say for example <pause dur="0.6"/> i believe more <pause dur="0.9"/> in say input figures <pause dur="0.5"/> in Italy <pause dur="0.3"/> than in output figures <pause dur="0.5"/> 
because everybody is cheating in construction <pause dur="0.9"/> not only in Italy <pause dur="0.3"/> but they're a bit more than in other European countries <pause dur="0.6"/> yeah <pause dur="0.4"/> so <pause dur="0.2"/> if you are building something <pause dur="0.6"/> you get paid in cash <pause dur="0.2"/> do you report the cash of course not <pause dur="1.1"/> many Italian builders especially small builders would never <pause dur="0.2"/> look at <pause dur="0.6"/> the a cheque <pause dur="0.7"/> they're not interested <pause dur="2.9"/> if you are paid only in cash <pause dur="0.2"/> you will clearly report something to the government because it would be suspiscious that you actually lost money all year long <pause dur="0.7"/> so you report something but you report <pause dur="0.3"/> just enough <pause dur="0.2"/> so that you are not suspiscious by comparison with another builder <pause dur="1.0"/> he reported twelve <pause dur="0.2"/> per cent so you report <pause dur="0.5"/> twelve-and-a-half because you're a nice guy <pause dur="2.2"/><vocal desc="laughter" n="ss" iterated="y" dur="1"/> but <pause dur="0.2"/> if you look at inputs of the construction industry you see an enormous amount of paint and <pause dur="0.6"/> bricks and everything you know much much more than output <pause dur="0.3"/> so <pause dur="0.6"/> then you adjust <pause dur="1.5"/> output <pause dur="0.3"/> by the input figures <pause dur="0.4"/> yeah <pause dur="0.5"/> and these are statistical procedures which are not necessarily 
easy <pause dur="2.2"/><kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="6"/> now another table which relates to this whole story <pause dur="2.4"/> it is the same thing <pause dur="0.5"/> but <pause dur="0.2"/> now they're broken up <pause dur="0.4"/> this is the the interindustry point this is quadrant one <pause dur="1.4"/> quadrant one <pause dur="0.7"/> and it says <pause dur="0.3"/> sector I <pause dur="0.7"/> produces some kind of <pause dur="0.5"/> output <pause dur="0.4"/> which is called X-sub-I <pause dur="0.5"/> which stands for output of sector I <pause dur="0.9"/> here is a sector J <pause dur="0.5"/> and here is the <pause dur="0.2"/> total input into sector <pause dur="0.2"/> J <pause dur="0.3"/> which is called X-sub-J <pause dur="2.9"/> here is a flow <pause dur="0.4"/> and that's expressed actually in pounds or yen or dollars <pause dur="0.5"/> between I and J sectors <pause dur="0.4"/> and it's called <pause dur="0.2"/> X-sub-I-J <pause dur="0.6"/> X-sub-I-J <pause dur="0.2"/> that's the flow between two sectors expressed in value </u><gap reason="break in recording" extent="uncertain"/> <u who="nm1108" trans="pause"> 
says sector I <pause dur="1.2"/> sells many things to other sectors <pause dur="0.2"/> sector J means any receiving sector <pause dur="0.7"/> when you add it up <pause dur="0.2"/> that's the total <pause dur="0.3"/> it sells to final demand <pause dur="1.5"/> and the total output is equal to that <pause dur="0.3"/> now <pause dur="0.4"/> going back to Leontief <pause dur="0.2"/> the basic thing that Leontief said <pause dur="0.4"/> which was a revelation in nineteen-thirty-six <pause dur="0.3"/> is that <pause dur="0.2"/> every sector produces not only for final demand <pause dur="0.7"/> but also for other industrial sectors <pause dur="0.3"/> so a large portion of what 
you produce is not visible <pause dur="1.2"/> the best example is if you have a <pause dur="0.2"/> pump <pause dur="1.4"/> going down into the earth <pause dur="0.9"/> going to the aquifer <pause dur="1.1"/> where water is <pause dur="1.1"/> and you start doing this <pause dur="0.5"/> and all of a sudden water starts coming up <pause dur="0.2"/> and you want one glass of water <pause dur="0.7"/> you got one glass but the whole pipe is full <pause dur="1.7"/> for you to get one car <pause dur="0.5"/> millions of cars must be on the line for that car to come out <pause dur="0.9"/> so an enormous amount of stuff is always elsewhere being produced <pause dur="0.4"/> being mixed in some fashion <pause dur="0.4"/> we make something we sell it to these guys <pause dur="0.4"/> they do something to it <pause dur="0.3"/> add something to it <pause dur="0.3"/> and then <pause dur="0.2"/> they sell it to another guy <pause dur="0.3"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> something travels through the national economy for a long time before it finally becomes a car <pause dur="1.1"/> just think about you know <pause dur="0.2"/> dashboard <pause dur="0.3"/> how many things go into a dashboard <pause dur="0.4"/> and there are special manufacturers that make dashboards <pause dur="0.3"/> but that are made from thousands of pieces that come from someplace <pause dur="0.4"/> yeah <pause dur="0.6"/> until they finally come to Mazda <pause dur="0.4"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> the whole thing is slotted into <pause dur="0.3"/> a chassis <pause dur="2.3"/> so we can also say 
that input <pause dur="1.0"/> is like this this is all intermediate inputs <pause dur="0.7"/> X-sub-dot-J simply means that you are summing all of this up <pause dur="0.6"/> but also what you are putting in there is value added <pause dur="0.8"/> primarily labour but here it's sum <pause dur="0.2"/> into one term <pause dur="0.3"/> V-sub-J <pause dur="1.2"/> and then the total input into an industry's called X-sub-J so it says <pause dur="1.3"/> we in making anything buy a lot from other industries <pause dur="0.2"/> but we also buy <pause dur="0.5"/> value added <pause dur="0.3"/> we contribute to national income by doing that by the way <pause dur="1.6"/> every time you hire any primary input like labour <pause dur="0.8"/> you pay wages and salaries <pause dur="1.1"/> for capital you pay interest <pause dur="0.8"/> for land you pay rents <pause dur="0.2"/> these are sources of income <pause dur="0.4"/> so when you add all of this up <pause dur="0.9"/> this by the way <pause dur="1.4"/> when you add all this up is contribution of this sector to national income <pause dur="0.8"/> and this is contribution of this sector to <pause dur="0.5"/> G-N-P <pause dur="0.9"/> to output <pause dur="0.3"/> gross <pause dur="1.2"/> national product <pause dur="1.8"/> and this is what this says <pause dur="0.2"/> it says when i add all of this up <pause dur="0.2"/> it will be called V <pause dur="0.4"/> it will be national income <pause dur="0.3"/> that must be equal to adding all of this up <pause dur="0.5"/> which is called <pause dur="0.9"/> 
gross national product or total output <pause dur="1.7"/> so these are the kinds of things that are <pause dur="0.2"/> there <pause dur="0.3"/> now i don't want to # <pause dur="0.2"/> <event desc="takes off transparency" iterated="n"/> drag you through all of this <pause dur="0.4"/> right now <pause dur="0.2"/> i'll do it some other time it'll be fun <pause dur="0.7"/><vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" dur="1"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> i'm showing you that all of these terms <pause dur="0.5"/> you know have names <pause dur="1.7"/> we'll talk about some of these things <pause dur="0.3"/> but then <pause dur="0.2"/> i can start combining these things i can start forming ratios <pause dur="0.9"/><kinesic desc="puts on transparency" iterated="n"/> which are interesting to study which look like this <pause dur="0.4"/> i can take one term for example X-sub-I-dot <pause dur="0.2"/> divided by Y-<pause dur="0.2"/>sub-I <pause dur="0.3"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> i call that intermediate output to final demand ratio for sector I <pause dur="0.2"/> and i can then plot these things <pause dur="0.3"/> and understand what's happening <pause dur="0.3"/> with a particular <pause dur="0.3"/> sector <pause dur="0.6"/> anyway <pause dur="0.4"/> i'm not going to do that now i'll do it some other time <pause dur="1.4"/><kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="3"/> but please look into this because it's boring to talk about it <pause dur="0.2"/> see it's much better for you to read it <pause dur="0.2"/> and for me to refer to it <pause dur="0.4"/> easier on me easier on you <pause dur="2.3"/> now i'd like to # focus your attention briefly <pause dur="0.6"/> on <pause dur="0.2"/> this <pause dur="0.5"/> series of appendices there are two appendices 
here <pause dur="0.3"/> and i would like you to read them <pause dur="0.7"/> # it was supposed to be read for today but i would still like to <pause dur="0.8"/> point out that this is something that i consider important <pause dur="1.5"/> this is written in so-called matrix notation <pause dur="1.5"/> some of you had some matrix algebra many of you had none <pause dur="0.6"/> but a matrix is basically a table of numbers <pause dur="0.5"/> so <pause dur="0.2"/> a matrix of the kind that you will see in a second <pause dur="0.2"/> which has four numbers <pause dur="0.3"/> has two rows and two columns <pause dur="0.4"/> that <pause dur="0.2"/> thing we call a matrix can be operated on <pause dur="0.3"/> just like you can operate on any standard number <pause dur="0.3"/> which in mathematics is called a scalar <pause dur="0.6"/> a scalar is just a number <pause dur="0.4"/> you can add numbers and so on <pause dur="0.6"/> in matrix algebra you can add matrices <pause dur="0.2"/> you can <pause dur="0.2"/> divide them <pause dur="0.3"/> sort of <pause dur="0.5"/> you can subtract them you can multiply matrices you can operate on them <pause dur="0.4"/> in other words you can operate on tables that look like input-output tables <pause dur="0.5"/> so you can have a table that has <pause dur="0.2"/> five-thousand rows <pause dur="0.3"/> and five-thousand columns but you just write <pause dur="0.2"/> A <pause dur="0.5"/> which means <pause dur="0.4"/> technical coefficient matrix in this case <pause dur="0.2"/> so 
it's wonderfully <pause dur="0.7"/> easy <pause dur="0.4"/> to manipulate things <pause dur="0.2"/> and not drag five-thousand things by five-thousand things around <pause dur="0.2"/> yeah <pause dur="1.0"/> now <pause dur="0.8"/> this is what this says and i'm not going to talk about the second equation but just the first one <pause dur="0.2"/> it basically says that's the basic set of equations <pause dur="0.3"/> that Leontief set up <pause dur="0.3"/> he said <pause dur="0.7"/> output <pause dur="1.1"/> is equal to intermediate output <pause dur="0.8"/> and final demand <pause dur="1.3"/> every <pause dur="0.7"/> economy <pause dur="0.2"/> must produce to satisfy final demand <pause dur="0.2"/> must produce many other things <pause dur="0.9"/> if you dear <pause dur="0.3"/> folks want <pause dur="1.0"/> three cars <pause dur="0.2"/> we'll have to make fifty <pause dur="1.7"/> for the production process to be possible <pause dur="0.2"/> for you to get three cars <pause dur="1.1"/> or if you want three-million <pause dur="0.2"/> well we'll have to make five-million <pause dur="1.2"/> and they will be in process <pause dur="0.3"/> moving toward you <pause dur="0.6"/> obviously if you don't want them any more we have a big problem <pause dur="0.2"/> because there are many things in the pipeline <pause dur="2.4"/> now <pause dur="0.2"/> this is called an output vector <pause dur="0.2"/> and you will see how it looks but it's basically <pause dur="0.4"/> in <pause dur="0.2"/> my simple example just two numbers one on on top of the other <pause dur="0.5"/> this matrix says well <pause dur="0.2"/> technology 
matrix <pause dur="0.3"/> and i'll explain to you <pause dur="0.2"/> # when we meet again <pause dur="0.2"/> or when we start talking about things <pause dur="0.6"/> # in a bit more detail how that matrix is constructed <pause dur="0.7"/> this is as you can see exactly the same vector again <pause dur="1.1"/> and this is the <pause dur="0.3"/> vector of final <pause dur="0.2"/> demand <pause dur="0.4"/> i'll just show you <pause dur="0.3"/> # how that looks in actual numbers <pause dur="0.3"/> to give you a <kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="9"/> feeling of # how this topic will look <pause dur="0.7"/> i have a very simple system <pause dur="2.2"/> in which i have some matrix which i have not introduced yet called Z <pause dur="0.4"/> which simply says or Z in English <pause dur="0.3"/> English <pause dur="0.9"/> # <pause dur="0.9"/> these are all the flows <pause dur="0.2"/> between different <pause dur="0.4"/> sectors of the national economy <pause dur="0.4"/> this is for example flow from industry <pause dur="0.4"/> two <pause dur="0.2"/> to industry <pause dur="0.2"/> one <pause dur="0.5"/> and it's <pause dur="0.3"/> in pounds let's say <pause dur="1.4"/> so this is how it looks <pause dur="1.2"/> this is final demand <pause dur="0.7"/> in pounds again it says <pause dur="0.4"/> people want <pause dur="0.4"/> for one year <pause dur="0.2"/> six-hundred <pause dur="0.2"/> say billion <pause dur="0.5"/> worth of construction goods <pause dur="0.8"/> and they want <pause dur="0.2"/> say <pause dur="0.5"/> fifteen-<pause dur="0.7"/>hundred-<pause dur="0.3"/>billion <pause dur="2.2"/> worth of <pause dur="0.2"/> non-construction goods <pause dur="2.3"/> so that's what that would say <pause dur="0.5"/> this also this is a <pause dur="0.2"/> vector V which <pause dur="0.2"/> is horizontal which says <pause dur="0.9"/> we have for 
purposes of production <pause dur="0.4"/> six-hundred-fifty-billion <pause dur="1.5"/> worth of money to spend on income of people who will be contributing primary inputs to construction <pause dur="0.9"/> primary inputs mainly labour <pause dur="0.8"/> and this is <pause dur="0.3"/> one-thousand-four-hundred-<pause dur="1.1"/>billion pounds worth of primary inputs for <pause dur="0.2"/> all the other <pause dur="0.7"/> sectors of the national economy <pause dur="2.0"/> so # <pause dur="0.3"/> X is in this particular case output <pause dur="1.0"/> and <pause dur="0.4"/> you know output happens to look like this <pause dur="0.2"/> now <pause dur="0.2"/> matrix A <pause dur="0.2"/> as you can see from this is this matrix transformed in a particular way <pause dur="0.4"/> you first add these two numbers <pause dur="0.3"/> and call that X-sub-one <pause dur="0.3"/> that's total input <pause dur="0.5"/> and then you <pause dur="0.2"/> divide that into this and into that <pause dur="0.5"/> sounds complicated but basically <pause dur="0.2"/> this simply becomes a proportion <pause dur="0.3"/> you say out of one pound <pause dur="0.9"/> of total inputs <pause dur="0.6"/> twenty-five P <pause dur="0.6"/> come from here <pause dur="0.4"/> and the rest that's seventy-five P come from there that's basically all <pause dur="0.4"/> it's the simply <pause dur="0.2"/> coefficients that tell you <pause dur="0.3"/> out of one pound <pause dur="0.2"/> or out of hundred per cent <pause dur="0.2"/> how much comes from a particular place <pause dur="1.4"/> so <pause dur="0.2"/> that matrix which is <pause dur="0.2"/> what i just 
explained that means fifteen P this means twenty P <pause dur="1.1"/> this tells you <pause dur="0.6"/> how <pause dur="0.3"/> things are actually mixed in terms of some kind of basic <pause dur="0.5"/> not technology really <pause dur="0.2"/> but <pause dur="0.2"/> basic recipe <pause dur="0.3"/> you know <pause dur="0.2"/> out of <pause dur="0.2"/> one kilo <pause dur="0.2"/> how much is in eggs <pause dur="0.2"/> and how much is in flour <pause dur="2.8"/><kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="5"/> then you do a few more operations which i will not drag you through right now <pause dur="0.5"/> and why this is so et cetera et cetera then you come up with this thingy <pause dur="0.9"/> this is a matrix it has <pause dur="0.5"/> two <pause dur="0.3"/> rows and two columns <pause dur="0.6"/> but this matrix which we have computed in some mirculous way <pause dur="0.6"/> tells us very interesting things <pause dur="0.5"/> for example <pause dur="0.7"/> this number here <pause dur="0.3"/> tells us <pause dur="0.4"/> something <pause dur="0.2"/> miraculous <pause dur="0.2"/> it says <pause dur="0.7"/> if you increase <pause dur="2.3"/> final demand <pause dur="0.2"/> for non-construction goods in this economy <pause dur="0.7"/> by one pound <pause dur="1.0"/> or one-zillion pounds doesn't make any difference but you know one pound <pause dur="2.1"/> the <pause dur="0.4"/> final demand <trunc>wh</trunc> sorry the total output of construction industry will go up by <pause dur="0.3"/> point-twenty-six <pause dur="0.2"/> and so on <pause dur="0.2"/> in other words <pause dur="0.2"/> twenty-six P <pause dur="1.2"/> so even though you didn't want any more new construction <pause dur="0.5"/> by wanting more 
non-construction goods <pause dur="0.2"/> construction goods will be required <pause dur="0.3"/> because <pause dur="0.2"/> these guys that make different things <pause dur="0.2"/> will have to be selling to each other and they will have to be building new plants and things like this and that would involve construction <pause dur="0.2"/> so even if you don't want any construction goods <pause dur="0.2"/> you will get them <pause dur="0.3"/> because construction goods are involved in production of other goods <pause dur="0.8"/> yeah <pause dur="0.6"/> but this is the literal meaning of this <pause dur="0.7"/> if you increase final demand <pause dur="0.3"/> of good two <pause dur="1.1"/> by one pound <pause dur="1.1"/> the output <pause dur="0.4"/> of good one in this economy will go up by <pause dur="0.2"/> twenty-six P <pause dur="0.2"/> even though you don't want it <pause dur="0.2"/> but this is what will happen because things are mixed in that way <pause dur="0.5"/> so this is <pause dur="1.0"/> in economic parlance <pause dur="0.2"/> the sensitivity of output of one industry <pause dur="0.2"/> to changes in final demand <pause dur="1.4"/> of another industry <pause dur="1.5"/> yeah <pause dur="0.5"/> that's what input-output is about so that table <pause dur="0.2"/> is an interesting table it tells us something interesting about <pause dur="0.2"/> how different industries are connected <pause dur="1.0"/> amen <pause dur="0.6"/> finished <vocal desc="laughter" n="ss" iterated="y" dur="1"/>
