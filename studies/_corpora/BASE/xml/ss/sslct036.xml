# <pause dur="0.6"/> historical linguistics is well it's deals with <pause dur="0.6"/> language change that's the main thing it's not the history of linguistics <pause dur="0.4"/> although for various reasons it gets sort of intertwined <pause dur="0.5"/> with the with the history of linguistics <pause dur="0.5"/> # the reason <pause dur="0.5"/> being that <pause dur="1.3"/> # the <pause dur="0.3"/> in modern linguistics that i suppose you could think of as being a nineteenth century <pause dur="0.2"/> # phenomenon <pause dur="0.2"/> it dealt with language change <trunc>ex</trunc> almost exclusively <pause dur="0.7"/> and quite a lot of the modern theories <pause dur="0.2"/> of language change <pause dur="0.5"/> have their origins in the nineteenth century <pause dur="0.6"/> and those of you who did <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> our our first year course the F-U-E <pause dur="0.2"/> # will have heard about the regularity hypothesis <pause dur="0.8"/> # and that's something i'm going to be talking about very much more and many of you probably from <pause dur="0.4"/> # Europe have probably covered this in your <pause dur="0.5"/> linguistics courses as well <pause dur="1.0"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> okay now for textbooks # <pause dur="0.4"/> there are there are quite a number <pause dur="0.2"/> there are there are two <pause dur="0.8"/> shall we say mainstream textbooks that i i'd recommend one is by Winfred Lehmann <pause dur="1.4"/> an American <pause dur="0.4"/> # person <pause dur="0.2"/> # 
Routledge Historical Linguistics <pause dur="0.8"/> and the other is <pause dur="0.7"/> by Trask also an American <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> Historical Linguistics <pause dur="0.2"/> and this one is Arnold <pause dur="0.7"/> so this this is a <pause dur="0.3"/> in some ways older although it's been updated and this is from ninety-six i think this one here <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> if you see you can you can see on your handout references to quite a number of of works <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> some of them are <pause dur="1.2"/> # older some are younger <pause dur="2.0"/> so # April McMahon nineteen-ninety-four Understanding Language Change <pause dur="0.9"/> okay this is <pause dur="0.7"/> # good on theory <pause dur="0.2"/> i would say <pause dur="0.2"/> of of language change and it's <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> extremely good read <pause dur="0.4"/> # it's perhaps not <pause dur="0.2"/> a <pause dur="0.4"/> beginners' level <pause dur="0.2"/> book which <pause dur="0.3"/> in some ways these other two <pause dur="0.2"/> are in that they they start from scratch <pause dur="1.0"/> then there's one by Raimo Anttila <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.8"/> a <pause dur="0.4"/> textbook called Introduction to Historical and Comparative Linguistics although it's it's old <trunc>n</trunc> it's quite old # <pause dur="0.5"/> it's still valuable <pause dur="0.8"/> then there's one by Hock <pause dur="0.6"/> # Principles of Historical Lingustics there is there is a nineteen-ninety-<pause dur="0.6"/>five edition or thereabouts <pause dur="0.6"/> # which is 
much more detailed <pause dur="0.3"/> and has loads of information in it <pause dur="0.5"/> and is not a particularly easy read <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> but but it's it's good for reference if you want to find out particular areas of it <pause dur="0.8"/> # Jeffers and Lehiste <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> this is a a a smaller thing Principles and Methods for Historical Linguistics <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> Roger Lass Phonology <pause dur="0.2"/> there is stuff in there on the history of English <pause dur="0.4"/> particularly <pause dur="0.9"/> # April McMahon unaccountably occurs again on the top of the next page <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> but then <pause dur="0.2"/> Peter Mühlhäusler on pidgins and creoles which is something i won't really be covering <pause dur="0.2"/> but it is relevant to you <pause dur="0.7"/> # Barbara Strang The History of English some of you will have come across that previously <pause dur="0.6"/> # a good sort of social and historical <pause dur="0.4"/> accounts of the language <pause dur="0.6"/> and then finally <pause dur="0.3"/> Trudgill <pause dur="0.4"/> Dialects in Contact <pause dur="0.6"/> he brings us up to date in the sense that he is interested in <pause dur="0.4"/> sociolinguistics and also <pause dur="0.3"/> contact phenomena <pause dur="0.8"/> particularly <pause dur="0.7"/> contact within varieties of the same language rather than <pause dur="0.3"/> actual language contact which is not something 
i'll i'll really be talking about all that much <pause dur="1.0"/> okay <pause dur="1.3"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> so <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> you have <pause dur="3.7"/> change that can occur <pause dur="0.3"/> on various linguistic levels the phonetic the phonological <pause dur="0.5"/> morphology lexicon syntax semantics all these are areas of language that can change that are subject to <pause dur="0.3"/> modification <pause dur="0.6"/> through <pause dur="0.5"/> cultural <pause dur="0.3"/> pressures perhaps if you can think of in fairly obvious <pause dur="0.4"/> terms <pause dur="0.9"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> lexical change <pause dur="0.7"/> # languages <pause dur="0.3"/> borrow very heavily from each other <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> the <pause dur="0.3"/> donor language the language that <pause dur="0.7"/> gives the words is often the culturally or <pause dur="0.4"/> economically <pause dur="0.3"/> dominant one and today that is probably English i suppose worldwide <pause dur="1.0"/> # although English <pause dur="0.3"/> as many of you will know has been the recipient of <pause dur="0.4"/> huge numbers of words <pause dur="0.3"/> from <pause dur="0.3"/> French and Latin <pause dur="0.7"/> and lesser extent from from Scandinavian so <pause dur="0.4"/> so while English has absorbed <pause dur="0.2"/> absorbed vocabulary it has now <pause dur="0.2"/> the position has now reversed in the last hundred years or so <pause dur="0.4"/> that it that it's # supplies the words <pause dur="1.4"/> and there's a lot of neologism all right <pause dur="0.2"/> coinage of new words <pause dur="0.2"/> takes place as 
well <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> in in the <pause dur="0.3"/> in the sciences in <trunc>a</trunc> anything technical <pause dur="0.2"/> at all <pause dur="1.2"/> and a lot of since since American technology seems to be in the in the lead <pause dur="0.7"/> # a lot of the words are coined in America and then <trunc>trans</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> transmitted <pause dur="0.2"/> to the rest of us <pause dur="2.2"/> # but that is the most tangible <pause dur="0.4"/> that's the sort of thing that people write to the <pause dur="0.6"/> newspaper editors about <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="1.0"/> but there's <pause dur="0.4"/> phonetic change as well <pause dur="0.8"/> okay there are there are <pause dur="0.3"/> there are small <pause dur="0.3"/> or <pause dur="0.2"/> greater <pause dur="0.2"/> changes in pronunciation <pause dur="0.8"/> # that <pause dur="0.3"/> take <pause dur="0.4"/> place over a period of time <pause dur="0.8"/> the motivations for these are not obviously cultural <pause dur="0.8"/> so if i start saying <pause dur="0.3"/> if i start changing my vowel <pause dur="0.8"/> in <pause dur="0.5"/> <distinct type="sampa">[Tru:]</distinct> to <distinct type="sampa">[Tr}]</distinct> <pause dur="0.7"/> to <distinct type="sampa">[TrY]</distinct> or something like that which many English people do <pause dur="0.5"/> then that is not <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.8"/> because of the # <pause dur="0.4"/> decline in the <pause dur="0.2"/> industries in the north of England <pause dur="0.7"/> or anything like that <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> the <trunc>c</trunc> you can't really find an obvious motivation for the <pause dur="0.2"/> the fronting of a vowel shall we say <pause dur="0.9"/> nor can you find any sort of obvious <pause dur="0.4"/> external motivation for the <pause dur="0.2"/> the loss of some 
confonant consonant so for example <pause dur="0.8"/> a word like through <pause dur="0.3"/> once had a <distinct type="sampa">[X@]</distinct> sound at the end of it about six or seven-hundred years ago that dropped out <pause dur="0.6"/> now you can't say that was # <pause dur="1.1"/> because of the <pause dur="0.4"/> decline of the feudal system or something like that <pause dur="0.7"/> okay <pause dur="0.4"/> but if you look at all the French words that came in <pause dur="0.8"/> <unclear>that's</unclear> five or six-hundred years ago <pause dur="0.4"/> then there are obvious cultural <pause dur="0.2"/> influences going on there <pause dur="1.3"/> right <pause dur="1.0"/> # <pause dur="1.5"/> one thing that historical linguistics shows us the study of language change shows us is <pause dur="0.5"/> that <pause dur="0.4"/> these linguistic levels i've mentioned phonetics phonology morphology lexicon syntax semantics <pause dur="0.4"/> are in some way interdependent <pause dur="0.9"/> all right <pause dur="0.7"/> there's been a tendency <pause dur="0.8"/> to treat each of these levels as separate <pause dur="0.6"/> and that's reflected in the courses that you're taking you you take a course in phonetics another one in phonology <pause dur="0.5"/> sometimes the lecturers don't even bother to point out the similarities although i hope they do <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> certainly then you get you go and listen to someone else 
talking about syntax and <unclear>it's a</unclear> like another world from phonology <pause dur="1.1"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> likewise you get a lecture on morphology <pause dur="0.6"/> which is doesn't appear to be related to syntax which in <trunc>s</trunc> many ways it obviously is <pause dur="1.1"/> # <vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.8"/> and so on now one of the things that you find in language change is that <pause dur="0.5"/> # these levels are <pause dur="0.3"/> they clearly influence each other and particular items can pass from one level to another level <pause dur="0.8"/> and i'll i'll show you some examples and particularly <pause dur="0.2"/> particularly in regard to phonetics phonology and perhaps morphology as well <pause dur="1.6"/> right <pause dur="0.2"/> okay <pause dur="0.2"/> so in terms of your handout # <pause dur="0.8"/> we are on page two <pause dur="0.7"/> right that's the first sheet page two # two-thirds of the way down where it says studying language change interdependence of linguistic levels that's where we are located <pause dur="0.7"/> # right now <pause dur="0.6"/> okay i'm going to give you a <unclear>new</unclear> you an example from <pause dur="0.6"/> Ancient Greek <pause dur="1.0"/> of this <pause dur="0.3"/> fluidity of linguistic levels if you like <pause dur="3.8"/> now then <pause dur="0.7"/> first of all bit of a struggle over here <pause dur="2.8"/> right <pause dur="0.2"/> okay <pause dur="0.3"/> now <pause dur="1.3"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> there was 
in at some point in Ancient Greek <pause dur="0.5"/> a sound change <pause dur="0.7"/> whereby <pause dur="0.4"/> and i'm going to use sort of <pause dur="0.6"/> phonological notation if you like <pause dur="0.7"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="7"/> S goes to nothing <pause dur="1.8"/> # in environment <pause dur="0.3"/> between vowels <pause dur="1.0"/> right if you're <trunc>f</trunc> you're <pause dur="0.5"/> familiar with that kind of notation <pause dur="0.2"/> all right S goes to nothing <pause dur="0.8"/> between vowels <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="1.1"/> how do we know that <pause dur="0.3"/> well we use something called the comparative method <pause dur="2.8"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="6"/> which i'll be mentioning a bit later on <pause dur="2.2"/> # and we look at languages that <pause dur="0.2"/> we know to be <pause dur="0.5"/> historically related in some way <pause dur="1.1"/> # <pause dur="1.5"/> historically related in that they have a common origin and i want come back to those common origins a bit later but just take it on trust that this is what we believe <pause dur="0.9"/> right there is a <pause dur="1.8"/> # <pause dur="1.0"/> Greek word <pause dur="1.5"/> Ancient Greek word <pause dur="1.1"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="3"/> <distinct lang="grc">geneos</distinct> <pause dur="1.7"/> okay and this meant this is the genitive <pause dur="0.2"/> case <pause dur="0.9"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="6"/> possessive case of a word meaning kind <pause dur="1.1"/> a kind of something <pause dur="0.9"/> right <pause dur="0.3"/> a noun <pause dur="0.9"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> now there is a a Sanskrit <pause dur="0.6"/> equivalent <pause dur="0.8"/> okay that's <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="3"/> Greek <pause dur="1.3"/> Sanskrit <pause dur="1.1"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> the <pause dur="0.3"/> liturgical language of India from about three-thousand years ago <pause dur="1.0"/> # <pause dur="1.0"/> word meaning exactly the same <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="5"/> 
thing <pause dur="0.3"/> is like this <pause dur="3.9"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> <distinct lang="sa">janasas</distinct> i don't know how you pronounce it <distinct lang="sa" type="sampa">[dZ{n{s{s]</distinct> or something like that <pause dur="1.0"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> there is a Latin <pause dur="0.6"/> word <pause dur="2.6"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> two-thousand years ago <pause dur="2.0"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="4"/> have exactly the same <pause dur="0.4"/> meaning and function <pause dur="2.0"/> <distinct lang="la">generis</distinct> <pause dur="1.7"/> <distinct lang="la">generis</distinct> okay <pause dur="1.0"/> now what you see is that <pause dur="0.6"/> there is some kind of consonant here <pause dur="0.7"/><kinesic desc="indicates point on board" iterated="n"/> and here <pause dur="0.2"/><kinesic desc="indicates point on board" iterated="n"/> there's a <distinct type="sampa">[r]</distinct> and there's a <distinct type="sampa">[s]</distinct> <pause dur="0.6"/> but in Greek there is nothing <pause dur="0.7"/> okay <pause dur="0.7"/> nothing at all <pause dur="1.1"/> so and this we think is because of this # sound change that # took took took place at some <pause dur="0.3"/> early stage of Greek <pause dur="0.9"/> right <pause dur="1.1"/> 
now what you find however <pause dur="2.9"/> okay <trunc>th</trunc> these are the initial facts of the <pause dur="0.9"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> <trunc>th</trunc> then comes the however <pause dur="0.9"/> there is in Ancient Greek <pause dur="0.9"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="5"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> a verb <pause dur="1.6"/> <distinct lang="grc">luo</distinct> <pause dur="1.3"/> <trunc>lu</trunc> i don't know how to pronounce it but <pause dur="0.2"/> # <distinct lang="grc">luo</distinct> <pause dur="0.4"/> and it means <pause dur="0.2"/> loosen <pause dur="0.5"/> to loosen something <pause dur="1.0"/> # there is another verb <pause dur="2.5"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="4"/> <distinct lang="grc"> timao</distinct> <pause dur="0.9"/> something like that <pause dur="0.9"/> to <pause dur="0.5"/> esteem or to hold <trunc>s</trunc> to hold something in in awe or honour or something like that <pause dur="0.5"/> <distinct lang="grc">timao</distinct> <pause dur="0.9"/> these had <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> aorist moods <pause dur="1.3"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="3"/> i'm not entirely sure what this means but anyway aorist it's a kind of tense <pause dur="1.4"/> which took the following forms <pause dur="1.3"/> for <pause dur="0.3"/> <distinct lang="grc">luo</distinct><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="3"/> it was <pause dur="1.1"/> <distinct lang="grc">elusa</distinct> <pause dur="1.2"/> and for the other the other <trunc>w</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> verb it was <pause dur="0.9"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="4"/> <trunc>etimef</trunc> <trunc>e</trunc> # <distinct lang="grc">etimesa</distinct> <pause dur="0.2"/> like this <pause dur="2.1"/> right <pause dur="0.7"/> now what you notice there is that there is an S <pause dur="1.2"/> between <pause dur="0.2"/> vowels <pause dur="1.3"/> but that shouldn't happen <pause dur="0.4"/> right if this <pause dur="0.7"/> sound change is is correct <pause dur="1.3"/> so what we have to say is we have to 
try and explain this <pause dur="0.7"/> one thing you can say is to say well <pause dur="0.4"/> sound change isn't regular <pause dur="1.3"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> that's something i'll be coming back to the idea of regularity of sound change but the idea of regularity is <pause dur="0.5"/> that <pause dur="0.2"/> given a phonological environment like consonant <pause dur="0.3"/> between two vowels <pause dur="0.7"/> a change will always happen in a given language <pause dur="0.3"/> okay that's what's meant by regularity <pause dur="1.4"/> right <pause dur="0.6"/> now <pause dur="0.2"/> it didn't happen here <pause dur="2.2"/><kinesic desc="indicates point on board" iterated="n"/> it didn't happen here so this is a <pause dur="0.3"/> sign of irregularity <pause dur="0.6"/> but this is not a random matter <pause dur="0.5"/> it is because we believe <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> the S became a an aorist tense marker <pause dur="1.2"/> it then shifted to become part of the morphology <pause dur="0.6"/> of the language <pause dur="1.3"/> right <pause dur="0.9"/> you follow that <pause dur="1.0"/> so this is an example of what i mean by the interdependence of levels <pause dur="1.5"/> okay so that's the point i want to make <pause dur="1.2"/> # <vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.8"/> i'm now going to move on to the relationship <pause dur="0.3"/> between <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> phonology and phonetics <pause dur="0.9"/> and this then is <pause dur="1.2"/> # another example coming up now <pause dur="0.3"/> and # <pause dur="1.5"/> okay one thing <trunc>i</trunc> i'll be talking about from time to time is velar <pause dur="0.3"/> fronting <pause dur="1.0"/> okay velar fronting <pause dur="1.1"/> this 
is the process whereby velar consonants like <distinct type="sampa">[k]</distinct> and <distinct type="sampa">[g]</distinct> <pause dur="1.3"/> are <pause dur="0.9"/> fronted in the mouth <pause dur="0.4"/> so that you get a palatal sound perhaps like <pause dur="1.0"/> <distinct type="sampa">[k']</distinct> <pause dur="0.2"/> and <distinct type="sampa">[g']</distinct> <pause dur="1.1"/> slightly palatalized or even <pause dur="0.8"/> palatoalveolar like <distinct type="sampa">[tS]</distinct> <pause dur="0.2"/> something of that sort <pause dur="0.8"/> you you find it may be appearing as a <distinct type="sampa">[s]</distinct> <pause dur="0.9"/> anyway <pause dur="0.6"/> now <pause dur="1.3"/> in English there are two words one word is core <pause dur="0.5"/> another word is key <pause dur="1.2"/> and <pause dur="0.3"/> the <distinct type="sampa">[k]</distinct> sound in those two words <pause dur="0.5"/> core and key <pause dur="0.5"/> if you just mouth them to yourself quietly you can feel that they're very different <pause dur="0.3"/> okay <pause dur="0.2"/> <distinct type="sampa">[k]</distinct> <pause dur="0.5"/> isn't like <distinct type="sampa">[k_-]</distinct> <pause dur="0.3"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> <distinct type="sampa">[k_+]</distinct> <pause dur="1.2"/> <distinct type="sampa">[k_-]</distinct> <pause dur="0.3"/> <distinct type="sampa">[k_+]</distinct> you can hear the difference 
and you can feel the difference <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> this is because of a coarticulation effect with the following front vowel <pause dur="0.2"/> high front vowel <distinct type="sampa">[i]</distinct> <pause dur="0.3"/> okay <pause dur="0.4"/> which you can think of as a <pause dur="1.3"/> you could think of it as a palatal vowel i mean it's not a correct <pause dur="0.3"/> description <pause dur="0.4"/> but it's very close to the palatal consonant <pause dur="0.3"/> <distinct type="sampa">[j]</distinct> <pause dur="0.7"/> right and it's not very far from <distinct type="sampa">[j]</distinct> to <distinct type="sampa">[J\]</distinct> <pause dur="0.6"/> which is an a a palatal <pause dur="0.2"/> stop <pause dur="1.2"/> so # <pause dur="0.5"/> okay this is something that is in our mouths all the time <pause dur="0.2"/> when we speak English and when we speak other languages <pause dur="0.7"/> # it's an entirely natural tendency <pause dur="0.4"/> but <pause dur="1.2"/> in some languages <pause dur="0.5"/> this <pause dur="0.6"/> gets accentuated somehow it's as if speakers <pause dur="0.5"/> start noticing it <pause dur="0.6"/> overtly <pause dur="1.3"/> consciously <pause dur="0.8"/> and <pause dur="0.3"/> they <pause dur="1.2"/> start believing well it is incorrect not to do this <pause dur="0.9"/> and those speakers over there in that other community this is where sociolinguistics comes in <pause dur="0.8"/> those people over there they don't really front their 
<distinct type="sampa">[k]</distinct> sounds all that much <pause dur="0.2"/> in the environment of a high front vowel they say to themselves <pause dur="0.4"/> well <pause dur="0.2"/> they don't say that to themselves <pause dur="0.2"/> but they <pause dur="0.8"/> they say well those people over there they i mean <pause dur="1.7"/> we say <pause dur="0.3"/> <distinct type="sampa">[k'i]</distinct> <pause dur="1.2"/> but they just say <distinct type="sampa">[ki]</distinct> <pause dur="1.0"/> # so we're <pause dur="0.2"/> better than them so let's just start <trunc>exa</trunc> exaggerating this <distinct type="sampa">[k'i]</distinct><pause dur="0.3"/> thing <pause dur="0.7"/> this sort of fronting of the <distinct type="sampa">[k]</distinct> <pause dur="0.9"/> and the lot in the other in the other village so they say <trunc>d</trunc>  you know those lot # # people over there they they say <distinct type="sampa">[tsi]</distinct> <pause dur="0.5"/> for <distinct type="sampa">[ki]</distinct> <pause dur="0.4"/> how ridiculous <pause dur="1.1"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> crazy way of pronouncing it <pause dur="0.4"/> <trunc>we</trunc> we're going to stick with <distinct type="sampa">[ki]</distinct> <pause dur="1.0"/> right <pause dur="0.2"/> in our village over here <pause dur="0.7"/> however that village over there is a big village and the one where you're in one well you only say <distinct type="sampa">[ki]</distinct> is a little 
village so then you start <pause dur="0.7"/> assimilating this 'cause it's regarded as a really good way <pause dur="0.4"/> a really wonderful great way of saying key to say <distinct type="sampa">[k'i]</distinct> <pause dur="0.5"/> okay <pause dur="1.4"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> nothing has changed at this point <unclear>it's</unclear> just that there's an allophone <pause dur="0.3"/> of <pause dur="0.2"/> <distinct type="sampa">[k]</distinct> <pause dur="0.7"/> that is <pause dur="0.2"/> <distinct type="sampa">[k']</distinct> <pause dur="0.8"/> before a high front vowel <pause dur="0.4"/> allophones yes <pause dur="2.4"/> yeah <pause dur="0.2"/> right and then if you <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/><pause dur="0.4"/> nods of recognition which i don't always get when i say allophone i get <pause dur="0.9"/> anyway <pause dur="0.2"/> good <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="1.0"/> you have just taken an exam in phonetics and phonology i think though some of you are second years <pause dur="0.9"/> # <pause dur="1.0"/> now <pause dur="1.1"/> the question is is this phonetics or phonology <pause dur="1.0"/> well <pause dur="1.1"/> once there is very obviously an allophone <pause dur="0.4"/> that is fronted <pause dur="0.5"/> more than would be <pause dur="0.3"/> predicted by coarticulation then you're dealing with phonology <pause dur="1.0"/> in some way <pause dur="1.0"/> # <pause dur="1.3"/> now <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="1.5"/> let just # <pause dur="0.7"/> think how this okay <pause dur="0.5"/> okay so let's let's say you got one community that's started saying <distinct type="sampa">[tSi]</distinct> <pause dur="0.5"/> okay it is it gone the 
whole hog actually and is producing a <trunc>f</trunc> proper <distinct type="sampa">[tS]</distinct> sound <distinct type="sampa">[tSi]</distinct> <pause dur="0.6"/> it's still an allophone <pause dur="0.8"/> it's not possible to say <distinct type="sampa">[ki]</distinct> in this dialect we're talking about <pause dur="0.5"/> you have to say <distinct type="sampa">[tSi]</distinct> <pause dur="0.8"/> it's a bit like the Japanese <pause dur="0.6"/> who <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="1.5"/> have <pause dur="1.6"/> this sound here <pause dur="0.8"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="2"/> this phoneme <pause dur="0.2"/> <distinct type="sampa">[s]</distinct> <pause dur="0.7"/> which is <distinct type="sampa">[s]</distinct> in all environments except before <pause dur="0.2"/> a high front vowel <pause dur="0.5"/> where the <distinct type="sampa">[s]</distinct> becomes <pause dur="0.6"/> <distinct type="sampa">[S]</distinct> <pause dur="0.8"/> all right <pause dur="0.8"/> so that you see <pause dur="0.2"/> i mean i've just been reading <pause dur="1.4"/> about # a Japanese dialectologist <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="3"/> who spells his name like that <pause dur="1.1"/> right that's pronounced <distinct lang="ja" type="sampa">[SIb{t{]</distinct> <pause dur="1.2"/> right not <distinct lang="ja" type="sampa">[sIb{t{]</distinct> but <distinct lang="ja" type="sampa">[SIb{t{]</distinct> <pause dur="1.7"/> # <pause dur="0.8"/> because of this high front vowel <pause dur="1.3"/> now it's not 
possible for Japanese to say <distinct lang="ja" type="sampa">[sIb{t{]</distinct> <pause dur="1.5"/> so when the Japanese are saying sit they have to be careful in English <pause dur="0.2"/> all right <pause dur="3.2"/><vocal desc="laughter" n="ss" iterated="y" dur="1"/> so that's an a a strictly allophonic <pause dur="0.2"/> effect <pause dur="1.6"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> now <pause dur="0.3"/> let's say <pause dur="0.7"/> we have these speakers who say <distinct type="sampa">[tSi]</distinct> <pause dur="0.4"/> for key <pause dur="0.7"/> and # <pause dur="0.3"/> and then suddenly <trunc>c</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> <trunc>s</trunc> somebody comes along with <pause dur="0.8"/> a new word # <pause dur="1.5"/> let's say <pause dur="0.2"/> just invent a new completely new word right <pause dur="0.5"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="2"/> this is it here <pause dur="1.9"/> and this this means a kind of pot of some kind okay it's entirely <pause dur="0.3"/> it i invented it just now a kind of pot <pause dur="0.7"/> # <distinct type="sampa">[kim]</distinct> <pause dur="1.1"/> and it's a cultural loan from some other language <pause dur="0.7"/> so <pause dur="0.2"/> in the <distinct type="sampa">[tSi]</distinct> village <pause dur="0.6"/> people don't say <distinct type="sampa">[tSim]</distinct> <pause dur="0.2"/> they say <distinct type="sampa">[kim]</distinct> because that's the correct way of pronouncing it <pause dur="2.0"/> so you <trunc>no</trunc> you notice what's happened suddenly <pause dur="2.3"/> <distinct type="sampa">[tS]</distinct> 
and <distinct type="sampa">[k]</distinct> have become <pause dur="0.2"/> phonemes <pause dur="1.3"/> because they can appear in the same phonological environment <pause dur="0.3"/> in other words <pause dur="1.0"/> # they can <trunc>inf</trunc> occur <pause dur="0.2"/> before a high front vowel <pause dur="1.1"/> in this hypothetical <pause dur="0.3"/> entirely <trunc>hypoth</trunc> hypothetical case <pause dur="1.3"/> now then # <pause dur="0.2"/> # do you follow what i'm i'm saying it's been phonologized <pause dur="0.9"/> this is how the <trunc>ph</trunc> the the phoneme <pause dur="0.4"/> <distinct type="sampa">[tS]</distinct> in English actually came about not with this word here <pause dur="0.2"/> but <pause dur="0.6"/> in various other ways <pause dur="1.0"/> # <pause dur="1.0"/> okay i can show you <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.8"/> there was in Old English <pause dur="0.4"/><vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/><pause dur="7.7"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> a word that was spelled like this <pause dur="2.9"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="3"/> that's that's how it was written and this is how it was pronounced # <pause dur="3.4"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="4"/> and i'll say it <pause dur="1.1"/> okay <pause dur="0.3"/> <distinct lang="oe">cirice</distinct> <pause dur="0.9"/> <distinct lang="oe">cirice</distinct> and it meant church <pause dur="1.0"/> which is the <pause dur="0.7"/> direct antecedent of our word church <pause dur="1.2"/> this was already in the Old English period we're dealing with <pause dur="0.9"/> fifteen-hundred years ago not quite <pause dur="0.5"/> twelve thirteen-hundred years ago <pause dur="0.2"/> it was it was already 
pronounced like that <pause dur="0.8"/> now then there was a particular <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> Norse invasion <pause dur="1.2"/> into the the north you know east of England and parts of Scotland <pause dur="1.0"/> and these Scandinavians came from Denmark and Norway <pause dur="0.9"/> and they introduced <pause dur="0.4"/> a word which they pronounced well this <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="3"/> is the <pause dur="1.3"/> this is one pronounciation of it <pause dur="1.5"/> kirkia <pause dur="0.6"/> okay <pause dur="0.3"/> kirkia <pause dur="0.3"/> they <pause dur="0.2"/> they they said <pause dur="1.0"/> this word <pause dur="0.2"/> ends up as the Scots word <pause dur="0.5"/> <distinct lang="sco">kirk</distinct> <pause dur="3.7"/> <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="3"/> all right which is the name of the Scottish church the <distinct lang="sco">kirk</distinct> <pause dur="0.4"/> right <pause dur="1.3"/> and you'll notice <pause dur="0.2"/> that <pause dur="0.2"/> it's not church it's <distinct lang="sco">kirk</distinct> <pause dur="0.5"/> so they retained the <trunc>ol</trunc> the old Norse the old Scandinavian <pause dur="1.1"/> velar sounds here <pause dur="2.1"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="2"/> okay <pause dur="0.2"/> <distinct lang="sco">kirk</distinct> and that remained <pause dur="0.4"/> forever <pause dur="1.0"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> there is a <pause dur="0.2"/> an English word keel <pause dur="2.4"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="2"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> the bottom bit of a boat <pause dur="1.9"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> that is a Norse word as well <pause dur="0.7"/> the hard <distinct type="sampa">[k]</distinct> <pause dur="1.2"/> now those of you who are Scandinavian who <trunc>m</trunc> in here might say but <pause dur="0.5"/> Norwegians they don't have a hard <distinct type="sampa">[k]</distinct> in these words they have a <pause dur="0.2"/> a soft <distinct type="sampa">[k]</distinct> <pause dur="1.2"/> 
they say <pause dur="0.6"/> well they say <distinct lang="no" type="sampa">[tSVrLtS{]</distinct> <pause dur="0.4"/> something for this and they say <pause dur="0.3"/> <distinct lang="no" type="sampa">[tS3rl]</distinct> for this <pause dur="0.9"/> but that's because <pause dur="0.3"/> in the years after the Viking invasions <pause dur="0.6"/> Norwegian <pause dur="0.5"/> underwent a sound change whereby <pause dur="1.5"/> the same palatalization occurred but entirely separately and much later <pause dur="0.9"/> in in middle Norwegian in some you know in the <pause dur="0.7"/> thirteenth century or fourteenth century or something like that hundreds of years after the Viking <pause dur="0.4"/> # the Vikings <pause dur="0.5"/> so that's why Norwegians say <pause dur="1.1"/> well depending what dialect you speak whether it's something like <distinct lang="no" type="sampa">[tS3rl]</distinct> for this and <pause dur="0.8"/> <distinct lang="no" type="sampa">[tSVrLtS{]</distinct> for this <pause dur="0.8"/> all right <pause dur="0.5"/> but at the time when the Viking invasions took place they had <pause dur="0.2"/> a <distinct type="sampa">[k]</distinct> <pause dur="0.2"/> in these words <pause dur="0.7"/> right <pause dur="0.6"/> okay <pause dur="0.2"/> so <pause dur="0.7"/> when this kind of thing happened then <distinct type="sampa">[tS]</distinct> and <distinct type="sampa">[k]</distinct> <pause dur="0.2"/> 
became separate phonemes in in English <pause dur="1.0"/> okay right <pause dur="5.3"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> there are other examples of this # <pause dur="1.2"/> it's a because it's such a natural change # there was a Latin word <distinct lang="la" type="sampa">[amiko]</distinct> which meant friend and the plural <distinct lang="la" type="sampa">[amiki]</distinct> <pause dur="1.1"/> # which meant friends and that ends up in <trunc>mo</trunc> modern Italian as <distinct lang="it" type="sampa">[amiko]</distinct> that's the same <pause dur="0.3"/> but <distinct lang="it" type="sampa">[amitSi]</distinct> <pause dur="1.5"/> right <pause dur="1.6"/> 
so a similar kind of thing happened in in well in <trunc>v</trunc> a very long time ago in early Latin <pause dur="1.0"/> # <pause dur="0.8"/> right <pause dur="0.8"/> okay how does this transition happen <pause dur="0.5"/> then okay so we've got this this thing moving from <pause dur="0.4"/> one <pause dur="0.6"/> area <pause dur="0.3"/> to another area <pause dur="0.2"/> another level if you like <pause dur="0.5"/> well # <pause dur="3.2"/> why do languages change at all why i mean why did this patalization occur when it did why didn't it occur before <pause dur="1.3"/> why didn't it occur later <pause dur="0.9"/> well <pause dur="0.4"/> these are <pause dur="0.2"/> unanswerable questions they're not answerable <pause dur="0.2"/> in relation to <pause dur="0.7"/> linguistic structure <pause dur="1.2"/> all right <pause dur="1.0"/> because <pause dur="1.0"/> of social factors <pause dur="0.3"/> something out <pause dur="0.3"/> external <pause dur="0.2"/> to the language historical linguists are very <pause dur="0.3"/> exercised by what <pause dur="1.0"/> constitutes internal motivations for language change <pause dur="0.5"/> structural motivations if you like <pause dur="0.3"/> whether there's a a tension in the system somewhere <pause dur="1.2"/> on the one hand and external <pause dur="0.2"/> reasons on the 
other hand <pause dur="0.5"/> namely to do with <pause dur="1.0"/> well <pause dur="0.6"/> sociolinguistic factors <pause dur="0.9"/> right there is a <pause dur="0.7"/> there's <pause dur="1.0"/> there's language contact maybe speakers of different languages come together there's <pause dur="0.4"/> dialect contact speakers of of different dialects coming together <pause dur="0.9"/> # <pause dur="0.9"/> there is a sense in which all of a sudden some particular sound becomes stigmatized <pause dur="1.0"/> becomes <pause dur="0.2"/> bad <pause dur="0.8"/> or it becomes favoured for some reason <pause dur="0.8"/> and then <pause dur="0.2"/> the <trunc>t</trunc> the change happens <pause dur="0.7"/> sometimes changes are <pause dur="0.4"/> entirely natural like the thing i'm talking about here <pause dur="0.8"/> # sometimes you can't really <pause dur="0.2"/> say whether they're they're natural like a vowel <pause dur="0.3"/> becoming <trunc>l</trunc> <pause dur="0.7"/> <distinct type="sampa">[E]</distinct> going to <distinct type="sampa">[E_o]</distinct> <pause dur="0.2"/> i mean there's nothing natural about that <pause dur="0.8"/> and <distinct type="sampa">[E]</distinct> goes to <distinct type="sampa">[E_r]</distinct> just as often <pause dur="0.6"/> <trunc>j</trunc> you get a lowering and and raising of vowels and sometimes <pause dur="1.1"/> if you take <pause dur="0.6"/> the English <distinct type="sampa">[{]</distinct> <pause dur="0.2"/> vowel <pause dur="0.3"/> English A vowel <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> and trace that over 
the last hundred years in the south of England you'll see that it goes like a yo-yo <pause dur="0.8"/> from a <pause dur="0.6"/> something like <pause dur="0.3"/> <distinct type="sampa">[m{n]</distinct> <pause dur="0.4"/> to <distinct type="sampa">[man]</distinct> <pause dur="0.2"/> to <distinct type="sampa">[mAn]</distinct> to <distinct type="sampa">[mEn]</distinct> and back to <distinct type="sampa">[m{n]</distinct> <pause dur="0.7"/> it goes up and down <pause dur="1.1"/> for no apparent reason other than well <pause dur="0.2"/> i mean social reasons every every time somebody says something different <pause dur="0.8"/> some # some <pause dur="0.2"/> something is # <pause dur="0.2"/> some sociolinguistic # <pause dur="1.0"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> value is attached to it of some sort <pause dur="1.1"/> right but in general terms <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> if you think about <pause dur="1.1"/> <trunc>sus</trunc> the speech production system and speech perception system <pause dur="1.1"/> # <pause dur="1.9"/> there <pause dur="0.3"/> is a <trunc>t</trunc> a a tension <pause dur="0.6"/> between <pause dur="0.5"/> minimizing what is <pause dur="0.2"/> difficult to pronounce <pause dur="1.2"/> and <pause dur="1.2"/> minimizing the <pause dur="0.2"/> the effort on the part of the listener sort of to distinguish what <pause dur="0.4"/> what's being said <pause dur="1.3"/> so you've got ease of articulation <pause dur="0.8"/> and ease of perception <pause dur="0.4"/> on the other hand <pause dur="1.0"/> so the speaker does <trunc>n</trunc> not have the same interests <pause dur="0.3"/> as the 
listener <pause dur="1.7"/> and there is an intrinsic <pause dur="0.3"/> tension <pause dur="0.2"/> between those two <pause dur="0.4"/> and as you know <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> we <pause dur="0.3"/> often mishear <pause dur="0.3"/> each other <pause dur="0.2"/> and we have to get people to say things again <pause dur="0.5"/> some and when somebody repeats something <pause dur="0.7"/> what they tend to do is to pronounce it more <pause dur="0.2"/> clearly more explicitly <pause dur="1.0"/> so in informal speech it's fine <pause dur="0.2"/> to <pause dur="0.4"/> garble <pause dur="1.3"/> # because it's pretty predictable <trunc>wha</trunc> what we're going to say next anyway <pause dur="0.5"/> in a in an <trunc>i</trunc> typical ingroup situation <pause dur="1.0"/> # when you're reading the news <pause dur="0.5"/> it's not a good idea to garble too much because <pause dur="0.4"/> the listener <pause dur="0.7"/> is being provided with new information <pause dur="0.2"/><vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/><pause dur="1.0"/> and there's no opportunity for the listener to ask <pause dur="0.2"/> the newsreader to repeat himself or herself <pause dur="1.3"/> okay <pause dur="0.7"/> so <pause dur="1.1"/> anyway <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.8"/> in terms of the speaker the easiest thing in the world would be just to abandon <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> all these different consonantal divisions we have in English and some of you have <pause dur="0.2"/> been struggling with <pause dur="0.4"/> things like <distinct type="sampa">[T]</distinct> and so on <pause dur="0.7"/><vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/><pause dur="1.1"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> so that <pause dur="0.7"/> so just abandon all that 
and maybe abandon consonants altogether <pause dur="1.0"/> as they impede the the breath and just stick with <pause dur="0.2"/> well abandon all the vowels <pause dur="0.6"/> too just have one vowel <pause dur="0.2"/> but that <pause dur="0.2"/> isn't really very good <pause dur="0.2"/> because <pause dur="0.2"/> language <pause dur="0.7"/> it's it's not efficient it is not an efficient way <pause dur="0.2"/> to organize language just to have one vowel <pause dur="0.5"/> and no consonants <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> it might be fine for the speaker but it doesn't help the listener now the listener <pause dur="0.8"/> needs # <pause dur="0.3"/> i mean i i think <pause dur="1.2"/> speakers can perceive <pause dur="0.3"/> a few hundred <pause dur="0.2"/> different <pause dur="0.2"/> distinctions listeners can i think something like that whatever it is <pause dur="0.8"/> so therefore it's no coincidence that the <pause dur="0.5"/> number of phonemes in languages <pause dur="0.6"/> ranges between <pause dur="0.7"/> i don't know fifteen to seventy <pause dur="0.3"/> or something <pause dur="0.2"/> like that <pause dur="0.8"/> whatever it is i'm not quite sure <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> <trunc>w</trunc> with most probably being forty or fifty or <trunc>som</trunc> or something like that phonemes i suppose <pause dur="0.9"/> # <pause dur="2.3"/> <trunc>the</trunc> there aren't any languages with five-hundred phonemes for example <pause dur="0.4"/> i mean in principle there could be 'cause we can produce five-hundred 
different sounds <pause dur="1.0"/> so there is something cognitive there as well to do with the auditory system that's adapted to hearing <pause dur="1.0"/> speech sounds <pause dur="0.6"/> and the brain both the <trunc>audit</trunc> both the the # auditory system and the brain <pause dur="0.7"/> are adapted <pause dur="0.2"/> to <pause dur="0.2"/> perceiving speech sounds <pause dur="0.7"/> so <pause dur="1.1"/> there is a constant tension <pause dur="0.2"/> between these two <pause dur="0.4"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> it never settles down <pause dur="0.2"/> basically <pause dur="0.4"/> you always get <trunc>some</trunc> something happening in in languages <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="1.1"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> because of this tension which is then exacerbated by the fact that there's also social <pause dur="0.4"/> changes as well <pause dur="0.3"/> which means that <pause dur="0.4"/> to do with people moving around and <trunc>ha</trunc> and <pause dur="0.2"/> acquiring different statuses and so on <pause dur="3.6"/> # <pause dur="2.0"/> there's no sign of <pause dur="0.4"/> languages as i indicated <pause dur="0.4"/> language sort of <pause dur="0.2"/> slowing down <pause dur="0.3"/> over the <pause dur="0.2"/> many <pause dur="0.3"/> tens of thousand language change slowing down over tens of thousands of years <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> what you can say though <pause dur="0.2"/> is that with <pause dur="0.4"/> globalization <pause dur="0.8"/> in the one <trunc>se</trunc> in the sense of <pause dur="0.4"/> English <pause dur="1.2"/> being a major language a major <pause dur="0.3"/> donor language and we're talking about just the last fifty years <pause dur="1.1"/> out of all the <pause dur="0.2"/> hundreds of 
thousands of years in which languages have been spoken <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> and with the <pause dur="0.5"/> demise of isolated communities <pause dur="1.4"/> where <pause dur="1.0"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> very shall we say <pause dur="0.5"/> small languages are spoken <pause dur="0.3"/> small <pause dur="0.5"/> <trunc>m</trunc> <pause dur="0.3"/> only meaning a small number of speakers doesn't mean it's small in its system but only <pause dur="0.3"/> only in the sense of small numbers of speakers <pause dur="0.6"/> there are fewer and fewer languages with <pause dur="0.5"/> small numbers of speakers <pause dur="1.2"/> and what's happens is not that those people die off <pause dur="0.2"/> but they <pause dur="0.6"/> shift to somebody else's language <pause dur="0.5"/> so that <pause dur="0.2"/> that somebody else's language then acquires more speakers <pause dur="0.4"/> so that that that is the tendency <pause dur="0.3"/> but that's what different now from what from two-hundred years ago <pause dur="0.9"/> all right <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.9"/> the the loss of isolated linguistic communities <pause dur="1.5"/> # and that does have certain consequences for <pause dur="0.2"/> for change but anyway i'm not i won't be going on on to those <pause dur="1.1"/> # <pause dur="2.4"/> okay what are our sources <pause dur="0.6"/> for <pause dur="1.0"/> language change <pause dur="2.4"/> where do we get the information from for language change <pause dur="1.7"/> now <pause dur="2.2"/> the <pause dur="0.2"/> <trunc>o</trunc> obvious thing is <pause dur="0.2"/> written down <pause dur="0.2"/> versions <pause dur="0.6"/> of language <pause dur="1.7"/> 
the unfortunate thing about that is that <pause dur="1.6"/> writing <pause dur="0.4"/> is a <trunc>f</trunc> relatively recent activity <pause dur="1.0"/> in the history of <pause dur="0.2"/> human language <pause dur="0.4"/> it's perhaps five-thousand <pause dur="0.2"/> years old or so <pause dur="1.0"/> and <pause dur="0.4"/> what we have i mean the # Egyptian <pause dur="0.3"/> from about three-thousand years ago Chinese <pause dur="0.5"/> no five-thousand years ago Chinese maybe three-thousand years ago Greek three-thousand years <pause dur="0.7"/> Sanskrit four-thousand years <pause dur="1.0"/> # and that's about it <pause dur="0.4"/> right <pause dur="1.9"/> writing systems <pause dur="1.6"/> # i mean vast majority of languages <pause dur="0.5"/> only received writing systems if they have <pause dur="0.2"/> received them yet within the last <pause dur="0.7"/> i don't know <pause dur="0.2"/> five-hundred years or so <pause dur="1.1"/> # <pause dur="0.9"/> so the time depth is very shallow for English <pause dur="0.8"/> which is the <pause dur="0.8"/> the object of so much investigation <pause dur="0.9"/> # <pause dur="1.7"/> not because of any quality of to do <pause dur="0.2"/> to English but <pause dur="0.4"/> because of its <pause dur="0.5"/> # political <pause dur="0.2"/> influence <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="1.3"/> that we only have <pause dur="0.8"/> well <pause dur="0.4"/> thirteen-hundred years of written history <pause dur="1.3"/> right <pause dur="1.1"/> # with other languages we have slightly more or slightly less <pause dur="1.2"/> and then with yet other languages we have no written history whatsoever <pause dur="1.2"/> anyway <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="1.3"/> and 
even the written sources are variable in their <pause dur="0.4"/> usefulness to us <pause dur="0.7"/> if you have a writing system <pause dur="0.3"/> that is simply shall we say picture writing <pause dur="1.1"/> # <pause dur="1.4"/> pictography i think is a word for it <pause dur="0.5"/> there is a direct iconic relation with the real world <pause dur="0.5"/> so if i were to draw <pause dur="0.2"/> a map <pause dur="0.8"/> of an <trunc>ar</trunc> treasure island with an arrow on it okay that would be <pause dur="0.4"/> intended to be <pause dur="0.8"/> a direct <pause dur="0.4"/> scaling down <pause dur="0.2"/> of the thing i was illustrating <pause dur="0.5"/> okay <pause dur="0.3"/> it doesn't <pause dur="0.6"/> have any bearing <pause dur="0.3"/> to language at all <pause dur="1.4"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> secondly i can strip down <pause dur="0.8"/> this thing and and <pause dur="0.3"/> make something much simpler <pause dur="0.9"/> so i can draw something like this <pause dur="3.6"/> <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="6"/> all right <pause dur="2.8"/> oh God isn't that awful <pause dur="0.4"/> anyway <pause dur="0.8"/><vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" dur="1"/><pause dur="0.6"/> <vocal desc="laugh" n="sf1261" iterated="n"/> that is not a <pause dur="0.3"/> rosette or something it's supposed to be a <pause dur="0.8"/> something you might find on a loo <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> anyway # <pause dur="0.2"/><vocal desc="sniff" iterated="n"/><pause dur="1.1"/> okay this does not i <trunc>s</trunc> i mean apart from the fact it's a very poor representation of the thing i'm trying i was aiming at <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> we just understand that this sort of stick man kind of thing represents a man and then there's a stick woman <pause dur="0.5"/> who who has her both legs

now <pause dur="0.4"/> syllabic <pause dur="0.2"/> and alphabetic writing this is really they <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> the best source if you like for the <pause dur="0.8"/> the phonological form <pause dur="0.3"/> of words <pause dur="0.4"/> syllabic and alphabetic writing <pause dur="0.5"/> because they represent sounds <pause dur="0.4"/> and phonological systems in some in some way or other <pause dur="0.9"/> # alphabetic writing systems are essentially phonemic <pause dur="0.6"/> even the English one <pause dur="0.6"/> essentially phonemic <pause dur="1.1"/> # <pause dur="1.8"/> and <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="1.4"/> these are <pause dur="0.5"/> really the most useful <pause dur="0.6"/> so alphabetic writing systems were <pause dur="0.4"/> it's not known how whether they were just <pause dur="0.2"/> invented once <pause dur="0.3"/> thought they might have been invented twice once <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> in <pause dur="0.6"/> the <pause dur="0.7"/> sort of Egyptian # Near Eastern sort of area <pause dur="0.6"/> from that large area represented by that we don't know exactly when <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="1.4"/> and then once in Korea or something in the <pause dur="0.6"/> tenth century <pause dur="0.2"/> or something like that <pause dur="0.4"/> but apart apart from that <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> not <pause dur="1.5"/> # <pause dur="1.4"/> right <pause dur="1.1"/> so it <trunc>i</trunc> it is rather limited <pause dur="0.9"/> now writing systems <pause dur="0.7"/> have a disadvantage as well <pause dur="0.3"/> and English <pause dur="0.7"/> shows that very clearly and that is the that it's very conservative <pause dur="1.5"/> # particularly English 
writing system <pause dur="0.5"/> because it's relatively old <pause dur="0.2"/> and because it hasn't <pause dur="0.2"/> it never really got standardized <pause dur="1.0"/> by an academy <pause dur="0.9"/> # you have well if i were to say <pause dur="0.4"/> the word right <pause dur="0.3"/> to you <pause dur="0.7"/> right <pause dur="1.0"/> there are <pause dur="0.2"/> four ways of spelling this representing four different words # two of them have a W in front <pause dur="0.8"/> and two of them have a G-H in the middle <pause dur="1.3"/> so you get <pause dur="0.2"/> W-R-<pause dur="0.2"/>I-T-E <pause dur="0.5"/> R-I-T-E R-I-G-H-T and W-R-I-G-H-T <pause dur="1.1"/> all right meaning four different words <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> they represent <pause dur="0.3"/> four different pronunciations in earlier stages of the language <pause dur="1.5"/> okay <pause dur="0.2"/> so that's a problem <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> if you want to deduce the <trunc>pronu</trunc> # you know the contemporary pronunciation if anybody saw those words written down they would suppose they were pronounced differently <pause dur="0.9"/> # <pause dur="2.1"/> and then another thing that is not represented <pause dur="0.6"/> often in writing is <pause dur="0.3"/> # morphophonemic alternations now German <pause dur="0.9"/> has <pause dur="0.4"/> an alternation <pause dur="0.9"/> involving <pause dur="1.3"/> a word like <pause dur="0.3"/> this word here <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="3.0"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="4"/> two words <pause dur="1.8"/> both pronounced <pause dur="0.5"/> <distinct lang="de" type="sampa">[Ra:t]</distinct> <pause dur="0.2"/> approximately <pause dur="0.8"/> all

switch <pause dur="1.5"/> # <pause dur="1.3"/> and that there is no variation <pause dur="0.4"/> in any given speech community <pause dur="0.8"/> or very little variation in any given speech community <pause dur="1.7"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> so for example we find <pause dur="0.4"/> there's an Old English <pause dur="0.5"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="12"/> vowel <pause dur="4.5"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> i'll just write down the word i'm thinking of this one here <pause dur="1.1"/> okay that says <distinct lang="oe">stan</distinct> <pause dur="2.5"/> and that means stone <pause dur="0.7"/> all right <pause dur="0.7"/> <distinct lang="oe">stan</distinct> this is the way it was written <pause dur="0.4"/> # with or without that accent on the top <pause dur="0.9"/> # <pause dur="1.0"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="2"/> by the time you get to the Middle English period we find <pause dur="0.2"/> it written like that <pause dur="0.9"/> or with an E on the end <pause dur="0.8"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="1"/> depending <pause dur="1.2"/> and that represents an <distinct type="sampa">[o]</distinct> kind of vowel <distinct lang="oe" type="sampa">[ston]</distinct> <pause dur="1.8"/> <distinct lang="oe" type="sampa">[ston]</distinct> right so it goes from <distinct lang="oe" type="sampa">[stAn]</distinct> to <distinct lang="oe" type="sampa">[ston]</distinct> you get <pause dur="0.3"/> basically there is raising of this <pause dur="1.2"/> back vowel <pause dur="0.3"/> from <distinct type="sampa">[A]</distinct> to 
<distinct type="sampa">[o]</distinct> <pause dur="1.1"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> we're not told when that happened or how that happened but if we then look at the Modern English versions of this O vowel <pause dur="0.3"/> in in the same word <pause dur="0.4"/> we have everything well <pause dur="0.3"/> i'll just write <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="17"/> down a few variants <distinct type="sampa">[st8@n]</distinct> <pause dur="1.1"/> <distinct type="sampa">[stI@n]</distinct> <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="1.0"/> <distinct type="sampa">[sto:n]</distinct> <pause dur="1.2"/> <distinct type="sampa">[stO:n]</distinct> <pause dur="1.1"/> <distinct type="sampa">[sto8n]</distinct> <pause dur="1.6"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> <distinct type="sampa">[st@8n]</distinct> <pause dur="2.1"/> <distinct type="sampa">[st@In]</distinct> <pause dur="0.8"/> and so on <pause dur="0.2"/> all right <pause dur="1.3"/> these are the variants in Modern English <pause dur="0.2"/> and more besides <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="0.8"/> so it's almost as if suddenly there's been a <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/><pause dur="0.4"/> flowering of variation but that's can't be the case 'cause there must always have been variation <pause dur="1.0"/> right <pause dur="0.7"/> this is because we can actually go out and listen to people now <pause dur="0.9"/> and the last <pause dur="0.3"/> for the last fifty years as well we've had <pause dur="0.4"/> reliable tape recordings of people so we can actually trace <pause dur="0.2"/> changes <pause dur="1.2"/> # <pause dur="1.1"/> 
so <pause dur="1.1"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> this then is the sort of idealization when i say that something goes from X to Y <pause dur="0.4"/> in some early stage of a language <pause dur="0.5"/> you have to think you know well it <pause dur="0.4"/> well to put it well it wasn't as simple as that <pause dur="1.8"/> right # <pause dur="1.8"/> okay now <pause dur="1.0"/> what i want to do now <pause dur="0.3"/> okay this this handout you have in front of you <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="2.9"/> it's really for this week and next week <pause dur="0.7"/> and what i want to do is to move straight on to the second page of the handout in the last few minutes we have <pause dur="1.9"/> and to start talking about the # <pause dur="0.6"/> types of <pause dur="0.4"/> of of of changes <pause dur="0.3"/> that might exist <pause dur="0.8"/> so <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="4.1"/><event desc="puts on transparency" iterated="n"/> right <pause dur="0.5"/> so on page three <pause dur="0.5"/> okay relatedness of languages i think i'll try and cover <pause dur="0.7"/> this point one <pause dur="0.2"/> on page three <pause dur="0.9"/> it should be possible to do that in the time available <pause dur="1.1"/> right <pause dur="0.2"/> now you see there <pause dur="0.4"/> # a table <pause dur="0.4"/> of and <trunc>th</trunc> it's on the overhead as well <pause dur="6.1"/><kinesic desc="turns on overhead projector showing transparency" iterated="n"/><event desc="presses overhead projector switches" iterated="y" dur="1"/> shut up <pause dur="8.1"/> right okay so you see there # a <pause dur="1.2"/> a table of items in English and German <pause dur="1.0"/> which <pause dur="0.7"/> have similar meanings and also similar phonetic forms <pause dur="1.0"/> # <pause dur="1.2"/> and what you will notice <pause dur="0.3"/> if you look at this 
concentrating on the consonants <pause dur="0.9"/> is that in English every <pause dur="0.3"/> English word in # in under A <pause dur="1.1"/> there is a <distinct type="sampa">[t]</distinct> <pause dur="1.8"/> and in <pause dur="0.7"/> some of the German words there is a <distinct type="sampa">[ts]</distinct> <pause dur="1.0"/> some other German words there's a <distinct type="sampa">[s]</distinct> <pause dur="0.9"/> and yet others there's a <distinct type="sampa">[t]</distinct> <pause dur="2.1"/> all right <pause dur="0.4"/> i mean the first <pause dur="0.4"/> thing to realize <pause dur="0.3"/> i suppose this thing that strikes you is that actually there's there's a general similarity about # the English and the German forms there so that leads you to suppose that maybe <pause dur="0.4"/> these two languages were derived from a common source <pause dur="1.5"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> however there are details like this the relationship between <distinct type="sampa">[t]</distinct> in English and these three other sounds in German <pause dur="0.5"/> that are a bit mystifying <pause dur="0.2"/> at the moment <pause dur="1.0"/> # likewise if you look under <pause dur="0.3"/> B the bit below <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> you'll see <pause dur="0.7"/> that <pause dur="0.5"/> # in German <pause dur="0.5"/> the other way round this time there's one vowel <pause dur="0.4"/> the <distinct type="sampa">[aI]</distinct> <pause dur="0.2"/> vowel of 
German <pause dur="0.9"/> to get <distinct lang="de">laib</distinct> <distinct lang="de">stein</distinct> <distinct lang="de">eiche</distinct> <distinct lang="de">mein</distinct> <distinct lang="de">eis</distinct> <distinct lang="de">zeit</distinct> <pause dur="1.2"/> in German <pause dur="0.2"/> would then corresponds apparently to two <pause dur="0.5"/> sounds of English so you get loaf stone oak <pause dur="0.6"/> mine ice tide <pause dur="2.2"/> so the kind of questions we have to ask ourselves and i'll be doing this in a couple of weeks' time is <pause dur="0.8"/> how did this come about you know is is this actually <pause dur="0.5"/> complete mystery or is there something <pause dur="0.9"/> something # that we can that we can <pause dur="0.3"/> discover about this <pause dur="0.7"/> right <vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/><pause dur="1.9"/> let's look at the <pause dur="1.1"/> next table under C here <pause dur="1.0"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> this time two more languages Icelandic and # well <trunc>ne</trunc> another adding another language <pause dur="1.0"/> which <pause dur="0.2"/> you know bears broad similarities to English in much of its vocabulary and phonetic form <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="1.2"/> and this time English and Icelandic seem to be paired quite closely <pause dur="0.9"/> and differentiated from German <pause dur="1.0"/> so what i've done is to take some basic vocabulary which seem to be 
which are shared between Icelandic <pause dur="0.4"/> and English <pause dur="0.3"/> but not German <pause dur="0.6"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> and as as you can see <pause dur="0.5"/> you know the same words occur on both <trunc>si</trunc> # in both those columns but not in the German column <pause dur="0.5"/> this might lead you to suppose that in fact <pause dur="1.2"/> # <pause dur="0.9"/> okay <pause dur="0.2"/> German and and English are related as from you saw from A and B <pause dur="0.2"/> in some case but there may be <pause dur="1.2"/> # English and Icelandic are in fact more closely related <pause dur="0.4"/> than English is to German <pause dur="0.2"/> because of the shared vocabulary here that's not shared with <pause dur="0.3"/> with German <pause dur="1.0"/> now <pause dur="0.2"/> to <pause dur="0.3"/> the the answer <pause dur="0.4"/> is <pause dur="0.3"/> in fact <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> not really <pause dur="1.0"/> not historically <pause dur="1.2"/> now Icelandic is the <pause dur="0.5"/> closest we have to the language of the Vikings <pause dur="0.9"/> descended into the modern age <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="1.2"/> and it is also known that there were <pause dur="0.6"/> # Viking <pause dur="0.2"/> invasions <pause dur="0.6"/> and that a lot of <pause dur="0.5"/> Viking <pause dur="0.7"/> Scandinavian vocabulary came into English at the same time <pause dur="0.5"/> all those <pause dur="0.2"/> English words in the English column under C are in fact Norse loan words <pause dur="1.0"/> a result of language contact <pause dur="0.3"/> okay <pause dur="0.5"/> not <pause dur="0.3"/> a result of <pause dur="0.2"/> shared origin of those two languages <pause dur="1.6"/> all right <pause dur="0.4"/> so <pause dur="0.3"/> contact is 
something that <pause dur="0.9"/> and i'll be showing you some examples of this <pause dur="1.0"/> # a bit later on <pause dur="0.2"/> contact is something that <pause dur="0.5"/> muddies the waters <pause dur="1.0"/> if you can you you can # assume <pause dur="0.4"/> if if the assumption is <pause dur="0.5"/> that there is a sort of <trunc>fa</trunc> the so-called family tree theory which <pause dur="0.2"/> again is something i'll be mentioning <pause dur="0.7"/><vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.2"/> that languages <pause dur="0.5"/> split off from each other and then split off into ever <pause dur="0.6"/> more diversified units <pause dur="0.4"/> so it so that <pause dur="0.3"/> in our case you have <pause dur="0.6"/> Indo-European which then splits into an Eastern and a Western branch and so on and there's a Germanic branch <pause dur="0.5"/> Germanic branch splits into English German Dutch Flemish <pause dur="0.6"/> # Frisian Scandinavian and and so on <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> what actually is happening all this time is <pause dur="0.2"/> well <pause dur="0.2"/> 'cause change is gradual <pause dur="1.0"/> these languages are still in contact with each other even though they might have split off at some point they can actually come back together again <pause dur="0.2"/> if you like <pause dur="0.7"/> so this is one <pause dur="0.8"/> <trunc>s</trunc> # so <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> <trunc>i</trunc> if you you just simply looked at English and Icelandic you might <pause dur="0.4"/> be you 
could be forgiven for thinking that <pause dur="0.6"/> they were <pause dur="0.9"/> # related more closely than they are <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> but that's because of <pause dur="0.3"/> contact after the time that they split off <pause dur="0.3"/> German and English are in fact more <pause dur="0.5"/> it's # they have a a more recent common origin <pause dur="0.6"/> than say <pause dur="0.5"/> German and Icelandic have <pause dur="0.6"/> which is then a step further back <pause dur="0.9"/> # <pause dur="1.5"/> and just to show that right for the right at the the bottom of the chart i've got an Icelandic word <distinct lang="is">gera</distinct> <pause dur="1.2"/> to do <pause dur="1.4"/> and then <pause dur="0.3"/> English and German words do make <pause dur="0.2"/> <distinct lang="de">tun</distinct> <distinct lang="de">machen</distinct> which Scandinavian simply doesn't have doesn't have those words <pause dur="0.9"/> well <pause dur="0.3"/> Norwegian does have <distinct lang="no">maker</distinct> <pause dur="0.5"/> <distinct lang="no">maker</distinct> <distinct lang="no">skomaker</distinct> # <pause dur="0.3"/> but that is <pause dur="0.4"/> a German loanword <shift feature="voice" new="laugh"/>from much later <shift feature="voice" new="normal"/>on so that there's no contact then mucks up things even for Norwegian as well <pause dur="0.4"/> but Icelandic doesn't have that word i don't think or maybe it does but it would be a loanword if it does <pause dur="0.4"/><vocal desc="laugh" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.6"/> okay <pause dur="0.4"/> okay so that's i'll leave you leave it there <pause dur="0.2"/> and i'll stop so # <pause dur="0.9"/> next week it'll be more of the same so if you can please bring that handout along next week </u><pause dur="4.6"/> <u who="sf1261" trans="pause"> <gap reason="inaudible" extent="2 secs"/> </u><u who="nm1254" trans="overlap"> <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> <pause dur="0.2"/> oh yeah sure yeah <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.9"/> spare handouts anybody <pause dur="1.4"/> yeah
