<u who="nm0976"> what i'd like to do this morning is to get into the sort of practical details of market research <pause dur="0.6"/> if you remember what the <pause dur="0.2"/> the programme looks like <pause dur="0.3"/> over the next few weeks <pause dur="1.4"/> in the next few weeks starting next week you're going to get quite involved with the <pause dur="0.4"/> # the detail of of # <pause dur="1.9"/> methodology <pause dur="0.2"/> so next week <pause dur="0.4"/> Professor <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> is going to be talking about conjunct analysis which is a <pause dur="0.4"/> quite a modern market research methodology to <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> basically <pause dur="1.0"/> find out what consumers like about new products <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> potential new products <pause dur="0.8"/> but before <pause dur="0.2"/> we do all that we've deliberately dealt with <pause dur="0.3"/> last week the kinds of data that you'll be <pause dur="0.4"/> coming across in this # <pause dur="1.4"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> course and the sorts of data that market researchers deal with <pause dur="1.1"/> and this week we want to deal with the practical aspects of collecting that data <pause dur="1.4"/> and there are in a sense there are always <pause dur="0.4"/> we always <pause dur="0.5"/> deal with this in two ways <pause dur="0.5"/> and the first way <pause dur="0.4"/> or or <trunc>th</trunc> <trunc>th</trunc> there are <pause dur="0.2"/> in a sense two themes to this <pause dur="0.4"/> there's a qualitative stream of market 
research <pause dur="0.3"/> and there's a quantitative stream of market research <pause dur="1.4"/> i'm going to deal with the <pause dur="0.2"/> basically the quantitative <pause dur="0.2"/> stream of data collection first <pause dur="0.3"/> and then <pause dur="0.3"/> look briefly at the <trunc>k</trunc> <pause dur="0.3"/> the qualitative stream but just to draw the distinction between the two <pause dur="1.9"/> qualitative research is essentially <pause dur="0.2"/> exploratory <pause dur="1.2"/> as i <pause dur="0.2"/> i think i mentioned in week one you're trying to find out ideas <pause dur="0.2"/> concepts <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> you might be testing people's reactions to certain things <pause dur="0.6"/> but in a qualitative way and what that <pause dur="0.3"/> effectively means is that you will never have <pause dur="0.4"/> large enough numbers to do statistical tests <pause dur="0.8"/> and this is why we're going to try and get this out of the way <pause dur="0.3"/> there are <pause dur="0.2"/> ways of dealing with you <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> last week talked to you about attitude measurement <pause dur="0.4"/> and some of that verges on qualitative but <pause dur="0.5"/> what she was referring to was essentially building up enough information about people's attitudes to be able to <pause dur="0.8"/> render it useful for statistical analysis of one sort or another <pause dur="0.2"/> and attitudes <pause dur="0.6"/> as you will see 
fall into today's session as well attitude measurement <pause dur="1.0"/> so qualitative research <pause dur="0.2"/> is about <pause dur="0.7"/> basically exploratory work <pause dur="0.8"/> today's the first part of today's session is more about <pause dur="0.4"/> quantitative <pause dur="0.2"/> work and <pause dur="0.2"/> collecting enough data to be able to do something <pause dur="0.4"/> statistical with it <pause dur="2.1"/> now qualitative research in some ways boils down to a <trunc>f</trunc> very few basic techniques and <pause dur="0.3"/> at the end of the morning i'm going to just show you a video which <pause dur="0.4"/> shows you how focus groups work <pause dur="0.3"/> because focus groups <pause dur="0.5"/> are the # the main <pause dur="0.7"/> vehicle that are used for qualitative research <pause dur="1.8"/> it's often said that qualitative research should come before quantitative research <pause dur="0.5"/> and for the sake of variety i'm doing it the other way round it doesn't really matter <pause dur="0.3"/> because <pause dur="0.8"/> qualitative research can stand on its own <pause dur="1.8"/> you know as you'll see in a second in order to design a decent questionnaire <pause dur="0.3"/> you need to have some idea of <pause dur="0.2"/> where people stand on the issue you're looking at <pause dur="0.6"/> it's dangerous of course to <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="2.1"/> impose your views as a researcher <pause dur="0.8"/> so 
what you what what we'll be looking at are ways of <pause dur="0.4"/> in qualitative work <pause dur="0.2"/> ways of <pause dur="0.5"/> prompting the sort of information we need to design questionnaires <pause dur="1.7"/> but we'll start off with <pause dur="0.8"/> some thoughts and some <pause dur="0.5"/> methods for <pause dur="0.4"/> dealing with quantitative data <pause dur="2.1"/> and just to give you a flavour for what's <pause dur="0.9"/> the sorts of problems and the sorts of issues that we're <pause dur="0.3"/> going to be looking at later on <pause dur="1.9"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> these are common market research problems <pause dur="0.3"/> analysing product usage <pause dur="1.2"/> very straightforward in a way just saying okay how <trunc>m</trunc> how much <pause dur="0.6"/> of <trunc>th</trunc> <pause dur="0.3"/> this product do people use why do they use it <pause dur="0.5"/> how much more might they use and so on so a fairly straightforward <pause dur="0.4"/> # quantitative <pause dur="1.0"/> assessment of of product usage or sales <pause dur="2.3"/> market researchers always talk about usage because it's <pause dur="0.3"/> more than just sales sales is just a number so much was sold <pause dur="0.3"/> usage is far more concerned with <pause dur="0.3"/> the way people <pause dur="0.5"/> react to the product the way people use the product what people do with it and so on <pause dur="1.7"/> you're going to get in <pause dur="0.4"/> the next couple of weeks quite a lot on 
market segmentation <pause dur="1.0"/> so quantitative research to describe market segments <pause dur="0.6"/> and if you're trying to split a mass market into lots of <pause dur="0.4"/> submarkets or segments <pause dur="0.5"/> you need quantitative research usually <pause dur="0.5"/> because <pause dur="0.2"/> it's quantitative research that says <pause dur="0.2"/> this many people are likely to be <pause dur="0.3"/> in this segment if you're trying to <pause dur="0.3"/> target market <pause dur="0.6"/> if you're trying to <pause dur="0.2"/> focus on a particular segment <pause dur="0.4"/> then you will need to know <pause dur="0.4"/> # basically how many people are in that segment or whether it's worth your while <pause dur="0.3"/> going for it <pause dur="1.3"/> so describing market segments market segmentation is usually <pause dur="0.4"/> quantitative and you're going to look at <pause dur="0.5"/> cluster and factor analysis and other things <pause dur="0.7"/> to <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> describe market segments <pause dur="0.6"/> assessing attitudes as <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> spoke to you last <pause dur="0.2"/> week <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> attitudes of purchasers are assessed mostly by quantitative research <pause dur="1.6"/> describing product image <pause dur="0.4"/> is # on the border <pause dur="0.5"/> again <pause dur="0.2"/> quantitative research can be used you can collect data from large numbers of people <pause dur="0.5"/> # to <trunc>descr</trunc> and and see <pause dur="0.3"/> what they think 
of product image but there's a there's a qualitative <pause dur="0.6"/> aspect to that as well <pause dur="1.7"/> identify market opportunities and redefine and reposition products <pause dur="0.6"/> <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> talked to you about scaling well you're going to look later on at <trunc>ma</trunc> # at multidimensional scaling <pause dur="0.6"/> which <pause dur="0.3"/> comes up with <pause dur="0.3"/> # ideas on those two those last two <pause dur="1.4"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> items there <pause dur="3.1"/> now a brief recap on last week <pause dur="0.5"/> <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> talked about the types of data well <pause dur="0.4"/> there are different <pause dur="0.9"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> types of data categories of data <pause dur="0.3"/> and these <pause dur="0.4"/> have a big impact <pause dur="0.5"/> on <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> how you collect <pause dur="0.2"/> the information the the the sorts of <pause dur="0.7"/> # vehicles you can use for that <pause dur="0.4"/> so <pause dur="0.2"/> numbers as labels is nominal data <pause dur="0.2"/> ordinal data where you put it in order <pause dur="0.3"/> interval data where <pause dur="0.3"/> there's some <pause dur="2.5"/> implication of the distances between each <pause dur="0.2"/> point let's say on a scale <pause dur="0.5"/> and ratio data where there's some absolute zero point and <pause dur="0.5"/> the <pause dur="0.2"/> differences between the the points means something <pause dur="2.1"/> now <pause dur="0.2"/> how are you going to <pause dur="0.2"/> get hold of people <pause dur="1.3"/> we're looking at questionnaire design which is a sort of general <pause dur="0.3"/> # description of of <pause dur="0.3"/> 
of variety of different <pause dur="0.4"/> ways of collecting information <pause dur="0.5"/> but <pause dur="2.2"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> the method of contact is obviously important how are you going to get hold of these people <pause dur="0.5"/> and these are <pause dur="0.3"/> the four <pause dur="0.6"/> sort of most common ways not <pause dur="0.4"/> necessarily in order but if you're thinking of <pause dur="0.3"/> how market researchers collect their information <pause dur="0.4"/> those are the ways they do it <pause dur="0.3"/> number four now <pause dur="0.5"/> is <pause dur="0.3"/> being used computers are being used to support <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="1.7"/> market researchers <pause dur="0.5"/> a great deal more and <pause dur="0.4"/> the whole business of <pause dur="1.0"/> both selling things over the telephone and doing market research over the telephone <pause dur="0.5"/> has become <pause dur="0.2"/> a very important issue in market research <pause dur="0.4"/> and you'll see reference to <trunc>th</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> to # <pause dur="0.9"/> terms like C-A-T-I <pause dur="2.8"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="3"/> computer assisted telephone interviewing <pause dur="0.4"/> i <trunc>me</trunc> i think it probably goes without saying now that when you're phoned up <pause dur="0.8"/> and somebody wants to conduct a market research interview with you <pause dur="0.3"/> # they're probably sitting in front of <pause dur="0.8"/> a P-C and we'll we'll <pause dur="0.8"/> look at some of the <pause dur="0.4"/> implications of that but <pause dur="0.3"/> one of the main ones of 
course is that <pause dur="0.4"/> the <pause dur="0.2"/> data entry <pause dur="0.5"/> occurs at the same time as the <pause dur="1.2"/> asking of the questions so there's huge savings in terms of that and indeed some of the analysis <pause dur="0.3"/> can go on <pause dur="0.2"/> more or less as you're speaking <pause dur="1.2"/> things like <pause dur="0.6"/> you know in questionnaires you'll need to <pause dur="0.4"/> need to skip <pause dur="0.6"/> from one section to another well the <pause dur="0.3"/> computer does that automatically <pause dur="0.6"/> next week you're going to hear about a technique called adaptive conjoint analysis <pause dur="0.4"/> and this is an analysis method that <pause dur="0.5"/> <trunc>i</trunc> <pause dur="0.3"/> as it suggests sort of adapts to the person who's being interviewed <pause dur="0.4"/> and starts to <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> react or ask different questions depending on the <pause dur="0.5"/> # the person <pause dur="1.9"/> telephone interviewing <pause dur="1.0"/> # is <pause dur="0.5"/> increasing in in # <pause dur="0.2"/> its coverage its its importance <pause dur="1.2"/> but <pause dur="0.8"/> in some ways <pause dur="0.2"/> it's postal questionnaires that we <pause dur="0.3"/> we want to <pause dur="0.2"/> concentrate on today because <pause dur="0.3"/> it's postal questionnaires that in a sense have to be the most accurate <pause dur="1.1"/> because posnal <trunc>k</trunc> postal questionnaires <pause dur="0.5"/> are <pause dur="0.3"/> the ones where the respondent doesn't have any help at all <pause dur="1.4"/> # <pause dur="1.6"/> there may be follow-ups and you may 
follow up by telephone and so on <pause dur="0.4"/> but <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> it's postal questionnaires which need <pause dur="0.3"/> to be the most accurate if you like <pause dur="1.9"/> personal interviewing <pause dur="3.3"/> in some ways is very good very high levels of response <pause dur="0.6"/> because although you might have <pause dur="1.2"/> told <pause dur="0.4"/> somebody on Broad Street who is trying to hassle you to answer a few questions to go away <pause dur="0.3"/> but at at that <pause dur="0.2"/> the response rate for <pause dur="0.4"/> # personal interviews is actually far higher <pause dur="0.5"/> than these other methods <pause dur="0.9"/> people find it a lot more difficult to turn away somebody who's <pause dur="0.6"/> sort of standing there in front of them <pause dur="1.3"/> the problem with personal interviews of course is that <pause dur="0.4"/> the interviewer is there <pause dur="0.5"/> and the interviewer <pause dur="0.2"/> themselves can <pause dur="0.4"/> bias <pause dur="0.3"/> the results and i think that's just <pause dur="0.5"/> it's a it's a <trunc>l</trunc> it's a lesson <pause dur="0.4"/> in research in general <pause dur="1.1"/> that <pause dur="1.3"/> interviewer bias of course is to be avoided <pause dur="0.9"/> but if you've got somebody in person and and <pause dur="0.7"/> <trunc>i</trunc> it's very interesting if you think about this perhaps <pause dur="0.2"/> having done this course you might think well <pause dur="0.5"/> you know i i tend to submit to these interviewers just 
to see how they do it and whether they're any good at it <pause dur="0.7"/> and <pause dur="0.6"/> you quite often find personal interviews where the interviewer is <pause dur="0.3"/> hassling you to answer the question <pause dur="0.7"/> and so you you're you're you're sort of thinking about your and they say <pause dur="0.3"/> well <pause dur="0.2"/> how about or do you mean <pause dur="0.3"/> and this kind of thing and and this is where distortions can come in <pause dur="1.0"/> so <pause dur="1.7"/> personal interviews <pause dur="0.5"/> are <pause dur="0.5"/> good high response rates <pause dur="0.4"/> but there is the problem of bias and of course they're very expensive you're <trunc>em</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> employing <pause dur="0.6"/> real people <pause dur="0.5"/> to ask these questions <pause dur="2.5"/> telephone interviewing less expensive but a less good response rate and again some problems of <pause dur="0.6"/> of bias <pause dur="0.4"/> there's a there's a there's a problem whenever you're a person who's asking another person questions <pause dur="0.5"/> there's always a problem of bias because <pause dur="0.2"/> you want people to <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> expand on their answers and you want people to <pause dur="0.5"/> # sort of chat about what they're interested in <pause dur="0.3"/> and therefore you have to interact with them <pause dur="0.4"/> and that interaction is what can cause 
the biases <pause dur="1.4"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> the alternative is to have a very strict interviewing schedule and a very strict questionnaire <pause dur="0.5"/> and you do get this particularly on the telephone where <pause dur="0.8"/> you know you get this sort of automaton who's actually a person but they're <pause dur="0.4"/> they're <pause dur="0.5"/> it's a very stilted kind of interview and some would say that the quality of the data <pause dur="0.6"/> that is <pause dur="0.9"/> collected as a result is not that high <pause dur="1.4"/> so we're concentrating on postal questionnaires but <trunc>as</trunc> accepting that you need good <pause dur="0.6"/> a good <pause dur="0.3"/> data collection <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="1.1"/> device for all of those things <pause dur="2.5"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> well sampling you're probably all familiar with sampling but <pause dur="0.3"/> you've got to make these decisions <pause dur="1.1"/> you've got to identify the population of people that you're <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> researching population of people you're talking to <pause dur="0.4"/> you need to draw up a sample frame that is <pause dur="0.2"/> some device which says <pause dur="0.2"/> here are <pause dur="0.3"/> # the rules that we're going to use in sampling these people <pause dur="3.8"/> the sampling unit are you going to sample households <pause dur="0.5"/> or individuals <pause dur="0.4"/> males females and so on so picking 
the <pause dur="0.2"/> the people <pause dur="2.7"/> the sampling method <pause dur="0.8"/> well <pause dur="0.6"/> statisticians would love everything to be probability samples preferably random <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> in practice <pause dur="0.4"/> i think most market researchers are much more pragmatic than that <pause dur="0.4"/> so <pause dur="0.2"/> that pragmatism means that they <pause dur="0.3"/> start <pause dur="0.5"/> looking at non-probability samples <pause dur="0.7"/> quota samples saying right we'll have certain numbers of people in each of these categories <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="1.1"/> when you get on to things like consumer panels <pause dur="0.5"/> they're probably sampled more <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> accurately if you like or more scientifically <pause dur="0.3"/> the only problem with them is that you've got the same <pause dur="0.4"/> people every time that's a good thing but it's also a bad thing because they <pause dur="0.6"/> they become their characteristics <pause dur="0.5"/> then get <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="1.4"/> # in a sense put into the the the research process and they they <pause dur="0.4"/> # may be atypical by <pause dur="1.0"/> cooperating with you <pause dur="1.1"/> sample size you've got to decide <pause dur="0.5"/> sample plan how are you actually going to do it <pause dur="3.9"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> now i'm going to show you lots of examples of different types <pause dur="0.2"/> of <pause dur="0.3"/> questions that you can ask <pause dur="1.6"/> here are some very 
general <pause dur="0.3"/> design issues though <pause dur="1.6"/> questions need to be precise as you'll you'll see in a moment <pause dur="1.0"/> they need to be <pause dur="0.5"/> well-ordered <pause dur="1.4"/> incidentally <trunc>s</trunc> sorry i should have said this earlier <pause dur="0.8"/> the <pause dur="2.1"/> assessment for this course <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> we will i think announce next week formally but what it's going to be <pause dur="0.6"/> is a <pause dur="1.1"/> case study <pause dur="0.3"/> basically and you will be asked to <pause dur="0.5"/> evaluate comment appraise the case study <pause dur="0.4"/> and it'll be a case study describing a sort of typical market research process <pause dur="0.9"/> # but it will also include data <pause dur="1.2"/> so there will be data that you can analyse to support your case <pause dur="0.3"/> and you will be able to analyse it basically in whatever way you want to <pause dur="0.6"/> and that'll be up to you <pause dur="0.7"/> i i say that now because <pause dur="0.4"/> you won't <pause dur="0.9"/> if somebody was asking earlier about will we have to do a questionnaire and that they've probably been talking to people who did it last year where <pause dur="0.4"/> we <pause dur="0.2"/> everybody <pause dur="0.2"/> every single individual ran a questionnaire and it got <pause dur="0.7"/> it actually got rather out of hand it was <pause dur="0.2"/> extremely difficult to mark because 
people producing <pause dur="0.3"/> huge volumes of things so <pause dur="0.2"/> this is this session is just to introduce you to how <pause dur="0.6"/> this sort of data is collected but you won't be doing this as part of the assessment <pause dur="1.6"/> so questions have got to be precise and i'm going to show you some examples of <pause dur="0.2"/> good and bad questions in a second <pause dur="1.0"/> you need to decide <pause dur="0.5"/> very <pause dur="0.5"/> carefully on the ordering <pause dur="0.8"/> i think there's no excuse these days for <pause dur="0.4"/> in a sense for getting this wrong and certainly <pause dur="0.2"/> presentation is really important <pause dur="0.7"/> and so we'll talk a little bit about presentation and how you order <pause dur="0.3"/> the questions to make sure that you get <pause dur="0.3"/> there's a there are different schools of thought <pause dur="0.3"/> to make sure that you get <pause dur="0.4"/> an optimum response <pause dur="2.9"/> in preparing yourself for this you need to <pause dur="0.2"/> have some idea of what you think people are going to <pause dur="0.4"/> respond or how you think people are going to respond <pause dur="0.9"/> so the sort of categories the sort of ways people might respond <pause dur="0.3"/> the different possible answers to multiple choice questions for example <pause dur="1.6"/> you need <pause dur="0.3"/> instructions <pause dur="0.3"/> for interviewers <pause dur="1.2"/> and as i say this can range from <pause dur="0.2"/> very <pause dur="0.3"/> explicit <pause dur="0.3"/> instructions to as to how somebody should ask particular questions <pause dur="0.4"/> or it could just be <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="1.7"/> 
so some questionnaires as you'll see have very <pause dur="0.5"/> # clear instructions for interviewers some have <pause dur="0.3"/> instructions that are really <pause dur="0.5"/> may well be over the top may well be too detailed <pause dur="1.4"/> and then data processing requirements <pause dur="0.6"/><vocal desc="cough" iterated="n"/> and you'll see some examples of how <pause dur="0.5"/> # we <pause dur="0.3"/> mark up questionnaires in order to <pause dur="0.5"/> make them amenable to <pause dur="0.5"/> data processing <pause dur="3.0"/> so how are we going to develop this thing <pause dur="1.4"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> well <pause dur="0.7"/> you need <pause dur="0.7"/> some kind of <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.8"/> statement of objectives the sort of resources you have available <pause dur="0.2"/> and the constraints to <pause dur="0.2"/> the development of the <pause dur="0.3"/> the survey <pause dur="1.5"/> so <pause dur="0.5"/> you've got to set very clear objectives as to what <pause dur="0.4"/> your <pause dur="0.5"/> # questionnaire is designed to achieve <pause dur="1.2"/> you need to say something about <pause dur="0.4"/> how <pause dur="0.6"/> you're going to collect the data the sorts of <pause dur="0.7"/> types of question that you're going to have the <pause dur="0.2"/> the way you word them <pause dur="0.4"/> the flow of the questionnaire and so on <pause dur="0.4"/> 
obtaining approval is important <pause dur="1.8"/> in the university we have # <pause dur="1.0"/> a <pause dur="1.7"/> body known as the Ethics Committee <pause dur="0.8"/> and technically speaking if you <pause dur="0.4"/> go out <pause dur="0.5"/> well if you go outside the university <pause dur="0.6"/> to <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="1.6"/> research anything you need to get the approval of the Ethics Committee <pause dur="0.7"/> and the Ethics Committee is <pause dur="0.3"/> in some ways is quite a good idea the university and indeed <pause dur="0.5"/> any market research body <pause dur="0.4"/> doesn't want <pause dur="0.3"/> the <pause dur="0.3"/> its name to be pulled down by the market research process of course <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> and so we have to if we're going out and indeed if <pause dur="0.3"/> students are doing projects we have to <pause dur="0.2"/> get the implicit approval of the Ethics Committee <pause dur="0.5"/> sometimes that can come from the head of department <pause dur="1.0"/> but # <pause dur="1.4"/> two or three years ago just <pause dur="1.2"/> for your information the # <pause dur="0.4"/> this group <pause dur="0.4"/> was actually a group of undergraduate students <pause dur="0.9"/> decided to do a <pause dur="0.5"/> a market research project which was the assessment for the course <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> and they were given a free choice as to what <pause dur="0.2"/> subject they wanted to <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="1.1"/> ask people about and <pause dur="1.2"/> # the <pause dur="0.5"/> explicit <pause dur="0.4"/> instruction was that the people 
they researched should only be members of the course <pause dur="0.7"/> and this group came and said <pause dur="0.3"/> we want to do <pause dur="1.5"/> a kind of sex survey <pause dur="1.2"/> and what this was it <trunc>w</trunc> it was fairly innocent although <pause dur="0.5"/> # i did say <pause dur="0.5"/> you know this must strictly be kept within the <pause dur="1.2"/> group and it it sort of <pause dur="1.3"/> i won't go into the details but it it was asking various fairly personal questions <pause dur="0.6"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> the <pause dur="1.0"/> first i heard well the next thing i heard of it was <pause dur="0.5"/> somebody called up from who'd been <pause dur="0.2"/> accosted by one of these students <pause dur="0.4"/> somewhere down in town <pause dur="0.6"/> and had been asked these questions and <pause dur="0.5"/> we got into a little bit of trouble about it and <pause dur="0.8"/> we hadn't <trunc>cle</trunc> i hadn't cleared it with the committee because it wasn't <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> i didn't believe it was going out so anyway <pause dur="0.2"/> there are there are that's a a very obvious problem but you do need to obtain approval <pause dur="0.2"/> there is a market research society code of practice <pause dur="0.3"/> on <pause dur="0.6"/> on asking <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> questions on on <pause dur="0.5"/> how to do research <pause dur="2.8"/> you need to pretest the questionnaire this is really important those of you some of you 
will be doing this for <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.8"/> your <pause dur="1.1"/> dissertations some of you i know are collecting <pause dur="0.2"/> primary data <pause dur="0.6"/> you need to pretest the thing because <pause dur="0.4"/> you're the researcher you're very close to the subject you know what you're talking about <pause dur="0.3"/> but you've got to check that other people do as well and if you want a <pause dur="0.2"/> statistically valid sample of a hundred people or two-hundred people <pause dur="0.5"/> you've got to make sure you're collecting the data properly <pause dur="0.6"/> and it's <pause dur="0.2"/> these pretests or pilots <pause dur="0.5"/> that will tell you whether it's <pause dur="0.2"/> going to work or not <pause dur="0.7"/> so make sure you do pilots and and <pause dur="0.4"/> you know this this can be up to <trunc>s</trunc> <pause dur="0.3"/> sort of half a dozen <pause dur="0.4"/> different <pause dur="0.6"/> # people that you question and you will soon find <pause dur="0.5"/> if you've got any doubts about the length of the questionnaire or the style of particular questions or whether the sort of <pause dur="0.3"/> issues you're asking them about are valid <pause dur="0.4"/> you'll soon find out <pause dur="0.7"/> # from that <pause dur="0.9"/> so <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> piloting is really important <pause dur="0.6"/> prepare the final questionnaire and then implement the survey <pause dur="1.6"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> this is the sort of <pause dur="0.2"/> layout 
that you might use <pause dur="0.3"/> for <pause dur="0.5"/> a questionnaire it's there are no <pause dur="0.2"/> right and wrong answers here really <pause dur="0.6"/> but <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="3.5"/> this is a layout <pause dur="4.5"/> every questionnaire of course has to carry an identification number i think i <pause dur="1.6"/> in the first week i was talking about using <pause dur="0.3"/> # a spreadsheet <pause dur="0.5"/> basically a a matrix to enter the data <pause dur="0.9"/> a lot of people <pause dur="0.3"/> use Excel for that <pause dur="1.0"/> which is fine <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> the bad thing about Excel i think i mentioned is that it will let you sort the thing <pause dur="0.7"/> in a rather rudimentary way and if you're trying to sort <pause dur="0.5"/> your data <pause dur="0.5"/> # and you <pause dur="0.7"/> if you know in Excel <vocal desc="cough" iterated="n"/><pause dur="1.0"/> you can select <pause dur="0.5"/> three or four columns with the data in it and forget to select the others and if you then sort it <pause dur="0.3"/> all the data will be <pause dur="1.2"/> out you you will <pause dur="0.3"/> it will be non-consistent <pause dur="0.3"/> things like Access <pause dur="0.4"/> and S-P-S-S don't let you do that <pause dur="0.4"/> if you're going to delete something or sort something it the whole row would be sorted so <pause dur="0.3"/> Excel is quite a good database but be careful because you do have to <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> you do have to watch that <pause dur="0.4"/> the <trunc>ob</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> obviously an I-D number is one way of 
sorting things so <pause dur="0.3"/> you sort by the order in which you collected the data or something <pause dur="1.8"/> screeners <pause dur="0.2"/> are qualifying questions and this quite often <pause dur="0.3"/> # this is <pause dur="1.0"/> quite often <pause dur="0.4"/> important <pause dur="0.2"/> because sometimes <pause dur="0.4"/> you'll be wanting to collect data on people <pause dur="0.4"/> who <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> have particular characteristics and you won't know <pause dur="0.5"/> until you <pause dur="0.5"/> # ask them whether they have those characteristics one classic example is <pause dur="0.5"/> and this this happens with student projects and other work we've done is <pause dur="1.8"/> quite often with food products you want to talk to vegetarians because <pause dur="0.4"/> you think that they might <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> have well they obviously have different <pause dur="0.2"/> physically they have different <pause dur="0.5"/> purchasing habits but they might have different attitudes to food <pause dur="0.8"/> but <pause dur="0.3"/> you can't well i can't spot a vegetarian just by looking at him or her <pause dur="0.6"/><vocal desc="laughter" n="su0986" iterated="y" dur="1"/> # so you need to ask <trunc>s</trunc> screening questions to find out <pause dur="0.4"/> and quite often <pause dur="0.3"/> you'll # you may have come across this you'll get stopped in the street and someone will say <pause dur="0.3"/> you know <pause dur="0.5"/> have you been to the cinema in the last six months 
if you say no they say right thanks very much <pause dur="0.4"/> goodbye that's a it's a screening question <pause dur="0.9"/><vocal desc="laughter" n="ss" dur="2" iterated="y"/> okay so <trunc>y</trunc> <pause dur="0.3"/> those qualifying questions are really important <pause dur="1.8"/> # <pause dur="1.1"/> i've got a a questionnaire to show you in a second but we'll just go through this <pause dur="1.8"/><vocal desc="cough" iterated="n"/> you need some introductory remarks and again this may well be a <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> a comment that the <pause dur="0.9"/> the personal interviewer <pause dur="0.6"/> makes but if it's if you're if this is a mail questionnaire you'll need some remarks to explain what you're doing <pause dur="2.0"/> it's no good just having you know first question <pause dur="0.4"/> how old are you or something # you need some explanation of the work you're doing and why <pause dur="0.5"/> and all market researchers do this <pause dur="0.4"/> there is one <pause dur="1.8"/> i suppose one exception to that there's a a <pause dur="1.1"/> technique if you like called an omnibus survey and this is where several firms pay <pause dur="0.4"/> to <pause dur="0.3"/> include questions about their own interests on a big survey and you may <pause dur="0.4"/> may well have come across these 
and these tend to be <pause dur="0.3"/> very mixed and so <pause dur="0.6"/> lots of introductory remarks about the survey are not necessarily relevant <pause dur="2.3"/> transition questions these are ones that sort of take you from <pause dur="0.2"/> one # part of the questionnaire to another if you're asking people about <pause dur="0.3"/> food consumption and you're <pause dur="0.2"/> you're starting off on pricing issues for example <pause dur="0.3"/> then you might have a question that <pause dur="0.3"/> # links price with the amount they buy or something and then you go on to <pause dur="0.4"/> deal more <pause dur="0.5"/> closely with the amount they buy and demand and so on <pause dur="1.4"/> difficult questions <pause dur="0.7"/><vocal desc="cough" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.4"/> and this is <pause dur="1.0"/> the textbook <pause dur="0.3"/> # idea <trunc>r</trunc> really this depends on <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="1.1"/> the practice on the ground if you like and what you're asking but <pause dur="0.4"/> i don't think you'd put difficult questions right at the top or very sensitive questions right at the start of the questionnaire <pause dur="1.0"/> 
you need to distinguish questions <pause dur="0.3"/> very clearly from instructions <pause dur="0.7"/> and you need to think about <pause dur="0.2"/> classification data about the respondent <pause dur="0.9"/> virtually all market research studies as you'll see <pause dur="0.5"/> will and and particularly when you get into market segmentation you need information about the people <pause dur="0.7"/> you're <pause dur="0.3"/> asking you're not <pause dur="0.3"/> you're very unlikely <pause dur="0.4"/> to be <pause dur="0.6"/> researching something related to some kind of mass market <pause dur="0.5"/> but you say <pause dur="0.2"/> okay well it doesn't matter who these people are we just want a hundred people and we'll ask them some questions <pause dur="0.8"/> because <pause dur="0.8"/> by far ninety-nine per cent of the time you'll be saying well we need to know <pause dur="0.3"/> whether older people think this and younger people think that <pause dur="0.4"/> or people in the north think <pause dur="0.2"/> one thing and people in the south think another thing <pause dur="0.9"/> so those <pause dur="0.5"/> the the classification data or the demographic data is is extremely important <pause dur="0.5"/> and for for 
clustering and <sic corr="factorizing">factronizing</sic> various other things <pause dur="0.3"/> as you'll find out <pause dur="0.4"/> this <pause dur="0.2"/> data is is vital <pause dur="2.7"/> there are various schools of thought on this # <pause dur="0.4"/> you know there used to be big debate about how you could ask people their age and and <pause dur="0.7"/> there was <pause dur="0.4"/> sort of # <pause dur="2.0"/> various schools of thought like you you didn't ask people their age that would put them off completely <pause dur="0.5"/> so you just had a <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="1.5"/> you know you had a blank box and you evaluated their age yourselves <pause dur="0.2"/> but now the <pause dur="0.6"/> it's current <pause dur="0.2"/> idea seems to be you just ask people how old are you <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="0.8"/> same thing about income <pause dur="0.4"/> that is more sensitive it's very difficult to ask people about incomes <pause dur="0.2"/> so as you know you start <pause dur="0.4"/> talking to people about <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> either you have a range of incomes and ask people to fill that in <pause dur="0.5"/> or you talk about the occupation of the main income earner <pause dur="0.7"/> so if you ask about occupation you get <trunc>r</trunc> rather more of an idea of <pause dur="0.9"/> what people <pause dur="1.1"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> earn <pause dur="2.4"/> so allied to the <pause dur="0.2"/> the types of 
data <pause dur="0.4"/> we were talking about earlier <pause dur="0.8"/> this <pause dur="0.5"/> really helps classify the types of question <pause dur="0.5"/> that <pause dur="0.4"/> you ask <pause dur="0.5"/> and they fall into various categories <pause dur="0.4"/> there are direct factual <pause dur="0.2"/> questions <pause dur="1.7"/> how much do you earn would be one of them <pause dur="1.1"/> you know are you male or female <pause dur="0.7"/> how tall are you this kind of thing it's all very factual <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> if you think about it in data analysis terms <pause dur="0.6"/> a lot of it is <pause dur="1.2"/> quite quantitative by which i mean <pause dur="0.4"/> it's it's useful in further <trunc>ana</trunc> it's it's particularly useful in further analysis so if you're collecting things on quantities or prices <pause dur="0.7"/> then <pause dur="0.3"/> you know as economists you'll know that that's data that can be used <pause dur="0.5"/> # for other things <pause dur="0.4"/> # personal details <pause dur="0.3"/> if you're <pause dur="0.6"/> just collecting information on <pause dur="0.3"/> you know whether somebody's going to vote yes in an election or vote no in an election <pause dur="0.4"/> it's very simple data it's a dummy variable but it's it's <pause dur="0.3"/> it can be useful <pause dur="1.4"/> however if you're <trunc>ope</trunc> asking open-ended questions <pause dur="1.1"/> like <pause dur="0.8"/> what do you feel about the new building <pause dur="1.8"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> right <pause dur="0.5"/> 
people could write an essay on that <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> would be very useful because they'd give you loads and loads of information but it would be <pause dur="0.4"/> extremely difficult <pause dur="0.4"/> to analyse <pause dur="0.5"/> so you've got to <pause dur="0.2"/> strike a balance <pause dur="0.2"/> there is the use of the data and <pause dur="0.4"/> how easy it will be to actually use it <pause dur="0.5"/> multiple choice questions and dichotomous questions dichotomous being yes or no <pause dur="0.5"/> just look at the different characteristics in those <pause dur="2.5"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/><vocal desc="cough" iterated="n"/> so open-ended questions are great as first questions <pause dur="1.2"/> they've still got to establish <pause dur="0.3"/> if you think of <trunc>th</trunc> the questionnaire remember it's postal <pause dur="0.6"/> that's what we're looking at at the moment <pause dur="0.6"/> you think of it as <pause dur="0.3"/> being you <trunc>s</trunc> you as the researcher speaking to people <pause dur="1.4"/> then you need something that establishes some rapport with people <pause dur="1.5"/> and you'll see in a second different ways of doing that <pause dur="1.3"/> 
so <pause dur="0.3"/> they're they're good first questions for that reason <pause dur="0.8"/> there's very little influence on the response what do you think of the new building <pause dur="0.6"/> is a very open question you can say exactly what you like <pause dur="0.6"/> you can write as much as you like you could give a one word answer or you could <pause dur="0.4"/> write an essay on it <pause dur="1.5"/> so there's very little influence on the <trunc>res</trunc> you're not saying what do you think of the new building <pause dur="0.4"/> you know good bad or indifferent <pause dur="0.8"/> you're not <pause dur="0.2"/> you're not <pause dur="0.4"/> imposing on people <pause dur="0.8"/> and so you can get <pause dur="0.3"/> insights <pause dur="0.2"/> however <pause dur="0.9"/> there can be <pause dur="0.2"/> interviewer bias certainly if it's a <pause dur="0.4"/> a personal interview <pause dur="0.5"/> but the <trunc>pr</trunc> main problem with open-ended questions is <pause dur="0.7"/> we're looking at <pause dur="0.4"/> quantitative methods we want to <pause dur="0.4"/> quantify the results we therefore need <pause dur="0.2"/> some form of computerized analysis <pause dur="0.4"/> and coding the things coding <pause dur="0.4"/> open-ended questions <pause dur="0.5"/> is <pause dur="0.3"/> the main problem <pause dur="0.3"/> that is <pause dur="0.5"/> putting a number really to the question <pause dur="0.2"/> to the sorry to the answer that you've been given <pause dur="0.8"/> you can precode open-ended questions so you'd have a <pause dur="0.3"/> a list of 
things that you think people are going to respond but they always say <pause dur="0.2"/> different things <pause dur="0.7"/> so you you you need to <pause dur="0.6"/> # bear that in mind you can <pause dur="0.4"/> it's usually better to do it afterwards <pause dur="3.5"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> multiple choice questions <pause dur="0.3"/> dead easy they reduce <pause dur="0.3"/> interviewer bias <pause dur="0.5"/> very easy for people to <pause dur="0.2"/> very easy and fast for people to answer <pause dur="0.8"/> very easy for data processing <pause dur="2.0"/> but the argument goes that they are <pause dur="0.9"/> rather difficult to design the thing about multiple choice questions <pause dur="0.5"/> is that you are forcing people into certain <pause dur="0.6"/> answers <pause dur="0.7"/> if you do this is a good reason for piloting if you have a multiple choice question <pause dur="0.5"/> and <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="1.4"/> you pilot it you may find that people are not <pause dur="0.5"/> they don't put the issue that you're asking them about into <pause dur="0.2"/> that particular set of categories that you've imposed <pause dur="0.3"/> so that's where your pilots and qualitative research will help <pause dur="1.0"/> let me just show you an example of this <pause dur="21.2"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> so this is a <pause dur="1.5"/> questionnaire was actually done out of this course a couple of years ago <pause dur="0.3"/> and it was to try to 
ask <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> customers of a farm shop <pause dur="0.2"/> what they thought of the <pause dur="0.7"/> # outlet they were visiting <pause dur="0.6"/> and we had a screening question because <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> it's not actually on there but we had a screening process because <pause dur="0.2"/> we wanted to interview customers at the farm shop and non-customers so there was a <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> a screener for that but <pause dur="0.2"/> these <pause dur="0.3"/> are <pause dur="0.4"/> basically multiple choice questions of various sorts <pause dur="2.1"/> here's one thinking about your visits to the shop do you visit at specific times of the year <pause dur="0.3"/> and there were <pause dur="0.4"/> different options <pause dur="0.2"/> and it's multiple choice now if you're <pause dur="0.2"/> asking do you visit at specific times of the year <pause dur="1.4"/> summer autumn winter spring there are no other options <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> oh except for all the year round <pause dur="1.2"/> so <pause dur="0.8"/> you know that's a a a relatively simple example <pause dur="0.9"/> # <pause dur="2.4"/> we said thinking about your visits to the shop do you <pause dur="0.2"/> more often than not visit at specific times of the day <pause dur="0.4"/> morning lunchtime afternoon <pause dur="0.4"/> now <pause dur="0.4"/> for all we knew they might come in the middle of the night <pause dur="0.6"/> so we had <pause dur="0.4"/> a category called other and this is this is the sort of <pause dur="0.7"/> 
<trunc>p</trunc> a # a pilot would find out if people did unusual things or <pause dur="0.3"/> did things that were not <pause dur="0.3"/> listed on here <pause dur="1.2"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> what form of transport did you use <pause dur="1.3"/> car bus taxi foot bicycle <pause dur="0.4"/> or other <pause dur="0.3"/> so other in multiple choice questions other is obviously a catch-all <pause dur="0.4"/> # if you find everyone's ticking other <pause dur="0.3"/> then you've designed the thing badly <pause dur="0.8"/> because you haven't <pause dur="0.4"/> obviously identified the right <pause dur="0.8"/> answers that people are going to give and this again is where piloting and so on will <pause dur="0.6"/> # help <pause dur="4.1"/> the other thing is about bias <pause dur="0.8"/> and it's said that <pause dur="0.4"/> if <pause dur="0.4"/> you offer people options <pause dur="1.9"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> the order you put them in does make a difference <pause dur="0.2"/> now this is a <pause dur="0.3"/> this is all sort of fairly <pause dur="0.2"/> straightforward data i don't know if we can find <pause dur="1.2"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> something else <pause dur="1.8"/> okay how did you hear about the existence of the shop <pause dur="0.4"/> well on the radio from friends <trunc>newsp</trunc> now if they're trying to think about oh how did i <pause dur="0.3"/> hear about this <pause dur="0.7"/> you need to be careful about biasing the survey <pause dur="0.3"/> because of the order these are in and people might oh radio yeah <pause dur="0.4"/> 
i'll put radio down <pause dur="1.1"/> okay and there's there's there's various ways of getting round this and one is simply to <pause dur="0.4"/> randomize the order and have different <pause dur="0.2"/> questionnaires with different orders <pause dur="0.6"/> where do you do your main food shopping for the week <pause dur="0.7"/> again <pause dur="0.2"/> the the order may well be important <pause dur="8.4"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> dichotomous questions this is yes or no male or female whatever <pause dur="1.1"/> # very easy <pause dur="1.9"/> coding is very simple and it offers you the possibility of <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> using dummy variables in this <pause dur="3.1"/> so <pause dur="0.4"/> you can isolate how males and how females think about things <pause dur="0.4"/> but <pause dur="0.5"/> with some issues the it may not be seen in this dichotomous way it may not be <pause dur="0.6"/> # an issue of <pause dur="0.4"/> # either or <pause dur="1.0"/> and the wording becomes very important <pause dur="0.5"/> in order to to get the right sort of response <pause dur="0.4"/> just <pause dur="1.1"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> one thing i just forgot <pause dur="0.7"/> while we're talking about multiple choice questions <pause dur="0.8"/> the analysis and coding of multiple choice questions is really crucial <pause dur="1.2"/> because <pause dur="0.3"/> if you're thinking about <pause dur="2.1"/> the <pause dur="0.7"/> variables <pause dur="1.7"/> remember <pause dur="0.6"/> you're putting this into a spreadsheet or into some sort of analysis 
package <pause dur="0.3"/> and you've got variables and the variable has got to <pause dur="0.4"/> identify <pause dur="0.3"/> each of the bits of data that you're dealing with <pause dur="2.4"/> and if i just take one of these <pause dur="1.3"/> says where do you do your main food shopping for the week <pause dur="0.2"/> or month that's a very deliberate question because <pause dur="0.4"/> we felt <pause dur="0.3"/> that there should only be one answer to that <pause dur="0.3"/> where do you do your main food shopping <pause dur="0.4"/> but if we'd said <pause dur="0.2"/> where do you do your food shopping <pause dur="1.8"/> then these people could quite easily have ticked more than one answer <pause dur="0.7"/> and indeed they did even though we put the word main in there <pause dur="1.2"/> so you then come up with a problem <pause dur="0.5"/> because <pause dur="1.0"/> the question <pause dur="0.7"/> arises what is the variable here <pause dur="2.3"/> if we had one variable <pause dur="0.3"/> to cover <pause dur="0.4"/> main food shopping so we'd call it main food shop or something <pause dur="0.3"/> as the variable name <pause dur="0.6"/> then you'd enter a number <pause dur="1.0"/> dependent on which one of these they ticked <pause dur="0.5"/> but if they ticked two you're in real problems because <pause dur="0.5"/> you can't <pause dur="0.6"/> if if you've just got the one variable about main food shopping and then say i do my main <trunc>shop</trunc> 
food shopping in Asda and Waitrose <pause dur="1.7"/> then you can't interpret that <pause dur="0.5"/> and this is a key thing about multiple choice questions is that you <pause dur="0.5"/> need to decide whether it's tick one or tick more than one <pause dur="0.7"/> and if it's tick more than one <pause dur="0.4"/> then each of these has to become a variable <pause dur="2.0"/> and if you're doing this later on it's really important to to get that difference right <pause dur="0.7"/> you you sometimes see people do <pause dur="0.3"/> what <pause dur="0.7"/> what are really rather silly things like <pause dur="0.8"/> if if it's a a tick once so this is one variable called main food shopping <pause dur="1.3"/> you then you you see people <pause dur="0.3"/> trying to <pause dur="1.3"/> create a number so right we'll say number seven <pause dur="0.3"/> we'll call it number seven if they tick Tesco and Asda <pause dur="1.6"/> right and then we'll call it number eight if they tick Asda and Sainsbury but then what if they tick three <pause dur="0.3"/> and so on it just gets out of hand so if <pause dur="0.8"/> there's a possibility in a multiple choice answer of them ticking more than one box you need to <pause dur="0.3"/> create <pause dur="0.5"/> five <pause dur="0.2"/> variables <pause dur="0.3"/> and we've got some rather horrendous <pause dur="1.2"/> things here <pause dur="1.7"/> please 
indicate <pause dur="0.5"/> where you shop for the bulk <pause dur="0.3"/> your needs for the following products <pause dur="0.2"/> there's an awful lot of data <pause dur="0.3"/> that can be collected in a table like that <pause dur="0.7"/> and again <pause dur="0.6"/> as long as people only tick one we're we're all right but of course each of these is a variable <pause dur="1.0"/> they start ticking more than them then each cell <pause dur="0.4"/> becomes a variable <pause dur="0.6"/> and you get <pause dur="0.6"/> you can get very <pause dur="0.6"/> confused and get an awful lot of variables <pause dur="5.8"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> now there are lots of problems obviously in asking people questions <pause dur="4.2"/> they relate to things like sensitivity <pause dur="0.5"/> is the issue a tricky one <pause dur="3.3"/> they relate to the complexity of the questions <pause dur="1.7"/> they relate to the applicability of the questions can people answer them <pause dur="0.7"/> they relate to length <pause dur="1.0"/> so <pause dur="0.2"/> the length of the questions themselves and the <trunc>c</trunc> the length of the questionnaire <pause dur="0.4"/> is <pause dur="0.3"/> an issue <pause dur="1.1"/> and then <pause dur="0.7"/> as you'll see <pause dur="0.3"/> asking people hypothetical questions may be something that they're not very good at <pause dur="0.4"/> dealing with <pause dur="0.5"/> and <pause dur="0.4"/> asking people <pause dur="0.2"/> leading questions <pause dur="0.4"/> as you'll see can bias your results <pause dur="2.7"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> to help avoid this there's a little list of things <pause dur="0.5"/> that you need to avoid <pause dur="1.0"/> <unclear>follow</unclear> you want simple words you want clear words avoid things like leading people biasing people <pause dur="0.7"/> implicit assumptions like assuming somebody knows something <pause dur="0.6"/> # which they may not <pause dur="1.6"/>

right just to finish off the discussion of questionnaires we <pause dur="1.8"/> have collected the data let's assume that <pause dur="3.0"/> when i first <pause dur="0.4"/><vocal desc="laugh" iterated="n"/> <pause dur="0.4"/> when i first arrived here <pause dur="0.2"/> some years ago <pause dur="0.6"/> there was a unit called the data processing unit in our department <pause dur="0.7"/> and they still operated <pause dur="0.5"/> or there was one at that time there was one P-C in fact it was a Macintosh in the department <pause dur="1.6"/> and i think it had <pause dur="1.0"/> it had a hundred-and-twenty-eight K of <pause dur="0.6"/> RAM or something <pause dur="1.1"/> # <pause dur="1.0"/> anyway <pause dur="1.2"/> there was the data processing unit and they they still operated with punched cards <pause dur="0.6"/> and quite a lot of the terminology of <pause dur="0.2"/> market research comes from <pause dur="0.5"/> that <pause dur="0.7"/> that # <pause dur="0.6"/> period and you still got talk about people punching data in <pause dur="0.6"/> which is <pause dur="0.3"/> entering data in <pause dur="0.7"/> common parlance but these punch cards were <pause dur="0.3"/> exactly that little cards with holes in them <pause dur="0.9"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> and i remember seeing them do do a sort on this data so you had <pause dur="0.3"/> a hundred cards each of which represented a respondent <pause dur="0.5"/> and the sorting process if you wanted to <pause dur="0.4"/> take out the males or the females # <pause dur="0.2"/> was more or 
less a <trunc>s</trunc> <pause dur="0.3"/> a simplification but it <pause dur="0.3"/> it more or less involved sticking a sort of needle through <pause dur="0.5"/> the the hole that represented male <pause dur="0.2"/> and all the female cards dropped out and you had the <pause dur="0.6"/> the male cards were hanging on this little pole <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="1.1"/> nowadays we're a bit more sophisticated than that as you know <pause dur="0.9"/> but it is important to get the questionnaire properly coded it's very important that <pause dur="0.4"/> the <pause dur="0.3"/> as i i mentioned with respect to multiple choice questions <pause dur="0.4"/> # it's very important that <pause dur="0.2"/> the data is entered correctly <pause dur="1.5"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> and in a way that can be <pause dur="0.7"/> relatively easily understood <pause dur="0.5"/> and when we looked at S-P-S-S in the first week <pause dur="0.7"/> i said things like making sure the variable names are sensible <pause dur="0.3"/> making sure the descriptions of those variables are then even more sensible so you can <pause dur="0.4"/> remember and understand what you're analysing is <trunc>v</trunc> very important <pause dur="0.7"/> var one to var twenty is not actually very useful for anybody <pause dur="1.6"/> but multiple choice and factual questions basically <pause dur="0.2"/> code themselves as you've seen <pause dur="1.5"/> # <pause dur="8.4"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> you've got little 
coding <pause dur="0.7"/> numbers in there and that's quite standard on a questionnaire <pause dur="0.3"/> and they they code themselves and you use those numbers <pause dur="0.3"/> in this case <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="1.2"/> again if it's if it's a single answer in this case that will just be a number representing <pause dur="0.3"/> that answer it's simply a label it's nominal data <pause dur="4.4"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> factual questions code themselves <pause dur="0.2"/> how many kilometres of hedges have you removed <pause dur="0.6"/> they just give you a number <pause dur="0.6"/> open-ended <pause dur="0.3"/> as i said they need a coding frame in advance or <pause dur="0.3"/> ex-post codings after you've got all the <pause dur="0.3"/> results in you sort things into categories <pause dur="0.5"/> with open-ended questions and indeed with qualitative data there are <pause dur="0.2"/> bits of software that can help you with this there's a thing called Nudist you may have come across <pause dur="0.4"/> which is for classifying qualitative data <pause dur="0.8"/> largely for classifying <pause dur="0.5"/> data which is in the form of <pause dur="0.6"/> # transcriptions of recordings interviews focus groups or whatever <pause dur="1.2"/> and what Nudist basically does is pick out <pause dur="0.6"/> key words and organise them in a sort of hierarchy <pause dur="0.8"/> to try to 
establish what are the things that are most important to people <pause dur="1.9"/>
<kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> dichotomous use basically done in variables ones or zeros <pause dur="1.4"/> # <pause dur="0.9"/> so there's the questionnaire <pause dur="0.4"/> you'll see <pause dur="0.8"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" dur="3" iterated="y"/> just remind you of the things that we <pause dur="0.5"/> were asking <pause dur="0.3"/> so you've got <pause dur="0.8"/> the questionnaire number the interviewer the date the time <pause dur="0.5"/> # how far have you travelled what form of transport did you use <pause dur="0.3"/> what that looks like <pause dur="2.3"/> is that when you collect <pause dur="0.6"/> remember each <pause dur="0.3"/> row is a <pause dur="0.4"/> an observation each row is a person <pause dur="0.4"/> so you've got code number name date time <pause dur="0.3"/> and then you have to start getting into these <pause dur="0.2"/> variable names which <pause dur="0.5"/> i think it it ought to be the next <pause dur="0.7"/> innovation in computing i <shift feature="voice" new="laugh"/>think <pause dur="0.4"/> is that they ought to be able<shift feature="voice" new="normal"/> to let variable names go over eight letters and S-P-S-S <pause dur="0.5"/> the next versions i think should work on that <pause dur="0.2"/> because <pause dur="0.2"/> how far and transport and <pause dur="0.8"/> M-U-M-U-eighteen <pause dur="2.5"/> which must be number of <pause dur="0.5"/> can't even remember </u><u who="ss" trans="latching"> <gap reason="inaudible, multiple speakers" extent="3 secs"/></u><u who="nm0976" trans="latching"> number of people under eighteen with yeah okay so <pause dur="0.7"/> mm <pause dur="0.5"/> it was a few years ago but you do

are essentially three <pause dur="0.2"/> broad methods <pause dur="0.5"/> of <pause dur="0.6"/> or broad schools of thought with respect to qualitative research <pause dur="0.4"/> and by far the most important method <pause dur="0.4"/> and of course these are sort of <pause dur="0.6"/> # themes as well is the whole <pause dur="0.3"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="3"/> idea surrounding <pause dur="0.3"/> focus groups <pause dur="0.3"/>and focus groups are by far these days by far the most <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="1.1"/> used <pause dur="0.9"/> form of qualitative research <pause dur="0.6"/> but you also <pause dur="2.2"/> hear of with <trunc>y</trunc> <trunc>the</trunc> there are also <pause dur="0.8"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="6"/> there's also the possibility of conducting depth interviews <pause dur="3.7"/> which i'll say a little bit about in a moment and then there's a a <pause dur="1.1"/> area of research called motivational research <pause dur="4.6"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="8"/> which in some ways can be used <pause dur="0.5"/> as part of these two <pause dur="2.9"/> so we'll just deal with <pause dur="0.5"/> we'll deal with these first get them out of the way and then talk about focus groups <pause dur="2.9"/> just to repeat the <pause dur="0.5"/> objective of carrying out <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="1.2"/> qualitative research <pause dur="0.4"/> is <pause dur="0.2"/> really to generate ideas <pause dur="0.8"/> things like <pause dur="0.5"/> background information on a problem or a topic <pause dur="1.7"/> identifying concepts so concept identification i will as i said <pause dur="0.5"/> put some notes up that refer to this <pause dur="1.7"/> identifying relevant behaviour patterns and themes in the way people's <trunc>b</trunc> people behave <pause dur="1.3"/> establishing priorities how people <pause dur="0.5"/>

to <pause dur="0.4"/> # ensure that that doesn't happen <pause dur="0.3"/> so screening of products <pause dur="0.3"/> and concept testing is very important <pause dur="0.4"/> # area <pause dur="1.0"/> of this <pause dur="0.7"/> also post research investigations in other words to sort of back up the results of a survey <pause dur="0.4"/> you might well conduct some further qualitative research <pause dur="1.2"/> piloting as i mentioned <pause dur="0.3"/> my pilot <pause dur="0.4"/> questionnaires during the qualitative phase <pause dur="1.1"/> and as i also said <pause dur="0.8"/> # talking about personal issues and personal questions <pause dur="0.4"/> they will be easier to do with some form of qualitative research <pause dur="0.6"/> now <pause dur="0.6"/> depth interviews just to get them out of the way <pause dur="0.2"/> depth interviews are exactly as they sound <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="1.7"/> relatively long <pause dur="0.4"/> relatively <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="1.2"/> well very personal in other words it's just one person plus the interviewer <pause dur="0.7"/> trying to uncover people's often people's motivations people's attitudes <pause dur="0.4"/> and so on <pause dur="0.4"/> highly expensive of course 'cause it's very intensive you need a <pause dur="0.4"/> highly trained interviewer to do it to do it <pause dur="0.3"/> and extremely difficult to evaluate <pause dur="0.4"/> the consequences because <pause dur="0.4"/> each respondent basically has a <pause dur="0.4"/> a write-up of a rather <pause dur="0.4"/> conventionally rather long discussion <pause dur="0.6"/> so depth interviews <pause dur="0.3"/> i think to 
some extent are <pause dur="0.4"/> waning in in # <pause dur="1.0"/> popularity amongst market researchers <pause dur="0.8"/> focus groups are not <pause dur="0.6"/> the Blair government <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> has popularized focus group use in the <shift feature="voice" new="laugh"/> U-K <shift feature="voice" new="normal"/><pause dur="0.6"/> in the sense that they were very <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> open about having used focus groups to try to find out what sort of image they ought to put across <pause dur="0.3"/> so things like image <pause dur="0.6"/> image of a political party is something that lends itself very well <pause dur="0.4"/> to a focus group discussion <pause dur="2.2"/> a focus group and i'll show you two examples in a moment <pause dur="0.6"/> is <pause dur="2.8"/> usually a relatively small number of people <pause dur="0.5"/> between <pause dur="0.2"/> six and ten <pause dur="1.0"/> eight being the <pause dur="0.3"/> probably the optimum in most cases <pause dur="7.2"/> participants are brought together <pause dur="0.4"/> under the direction of a <pause dur="0.3"/> group leader of some sort <pause dur="0.9"/> # <pause dur="1.7"/> a trained person who is usually <pause dur="0.4"/> referred to as the moderator <pause dur="0.5"/> of the focus group <pause dur="2.4"/> in fact to call them the leader is probably wrong <pause dur="0.7"/> they are the moderator they're trying to moderate a discussion between <pause dur="0.8"/> eight people <pause dur="1.0"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> moderation means that they shouldn't really be <pause dur="0.4"/> too involved in it ideally <pause dur="0.6"/> a good 
focus group would <pause dur="1.1"/> last for an hour and a half and the moderator wouldn't <trunc>n</trunc> need to intervene at all <pause dur="0.8"/> that doesn't <pause dur="0.4"/> often happen because there needs to be some introduction there needs to be some direction <pause dur="0.4"/> as you'll see in a second <pause dur="1.7"/> the group <pause dur="0.5"/> the <trunc>m</trunc> the moderator <pause dur="0.2"/> should be just that they shouldn't intervene in the discussion they're not <pause dur="0.3"/> there to be part of the discussion <pause dur="0.8"/> quite often <pause dur="0.6"/> other members of a research team want to be involved in the focus group they'll say oh i'll sit in <pause dur="0.6"/> but that <pause dur="0.3"/> can distort the discussion as well it <trunc>s</trunc> <pause dur="0.4"/> it should be very genuinely a <pause dur="0.3"/> an independent discussion between eight <pause dur="0.3"/> people who are <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.8"/> genuine respondents <pause dur="4.9"/> the leader has various sorry the moderator has various <pause dur="0.4"/> # functions <pause dur="1.1"/> the moderator has got to <pause dur="0.2"/> make sure the discussion follows the route <pause dur="0.5"/> that it's supposed to <pause dur="0.3"/> but <pause dur="1.0"/> they need to do this in a relatively subtle way <pause dur="0.6"/> we did some work as you'll see <pause dur="0.8"/> looking at <pause dur="0.8"/> the attitudes of consumers to British meat products <pause dur="1.6"/> # now <pause dur="0.7"/> we were actually 
looking at the attitudes of Belgian consumers to British meat products <pause dur="0.6"/> # for the Meat and Livestock Commission <pause dur="0.3"/> who <pause dur="0.4"/> at the time of the B-S-E <pause dur="0.4"/> the height of the B-S-E affair were facing <pause dur="0.4"/> an export ban on beef and therefore were looking at <pause dur="0.5"/> the <pause dur="0.4"/> # prospects for other <pause dur="0.9"/> products like <pause dur="0.5"/> # lamb and pork so we were looking particularly at those products <pause dur="1.2"/> # <pause dur="2.2"/> we didn't <pause dur="0.7"/> we or the the research team did not go straight into a focus group and say right we're going to talk about British meat <pause dur="1.7"/> because what we wanted to do was to get people's confidence and to build up <pause dur="0.4"/> their <pause dur="0.3"/> # or build up rapport with them so # okay they knew it was about food consumption <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> what you ideally want in a focus group <pause dur="0.3"/> is for people to lead you <pause dur="0.7"/> so if you're the moderator and there's a group of people <pause dur="0.5"/> chatting away about something and somebody says <pause dur="0.5"/> oh i'm not very keen on British meat <pause dur="1.4"/> that is your cue to bring them in and to <trunc>s</trunc> start the <pause dur="0.2"/> the subject going on rather than saying right it's <pause dur="0.4"/> you know it's half past twelve now we're going to talk about British meat <pause dur="0.4"/> you want 
to let people <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.8"/> guide you in some ways and the and the skill of the moderator's in recognizing those signs and making sure that <pause dur="0.4"/> # they're picked up on and the the discussion is <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> or follows a <pause dur="0.2"/> a <pause dur="0.6"/> particular course <pause dur="2.4"/> focus groups are popular for lots of <pause dur="0.7"/> perfectly valid reasons <pause dur="1.3"/> in some ways they're relatively cheap <pause dur="2.2"/> certainly compared with individual interviews it's relatively cheap to get eight people together <pause dur="0.3"/> even so <pause dur="0.5"/> the going rate at the moment for <pause dur="0.7"/> participation in focus group is about twenty-five quid <pause dur="0.5"/> we're trying to recruit some people at the moment and <pause dur="0.3"/> twenty-five quid <pause dur="0.4"/> is # <pause dur="0.3"/> seen as <pause dur="0.8"/> a reasonable rate to pay people for a <pause dur="0.3"/> couple of hours of their time <pause dur="0.3"/> if you're doing this for a professional agency you probably also <pause dur="0.5"/> pay travel expenses and so on <pause dur="0.4"/> you've got to <pause dur="0.4"/> hire a <pause dur="0.4"/> facility <pause dur="1.1"/> there's one in Reading called Sight and Sound <pause dur="0.5"/> typical facility would be <pause dur="0.6"/> probably about the a room about this size but <pause dur="0.3"/> from here to the wall would be split off <pause dur="0.4"/> and there'd be a big <pause dur="0.5"/> # single 
way mirror <pause dur="0.4"/> in the wall <pause dur="0.5"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> the research group can sit behind the mirror <pause dur="0.4"/> and observe what's going on in the <pause dur="0.3"/> in the room sometimes video is used <trunc>m</trunc> more often than not <pause dur="0.4"/> video is used either in addition to that or instead of it <pause dur="0.9"/> so focus groups are <pause dur="0.4"/> tape recorded they're videoed <pause dur="0.4"/> and <pause dur="0.5"/> # this this facility in Reading is extremely good and you can <pause dur="0.3"/> you can watch as a member of the research team <pause dur="0.6"/> market research code of ethics <pause dur="0.5"/> says that people have to be informed <pause dur="0.2"/> that the research team is sitting behind the mirror <pause dur="0.9"/> # which i think is fair enough and <pause dur="0.7"/> as as the <pause dur="0.6"/> moderator says this they say oh <pause dur="0.4"/> you know you ought to know that behind that wall there's a few people there <trunc>obser</trunc> <trunc>a</trunc> and <pause dur="0.7"/> focus group goes completely quiet and oh my God you know can't <pause dur="0.3"/> you know can't put up with that and within five minutes they've completely forgotten about it <pause dur="0.4"/> as is as they've forgotten about the fact they're being videoed <pause dur="0.9"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> and then after two hours you sort of introduce yourselves to them and like

sure this was a few years back and it probably doesn't apply at all now <pause dur="0.3"/> but it actually <pause dur="0.4"/> resonates with what i was <shift feature="voice" new="laugh"/>saying about<shift feature="voice" new="normal"/> our <pause dur="0.6"/> Belgian males and females <pause dur="1.1"/> # a car of your own <pause dur="1.7"/> pleasant convenient say women it's fine to have it's nice to have <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> men say i take good care of it it's a good thing it's absolutely a necessity <pause dur="0.5"/> so you get <pause dur="0.4"/> if you were an advertiser this would be really important and <pause dur="0.3"/> let's face it whatever you think about this and however out of date it is <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.9"/> <shift feature="voice" new="laugh"/>gender <pause dur="0.2"/> is extremely important<shift feature="voice" new="normal"/> in advertising <pause dur="0.6"/> you could you can watch almost any <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> particularly T-V advert because they're the most visual and the most active <pause dur="0.4"/> you can watch almost any one and if you start thinking about <pause dur="0.3"/> what segment are they aiming at <pause dur="0.6"/> and what is the sort of message they're putting across <pause dur="0.2"/> you'll soon find that <pause dur="0.6"/> things like this become very important <pause dur="0.6"/> and <pause dur="1.0"/> you know if <pause dur="0.5"/> it's certainly in the U-K <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="2.2"/> and i think i mean cars is always a good example of this <pause dur="0.4"/> but <pause dur="0.5"/> you can <trunc>i</trunc> i'll i'll leave you to 
draw your own conclusion but you can look at <pause dur="0.5"/> car ads for things like the Renault Clio <pause dur="0.9"/> and Citroen Saxa <pause dur="1.0"/> and you could <pause dur="0.3"/> almost certainly identify a gender bias in that sort of advertising <pause dur="0.5"/> and same for different models so <pause dur="0.2"/> just keep an eye on that because <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.8"/> i can guarantee <pause dur="0.3"/> that <pause dur="0.2"/> almost every T-V advert is backed up by qualitative research of some sort where <pause dur="0.4"/> the researchers have tried to establish <pause dur="0.4"/> the sort of basic motivations that people have <pause dur="0.3"/> for dealing with that <pause dur="0.5"/> vehicle or </u><u who="sf0984" trans="overlap"> i was going to say that there's direct correlation between that and advertising cars is the new Fiat <pause dur="0.2"/> we've got the woman talking about the men the man's point of view # <pause dur="0.6"/> <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> the man talking about the woman's point of view <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 word"/> have you seen that one yet </u><u who="nm0976" trans="latching"> right is that <pause dur="0.8"/> i mean the <trunc>fi</trunc> Fiat have have done a lot of this they had that <distinct lang="it"> spirito di punto</distinct> thing for the Fiat Punto </u><u who="sf0984" trans="overlap"> mm </u><pause dur="0.5"/> <u who="nm0976" trans="pause"> there's <trunc>alwa</trunc> there's often a male female thing in <pause dur="0.2"/> car i mean <pause dur="0.9"/> if you want sort of classic marketing texts you read something like <pause dur="0.7"/> # if there's a <pause dur="0.2"/> book called the hidden persuaders i think i've got it on a <pause dur="1.3"/> on a reference list somewhere <pause dur="0.6"/> by a guy called Vance 
Packard which again is about nineteen-fifties America about how <pause dur="0.3"/> car <pause dur="0.3"/> manufacturers persuade people to buy things and and <pause dur="1.3"/> i mean at that time if you think of American cars in the fifties and the sort of style and size and <pause dur="0.6"/> and shape of these things they were <pause dur="0.2"/> they were making very <pause dur="0.2"/> definite sort of psychological claims on people <pause dur="1.0"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> and where you <pause dur="0.5"/> you know particularly sports <shift feature="voice" new="laugh"/>cars <shift feature="voice" new="normal"/><pause dur="0.5"/> and the sort of <pause dur="0.3"/> connotations that go with owning and driving a sports car <pause dur="0.5"/> which i'll leave to your imagination <pause dur="0.7"/><vocal desc="laughter" n="ss" iterated="y" dur="1"/> but # <pause dur="1.2"/> you know it's a lot of it would be based on this sort of work definitely <pause dur="2.6"/> okay so it's conjoint analysis next week that's a way of <pause dur="0.6"/> designing new products basically <pause dur="0.5"/> common market research problem <pause dur="1.3"/> thanks <pause dur="3.3"/> can you pull the blinds up <pause dur="0.2"/> thanks
