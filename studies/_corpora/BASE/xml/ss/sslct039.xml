they've got so many words to make up if they're going to compete <pause dur="0.5"/> with native speakers <pause dur="1.1"/> # <pause dur="2.0"/> okay i'll just give <trunc>ha</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> i'll give you one more handout <pause dur="1.9"/> or two more handouts <pause dur="2.4"/><event desc="passes out handouts" iterated="n"/> yeah <pause dur="1.7"/> so far <pause dur="0.3"/> we've just been thinking about <pause dur="0.4"/> in fact i'll take can i have one <pause dur="5.6"/> # so far i've just been talking about testing people on word recognition <pause dur="0.7"/> well <pause dur="0.2"/> just just started talking about <pause dur="0.4"/> but many of you would be unhappy with that in fact # <pause dur="0.4"/> who was it who was saying is it productive <pause dur="0.7"/> was it <trunc>y</trunc> was it <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> or yeah <pause dur="0.4"/> yes <pause dur="0.2"/> i mean that that's a whole new question isn't it <pause dur="0.3"/> this there's <pause dur="0.6"/> # <trunc>be</trunc> # it's one thing in being able to recognize a word <pause dur="0.3"/> it's quite another to really be able to say you know <pause dur="0.3"/> that word <pause dur="0.8"/> in fact <pause dur="0.9"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> it's a cline like everything is in applied linguistics isn't it <pause dur="0.3"/> it's there's not just a yes or a no answer to whether you know a word <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> all of us in our first languages too <pause dur="0.5"/> we know words words to 
varying extents <pause dur="0.3"/> <trunc>s</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> on the first on one side you've got knowing a word haven't you </u><pause dur="0.6"/> <u who="sf1331" trans="pause"> mm </u><u who="nf1292" trans="overlap"> <unclear>yeah</unclear> <pause dur="0.4"/> and that's just if we'd had time i would have asked you what you thought knowing a word meant but there isn't time <pause dur="0.7"/> so <pause dur="0.4"/> just have a quick look at that <pause dur="1.2"/> # <pause dur="1.7"/> you may be able to think of more aspects to knowing a word than are listed here <pause dur="5.3"/> so there are many many <pause dur="1.4"/> there are many many # <pause dur="1.8"/> aspects to knowing a word <pause dur="0.6"/> and <pause dur="0.6"/> there are many words in English which i <pause dur="0.7"/> can recognize <pause dur="0.3"/> but i can't <pause dur="0.2"/> answer all <kinesic desc="indicates point on handout" iterated="n"/> those questions about and i'm sure that's true for everyone here for their first language <pause dur="0.4"/> as well as any other languages they may know <pause dur="1.9"/> in fact i heard on the radio they were interviewing someone <pause dur="0.5"/> and they said <pause dur="0.3"/> <trunc>y</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> he said oh i <trunc>w</trunc> i <trunc>we</trunc> i studied languages <pause dur="0.4"/> and the interviewer said <pause dur="0.3"/> well did you learn <shift feature="voice" new="laugh"/>them <vocal desc="laugh" iterated="n"/> <shift feature="voice" new="normal"/><pause dur="0.2"/> i thought what a stupid question because <pause dur="0.2"/> <vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" n="sl" dur="1"/> <pause dur="0.3"/> i mean the you don't just sort of say oh i've learned it <shift feature="voice" new="laugh"/>now that's the end <shift feature="voice" new="normal"/><vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" n="ss" dur="1"/><pause dur="0.3"/> because everything is ongoing 
<shift feature="voice" new="laugh"/>isn't it you're <pause dur="0.3"/><shift feature="voice" new="normal"/> you're learning more and more all the time in <trunc>ev</trunc> in every language <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="2.2"/> so <pause dur="0.3"/><vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/><pause dur="1.6"/> over the page <pause dur="0.5"/> you've got <pause dur="0.4"/> a suggestion for an interview format <pause dur="0.4"/> if you were trying to find out <pause dur="0.3"/> how much word knowledge <pause dur="0.6"/> an interviewee had <pause dur="0.7"/> yeah <pause dur="0.7"/> and you can see it's a much more complex business than simply saying do you recognize this word yes no <pause dur="1.0"/> and if as <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> was suggesting you wanted to find out about the productive knowledge <pause dur="0.3"/> of <pause dur="0.3"/> for example <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/>'s subjects <pause dur="0.5"/> in the Engineering department <pause dur="0.2"/> you'd have to <pause dur="0.8"/> <trunc>y</trunc> ideally <pause dur="0.3"/> you'd get them all <pause dur="0.3"/> in <trunc>sh</trunc> she <pause dur="0.2"/> she # she asked hundreds <pause dur="0.4"/> of students i mean it would <trunc>ta</trunc> be <shift feature="voice" new="laugh"/>very long <shift feature="voice" new="normal"/><pause dur="0.3"/> drawn out process wouldn't it it # <pause dur="0.2"/> hundreds of words for hundreds of students you'd <pause dur="0.4"/> <shift feature="voice" new="laugh"/>you know you'd be <shift feature="voice" new="normal"/> take years and years and years but that i mean that would be the ideal <pause dur="0.9"/> and so just before we stop <pause dur="0.3"/> does # anyone got any questions on <kinesic desc="indicates handout" iterated="n"/> this do you do you understand <pause dur="0.2"/> it in principle <pause dur="2.1"/> someone <pause dur="0.6"/> <trunc>o</trunc> here <pause dur="0.2"/> might be interested in doing # <pause dur="0.7"/> a 
piece of research of this nature <pause dur="0.3"/> with a group of subjects for their dissertation <pause dur="1.0"/> no i mean <pause dur="0.2"/> you'd have <pause dur="0.3"/> on a small scale that certainly would be an interesting experiment wouldn't it <pause dur="0.3"/> to find out <pause dur="0.4"/> in depth <trunc>voco</trunc> vocabulary knowledge for a small number of subjects following <kinesic desc="indicates point on handout" iterated="n"/> this sort of model <pause dur="2.1"/> # <pause dur="1.3"/> i'll just hand i'll give you one more <pause dur="0.6"/> handout <pause dur="1.1"/> because <pause dur="1.0"/><event desc="passes out handouts" iterated="n"/> # this is an experiment <pause dur="0.2"/> <trunc>f</trunc> <pause dur="0.6"/> someone called # <trunc>corso</trunc> <pause dur="0.4"/> i can't remember his first name <pause dur="1.0"/> David <pause dur="0.3"/> David Corson <pause dur="1.1"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> who was <pause dur="0.2"/> he wasn't working with # <pause dur="1.1"/> he wasn't working with <pause dur="0.8"/> non-native speakers David Corson writes about <pause dur="0.2"/> native speakers of English <pause dur="0.6"/> and he has <pause dur="0.4"/> a kind of bee in his bonnet about class <pause dur="0.9"/> # <trunc>i</trunc> <pause dur="0.3"/> and he argues that <pause dur="2.2"/> children whose <pause dur="0.3"/> families <pause dur="0.2"/> don't belong to the class where <pause dur="0.4"/> Greek and Latin <pause dur="0.2"/> was taught in the past <pause dur="0.5"/> are disadvantaged throughout their educational lives <pause dur="0.4"/> and that is why he says in <pause dur="0.4"/> English speaking countries <pause dur="0.2"/> lower class working class children <pause dur="0.4"/> don't succeed <pause dur="0.4"/> academically on the whole <pause dur="0.7"/> this this is his thesis <pause dur="0.6"/> he says <pause dur="0.2"/> the real reason is
