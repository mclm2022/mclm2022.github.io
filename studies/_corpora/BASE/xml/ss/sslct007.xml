two weeks time <pause dur="0.5"/> and you've already had a lecture with him <pause dur="0.8"/> so <pause dur="0.2"/> i'm going to spend this week and next week <pause dur="0.2"/> looking at the European Union <pause dur="0.2"/> harmonization process <pause dur="1.4"/> because it has <pause dur="0.9"/> many # <pause dur="0.2"/> points i think that are important for the future about relative success and failure <pause dur="1.7"/> # <pause dur="0.8"/> and what we're going to do is it's going to be excruciatingly boring <pause dur="0.7"/> is we're going to <event desc="student enters room" n="su1114" iterated="n"/> come in we're going to look <pause dur="0.7"/> at <pause dur="1.5"/> two of the main instruments of harmonization <pause dur="0.7"/> within Europe <pause dur="0.9"/> the first is something called the Fourth Directive which i'm going to look at this week <pause dur="0.7"/> and the second is the Seventh Directive that i'll look at next week and then we shall look at some developments in the European Commission <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> that <pause dur="0.9"/> tie pieces together <pause dur="1.0"/> right <pause dur="0.2"/> so it's not i better warn you it's not <shift feature="voice" new="laugh"/>going to be a terribly exciting <shift feature="voice" new="normal"/><pause dur="0.6"/> area but i think it's good for the soul <pause dur="0.7"/> you may find it quite interesting <pause dur="0.4"/> to see why these things <pause dur="0.5"/> have had relative success or failure <pause dur="1.1"/> right well what i want to do first is just to because i know <pause dur="0.2"/> some of some of you are not from the European Union at all <pause dur="0.6"/> some of you are <pause dur="0.6"/> from the European Union 
countries <pause dur="0.6"/> # i just want to take a very simple view <pause dur="0.5"/> of what the European Union consists of <pause dur="0.9"/> and <vocal desc="cough" iterated="n"/> <pause dur="0.3"/> the first point is that <pause dur="1.3"/> it's been called various names in its history <pause dur="0.9"/> the European Communities Common Market the European Community the single market and we're now called the European Union <pause dur="0.9"/> but in its origin <pause dur="1.0"/> <kinesic desc="writes on board" dur="7" iterated="y"/> it started <pause dur="0.7"/> with a treaty <pause dur="0.4"/> signed by <pause dur="0.8"/> a small number of continental countries <pause dur="0.2"/> basically the Benelux countries <pause dur="0.4"/> France Italy <pause dur="0.2"/> and Germany <pause dur="1.4"/> who signed a Treaty of Rome <pause dur="1.8"/> and the political aspect to it was <pause dur="0.2"/> that of course it was <pause dur="0.7"/> the idea that there should be no more war in Europe <pause dur="0.2"/> after the Second World War but we're going back to nineteen-fifty-seven for that <pause dur="0.2"/> we're going some way <pause dur="1.2"/> and the original Treaty of Rome had three <pause dur="0.3"/> central economic objectives <pause dur="1.5"/> there was a political dimension but it had three <pause dur="0.3"/> basic objectives now <pause dur="0.3"/> do you know what they are <pause dur="0.3"/> what was the original idea <pause dur="0.4"/> come on you're you're from European <pause dur="0.5"/> Union countries what's the </u><u who="sm1116" trans="overlap"> <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 word"/> energy i think <pause dur="0.3"/> <trunc>someth</trunc> something about energy </u><pause dur="0.7"/> <u who="nm1112" trans="pause"> well there was </u><u who="sm1116" trans="overlap"> <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 word"/> steel </u><u who="nm1112" trans="latching"> yeah you're right in fact there were <trunc>t</trunc> that's why it's called communities </u><u who="sm1116" trans="latching"> yeah </u><u who="nm1112" trans="latching">
there was European Economic Community and the European Coal and Steel Community <pause dur="0.8"/> but if i take the European Economic Community what was the aim what were the three central points <pause dur="0.3"/> shh <pause dur="1.6"/> what was the three central points </u><u who="sm1117" trans="latching"> is that the <trunc>com</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> common policy # <pause dur="0.4"/> <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/></u> <pause dur="4.8"/><u who="nm1112" trans="pause"> # very easy to remember honestly they all begin the word free <pause dur="2.0"/> free something <pause dur="0.3"/> free something <pause dur="0.4"/> free something <pause dur="1.6"/><shift feature="voice" new="whisp"/> come on <shift feature="voice" new="normal"/></u> <pause dur="2.7"/><u who="su1115" trans="pause"> free</u> <pause dur="0.7"/> <u who="nm1112" trans="pause"> free </u> <pause dur="0.5"/> <u who="sf1118" trans="pause"> <gap reason="inaudible" extent="4 secs"/> </u><pause dur="0.7"/> <u who="nm1112" trans="pause"> you're on the right lines the word is free trade <pause dur="0.6"/> <kinesic desc="writes on board" dur="5" iterated="y"/> it was the removal <pause dur="0.8"/> of <pause dur="0.4"/> tariff barriers <pause dur="0.5"/> and quotas between the member states that would allow free trade without restriction <pause dur="1.0"/> so that was one <pause dur="1.3"/> the second one was <pause dur="2.3"/> right i'll give you a clue <pause dur="1.3"/> what is it that underpins <pause dur="0.3"/> the fact that you are <trunc>soc</trunc> the Socrates scheme <pause dur="0.5"/> you're here studying in the U-K </u><pause dur="0.4"/> <u who="sm1116" trans="pause"> <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/><pause dur="0.8"/> movement of <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 word"/></u><u who="nm1112" trans="latching"> good free movement of labour <pause dur="6.4"/> <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="8"/> good <pause dur="1.3"/> and there was a third one </u><pause dur="0.6"/><u who="sm1116" trans="pause"> free transportation of goods</u> <pause dur="0.5"/> <u who="nm1112" trans="pause"> no i don't know </u><u who="ss" trans="overlap"> <gap reason="inaudible, multiple speakers" extent="2 secs"/></u><u who="nm1112" trans="overlap"> well i think that comes under free trade doesn't it <pause dur="1.2"/> free <pause dur="0.6"/> movement of </u> <pause dur="2.0"/> <u who="sm1116" trans="pause"> money</u><pause dur="1.1"/> <u who="nm1112" trans="pause"> i like it <pause dur="0.2"/> yeah <pause dur="0.2"/> free movement <pause dur="1.1"/> of <pause dur="0.2"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="4"/> capital <pause dur="1.0"/> so these were the three central <pause dur="0.7"/> ideas in <trunc>ter</trunc> economic terms before we ever had the idea of a single market 
before we had the idea of a euro <pause dur="0.7"/> this was the starting point <pause dur="0.7"/> of the European Economic Community <pause dur="0.5"/> right now i want to ask you this question i want to think <pause dur="1.4"/> the European Communities later Union <pause dur="0.9"/> embarked upon a process <pause dur="0.2"/> of the harmonization of company law <pause dur="0.7"/> in the member states <pause dur="2.7"/> why <pause dur="0.9"/> how <pause dur="0.6"/> how did that they started right from the beginning <pause dur="1.9"/> what had that got to do with this <pause dur="1.0"/> why would the European Economic Community <pause dur="0.3"/> be interested in trying to bring accounting systems company law in each of the member states why would it think about <pause dur="0.9"/> bringing them together harmonizing them <pause dur="1.7"/> can you construct a rationale <pause dur="0.4"/> looking at these </u><pause dur="0.6"/> <u who="sm1117" trans="pause"> <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/></u><pause dur="0.9"/> <u who="nm1112" trans="pause"> a bit more </u><u who="sm1117" trans="latching"> in order to <pause dur="0.4"/> come free movement of capital <pause dur="0.4"/> only for someone from England or <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 word"/> <pause dur="0.4"/> <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> France and <pause dur="0.5"/> invest in France </u><pause dur="0.5"/> <u who="nm1112" trans="overlap"> <trunc>abs</trunc> </u><u who="sm1117" trans="overlap"> and share a common <pause dur="0.5"/> government system </u><pause dur="0.3"/> <u who="nm1112" trans="pause"> absolutely right <pause dur="0.5"/> the idea was this the free movement of capital was originally about <pause dur="0.4"/> <trunc>s</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> you know getting rid of <trunc>th</trunc> exchange control so the money flows would be free within the European Community <pause dur="0.7"/> but then it led on to the the following idea <pause dur="0.8"/> if i am somebody with some funds in the U-K <pause dur="1.1"/> 
and i am thinking of investing in a company <pause dur="2.0"/> this principle <pause dur="0.2"/> should mean that there should be no barriers to my investing in a British company or French company or an Italian company <pause dur="2.3"/> however the decision about where i'm going to invest my funds is critically dependent <pause dur="0.5"/> upon the fact that the companies are comparable <pause dur="1.8"/> and that the financial information that those companies provide to me <pause dur="0.7"/> are <pause dur="0.3"/> of a kind and a nature that i can make a comparison between them <pause dur="0.7"/> to find the best investment opportunity <pause dur="2.0"/> so this argued therefore for harmonizing company law <pause dur="0.9"/> and for getting equivalent kinds of financial information for me to be able to make a decision <pause dur="0.9"/> that <pause dur="0.2"/> was in a sense a consequence of this central principle <pause dur="1.2"/> and indeed we find this idea of harmonizing company law <pause dur="0.5"/> in the Treaty of Rome <pause dur="0.3"/> <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="6"/> in a very obscure section <pause dur="0.6"/> article <pause dur="0.5"/> fifty-four section three subsection G <pause dur="0.6"/> forever engraved on your hearts <pause dur="0.7"/> this is the origin <pause dur="0.4"/> of <pause dur="0.3"/> the company law harmonization

from each of the member states <pause dur="0.2"/> and the council <pause dur="0.2"/> then will reflect the topic under discussion so if it's <pause dur="0.4"/> if there is an agricultural issue <pause dur="0.9"/> that is to be decided like the common agricultural policy <pause dur="0.5"/> the council will consist of the Minister of Agriculture from Britain the Minister of Agriculture from Belgium the Minister of Agriculture from <pause dur="1.1"/> # Italy and so forth <pause dur="1.9"/> now <vocal desc="cough" iterated="n"/> these <pause dur="0.8"/> are the four institutions <pause dur="1.4"/> and under the Treaty of Rome and everything subsequent to it <pause dur="0.7"/> the European Communities or as it's now called European Union <pause dur="0.5"/> can produce law <pause dur="1.2"/> which <pause dur="0.9"/> affects all of the member states of the Union <pause dur="0.7"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> very simply and i am oversimplifying here <pause dur="0.5"/> there are two kinds of law <pause dur="0.4"/> that can be produced <pause dur="1.6"/> and this law of course <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="6"/> can be tested <pause dur="0.5"/> in the European Court of Justice <pause dur="0.9"/> which is not the European Court of Human Rights let me tell you <pause dur="1.1"/> the first type of law <pause dur="0.5"/> are something called regulations <pause dur="0.8"/> and the second <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="4"/> type of law <pause dur="2.1"/> is called directives so we have <pause dur="0.5"/> European Regulations and European Directives <pause dur="0.5"/> does

and the sources of regulations can either be the Commission <pause dur="0.2"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="1"/> can issue one <pause dur="0.9"/> on its own <pause dur="0.9"/> or <pause dur="0.2"/> a Council of Ministers can issue one <pause dur="0.3"/> on its own <pause dur="1.6"/> and once they are published in the Official Journal <pause dur="0.8"/> they have legal effect <pause dur="0.9"/> and they tend to be <pause dur="0.6"/> used for let's say minor matters like <pause dur="0.3"/> let's think of a silly example of one recently <pause dur="0.2"/> the amount of real cream <pause dur="1.0"/> in the ice cream that you buy <pause dur="1.1"/> the amount of pig meat <pause dur="0.2"/> in a sausage <pause dur="1.1"/> all right <pause dur="0.2"/> these are technical minor things that come <pause dur="0.5"/> and once the regulation has been issued that's it <kinesic desc="clicks fingers" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.2"/> has effect in the U-K in Belgium and in Spain or wherever <pause dur="1.7"/> so these are minor matters <pause dur="0.5"/> but for important issues <pause dur="0.6"/> the legal instrument is a directive <pause dur="1.7"/> right <pause dur="7.9"/> <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="13"/> and these are only binding <pause dur="0.4"/> i'll write it so it's clear for you <pause dur="3.2"/>  and this is half your point actually <pause dur="0.8"/> oh binding only when <pause dur="1.5"/> <vocal desc="cough" iterated="n"/> <pause dur="1.2"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="17"/> they are <pause dur="1.2"/> enacted <pause dur="2.8"/> by <pause dur="0.7"/> the parliaments <pause dur="5.1"/> of the 
member states <pause dur="1.4"/> i'm running out of <pause dur="0.2"/> pens here <pause dur="7.8"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="6"/> right <pause dur="0.7"/> in other words once a directive <pause dur="1.2"/> is published in the Official Journal <pause dur="0.5"/> of the European Union <pause dur="0.3"/> it has no legal effect <pause dur="1.0"/> what has to happen is that the <pause dur="0.2"/> individual parliaments have to <trunc>cr</trunc> <pause dur="0.4"/> put it into national law <pause dur="0.8"/> and they normally have a delay <pause dur="0.9"/> in which to do it they must do it <pause dur="1.3"/> but they have time <pause dur="0.4"/> to put it into national law using national phrasing <pause dur="1.2"/> right <pause dur="0.7"/> now these are for important issues and the procedures for <pause dur="0.3"/> for actually <pause dur="0.3"/> these directives being published or the word is adopted <pause dur="0.5"/> by the European Union <pause dur="0.8"/> are quite complicated <pause dur="0.3"/> and <pause dur="0.3"/> normally what happens is this <pause dur="1.7"/> the commission the civil service has an idea <pause dur="0.4"/> for a directive <pause dur="0.9"/> right <pause dur="0.6"/> it publishes a draft <pause dur="1.1"/> first draft <pause dur="0.6"/> the draft <pause dur="0.4"/> goes to the parliament for consultation <pause dur="0.8"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="17"/> goes back to the commission <pause dur="2.0"/> and then it may go backwards and forwards several times <pause dur="1.1"/> and then the commission <pause dur="0.4"/> puts a draft to the Council of Ministers and it goes <pause dur="0.2"/> back <pause dur="0.7"/> and it goes back again <pause dur="1.8"/> and it is a vote of the Council of Ministers <pause dur="0.9"/> not the <trunc>commiss</trunc> the commission can't do it on its own the parliament can't 
do it on its own it's only the Council of Ministers <pause dur="1.0"/> that <pause dur="0.4"/> adopts notice the verb <pause dur="0.5"/> adopts the directive <pause dur="1.0"/> once they adopt the directive <pause dur="0.2"/> it's published in the Official Journal of the European Communities <pause dur="0.8"/> or the European Union as it now is <pause dur="0.5"/> and then there is an obligation on the governments of the member states to put it into national law <pause dur="0.5"/> into their own national law <pause dur="2.2"/> so very <pause dur="0.2"/> are there any questions on that <pause dur="0.4"/> anyone i i'm sketching and oversimplifying <pause dur="0.3"/> but i want you to understand <pause dur="0.5"/> what a directive is how roughly how it happens particularly the notion of a draft <pause dur="1.0"/> the notion of adoption <pause dur="0.6"/> and then the requirement for national legislates <pause dur="0.4"/> to <pause dur="0.2"/> enact it or put it into national law <pause dur="2.0"/> <vocal desc="cough" iterated="n"/> okay <pause dur="0.5"/> no questions <pause dur="0.9"/> it's a lot of fun isn't it <pause dur="1.9"/> right <pause dur="0.4"/> well let's look at what this <pause dur="1.0"/> harmonization programme on company law <pause dur="0.5"/> and the <trunc>direct</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> under <trunc>de</trunc> the directive system has been <pause dur="0.7"/> for <pause dur="0.2"/> <vocal desc="cough" iterated="n"/> the European Communities <pause dur="0.7"/> and if you look at the first page of the handout 
you'll see a list <pause dur="0.6"/> of <pause dur="0.2"/> the principal directives that <pause dur="0.6"/> <trunc>ac</trunc> been emitted <pause dur="0.2"/> from or adopted and enacted <pause dur="0.8"/> from # the European Communities <pause dur="0.3"/> and you'll see that they cover quite a long time period <pause dur="0.7"/> each directive the first one in sixty-eight the last one ten just over ten years ago <pause dur="0.8"/> and you'll see they're each given a number <pause dur="1.4"/> you'll also see that some of them <pause dur="0.3"/> have never been adopted <pause dur="0.6"/> in other words the Council of Ministers has never said yes <pause dur="0.9"/> they only exist in draft <pause dur="1.0"/> so for example the Fifth Directive <pause dur="0.6"/> which would have brought <pause dur="0.4"/> employees <pause dur="0.3"/> onto company boards of directors if they were public companies <pause dur="0.8"/> has never been agreed the Council of Ministers <pause dur="1.6"/> actually that's Mrs Thatcher <pause dur="0.5"/> she wouldn't allow it to be a directive <pause dur="0.5"/> to be adopted <pause dur="0.8"/> and the Ninth and the Tenth equally <pause dur="1.6"/> well what i want to do is just to go through and pick out the important ones <pause dur="0.2"/> <vocal desc="cough" iterated="n"/> <pause dur="0.8"/> first of all let me talk about the First Directive very early on <pause dur="1.2"/> it did three things two of which are mentioned here and the third which isn't <pause dur="1.5"/> first of all it defined what companies could do <pause dur="0.3"/> whether they were Italian <pause dur="0.7"/> or French or 
German or British or any of them <pause dur="1.1"/> their powers <pause dur="0.2"/> that defined also <pause dur="0.3"/> the powers and duties of directors of <pause dur="0.2"/> companies <pause dur="0.9"/> those two points are mentioned <pause dur="1.4"/> the third point which is not mentioned is an accounting point <pause dur="1.6"/> the First Directive made it an obligation <pause dur="0.8"/> on national governments <pause dur="0.5"/> to establish <pause dur="0.2"/> a company registry <pause dur="0.2"/> or registries <pause dur="0.8"/> into which companies would file their accounts <pause dur="0.7"/> for public disclosure <pause dur="2.3"/> now for some countries like <pause dur="0.3"/> although the U-K wasn't a member of the # the European Communities of that date <pause dur="0.5"/> some countries there has always been a company registry <pause dur="1.2"/> there has <trunc>co</trunc> there's Companies House in the U-K where companies must deposit their accounts <pause dur="1.7"/> in France <vocal desc="cough" iterated="n"/> you've always had some <pause dur="0.8"/> but you know that that they are local <pause dur="0.9"/> <distinct lang="fr">les Tribunaux de Commerce</distinct><pause dur="0.6"/> okay <pause dur="0.7"/> in other countries like Greece <pause dur="0.4"/> before this was enacted in Greece <pause dur="0.2"/> there there were never any company registries but this was the first point <pause dur="0.6"/> you know how could you ensure <pause dur="0.3"/> to get 
free movement of capital <pause dur="0.8"/> then an investor could actually get hold of accounts if there wasn't some place where they were deposited <pause dur="0.4"/> the accounts were deposited <pause dur="0.7"/> and you know this is not common <pause dur="0.5"/> well it is common in some countries but there's plenty countries in the world <pause dur="0.2"/> don't have them <pause dur="0.6"/> so for example if you wanted to look up the accounts of a Vietnamese company <pause dur="0.6"/> forget it <pause dur="0.4"/> you're not going to be able to find it <pause dur="2.1"/> the Second Directive is one we've already come across <pause dur="0.6"/> and it sets minimum capital requirements on the formation of a company <pause dur="0.7"/> it also defined distributable profit although that's not mentioned here but more importantly <pause dur="1.0"/> it gave a common constitution throughout all the member states <pause dur="0.9"/> between a private company and a public company between a P-L-C limited <distinct lang="fr">S-A</distinct> <distinct lang="it">S-R-L</distinct> <pause dur="0.3"/> <distinct lang="de">A-G</distinct> <distinct lang="de">G-M-B-H</distinct> <pause dur="1.3"/> all similar <pause dur="1.1"/> right <pause dur="0.4"/> and that's useful so that any investor now <pause dur="0.3"/> will know what kind of company <pause dur="0.4"/> he or she is dealing with <pause dur="1.4"/> okay <pause dur="1.2"/> the Third Directive was a one that only affected 
Benelux and France it's deals with something well you'll know about that <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> in France it deals with something called <distinct lang="fr">fusion</distinct> <pause dur="1.0"/> and mergers <pause dur="1.2"/> the Fourth Directive is the big one <pause dur="1.1"/> dealing with <pause dur="0.7"/> when the accounts are published <pause dur="0.4"/> what <pause dur="1.0"/> financial information must be <pause dur="0.3"/> disclosed what the content of the annual accounts is going to be <pause dur="0.7"/> and that's where we'll be looking at a little later <pause dur="1.1"/> but at the bottom of the page you'll see <pause dur="0.5"/> although the Fourth Directive was <pause dur="0.3"/> adopted <pause dur="0.7"/> by the Council of Ministers in nineteen-seventy-eight <pause dur="0.8"/> it was given a delay was given <pause dur="0.2"/> for <pause dur="0.4"/> countries to put it into national law so <pause dur="0.3"/> Denmark and the U-K were the first countries <pause dur="0.7"/> Sweden Austria and Finland who joined quite recently <pause dur="0.3"/> European Union of # just <pause dur="0.8"/> recently <pause dur="0.7"/> and you may notice Italy <pause dur="0.5"/> Italy <pause dur="0.5"/> took <pause dur="0.5"/> thirteen years <pause dur="0.5"/> <shift feature="voice" new="laugh"/>to put this<shift feature="voice" new="normal"/> # directive into national law they were even going to be taken to the Court of Justice <pause dur="0.5"/> 'cause they were so late <pause dur="1.4"/> <vocal desc="cough" iterated="n"/> so we're going to look at the Fourth Directive today <pause dur="0.4"/> the Fifth 
hasn't been # adopted <pause dur="0.2"/> the Sixth is a minor one that deals with something called <pause dur="0.3"/> again i just speak to the French <distinct lang="fr">scission</distinct> <pause dur="0.4"/> <trunc>de</trunc> de-mergers if you've done <distinct lang="fr">scission</distinct> <pause dur="1.2"/> the Seventh Directive is the other great one it deals with consolidated accounts <pause dur="0.8"/> group accounts and we shall look at that next week <pause dur="1.1"/> and again if you look at the bottom of the page <pause dur="0.6"/> you'll see the dates of enactment there the Seventh was adopted in nineteen-eighty-three <pause dur="0.9"/> and you'll see the dates <pause dur="0.2"/> when it was put into national law <pause dur="1.0"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> and you'll notice that some countries that you've dealt with <pause dur="0.5"/> actually put them in together <pause dur="0.5"/> so if you look at the case of Germany <pause dur="0.7"/> Germany waited <pause dur="0.3"/> to put <pause dur="0.2"/> the Fourth Directive into national law <pause dur="0.6"/> into their national law <pause dur="1.0"/> until the Seventh had come out <pause dur="0.4"/> and then they did the two together <pause dur="1.0"/> and that you may remember when <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> did Germany <pause dur="0.5"/> you came across the <distinct lang="de">Bilanzrichtlinie-Gesetz</distinct> of nineteen-eighty-five <pause dur="0.5"/> that's the one <pause dur="0.9"/> that <pause dur="0.3"/> # puts in both <pause dur="1.8"/> the Eighth Directive is the third 
is the third big one <pause dur="0.6"/> Fourth the Seventh and the Eighth <pause dur="0.2"/> and this deals with <pause dur="0.6"/> common qualifications for auditors <pause dur="0.3"/> and their appointment <pause dur="0.3"/> procedures for appointment and procedures for their dismissal <pause dur="2.0"/> Ninth and Tenth <pause dur="0.8"/> # aren't haven't been introduced <pause dur="0.4"/> the Eleventh is very minor <pause dur="0.2"/> <vocal desc="cough" iterated="n"/> the Twelfth <pause dur="0.6"/> is a minor one although it's had quite an impact in some countries <pause dur="0.9"/> # <pause dur="1.0"/> the idea of a company is that you have two <pause dur="0.2"/> shareholders minimum of two <pause dur="1.5"/> the Twelfth Directive introduced the idea that <pause dur="1.1"/> you can have a one-person company where there's only one shareholder <pause dur="0.4"/> and create company as a shell <pause dur="1.0"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> in some countries in the European Union there's a name for this i'm going to ask the French <pause dur="0.7"/> what's it called in France <pause dur="1.4"/> <distinct lang="fr">E-U-R-L</distinct> <pause dur="0.8"/> <distinct lang="fr">Entreprise unipersonnelle à responsabilité limitée</distinct> <pause dur="0.9"/> the U-E # E-U-R-L <pause dur="1.1"/> you can spot one of these <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="2"/> if you see a French business and it's got the name and it's got this behind the name <pause dur="0.8"/> then it's a one-person company <pause dur="2.1"/> right <vocal desc="cough" iterated="n"/> so i mean that's the background now we're going to go 
in <pause dur="0.5"/> to the Fourth Directive 'cause that's the big one <pause dur="0.7"/> and what i'm going to do with you <pause dur="0.2"/> and you're going to hate this <pause dur="0.6"/> you really are going to hate this <pause dur="0.7"/> is i'm going to we are going to read <pause dur="0.2"/> the directive <pause dur="0.2"/> together <pause dur="1.4"/> we're going to go through a certain number of articles and i'm going to ask questions and think i want you to think back <pause dur="0.5"/> to France and to Germany <pause dur="0.8"/> and to the Netherlands <pause dur="0.4"/> 
we did those countries <pause dur="0.9"/> because it's by going through it <pause dur="0.9"/> that you can see <pause dur="0.2"/> the potential for success and the potential for failure <pause dur="0.7"/> in terms of bringing accounting systems together <pause dur="0.8"/> now what you have in front of you is a copy of the Fourth Directive <pause dur="0.8"/> i don't propose to go through it all <pause dur="1.5"/> i'm going to go through depending on the time we have <pause dur="0.2"/> up to about article forty-two i'm not going to consider each article <pause dur="0.6"/> i'm just going to pick out and ask you to think <pause dur="1.1"/> about the consequences the implications <pause dur="0.4"/> of <pause dur="0.4"/> the basic <pause dur="0.8"/> <vocal desc="cough" iterated="n"/> <pause dur="0.2"/> things that are contained <pause dur="0.8"/> right <vocal desc="laugh" iterated="n"/> how are 
you feeling <pause dur="1.3"/> happy <pause dur="1.0"/> pleased <pause dur="0.3"/> content it's a lovely new year and we're going to enjoy ourselves <pause dur="1.1"/> right <vocal desc="cough" iterated="n"/> let's just <pause dur="0.8"/> start <pause dur="0.3"/> by looking just the words coming out <reading>Fourth Council Directive</reading> <pause dur="0.5"/> 'cause it's the Council of Ministers <pause dur="1.1"/> <reading>based on article fifty-four-three-G of the Treaty</reading> <pause dur="1.6"/> and then this wonderfully pompous phrasing <pause dur="0.3"/> <reading>the Council <pause dur="0.7"/> having regard to the Treaty <pause dur="0.6"/> having regard to a draft from the Commission having regard to an opinion of the parliament</reading> <pause dur="0.3"/> all of this preliminary stuff <pause dur="0.9"/> then says <pause dur="1.7"/> <reading>whereas the coordination of national provisions concerning</reading> watch the words <pause dur="0.7"/> <reading>presentation <pause dur="2.1"/> content of annual accounts and annual reports <pause dur="0.7"/> valuation methods <pause dur="0.6"/> and publication <pause dur="0.4"/> is of special importance</reading> <pause dur="0.4"/> three <pause dur="0.2"/> four key words there <pause dur="0.7"/> the directive is going to deal with the way the accounts are presented <pause dur="1.5"/> what their content is <pause dur="0.7"/> what rules are going to be used for the valuation of assets and liabilities <pause dur="0.8"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> the details of publication <pause dur="0.9"/> so in the very first introduction you know what this is about <pause dur="3.4"/> the next paragraph <pause dur="0.3"/> says <pause dur="1.2"/> <reading>whereas <pause dur="0.3"/> simultaneous coordination is necessary</reading> well try telling 
that to the Italians <pause dur="0.7"/> they <shift feature="voice" new="laugh"/>took thirteen years<shift feature="voice" new="normal"/> to put this in as i mentioned <pause dur="0.9"/> and then it goes dum-de-dum-de-dum-de-dum and then the last part says <pause dur="0.5"/> <reading>whereas moreover the necessity and the urgency of <trunc>cu</trunc> such coordination has been recognized and confirmed <pause dur="0.6"/> by article two of Directive sixty-eight-one-five-one</reading> <pause dur="0.9"/> what is Directive sixty-eight<pause dur="0.3"/>-one-five-one <pause dur="0.2"/> what would you guess </u><pause dur="1.6"/><u who="sm1117" trans="pause"> <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/></u><pause dur="0.3"/> <u who="nm1112" trans="pause"> yeah which which directive is it </u><pause dur="3.8"/> <u who="sm1117" trans="pause"> first </u><pause dur="0.3"/> <u who="nm1112" trans="pause"> it's the first now that's telling you something interesting it's telling you that the European Communities as they <trunc>we</trunc> then were <pause dur="0.9"/> were trying to <pause dur="0.3"/> they had in mind the Commission at least had in mind a whole series of interconnected directives <pause dur="0.8"/> they weren't just <pause dur="0.5"/> oh that's a good idea and now here's another good idea <pause dur="0.6"/> they were thinking them through <pause dur="0.3"/> as they were <pause dur="1.2"/> working on one they were thinking of the next <pause dur="1.3"/> right the next paragraph <pause dur="0.7"/> <reading>whereas it is necessary moreover <pause dur="0.5"/> to establish in the community</reading> <pause dur="0.3"/> now watch <pause dur="0.3"/> 
three <pause dur="0.2"/> words <pause dur="0.7"/> <reading>minimum <pause dur="0.9"/> equivalent <pause dur="0.7"/> legal <pause dur="0.5"/> requirements <pause dur="0.8"/> as regards the extent of the financial information</reading> <pause dur="1.3"/> right <pause dur="0.7"/> again this gives you a clue to the harmonization process first of all <pause dur="1.4"/> it's going to concentrate on basic things <pause dur="0.2"/> minima <pause dur="2.8"/> it's not intending <pause dur="0.2"/> to go through and <trunc>lo</trunc> cover all the accounting issues that are involved <pause dur="0.5"/> in the balance sheet P and L notes <pause dur="0.7"/> it's minima <pause dur="1.1"/> right <pause dur="1.0"/> second the second word is equivalent <pause dur="0.3"/> it's not trying to make <pause dur="0.4"/> the requirements the same in each of the member states it's trying to make them equivalent one to another <pause dur="1.1"/> so that's actually quite a limited process <pause dur="1.8"/> it's not saying that in France <pause dur="0.5"/> you must depreciate buildings over twenty years and also in England you must <trunc>be</trunc> depreciate buildings over twenty years it's just trying to make things equivalent <pause dur="1.4"/> and then the third thing <pause dur="0.3"/> is legal <pause dur="0.9"/> the harmonization process is through the amendment of company law <pause dur="0.9"/> now <pause dur="2.2"/> can you see a problem <pause dur="2.9"/> with that word legal <pause dur="0.6"/> can you see a problem <pause dur="0.8"/> with 
this <pause dur="0.2"/> approach to bringing accounting systems together <pause dur="0.8"/> making them converge <pause dur="0.6"/> using <pause dur="0.6"/> a requirement of <trunc>chan</trunc> using legal requirements <pause dur="1.4"/> come on </u><pause dur="1.9"/><u who="sm1117" trans="pause"> i think the problem is # who is # <pause dur="2.0"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> who is giving the law for accounting in this country <pause dur="0.3"/> <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 word"/> some in France come from <pause dur="1.0"/> the <pause dur="2.1"/> government <pause dur="0.9"/> the government issues <pause dur="0.5"/> # and from something in the U-K is coming from # they look at the <pause dur="0.8"/> the boards of accountants <pause dur="0.4"/><gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/></u> <u who="nm1112" trans="overlap"> well not the boards of accountants come on what's it coming from <pause dur="0.4"/><vocal desc="sniff" iterated="n"/> <pause dur="0.4"/> you're right you're exactly on the right track <pause dur="1.9"/> what's the point <trunc>y</trunc> <trunc>y</trunc> you're absolutely right i just want i want the words</u><u who="sm1117" trans="overlap"> <gap reason="inaudible" extent="2 secs"/> <pause dur="0.6"/> # <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 word"/><pause dur="1.4"/> the <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 word"/></u> <pause dur="0.5"/> <u who="nm1112" trans="pause"> <vocal desc="laughter" n="sl" iterated="y" dur="2"/> it's the Christmas holidays being too long <pause dur="1.0"/> <vocal desc="laughter" n="ss" iterated="y" dur="1"/> all right there you got the point i mean the </u><u who="sm1117" trans="overlap"> <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> SAPs and</u><pause dur="0.5"/> <u who="nm1112" trans="pause"> yeah SAPs are a bit old </u><u who="sm1117" trans="overlap"> yeah</u><u who="nm1112" trans="overlap"> we don't talk SAPs now <pause dur="0.7"/> yeah the point is this in <pause dur="0.6"/> in many member states in the European <pause dur="0.7"/> Communities as they then were <pause dur="1.1"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> accounting regulation is entirely by law <pause dur="0.9"/> in Germany <pause dur="0.3"/> in Italy <pause dur="0.2"/> in Spain <pause dur="0.2"/> in France </u><pause dur="0.4"/><u who="sm1117" trans="pause"> Greece </u><u who="nm1112" trans="overlap"> and the point about and in Greece thank you <pause dur="0.8"/> and you you know in France there's a <distinct lang="fr">Code de Commerce</distinct> there's the <distinct lang="fr">Plan Comptable Général</distinct> there's the <distinct lang="fr">Comité de Reglementation Comptable</distinct> all these things we've talked about it's all government driven <pause dur="1.1"/> but in the U-K and Ireland <pause dur="0.3"/> and to a lesser

more about the content and it says <reading>whereas annual accounts must give a true and fair view</reading> <pause dur="1.1"/> right <pause dur="1.1"/> so we got that's <pause dur="0.2"/> that's Anglo-Saxon in origin isn't it this notion of a true and fair view <pause dur="1.2"/> next part <reading>whereas to this end a mandatory layout</reading> a prescribed format <pause dur="1.0"/> that's German <pause dur="0.8"/> and French <pause dur="1.2"/> so there's an element of a compromise <pause dur="0.2"/> coming and you see there's both <pause dur="0.7"/> Anglo-Saxon and continental inputs into this <pause dur="1.3"/> <reading>whereas there is a minimum content of the notes <pause dur="0.2"/> and whereas <pause dur="0.2"/> <trunc>de</trunc> derogations may be granted</reading> and derogations means exemptions in English <pause dur="0.7"/> # for certain companies of minor <trunc>e</trunc> economic and <trunc>so</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> social importance <pause dur="1.7"/> and then the next paragraph says <pause dur="1.3"/> <reading>whereas the different methods I-E rules <pause dur="0.3"/> for the valuation of assets and liabilities must be coordinated <pause dur="0.6"/> dum-de-dum-de-dum-de-dum <pause dur="0.3"/> disclose <pause dur="0.3"/> comparable <pause dur="0.4"/> and equivalent <pause dur="0.2"/> information</reading> <pause dur="2.4"/> comparable and equivalent <pause dur="0.7"/> it does not say <pause dur="0.9"/> disclose the same information <pause dur="1.2"/> it just means

limited liability companies that are being captured by this directive as a requirement <pause dur="1.0"/> so general partnerships <pause dur="0.7"/> no <pause dur="0.5"/> sole traders <pause dur="0.4"/> no <pause dur="1.6"/> unlimited liability companies no <pause dur="0.3"/> they're not subject to this directive <pause dur="1.3"/> okay <pause dur="1.2"/> however <pause dur="1.0"/> and this is a point of difference <pause dur="0.2"/> there's nothing in this <trunc>dir</trunc> in this article <pause dur="0.2"/> that prevents member states <pause dur="0.3"/> from applying the directive <pause dur="0.8"/> to these <trunc>c</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> other sorts of businesses <pause dur="2.3"/> is there <pause dur="1.2"/> all it says is that <pause dur="0.4"/> this <trunc>a</trunc> must apply to these limited liability companies but there's nothing to stop <pause dur="0.2"/> a country saying <pause dur="0.3"/> oh well <pause dur="0.3"/> we'll make it apply <pause dur="1.1"/> to everybody <pause dur="1.5"/> and that's what's happened some countries <pause dur="0.2"/> have applied the directive <pause dur="1.0"/> aside from publication requirements <pause dur="0.4"/> to every enterprise <pause dur="0.9"/> that's the case in France and the case in Greece <pause dur="4.3"/> yeah <pause dur="0.7"/> Greek businesses even if <pause dur="0.8"/> they <pause dur="0.4"/> even if they're not limited liability companies <pause dur="0.4"/> will have <pause dur="0.3"/> the basic rules here applied <pause dur="0.4"/> through your <pause dur="0.6"/> Greek <pause dur="0.3"/> general accounting plan <pause dur="0.5"/> the French <pause dur="0.4"/> general accounting plan <pause dur="1.3"/> is 
consistent with this <pause dur="0.2"/> so the only difference is that that everybody uses it in France and Greece the directive <pause dur="0.5"/> the only difference is that <pause dur="0.3"/> if it's not a limited liability company <pause dur="0.7"/> they don't have to publish their accounts <pause dur="0.8"/> okay <pause dur="0.9"/> you might like to think about <pause dur="0.3"/> why does this directive only apply to limited liability companies <pause dur="0.8"/> i'll leave you to think about that </u><pause dur="3.9"/><u who="sm1117" trans="pause"> why </u><pause dur="0.2"/> <u who="nm1112" trans="pause"> why <pause dur="0.2"/> why only limited liability companies <pause dur="8.2"/> limited liability businesses <pause dur="0.9"/> why doesn't it apply to everybody <pause dur="2.0"/> why didn't why didn't the European Communities make it apply to everybody <pause dur="0.9"/> partnerships sole traders unlimited liability companies nationalized industries <pause dur="4.3"/> well it's okay i said i'll let you think about it it's basically because when an earner has limited liability <pause dur="0.4"/> creditors need protection <pause dur="1.7"/> because a shareholder is only limited up to a <shift feature="voice" new="laugh"/> certain amount<shift feature="voice" new="normal"/> <pause dur="1.6"/> it <pause dur="0.3"/> it's <trunc>po</trunc> it's for the protection of creditors <pause dur="1.4"/> that's why it's here <pause dur="0.9"/> and you'll notice in section two <pause dur="1.6"/> that there is <pause dur="0.2"/>

you're reading the English language version <pause dur="2.1"/> of the Fourth Directive <pause dur="0.8"/> but there is obviously <pause dur="0.7"/> a French version and a Greek version and a Finnish version <pause dur="1.8"/> and in the European Communities or European Union <pause dur="0.2"/> they all have <pause dur="0.2"/> equal authority <pause dur="0.8"/> the Finnish version is exactly the same authority as the English version <pause dur="1.3"/> it's exactly the same as the Greek or the French <pause dur="0.7"/> can you see a problem </u><pause dur="1.1"/><u who="sm1117" trans="pause"> translation of the true and fair view </u><u who="nm1112" trans="overlap"> translation of true and fair view <pause dur="0.5"/> <distinct lang="el">di pragmatiki eikona</distinct> <pause dur="0.4"/> <distinct lang="fr">une image fidèle</distinct> <pause dur="0.4"/> <distinct lang="es">la</distinct> <pause dur="0.2"/> do you remember the Spanish case <pause dur="0.5"/> <distinct lang="es">la imagen fiel</distinct> <pause dur="0.8"/> the you don't remember this i talked about it last time <pause dur="0.6"/> Spanish translated this phrase as <pause dur="0.2"/> the <pause dur="0.5"/> faithful picture <pause dur="1.0"/> there's only one <pause dur="0.2"/> the <pause dur="1.8"/> and you get it by applying the rules <pause dur="0.2"/> in the Spanish <pause dur="0.4"/> law <pause dur="0.9"/> whereas the English version says a true and fair view <pause dur="0.7"/> so you're going to get differences <pause dur="0.7"/> and each version <pause dur="0.5"/> is equally authoritative <pause dur="1.5"/> do you do you understand <trunc>be</trunc> because the the criterion <pause dur="0.3"/> is expressed in a different way <pause dur="0.4"/> it could lead to different numbers 
in the accounts different ways of doing things <pause dur="0.8"/> yeah <pause dur="1.3"/> what about <pause dur="0.2"/> <trunc>i</trunc> <pause dur="0.5"/> you did a lecture with <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> on the I-S-C <pause dur="1.2"/> do different languages have equal authority for international accounting standards <pause dur="3.1"/> can you remember <pause dur="0.3"/> no they don't <pause dur="1.0"/> they're published in English <pause dur="2.5"/> so <pause dur="0.2"/> that's quite interesting <pause dur="0.8"/> because there's always a base <pause dur="0.2"/> in international accounting standards that you can refer to it's it's the English version that has authority <pause dur="0.6"/> and everything must fit with it <pause dur="0.7"/> but in the European Union the European Communities they're all of equal authority so they can be taken <pause dur="0.4"/> the phraseology can be taken differently <pause dur="0.6"/> 
and this is the first point <pause dur="1.2"/> <trunc>e</trunc> despite despite it being of Anglo-Saxon origin <pause dur="0.7"/> the second point <pause dur="0.2"/> is the words # see if you can remember this <pause dur="0.4"/> if i show this to British students <pause dur="0.7"/> and i say <pause dur="0.2"/> of the company's assets liabilities financial position <pause dur="0.9"/> they look a bit odd they say to me <pause dur="0.9"/> well <pause dur="1.2"/> what's the difference assets and liabilities do represent financial position <pause dur="0.9"/> so why is the words being repeated <pause dur="2.7"/> but <pause dur="0.3"/> in a lot of other language versions <pause dur="0.2"/> assets comma liabilities are translated by a single word <pause dur="0.5"/> can you remember what it is <pause dur="2.9"/> i'm looking at the French </u><pause dur="2.2"/><u who="sf1120" trans="pause"> <distinct lang="fr">actif passif</distinct><pause dur="0.8"/> <distinct lang="fr">actif passif</distinct></u><u who="nm1112" trans="latching"> <distinct lang="fr">non</distinct> <pause dur="1.6"/> <distinct lang="fr">non</distinct> that would be the straight translation <distinct lang="fr">actif passif</distinct> <pause dur="1.6"/> here's the word you should remember it <pause dur="9.7"/> <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="9"/> you told me this is the same word in Greek <pause dur="0.8"/> i remember <pause dur="1.6"/> the words assets comma liabilities translated by the word <pause dur="0.2"/> a single word <pause dur="0.2"/> 
patrimony now what's the significance of this patrimony idea <pause dur="4.6"/> well it refers to things that are legally owned <pause dur="0.2"/> or legally owed <pause dur="1.5"/> right <pause dur="2.2"/> take me a bit further <pause dur="5.4"/> no you don't follow the point <pause dur="0.6"/> what it means is that you can only put something on the balance sheet if it's legally owned it can only appear as an asset if it's legally owned <pause dur="1.2"/> which is the reason why you can't capitalize finance leases <pause dur="2.3"/> but we don't have that restrictive notion of patrimony <pause dur="1.4"/> so we can put more things on the balance sheet <pause dur="1.5"/> do you not <trunc>underst</trunc> do you not follow don't you remember this <pause dur="1.3"/> come on let me <trunc>gi</trunc> <pause dur="0.3"/> you're sure <pause dur="2.2"/> don't remember this <pause dur="1.4"/> all right let me give you a better example to make you remember <pause dur="0.3"/> are you do any do you know anything about <trunc>co</trunc> </u><u who="sm1117" trans="overlap"> it's about leases <pause dur="0.7"/> leases</u><pause dur="0.2"/> <u who="nm1112" trans="pause"> <trunc>lea</trunc> finance leases absolutely right you can't capitalize finance leases <pause dur="0.4"/> under the restrictive notion of patrimony <pause dur="0.4"/> and that's that's what appears <pause dur="0.4"/> in the French and Greek versions <pause dur="0.8"/> and Spanish and Italian <pause dur="0.8"/> so it's telling

<shift feature="voice" new="laugh"/>you're not <shift feature="voice" new="normal"/> going to get a lot of comparability <pause dur="0.7"/> because you you remember <pause dur="0.5"/> you know in a by nature format you can work out the value added the gross operating profit <pause dur="0.7"/> but because you don't have a <trunc>g</trunc> cost of sales you can't work out the gross profit which you can in a by function format <pause dur="0.7"/> so again it's not being very helpful in making things comparable <pause dur="0.9"/> and why did Portugal want to have by nature <pause dur="0.7"/> simply because there are so many small and medium-sized companies <pause dur="0.2"/> who couldn't afford the cost of running <pause dur="0.6"/> a costing system <pause dur="0.5"/> which is what you need if you have that kind of <pause dur="0.6"/> structure of P and L <pause dur="1.6"/> and it reflected if you like economic conditions it also in tax terms is more tax <shift feature="voice" new="laugh"/>transparent <shift feature="voice" new="normal"/><pause dur="0.8"/> so it fits very much with the <pause dur="0.8"/> particular economic conditions <pause dur="3.1"/> right are you depressed <pause dur="2.6"/> <vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" dur="1"/> fed up <pause dur="1.6"/> this is heavy stuff you know this is good stuff <pause dur="1.0"/> let's <pause dur="1.0"/> let's just pick a <pause dur="1.6"/> a few points <pause dur="0.5"/> further on i'm just picking things <pause dur="0.5"/> just to illustrate what this problem of <pause dur="1.2"/>
