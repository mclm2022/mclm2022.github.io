# <pause dur="0.2"/> in direct action <pause dur="0.3"/> # to stop # calves being exported <pause dur="0.3"/> # alive to the continent or something like that <pause dur="0.3"/> then you'll know <pause dur="0.3"/> that # <pause dur="0.4"/> the form of organization <pause dur="0.2"/> is extremely loose and network based <pause dur="0.3"/><vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/><pause dur="1.3"/> so there's a great debate about how we define social movements <pause dur="0.8"/> if you look in the the the textbook that we use in this course <pause dur="0.4"/> one of the more disappointing chapters there <pause dur="0.3"/> is on social movements i don't particularly recommend that <pause dur="0.4"/> because it seems to me to become <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> convoluted into a debate about <pause dur="0.2"/> how we define a social movement <pause dur="0.8"/> so to cut through all of that i use a nice straightforward definition which we've got here <pause dur="1.6"/><kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> <reading>forms of <trunc>po</trunc> popular organization <pause dur="0.4"/> which have their basis outside the political system <pause dur="0.5"/> but which seek to influence the political system in the direction of their cause</reading> <pause dur="1.2"/> so we've got <pause dur="0.3"/> the idea of popular organization a basis outside the political system <pause dur="0.8"/> we've got secondly the idea of seeking to influence politics rather than join politics <pause dur="0.5"/> and we've 
got <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> thirdly the idea of a cause <pause dur="0.6"/> of seeking <trunc>d</trunc> a a movement for something <pause dur="0.6"/> sometimes a movement against something <pause dur="2.8"/> now <pause dur="2.1"/> until <pause dur="0.2"/> fairly recently it seemed that <pause dur="0.3"/> one particular <trunc>so</trunc> social movement <pause dur="0.4"/> the labour movement <pause dur="0.2"/> seemed to have some <pause dur="0.2"/> pre-eminence <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> in # among social movements <pause dur="0.2"/> in terms of size and scale <pause dur="0.3"/> # degree of organization <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> the the labour movement made up of trade unions cooperative parties <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> political parties and all sorts of <pause dur="0.2"/> of other <pause dur="0.2"/> associated # <pause dur="0.5"/> # groupings <pause dur="0.2"/> seemed to have <pause dur="0.2"/> a pre-eminence <pause dur="1.5"/> and so i'll start my lecture by <pause dur="0.3"/> talking about a theory of the labour movement <pause dur="0.2"/> and then <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> a sort of lock lack of of confidence about the labour movement <pause dur="0.2"/> which set in <pause dur="0.3"/> # during the nineteen-seventies <pause dur="0.5"/> so i'll outline a theory and then i'll <pause dur="0.2"/> outline some <pause dur="0.3"/> # scepticism from within <pause dur="0.4"/> # the labour movement about that theory <pause dur="0.8"/> and then <pause dur="0.3"/> to conclude the lecture we'll move on to a different kind of theory <pause dur="0.3"/> the theory of so-called new social movements <pause dur="0.4"/> which claims <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> that <pause dur="0.4"/> either 
the pre-eminence of the labour movement has now declined and there it's just one amongst many <pause dur="0.4"/> or a more radical version of the theory <pause dur="0.3"/> is that the labour movement is now <pause dur="0.3"/> # an anachronism <pause dur="0.2"/> and has been overtaken by <pause dur="0.2"/> new social movements <pause dur="2.0"/> okay <pause dur="0.4"/> so let's start then with the classic theory of the labour movement <pause dur="1.6"/> the source that i'm <trunc>i</trunc> going to use here <pause dur="0.3"/> is # <pause dur="0.2"/> # the accessible <trunc>sourc</trunc> source that # i've <pause dur="0.2"/> introduced you to already <pause dur="0.4"/> # Marx and Engels The Communist Manifesto <pause dur="0.7"/> this is a <pause dur="0.2"/> a nice neat statement of the theory of the labour movement <pause dur="0.4"/> but <pause dur="0.2"/> what i want to stress is that this is not a particularly Marxist theory this is a <pause dur="0.3"/> a theory shared <pause dur="0.2"/> well beyond Marxism <pause dur="0.2"/> within <pause dur="0.2"/> other branches <pause dur="0.2"/> of of the labour movement <pause dur="1.9"/> so let's # just state the theory <pause dur="0.2"/><vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.5"/> the first point to state about it is the idea of historical inevitability <pause dur="0.6"/> the inevitability <pause dur="0.3"/> of <pause dur="0.2"/> A <pause dur="0.3"/> some kind of movement generated within modern societies <pause dur="0.9"/> which will lead B <pause dur="0.3"/> to <pause dur="0.3"/> the demise of the the current forms of society <pause dur="0.2"/> and the 
movement on to a new <pause dur="0.2"/> and different and better kind of society <pause dur="0.7"/> within Marxism <pause dur="0.3"/> the idea of a shift from <pause dur="0.4"/> capitalism to communism <pause dur="0.4"/> and that <pause dur="0.2"/> being linked not just to <pause dur="0.3"/> something which was <pause dur="0.3"/> good about communism <pause dur="0.2"/> but also the <pause dur="0.2"/> the workings the mechanisms <pause dur="0.2"/> of capitalist society <pause dur="0.3"/> in Marx's famous phrase <pause dur="0.3"/> would generate <pause dur="0.2"/> the gravediggers of the capitalist system <pause dur="1.2"/> the labour movement is precisely that gravedigger <pause dur="0.5"/> that out of capitalism <pause dur="0.2"/> would come a mechanism of change <pause dur="0.2"/> which would lead on to a different kind of society <pause dur="2.7"/> secondly let's talk about <pause dur="0.2"/> the process <pause dur="0.2"/> of labour movement growth <pause dur="0.8"/> the idea is <pause dur="0.4"/> that the labour movement <pause dur="0.3"/> grows out of the everyday experience of people in modern society <pause dur="0.4"/> the everyday experience of the deprivations of work poverty <pause dur="0.3"/> problems with housing dah-di-dah-di-dah <pause dur="1.8"/> but that that would grow in three different ways <pause dur="1.4"/> first of all spatially <pause dur="1.7"/><vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/> it would grow from <pause dur="0.7"/> groups of workers coming together in a workplace and thinking <pause dur="0.2"/> we're being done here we're being <pause dur="0.2"/> # exploited 
here and they got together <trunc>t</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/><vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.3"/> <trunc>t</trunc> # at the workplace level <pause dur="0.3"/> and and tried to do something about it <pause dur="0.4"/> but it moved from that level <pause dur="0.2"/> spatially <pause dur="0.3"/> to the idea of the regional trade union and then the national trade union <pause dur="0.2"/> and then international workers <pause dur="0.4"/> so the idea is <pause dur="0.2"/> that spatially <pause dur="0.3"/> the labour movement grows from everyday experience <pause dur="0.2"/> of problems in in <pause dur="0.2"/> capitalist society <pause dur="0.5"/> into <pause dur="0.2"/> a <pause dur="0.3"/> national and indeed international movement <pause dur="1.6"/> secondly <pause dur="0.3"/> the idea of # <pause dur="0.8"/> of organizational expansion <pause dur="1.1"/><vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.2"/> again the idea is that # <pause dur="0.3"/> everyday experience <pause dur="0.2"/> would lead to the <pause dur="0.2"/> the formation of <pause dur="0.3"/> trade unions <pause dur="0.2"/> trade unions would grow into a national movement <pause dur="0.2"/> they would then grow into a political movement or merge with a political movement <pause dur="0.4"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> that would lead to # <pause dur="0.2"/> # a mechanism for change <pause dur="0.6"/> so organizationally there's that idea <pause dur="0.2"/> of expansion <pause dur="0.2"/> out of everyday experience <pause dur="1.2"/> and then thirdly at the level of the individual <pause dur="0.7"/> the idea is that <pause dur="0.3"/> people's moans and groans <pause dur="0.3"/> would # <pause dur="0.4"/> <trunc>m</trunc> # move on from moaning and groaning about your 
particular boss or your particular supervisor <pause dur="0.4"/> # to thinking <pause dur="0.2"/> well it's not just me that has this problem <pause dur="0.6"/> i'm in the same boat as other people <pause dur="0.9"/> we all form part of <pause dur="0.4"/> first of all the trade <pause dur="0.8"/> or the industry <pause dur="0.4"/> and then the penny drops in <pause dur="0.4"/> according to the theory <pause dur="0.2"/> we're all <pause dur="0.4"/> part of a class <pause dur="0.6"/><vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.3"/> # and the labour movement <pause dur="0.3"/> # is based upon the idea of class solidarity <pause dur="2.2"/> so that's the second aspect of the theory <pause dur="0.8"/> that # <pause dur="0.3"/> out of everyday experience in these different ways <pause dur="0.3"/> a movement would be generated <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> # which was large-scale <pause dur="0.5"/> # in terms of space <pause dur="0.2"/> in terms of organization <pause dur="0.3"/> and in terms of aspiration of individuals <pause dur="0.3"/> from just <pause dur="0.2"/> solving everyday problems <pause dur="0.2"/> to looking forward <pause dur="0.3"/> to a new form of society <pause dur="2.2"/> and then the third thing about the theory <pause dur="0.3"/><vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.8"/> is its politics <pause dur="1.8"/> the claim is that the labour movement <pause dur="0.2"/> is confrontational <pause dur="0.6"/> it is not just a movement which seeks to enter politics on the same terms <pause dur="0.2"/> of as what are called bourgeois parties <pause dur="0.7"/> rather <pause dur="0.3"/> it is a <pause dur="0.5"/> # a political movement that seeks to enter the 
political arena <pause dur="0.2"/> to confront that political arena <pause dur="0.3"/> and move beyond it <pause dur="0.3"/> to a different kind of society <pause dur="0.9"/> the labour movement <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> # has an aspiration to <trunc>m</trunc> to # <pause dur="0.2"/> to change society <pause dur="0.2"/> in fundamental ways <pause dur="2.4"/> so <pause dur="0.5"/><kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="10"/> that <pause dur="0.2"/> is <pause dur="0.4"/> or those are the <pause dur="0.4"/> main <pause dur="0.3"/> elements of the theory <pause dur="0.5"/><vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.6"/> we'll see if i can get this <pause dur="2.8"/> lined up <pause dur="1.6"/> so <pause dur="0.6"/> that's the theory then what about the experience <pause dur="0.2"/> of <pause dur="0.2"/> <trunc>th</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> # <trunc>th</trunc> the labour movement and its history <pause dur="1.9"/> well prior to the First World War prior to nineteen-fourteen <pause dur="0.6"/> that's that theory seemed to be working out very well <pause dur="0.5"/><vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.8"/> if we take a <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> the <trunc>ec</trunc> <trunc>ec</trunc> example of <pause dur="0.2"/> both the United States and Europe <pause dur="0.7"/> then <pause dur="0.6"/> workers' movements did seem to be <pause dur="0.2"/> developing <pause dur="0.2"/> spatially <pause dur="0.2"/> organizationally and in terms of class consciousness <pause dur="0.6"/><vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.5"/> trade union movements had grown had become united as movements <pause dur="0.3"/> and had <pause dur="0.2"/> linked up with <pause dur="0.2"/> socialist movements <pause dur="0.2"/> and formed political parties <pause dur="0.3"/> which were entering the political arena <pause dur="0.3"/> in Germany <pause dur="0.3"/> # for example in the <pause dur="0.2"/> Social 
Democratic Party <pause dur="0.6"/> on a specific platform <pause dur="0.5"/> that we are not here to collaborate with you our oppressors <pause dur="0.2"/> we are here to get rid of you <pause dur="2.8"/> so <pause dur="0.2"/> up until nineteen-fourteen the <trunc>the</trunc> the the theory seemed to be working <pause dur="0.9"/> but from <pause dur="0.5"/> the First World War <pause dur="0.4"/> the theory went wrong <pause dur="0.8"/> experience departed from <pause dur="0.2"/> the theory <pause dur="1.4"/> it went wrong in two different ways <pause dur="0.3"/><vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.9"/> first of all <pause dur="0.8"/> there was a divergence <pause dur="0.4"/> in the <trunc>i</trunc> in <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> in the form of the labour movement <pause dur="1.3"/> the labour movement took two <pause dur="0.2"/> different routes <pause dur="0.9"/> the first route <pause dur="0.4"/> exemplified by <pause dur="0.3"/> the nineteen-seventeen revolution and the formation of the Soviet Union <pause dur="0.6"/> was the Communist Party route <pause dur="1.0"/> that <pause dur="0.2"/><vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/> route <pause dur="0.5"/> # saw confrontational politics <pause dur="0.2"/> as based upon <pause dur="0.2"/> a <trunc>c</trunc> a violent confrontation with the state <pause dur="0.3"/> violent revolution <pause dur="0.5"/><vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/> the taking <pause dur="0.3"/> power <pause dur="0.3"/> taking of power <pause dur="0.4"/> through the state <pause dur="0.3"/> and the imposition of a social blueprint <pause dur="0.3"/> of a communist society <pause dur="1.5"/> so that was one route forward <pause dur="0.3"/> that actually happened <pause dur="2.0"/> but secondly <pause dur="0.4"/> there is a second route forward again which actually happened <pause dur="0.8"/> what 
i'll call the social democratic route <pause dur="1.6"/><vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/><pause dur="2.6"/><event desc="turn over notes" iterated="n" n="ss"/> everyone turned the page <vocal desc="laugh" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.5"/><vocal desc="cough" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.4"/> within <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> Western Europe <pause dur="0.9"/> violent revolution did not occur <pause dur="0.5"/> but by the <trunc>exp</trunc> <trunc>ex</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> expansion of the franchise <pause dur="0.4"/> and the formation of social democratic parties <pause dur="0.2"/> such as the Labour Party in Britain <pause dur="0.3"/> Social Democratic Party in Germany <pause dur="0.4"/> # <vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/> not <pause dur="0.2"/> not so clear in in France but similarly in in Sweden <trunc>a</trunc> again the Social Democratic Party <pause dur="0.7"/> what one had <pause dur="0.3"/> was # a route forward <pause dur="0.2"/> a route forward for the labour movement <pause dur="0.4"/> not based upon overthrow of the state <pause dur="0.3"/> but the use of <pause dur="0.4"/> # electoral power <pause dur="0.4"/> to gain access to the state <pause dur="0.3"/> and the <pause dur="0.2"/> and the <pause dur="0.3"/> proclamation <pause dur="0.2"/> that that access could use <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> parliamentary strength <pause dur="0.3"/> political strength <pause dur="0.3"/> to fundamentally change <pause dur="0.2"/> capitalist societies <pause dur="1.8"/> so that was the first thing that went wrong the theory didn't predict some kind of <pause dur="0.2"/> divergence along these two <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> very different paths <pause dur="1.5"/> then the second thing that went wrong with the theory <pause dur="0.8"/> was that in each of these two different cases <pause dur="1.5"/> the more that <pause dur="1.2"/> 
either <pause dur="1.0"/> form of political expression <pause dur="0.9"/> became successful <pause dur="0.7"/> in inverted commas <pause dur="0.6"/> the more it seemed to depart <pause dur="0.2"/> from the ideals of socialism <pause dur="1.6"/> so in the Soviet Union <pause dur="1.3"/> the longer the experience of the # of the Soviet system <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/><vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> went on <pause dur="0.8"/> the more it seemed <pause dur="0.3"/> that the Soviet Union became an <trunc>increa</trunc> increasingly <pause dur="0.2"/> bureaucratized <pause dur="0.3"/> increasingly <pause dur="0.3"/> totalitarian <pause dur="0.3"/> increasingly <pause dur="0.3"/> # militaristic society <pause dur="0.5"/> in which the experience of workers <pause dur="0.2"/> seemed to be <pause dur="0.2"/> little different <pause dur="0.2"/> to the experience of workers under capitalism <pause dur="1.8"/> so <pause dur="1.5"/> the greater the power <pause dur="0.2"/> of the the Communist Party in the Soviet Union <pause dur="0.2"/> the greater <pause dur="0.2"/> seemed to be the disillusionment in terms of the # <pause dur="0.3"/> the <trunc>c</trunc> the criterion of achieving a socialist society <pause dur="1.3"/> similarly if we look at the second road <pause dur="0.5"/> sometimes called the parliamentary road to # <pause dur="0.3"/> to socialism <pause dur="0.7"/> via social democratic parties <pause dur="0.7"/> again the more successful these parties <pause dur="0.2"/> became <pause dur="0.4"/> the more <pause dur="0.3"/> they seemed to depart from socialism <pause dur="0.5"/> in this particular case what we're talking about is <pause dur="0.3"/> the more
