on tariffs and trade article <pause dur="0.7"/> # which covers authorizes <pause dur="0.6"/> # free trade areas and customs union <pause dur="0.4"/> because of course <pause dur="0.6"/> they <pause dur="0.2"/> fundamentally break article one <pause dur="0.5"/> # the principle of non-discrimination i mean the whole purpose of a free trade area or a customs union <pause dur="0.6"/> is to discriminate <pause dur="0.2"/> in favour of the partner countries <pause dur="0.3"/> and therefore against the world <pause dur="0.5"/> # so which is entirely against the whole <pause dur="0.5"/> essence <pause dur="0.5"/> of the GAT <pause dur="0.2"/> the <pause dur="0.2"/> # agreements and the W-T-O <pause dur="0.5"/> so article twenty-four permits <pause dur="0.4"/> this major break <pause dur="0.6"/> # from the principle of non-discrimination <pause dur="0.5"/> but i'll deal with that next week <pause dur="0.6"/> # 'cause it's a topic which <pause dur="0.6"/> # has come to the fore <pause dur="1.2"/> particularly given the proliferation of <pause dur="0.7"/> # these <pause dur="0.2"/> preferential trade agreements as Bhagwati <pause dur="0.2"/> prefers to call them <pause dur="0.9"/> # <pause dur="1.5"/> i mean at the moment i think there's about a hundred-and-six <pause dur="1.0"/> <shift feature="voice" new="laugh"/> preferential <shift feature="voice" new="normal"/> trade agreements have been notified <pause dur="0.7"/> to the W-T-O <pause dur="0.4"/> and not all agreements are notified <pause dur="0.8"/> # so <pause dur="0.2"/> there's something in <trunc>n</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> in excess <pause dur="0.6"/> of a hundred-and-six preferential trade 
agreements <pause dur="0.7"/> # and the <trunc>p</trunc> <pause dur="0.7"/> as i say the previous <pause dur="0.2"/> past <pause dur="0.9"/> ten years or less <pause dur="1.1"/> have seen a proliferation of these agreements <pause dur="0.3"/> # i mean everybody's signing agreements as if there was no tomorrow <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> which is entirely contrary to all that we were saying <pause dur="0.5"/> about the Uruguay round <pause dur="0.4"/> and the move towards <pause dur="0.3"/> a rules based system for international trade <pause dur="0.5"/> and the principle of non-discrimination that underpins <pause dur="0.4"/> all of the <pause dur="0.2"/> new <pause dur="0.4"/> # international economic order <pause dur="1.8"/> so one of the questions really i mean one of the fundamental questions which people are asking themselves today is why <pause dur="0.3"/> you know why in a world in which on the one hand <pause dur="0.4"/> we strengthened <pause dur="0.5"/> the general agreement on tariffs and trade <pause dur="0.5"/> and we have the general agreement on trade and services <pause dur="0.5"/> and trade related intellectual property rights agreements trade related investment measures <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> and so on <pause dur="0.4"/> <trunc>i</trunc> particularly the strengthening of the <trunc>di</trunc> the <pause dur="0.4"/> # dispute settlement <pause dur="0.4"/> process <pause dur="0.6"/> all of that you know we we emphasized <pause dur="0.4"/> really was to underpin the <pause dur="0.3"/> 
spectacular growth of world trade that we've seen <pause dur="0.7"/> # so why at this time of all times <pause dur="0.5"/> do we see this <pause dur="0.3"/> huge increase <pause dur="0.4"/> in the number of preferential trade agreements <pause dur="0.5"/> which is fundamentally based on mercantilist philosophy isn't it <pause dur="0.2"/> i mean the view that <pause dur="0.5"/> you know we sign up agreements between ourselves <pause dur="0.4"/> # and keep out the rest of the world you know <pause dur="0.5"/> we sort of concentrate the gains from trade <pause dur="0.5"/> # between us at the expense of or <pause dur="0.2"/> partly at the expense of the rest of the world <pause dur="0.5"/> so why that's one of the big questions that we'll <pause dur="0.2"/> continue to come <pause dur="0.4"/> to to come back to <pause dur="1.2"/> # <pause dur="1.0"/> i don't think anybody knows the answer to that one <pause dur="0.5"/> # but we can at least speculate on it <pause dur="1.7"/> and of course as Bhagwati puts it as well <pause dur="0.2"/> are they are they obstacles <pause dur="0.7"/> to the development of a <pause dur="0.2"/> non-discriminatory <pause dur="0.2"/> free trade world <pause dur="0.8"/> or are they simply stepping stones <pause dur="1.1"/> which might be the apologist case if you like <pause dur="0.5"/> for customs unions and free trade agreement <pause dur="1.8"/> stepping stones in the sense that <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> you first of all <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> free up trade between 
the partner countries <pause dur="0.7"/> and maybe deepen relations between you <pause dur="0.9"/> # and having adjusted to that <pause dur="0.3"/> you can then go on <pause dur="0.4"/> to <pause dur="0.4"/> # free trade <pause dur="0.5"/> on a <pause dur="0.2"/> worldwide basis <pause dur="0.9"/> and particularly perhaps for developing countries <pause dur="0.6"/> # that might be very attractive <pause dur="0.2"/> rather than go suddenly for broke <pause dur="0.6"/> you know suddenly <pause dur="0.7"/> when your barriers to trade as we've <pause dur="0.2"/> discussed in the past have been very high <pause dur="0.4"/> very high tariff and non-tariff barriers <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> and you <pause dur="0.7"/> you know rapidly take them away over a short period of time expose yourself to world trade <pause dur="0.5"/> that's a pretty frightening thought <pause dur="0.5"/> # for for any country <pause dur="0.6"/> so maybe a regional free trade agreement <pause dur="0.3"/> particularly with <pause dur="0.4"/> an industrialized country a large industrialized country like United States <pause dur="0.6"/> or a regional grouping like the E-U <pause dur="0.6"/> that might be a sort of stepping stone <pause dur="0.3"/> so you free trade first of all with the <pause dur="0.2"/> the big <pause dur="0.3"/> industrialized market <pause dur="0.5"/> and you adjust to that <pause dur="0.5"/> and then you go in to <pause dur="0.4"/> # liberalized trade <pause dur="0.5"/> on a on a worldwide basis <pause dur="0.2"/> and that's the sort of 
optimistic view if you like <pause dur="0.6"/> of <pause dur="0.3"/> # the role of free trade agreements <pause dur="0.9"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> in which case they're stepping stones <pause dur="1.1"/> to # <pause dur="0.7"/> # final free trade <pause dur="1.1"/> or are they obstacles in the way that i indicated at the beginning they might be <pause dur="0.4"/> 'cause fundamentally <pause dur="0.2"/> they're discriminatory <pause dur="0.7"/> and the more agreements you have <pause dur="0.4"/> the more discrimination we have in the world <pause dur="0.7"/> and therefore <pause dur="0.8"/> we're running quite contrary <pause dur="0.9"/> to the fundamental principle <pause dur="0.6"/> of the W-T-O <pause dur="0.3"/> principle of non-discrimination <pause dur="1.0"/> so <pause dur="0.2"/> that's the big debate and we <pause dur="0.6"/> there's no answers to that one <pause dur="0.5"/> you just have to <pause dur="0.9"/> really <pause dur="0.8"/> make up your own minds <pause dur="2.7"/> so first of all let's go through with the basic economics of it i say my apologies to those who've done this before but it's such an important topic <pause dur="0.4"/> it comes up in all sorts of areas <pause dur="1.3"/> # so what i'm going to do <pause dur="0.6"/> is # put up the diagrams <pause dur="0.5"/> and then get those of you particularly well anyone <pause dur="0.3"/> but particularly those of you who've done E-U and developing countries course <pause dur="0.5"/> # to then explain the diagrams to me <pause dur="0.6"/> rather than me do 
it <pause dur="1.6"/><kinesic desc="turns on overhead projector showing transparency" iterated="n"/> so let's see if we <pause dur="0.8"/> when we get this thing focused in this ghastly room that we have <pause dur="17.0"/> least it's not as bad as the Palmer building is it where you've got the <pause dur="0.3"/> the screen up one end and people are sitting up the other end i mean that is really <pause dur="0.4"/> truly awful <pause dur="1.6"/> okay <pause dur="2.8"/> well the starting point <pause dur="0.5"/> on the analysis of <pause dur="1.5"/> # preferential trade agreements <pause dur="1.4"/> really was by <pause dur="0.7"/> put up by Jacob Viner <pause dur="1.5"/> # <pause dur="1.3"/> who <pause dur="0.2"/> pointed out <pause dur="0.4"/> that <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="1.2"/> preferential trade agreements on the one hand <pause dur="0.4"/> freed up trade between the partner countries and therefore the theory of comparative advantage can work <pause dur="0.6"/> okay <pause dur="0.5"/> but of course it was only partial liberalization <pause dur="1.1"/> # it discriminated against the countries <pause dur="0.9"/> and so <pause dur="0.3"/> it was # Viner <pause dur="1.6"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="4"/> who <pause dur="3.0"/> coined the terms <pause dur="0.3"/> trade creation <pause dur="1.2"/> and <pause dur="0.3"/> the next diagram that we'll do trade diversion <pause dur="2.8"/> # have we got <pause dur="0.3"/> a spare handout <pause dur="2.4"/> oh you do right <pause dur="1.0"/> <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/></u><pause dur="1.3"/><u who="sm1130" trans="pause"> <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/></u><u who="nm1128" trans="overlap"> <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 word"/> <pause dur="3.1"/> okay so trade creation then this is comparative advantage working <pause dur="0.5"/> mm <pause dur="1.0"/> but of course only between <pause dur="0.2"/> the member countries <pause dur="1.0"/> mm <pause dur="2.1"/> # <pause dur="1.8"/> this diagram here <pause dur="1.1"/> # this is <pause dur="0.2"/> a <pause dur="0.5"/> 
preferential trade agreement <pause dur="0.6"/> between <pause dur="0.3"/> a developing country <pause dur="0.8"/> right <pause dur="0.2"/> which is # <pause dur="0.4"/> labelled L-B-C here <pause dur="1.6"/> and <pause dur="0.3"/> the European Union <pause dur="0.3"/> E-U <pause dur="2.8"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> and we're looking to see what happens in the developing country here <pause dur="2.1"/> # the the argument's a general one <pause dur="0.2"/> but # <pause dur="0.4"/> purposes of <pause dur="0.3"/> our interest let's look at the developing country <pause dur="0.2"/> side of the equation <pause dur="1.0"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> now in this case here <pause dur="0.7"/> the European Union <pause dur="0.9"/> is the cheapest source of supply <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> of the imported goods <pause dur="0.7"/> okay the rest of the world <pause dur="0.6"/> the dearer source of supply somewhere up here so we can forget about them <pause dur="0.8"/> okay <pause dur="1.2"/> so we're simply we're importing <pause dur="0.2"/> from the E-U <pause dur="0.7"/> # which is the cheapest source of supply <pause dur="0.8"/> prior to the preferential trade agreement <pause dur="0.9"/> there is the <pause dur="0.2"/> tariff <pause dur="0.7"/> tariff <pause dur="0.5"/> is the distance between <pause dur="1.0"/> P-star-E-U <pause dur="0.3"/> and P-E-U here <pause dur="0.6"/> okay <pause dur="1.0"/> so that's the <pause dur="0.5"/> that's the height of the tariff <pause dur="2.9"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> and prior to the preferential trade agreement <pause dur="0.4"/> we're importing <pause dur="0.2"/> M-O <pause dur="0.8"/> from <pause dur="0.8"/> the E-U <pause dur="1.6"/> tariffs then disappear <pause dur="1.5"/> okay <pause dur="0.8"/> and <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="1.4"/> we then <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="2.4"/> expand our imports from the E-U <pause dur="0.6"/> upto M-F-T-A <pause dur="0.9"/> imports under the <pause dur="0.5"/> free trade

mm <pause dur="0.6"/> so <pause dur="0.3"/> that's the tariff <pause dur="0.3"/> it used to be <pause dur="0.2"/> applied to imports from the E-U <pause dur="0.6"/> that's now disappeared <pause dur="0.7"/> so <pause dur="1.5"/> the difference between those two prices multiplied by <pause dur="0.4"/> the previous level of imports <pause dur="0.4"/> I-E in the area A-B <pause dur="0.6"/> is <pause dur="0.3"/> the loss of tariff revenue <pause dur="0.7"/> by <pause dur="0.7"/> # Morocco <pause dur="0.5"/> or where it happened to be <pause dur="5.1"/> so that element under the demand curve <pause dur="0.8"/> the increase in the consumer surplus A-B-C-D <pause dur="0.4"/> is made up of two components <pause dur="0.6"/> mm <pause dur="0.8"/> the first one's a pure transfer <pause dur="1.2"/> mm <pause dur="0.5"/> it's a transfer <pause dur="0.5"/> from the government <pause dur="0.2"/> of Morocco <pause dur="0.7"/> to the consumers in Moroco <pause dur="0.8"/> mm <pause dur="1.6"/> so <pause dur="0.2"/> one just cancels out the other <pause dur="0.8"/> all right <pause dur="0.6"/> net <pause dur="0.5"/> # there's no welfare gain <pause dur="0.7"/> in that sense <pause dur="0.9"/> all right there's a gain in consumer surplus <pause dur="1.4"/> but that chunk of the consumer surplus in here <pause dur="0.6"/> is just <pause dur="0.2"/> a decrease in government revenues <pause dur="0.5"/> and that's transferred to consumers <pause dur="0.8"/> through the lower price <pause dur="0.4"/> that they pay for the previous level of imports <pause dur="0.5"/> one balances out the other exactly <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> zero change in terms of welfare <pause dur="0.9"/> unless you like to say that well <pause dur="0.7"/> it's better off if <pause dur="0.5"/> # consumers gain <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> than 
if governments get their revenues but <pause dur="0.4"/> as economists we're we're very neutral in all those things all right <pause dur="0.5"/> # so we don't make value judgements <pause dur="0.5"/> as to whether governments should consume <pause dur="0.4"/> or whether private individuals or firms should consume <pause dur="1.0"/> point of view of the economy <pause dur="0.7"/> that's simply a a transfer <pause dur="1.0"/> # <pause dur="1.1"/> no welfare effect at all <pause dur="0.8"/> so <pause dur="0.3"/> the net welfare effect then <pause dur="0.5"/> is <pause dur="0.3"/> that the two <trunc>tri</trunc> the is the is the triangle here <pause dur="0.7"/> plus this whatever that shape is <pause dur="0.4"/> i've forgotten my methematics somebody tell me <vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" dur="1"/><shift feature="voice" new="laugh"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/><shift feature="voice" new="normal"/> D in there <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> it's those two areas C-plus-D <pause dur="0.3"/> is the net <pause dur="0.2"/> welfare gain <pause dur="0.5"/> okay so <trunc>cons</trunc> the gain and the consumer surplus <pause dur="1.4"/> minus this transfer element A-B <pause dur="0.6"/> so we're left with <pause dur="0.3"/> this area in here <pause dur="1.1"/> so that's the welfare gain <pause dur="1.8"/> unambiguously a welfare gain <pause dur="0.6"/> to <pause dur="0.2"/> the developing country <pause dur="1.6"/> from the <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> abolition of the tariffs the free trade agreement <pause dur="0.9"/> and that's what Viner called <pause dur="0.6"/> trade creation <pause dur="1.2"/> mm <pause dur="3.0"/> the consumers <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> are able to <pause dur="0.8"/> purchase <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> a higher level of imports <pause dur="0.7"/> at <pause dur="0.5"/> a lower price <pause dur="4.7"/> let's

getting round to then <pause dur="0.5"/> is that <pause dur="0.2"/> one of the important aspects of the trade creation effect <pause dur="0.7"/> is the degree of substitutability <pause dur="1.2"/> between <pause dur="0.6"/> domestic production <pause dur="0.7"/> and imported goods <pause dur="0.7"/> okay <pause dur="1.2"/> in other words my supply curve that i've got here <pause dur="1.0"/> okay <pause dur="1.5"/> # <pause dur="2.3"/> and i've drawn that quite steeply <pause dur="0.8"/> indicating that the degree of substitutability <pause dur="0.3"/> is quite small <pause dur="1.3"/> mm <pause dur="1.0"/> most of the goods you import from the E-U <pause dur="0.6"/> are not produced in the domestic economy <pause dur="1.3"/> so if you like the trade displacing effect on domestic production <pause dur="0.5"/> is also going to be <pause dur="0.3"/> quite small <pause dur="1.1"/> now it depends on the economy <pause dur="0.5"/> right i've talked about Chad or Mali <pause dur="0.5"/> if we're talking about Cote d'Ivoire <pause dur="0.5"/> # Zimbabwe <pause dur="0.5"/> Kenya <pause dur="0.9"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> well <pause dur="1.3"/> there's going to be a greater degree <pause dur="0.4"/> of <pause dur="0.4"/> # overlap <pause dur="0.4"/> if you like <pause dur="0.6"/> between <pause dur="0.9"/> some domestic production anyway <pause dur="0.8"/> and <pause dur="0.3"/> imports from the E-U <pause dur="0.4"/> mm <pause dur="0.8"/> so if # the price of <pause dur="0.3"/> of goods fall <pause dur="0.5"/> imported from the E-U <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> then <pause dur="0.2"/> that's going to <pause dur="0.5"/> squeeze out <pause dur="0.4"/> # less efficient <pause dur="0.4"/> less desirable goods <pause dur="0.3"/> produced by some <pause dur="0.4"/> or # <trunc>d</trunc> domestic producers <pause dur="0.5"/> in # in the country <pause dur="0.3"/> they could only 
survive <pause dur="0.5"/> behind high tariff protection <pause dur="0.4"/> but you still got a lot of other production <pause dur="0.6"/> which is simply doesn't compete <pause dur="0.6"/> # with imports from the E-U <pause dur="3.5"/> that's important because this theory was developed by Viner <pause dur="0.8"/> in the context particularly of explaining <pause dur="0.5"/> # the common market <pause dur="0.4"/> all right we're going back now to the nineteen-fifties <pause dur="0.6"/> mm <pause dur="0.5"/> if you're <pause dur="0.4"/> talking about a free trade agreement a customs union <pause dur="0.8"/> i'll give you the difference between those later on <pause dur="0.9"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> between <pause dur="0.4"/> industrialized  countries in Europe between France and Germany and Italy <pause dur="0.4"/> right <pause dur="0.8"/> then the degree of substitutability <pause dur="0.9"/> between imports and domestic production is going to be very high <pause dur="0.3"/> mm <pause dur="1.0"/> so the trade creation effect on that side is potentially very powerful <pause dur="0.6"/> mm <pause dur="0.8"/> # but going to be going to be a wide range of goods which are <pause dur="0.3"/> produced for the domestic economy <pause dur="0.3"/> which you could just as well import from France or Germany or Italy <pause dur="0.2"/> mm <pause dur="1.0"/> and so <pause dur="0.5"/> # the trade creation effect would be very powerful <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> in an industrialized country but between an

but and that's created a dilemma <pause dur="0.9"/> and similarly with clothing you see the clothing industry <pause dur="0.3"/> in Jamaica which is a quite an important source of employment for them that live there <pause dur="0.9"/> is principally because of the <pause dur="0.4"/> Caribbean Basin Initiative it's because of preferences in the U-S market <pause dur="0.4"/> without those preferences <pause dur="0.4"/> again in a free trade situation <pause dur="0.4"/> the clothing would come from Asia <pause dur="0.5"/> not from Jamaica <pause dur="1.0"/> i mean Jamaica then says well what the heck are we <shift feature="voice" new="laugh"/> going to produce <pause dur="0.5"/> but <shift feature="voice" new="normal"/> <pause dur="0.5"/> but <pause dur="0.2"/> you've got the answer i mean the answer is that it'll be other things which of course we don't know about <pause dur="0.4"/> because they don't exist <pause dur="0.7"/> but <pause dur="0.4"/> # the obvious trade pattern would be towards Latin American countries <pause dur="0.3"/> that have a different resource base a different level of income <pause dur="0.6"/> a different stage of technology <pause dur="0.4"/> so the two economies are complementary to each other <pause dur="0.4"/> and that's the future for these countries' <unclear>problems</unclear> <pause dur="1.6"/> but that gets us away from <pause dur="0.8"/> here anyway that's just # a variation on the <pause dur="0.7"/> on the i mean <trunc>th</trunc> <trunc>th</trunc> the

one that's not going to be terribly big <pause dur="0.3"/> that's going to be small <pause dur="0.7"/> this one might be big it might not <pause dur="0.2"/> we have to look at that more carefully <pause dur="0.4"/> and that's what it does <pause dur="0.4"/> and then at the end of the day <pause dur="0.4"/> you make a judgement <pause dur="2.9"/> but the big question too is all of these things i've mentioned here <pause dur="0.3"/> you could get from unilateral trade liberalization <pause dur="0.5"/> at least a lot of it anyway <pause dur="0.4"/> mm <pause dur="1.0"/> # i mean you wouldn't <trunc>nes</trunc> i mean you wouldn't get the so much the investment creation investment deflection effects that wouldn't tell us very much <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 word"/> <pause dur="0.7"/> but the other ones economies of scale greater competition <pause dur="0.5"/> wider choice of goods <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="1.0"/> we'd all <pause dur="0.4"/> i would all get if i simply lowered my barriers to trade with the world as a whole <pause dur="1.1"/> and there'd be no trade diversion cost <pause dur="0.9"/> mm <pause dur="5.7"/> so again we come back and think why the hell did <shift feature="voice" new="laugh"/> we sign the agreement <shift feature="voice" new="normal"/> right <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> okay <pause dur="0.2"/> there might be this <pause dur="0.2"/> # investment creation investment deflection effects to the extent that they're important <pause dur="1.0"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> as i say <pause dur="0.4"/> i would <pause dur="0.7"/> 
think fundamentally that depends how big an economy you are <pause dur="0.6"/> mm <pause dur="0.9"/> if you're a small economy i wouldn't expect it to be terribly great <pause dur="0.7"/> may be wrong <pause dur="0.8"/> # Mauritius might be an example where it was quite substantial <pause dur="0.5"/> mm <pause dur="0.7"/> # where <pause dur="0.4"/> you know it's it's the <pause dur="0.2"/> third largest exporter of woollen clothes in the world <pause dur="0.6"/> and it's a tiny little island <pause dur="0.8"/> and that's <pause dur="0.2"/> largely because of preferences <pause dur="0.5"/> so <pause dur="0.7"/> yeah we got to be careful with that one <pause dur="0.4"/> <trunc>i</trunc> <trunc>i</trunc> it could be important <pause dur="1.1"/> # <pause dur="1.6"/> but # <pause dur="0.9"/> so so maybe that's important but <pause dur="0.2"/> in terms of stimulating foreign direct investment because <pause dur="0.3"/> duties on imports of capital goods and intermediate goods have come down <pause dur="0.4"/> well <pause dur="0.2"/> liberalize to the world as a whole <pause dur="0.4"/> mm <pause dur="0.5"/> so investors can then buy <pause dur="0.8"/> capital goods and intermediate goods at world prices <pause dur="1.1"/> mm not simply <pause dur="0.5"/> # at whatever price <pause dur="0.3"/> the E-U exporter <pause dur="0.2"/> sells them to you <pause dur="1.2"/> so we still got <pause dur="0.8"/> really we still haven't really answered the question <pause dur="1.1"/> why sign the agreement <pause dur="0.5"/> we've got the gains from trade <pause dur="1.0"/> but why not just get 
those <pause dur="0.4"/> on a non-discriminatory basis through unilateral trade liberalization <pause dur="0.5"/> why do it in a in a discriminatory way <pause dur="1.0"/> we've still got that puzzle <pause dur="1.4"/> well <pause dur="0.9"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> next week i'll go through some new thinking <pause dur="0.5"/> and # <pause dur="0.2"/> to explain <pause dur="0.6"/> why some of the what those gains might be <pause dur="0.8"/> i've hinted at one of them already <pause dur="0.8"/> that is in an uncertain world <pause dur="1.1"/> binding yourself in to a free trade agreement <pause dur="0.4"/> provides you with a bit more certainty <pause dur="1.3"/> so if i engage in unilateral trade liberalization <pause dur="0.7"/> and it's or <pause dur="0.2"/> maybe with other countries <pause dur="0.6"/> # negotiate reciprocal tariff reductions in the W-T-O <pause dur="0.9"/> # there's always the danger <pause dur="0.5"/> of going back to the nineteen-thirties <pause dur="0.4"/> all right there's always <pause dur="0.2"/> the W-T-O <pause dur="0.4"/> has been weakened <pause dur="0.2"/> by the Seattle <pause dur="0.7"/> # situation that we've talked about before okay <pause dur="0.5"/> maybe it's not quite such a strong organization that we thought it was <pause dur="0.6"/> okay <pause dur="0.5"/> maybe if there was serious unemployment in the industrialized countries <pause dur="0.4"/> the whole agreement would just be torn up <pause dur="0.6"/> and we'd be back to the <pause dur="0.5"/> # # discrimination and <pause dur="0.5"/> # barriers to trade 
of the nineteen-thirties <pause dur="0.2"/> you know that's not improbable <pause dur="1.6"/> but if i lock myself in to the E-U or to United States through a free trade agreement <pause dur="0.6"/> maybe that gives me a bit more certainty <pause dur="0.8"/> okay it's a <trunc>i</trunc> it's a <pause dur="0.2"/> it's a legally binding agreement <pause dur="0.8"/> you'd build up institutional arrangements which link you in with the other country <pause dur="0.7"/> so when push comes to shove <pause dur="0.4"/> all right <pause dur="0.5"/> if we if we did have a bit of a recession in the <trunc>u</trunc> in the E-U or <pause dur="0.2"/> or United States <pause dur="0.5"/> they'll discriminate against other people <pause dur="0.9"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> not against me at least not in the first instance <pause dur="0.8"/> all right <pause dur="0.7"/> so <pause dur="0.2"/> bit more certainty then perhaps <pause dur="0.4"/> yeah </u><u who="sm1132" trans="overlap"> <gap reason="inaudible" extent="3 secs"/> </u><u who="nm1128" trans="overlap"> well it <pause dur="0.6"/> yeah i mean in the case of Eastern European <pause dur="0.2"/> agreements <pause dur="0.2"/> it's heavily political <pause dur="0.3"/> all right you're trying to reinforce <pause dur="0.4"/> the overthrow of communism <pause dur="0.4"/> # democratic governments as long as 
they're not communist governments <pause dur="0.4"/> # and so on <pause dur="0.7"/> that's right <pause dur="0.2"/> so i mean that was a heavy political element in that one <pause dur="0.5"/> that was the top of the of the agenda <pause dur="0.6"/> and the E-U was willing to pay quite a high price <pause dur="0.5"/> to maintain that <pause dur="1.3"/> with the other <trunc>dev</trunc> <trunc>o</trunc> other developing countries <pause dur="0.6"/> not really willing to pay a price <pause dur="0.4"/> and that in a sense is part of the of of also of the puzzle <pause dur="0.6"/> the developing countries in effect i mean from what we've said <pause dur="0.4"/> have to pay quite a high price <pause dur="0.8"/> upfront right at the beginning <pause dur="0.6"/> for these agreements <pause dur="0.6"/> okay that's the welfare loss <pause dur="0.5"/> there's the rising unemployment as industries close down that are competing with imports from the E-U <pause dur="0.4"/> there's the loss of government revenue <pause dur="0.5"/> you know there's a lot of upfront costs <pause dur="0.3"/> for the developing country <pause dur="1.1"/> from the agreement <pause dur="0.8"/> really not much 
cost <pause dur="0.6"/> for the industrialized country <pause dur="0.5"/> mm <pause dur="1.0"/> so why do they sign <pause dur="0.6"/> why do developing countries sign these agreements with industrialized countries <pause dur="0.7"/> hinted at one of them <pause dur="0.4"/> and that's that's increased certainty i think that figures quite prominently <pause dur="0.8"/> but there's other <pause dur="0.3"/> aspects as well <pause dur="0.3"/> that we'll talk about next week <pause dur="0.5"/> to do with <pause dur="0.4"/> timing consistency problems signalling <pause dur="0.4"/> all sorts of other things that we <pause dur="0.4"/> talk about <pause dur="2.7"/> any final points <pause dur="2.1"/> okay <pause dur="0.5"/> well i'll carry on doing the theory and then we'll <pause dur="0.9"/> talk a bit more about actual agreements next week <pause dur="0.7"/> and then we'll get on to talk about article twenty-four <pause dur="0.4"/> and # <pause dur="0.2"/> how it <pause dur="0.3"/> <trunc>i</trunc> its weaknesses <pause dur="0.6"/> and how <pause dur="0.2"/> it needs to be reformed <pause dur="0.5"/> hopefully in a <pause dur="0.2"/> Seattle type row whatever it's going to be called <pause dur="0.4"/> <vocal desc="laugh" iterated="n"/> <pause dur="1.5"/> thank you
