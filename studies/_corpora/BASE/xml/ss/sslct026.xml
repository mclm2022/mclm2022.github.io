level one <pause dur="0.3"/> is where they just work on an indicative level <pause dur="1.5"/> so <pause dur="0.2"/><vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/> that has changed things <pause dur="0.2"/> quite dramatically <pause dur="0.4"/> or will do <pause dur="0.4"/> in that the involvement of general practitioners in the <pause dur="0.3"/> purchasing commissioning focus is so much more <pause dur="3.7"/> <kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="3"/> # around primary care <pause dur="2.0"/> primary care <pause dur="0.3"/> functions group main functions <pause dur="2.4"/> they have to contribute to what is called a Health Improvement Programme <pause dur="1.6"/> they have to look at the <trunc>p</trunc> and promote the health of their local population and the local population <pause dur="0.5"/> is <pause dur="0.5"/> # # based around <pause dur="0.5"/> geographical ward areas coterminous with social services <pause dur="0.5"/> so groups of practices will be brought together <pause dur="0.7"/> and they will be set <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> as a board <pause dur="0.5"/> looking at the individual needs of their local health <trunc>autho</trunc> health population <pause dur="1.6"/> they then have to look at how they're going to commission health <pause dur="0.2"/> services <pause dur="0.3"/> for that <pause dur="0.8"/> group of the population <pause dur="1.0"/> they also have to look at how they integrate that with the development of primary care <pause dur="1.1"/> community services <pause dur="0.3"/> and 
gradually replace what is now known as fundholding <pause dur="1.8"/> presume everybody's aware of what fundholding is <pause dur="0.7"/> that they take a specific budget and they monitor that <pause dur="0.7"/> with primary care groups it is somewhat different in that they have to take those things <pause dur="0.4"/> in addition to fundholding <pause dur="0.4"/> that are not necessarily containable so they have <trunc>t</trunc> they can take <pause dur="0.5"/> <trunc>em</trunc> <trunc>i</trunc> levels of emergency activity they have to take that into consideration <pause dur="0.7"/> so it's not as contained as fundholding fundholding was very much a specific amount of money <pause dur="0.7"/> with very little external <pause dur="0.3"/> pressures and constraints on it <pause dur="1.0"/> unlike the health authority who had to manage winter pressures waiting lists <pause dur="0.4"/> emergency activity <pause dur="0.3"/> and other financial pressures on their budget <pause dur="0.4"/> primary care groups now gradually will have to start to take on board those issues <pause dur="6.5"/> <kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="6"/> what is <pause dur="0.8"/> purchasing <pause dur="1.4"/> the definition of purchasing <pause dur="1.3"/> is the buying <pause dur="0.5"/> that's when you've decided <pause dur="0.4"/> what it is you need for your 
local population <pause dur="0.3"/> you <trunc>g</trunc> actually go out and buy it <pause dur="0.6"/> that's still staying in the new N-H-S the purchaser provider split is still staying <pause dur="2.9"/> it <trunc>g</trunc> actually gives the primary care groups quite a lot of leverage <pause dur="0.2"/> because they will be determining <pause dur="0.2"/> what it is they want to buy <pause dur="0.4"/> based on the needs of their local population <pause dur="1.1"/> one of the things they have to get used to doing however <pause dur="0.6"/> is working with the providers because as an example if they suddenly decided <pause dur="0.4"/> that they'd no longer wanted to contract <pause dur="0.3"/> for a particular acute service in a main general hospital <pause dur="1.3"/> they then have to look at <trunc>wh</trunc> how that impacts on other services if we take <pause dur="0.3"/> paediatrics as an example <pause dur="0.3"/> paediatrics links in with SCBU <pause dur="0.3"/> it links in with maternity <pause dur="0.4"/> and other services around <pause dur="0.2"/> in primary care like child health services <pause dur="0.4"/> and and it's that sort of a domino effect if they remove one thing <pause dur="0.3"/> they actually can cause a ripple effect through an organization <pause dur="0.3"/> so there has to be <pause dur="0.4"/> a process of change management <pause dur="0.7"/> so they can change 
purchasing decisions <pause dur="0.2"/> but it has to be done in a planned <pause dur="0.3"/> framework <pause dur="2.2"/> <vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/> </u><pause dur="0.2"/> <u who="nm1201" trans="pause"> you you said about # <pause dur="0.6"/> you know there'll still be the commissioner and provider split </u><u who="nf1199" trans="overlap"> yes </u><u who="nm1201" trans="overlap"> but it may have become <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> when the <pause dur="0.4"/> primary care trusts come in <pause dur="0.7"/> because they'll be able to provide community care <pause dur="0.8"/> for that level as well won't they </u><u who="nf1199" trans="latching"> they will have to <pause dur="0.2"/> be responsible as a primary care <pause dur="0.2"/> trust <pause dur="0.4"/> still for the provision of services but that will be through contract still <pause dur="0.7"/> there may be some contracts within primary care <pause dur="0.4"/> but there will be a division between the board <pause dur="0.4"/> and the decision making process of what's actually provided <pause dur="1.0"/> the <pause dur="0.2"/> the it's it's not as you say it's not as clear-cut as now where you've got an N-H-S trust <pause dur="0.4"/> but a primary care group will not actually themselves be providing the service <pause dur="0.3"/> they will be members of providers </u><u who="nm1201" trans="latching"> right </u><u who="nf1199" trans="overlap"> for example there will be a social worker <pause dur="0.3"/> a general practitioner <pause dur="0.3"/> an acute hospital <trunc>ru</trunc> member <pause dur="0.2"/> alongside up to seven 
general practitioners <pause dur="0.2"/> so in <trunc>e</trunc> in essence they are providers <pause dur="0.5"/> but they will have as a primary care group board <pause dur="0.3"/> contracts as purchasers if you like <pause dur="0.3"/> with <pause dur="0.2"/> a range of providers </u><u who="nm1201" trans="latching"> mm </u><u who="nf1199" trans="latching"> does <pause dur="0.2"/> does that <pause dur="0.3"/> clarify </u><u who="nm1201" trans="overlap"> <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> providers could be then <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> shouldn't it </u><u who="nf1199" trans="overlap"> it <trunc>w</trunc> will definitely should be <pause dur="0.2"/> because the <trunc>r</trunc> the the aim is <pause dur="0.3"/> that <pause dur="0.3"/> all of those people sitting on the <trunc>pu</trunc> on the primary care group board <pause dur="0.2"/> will be aware <pause dur="0.2"/> of the capabilities weaknesses and change management issues <pause dur="0.4"/> around their own trust <pause dur="0.2"/> so if you're looking at somebody sitting on a primary care group from social services <pause dur="0.4"/> and the issue on the primary care group board agenda is elderly care <pause dur="0.4"/> it's very much their interest <pause dur="0.3"/> to have a voice in that group <pause dur="0.3"/> whereas at the moment it's not in an integrated forum <pause dur="0.7"/> there is <pause dur="0.2"/> there are a few areas that are under joint planning where we sit round the table as health professionals with social services 
professionals <pause dur="0.4"/> but it's not part of the N-H-S structure <pause dur="0.2"/> before or it wasn't before primary care groups came in existence <pause dur="0.5"/> so i think the aim is to have an integrated approach <pause dur="0.4"/> of all the professionals <pause dur="0.4"/> involved in providing care <pause dur="0.2"/> for that designated area <pause dur="0.4"/> so whatever the whether it be a subject whether it be a client group <pause dur="0.3"/> or whether it be a specialty <pause dur="0.6"/> it will be discussed and each person will have a group there will be a practice nurse who will be able to speak <pause dur="0.3"/> on behalf of <pause dur="0.3"/> the practice nurse provision <pause dur="0.4"/> there will be <pause dur="0.5"/> as i said a social worker <pause dur="0.2"/> general practitioners all giving their views <pause dur="0.3"/> so it's going to fundamentally change because there's going to be a lot of tension because of people come <pause dur="0.4"/> in at different things in different ways <pause dur="0.8"/> when i was working with <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> <pause dur="0.2"/> <trunc>wh</trunc> who you've just <pause dur="0.2"/> met <pause dur="0.5"/> # we had to implement <pause dur="0.2"/> under the previous government <pause dur="0.4"/> # a White Paper called Changing Childbirth you're probably <pause dur="0.3"/> aware of that was that was 
the change of maternity services <pause dur="0.4"/> from purely acute care <pause dur="0.3"/> and to more spread out into the community <pause dur="0.9"/> what you end up doing is <trunc>y</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> you have to start <pause dur="0.3"/> bringing in an awful lot of <pause dur="0.5"/> interest into that process but there's no formal <pause dur="0.6"/> # meeting place for that to happen and it was very difficult getting the midwives round the table alongside the health authority <pause dur="0.4"/> trying to drag a general practitioner in to give his view <pause dur="0.2"/> which one do you choose <pause dur="0.4"/> out of seventy-eight practices or however many practices <pause dur="0.3"/> which general practitioner do you actually choose to join you <pause dur="0.3"/> and is he <pause dur="0.2"/> is he or she seen <pause dur="0.2"/> as representative <pause dur="0.3"/> of their own profession in that area <pause dur="0.4"/> at least with primary care groups <pause dur="0.2"/> whoever they may be <pause dur="0.6"/> they will be accepted as the representative voice of that profession <pause dur="0.4"/> so whenever their changing services <pause dur="0.4"/> from a commissioning point of view <pause dur="0.3"/> they will be the guidance and they will be the reference point <pause dur="0.3"/> consultation point start point planning point whatever <pause dur="0.3"/> well they'll either go to 
them to start a problem <pause dur="0.3"/> or they will make a decision to finish it <pause dur="2.5"/> the <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="2.3"/><kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="2"/> commissioning <pause dur="0.9"/> definition that brings us on quite nicely to the is something entrusted to be done delegated authority <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> payment by percentage for doing something <pause dur="1.8"/> <shift feature="voice" new="laugh"/>that's a <shift feature="voice" new="normal"/><pause dur="0.2"/> a very lengthy <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> definition <pause dur="0.9"/> there are other definitions for commissioning <pause dur="0.3"/> which i actually prefer <pause dur="2.3"/> <kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="4"/> which is looking at <pause dur="0.2"/> these key areas <pause dur="1.8"/> and that is looking at the skills <pause dur="0.6"/> oh dear <pause dur="2.4"/> skills and abilities of the people involved in providing the service i've got handouts for these so don't worry too much <pause dur="1.6"/> diagnosing the problem <pause dur="0.5"/> so if we're looking at changing a particular service as # <pause dur="1.6"/> around a client group <pause dur="0.4"/> we have to understand why we want to change it <pause dur="0.3"/> and that has to be backed up by <pause dur="0.3"/> evidence and the new White Paper says all the way through evidence based medicine <pause dur="0.5"/> R and D research and development <pause dur="0.6"/> clinical effectiveness they're all key words <pause dur="0.3"/> in the new White Paper <pause dur="0.2"/> so 
whatever <trunc>w</trunc> <pause dur="0.3"/> primary care groups are changing <pause dur="0.4"/> they have to look for A the problem <pause dur="0.3"/> and then B <pause dur="0.3"/> underpinning it with reasons why <pause dur="0.3"/> or reasons for making changes in the commissioning process <pause dur="0.6"/> so from an information point of view it could well be activity data from contracts <pause dur="0.4"/> it could well be census data of age sex <pause dur="0.3"/> breakdown <pause dur="0.3"/> it could be <pause dur="0.3"/> <vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/> epidemiological information about <pause dur="0.3"/> the structure and nature of that particular population that's causing the problem <pause dur="0.6"/> if there's a <trunc>prob</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> problem in <pause dur="0.7"/> a part of a county where there is high percentages of elderly and it is involved rehabilitation <pause dur="0.3"/> then there's an you know an underlying reason why rehabilitation is probably more of a problem there than it may be <pause dur="0.3"/> elsewhere <pause dur="1.8"/> so they have to look for the underlying causes but they can't just make a judgement and say we think it's because they've got to start to back it up <pause dur="0.4"/> so commissioning the commissioning process is the <pause dur="0.3"/> the digging up <pause dur="0.2"/> all the research all 
the evidence <pause dur="1.5"/> they have to look at it <pause dur="0.2"/> without taking sides so they've got to start and analyse that information <pause dur="0.9"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> as a group of professionals without taking sides <pause dur="0.7"/> and that's going to be quite difficult 'cause obviously the doctors may well veer towards the medical <pause dur="0.6"/> angle <pause dur="0.3"/> nurses will be <shift feature="voice" new="laugh"/>protecting their <shift feature="voice" new="normal"/> own profession <pause dur="0.3"/> you'll have social services coming at it <pause dur="0.3"/> so there's going to be <pause dur="0.2"/> quite a lot of storming i think in relation to the group coming together initially <pause dur="0.6"/> but as the process takes 'cause as long as it's backed up by research and evidence <pause dur="0.3"/> they can't they won't be able to argue <pause dur="0.4"/> the decision making process in the longer term because it will be based on factual data <pause dur="1.4"/> so <pause dur="0.3"/> there's a lot of listening <pause dur="0.5"/> key in the White Paper is involving the local community <pause dur="0.5"/> focus groups <pause dur="0.4"/> # health economies i think they're being called in relation to involving those groups of individuals <pause dur="0.3"/> patients population <pause dur="0.4"/> in the decision making process <pause dur="0.4"/> so as part of the commissioning they 
have <trunc>g</trunc> also got to demonstrate <pause dur="0.3"/> that not only are they underpinning it with <pause dur="0.3"/> evidence based <pause dur="0.3"/> research <pause dur="0.3"/> but they are actually going out on consultation <pause dur="0.3"/> to the people <pause dur="0.3"/> who actually <pause dur="0.5"/> <trunc>n</trunc> have to have the services <pause dur="0.4"/> delivered to them <pause dur="1.9"/> timing <pause dur="0.4"/> you cannot make change overnight it's not something that <pause dur="0.4"/> a group of professionals can suddenly make changes in within three to six months <pause dur="0.3"/> so there has to be a plan has to be a management plan <pause dur="0.4"/> involving the people <pause dur="0.4"/> involving the <pause dur="0.4"/> professionals involving the public <pause dur="1.7"/> if anybody's aware in Warwickshire at the moment there's a major project going on around Alcester Hospital where they're trying to bring together a social services <pause dur="0.4"/> and independent <pause dur="0.2"/> sector <pause dur="0.2"/> development <pause dur="0.2"/> alongside a community hospital and actually integrate services <pause dur="0.3"/> and there was a public meeting with the health authority <pause dur="0.3"/> to the local population of the plans <pause dur="0.3"/> and encouraging people to put forward their views <pause dur="0.2"/> that's part of the commissioning process <pause dur="2.5"/> once you've done all of that <pause dur="0.9"/>

meeting with a group of doctors and they said <pause dur="1.6"/> well <pause dur="0.4"/> if i want to go out and buy oranges <pause dur="0.3"/> i'll go and buy oranges <pause dur="0.7"/> she was a G-P fundholder <pause dur="1.3"/> and i said <pause dur="0.8"/> fine <pause dur="0.6"/> # i said but <pause dur="0.5"/> the provider needs to know <pause dur="0.2"/> what sort of oranges you're going to want to buy <pause dur="0.6"/> do you want clementines satsumas <pause dur="0.4"/> jaffas <pause dur="1.0"/> and that's the <shift feature="voice" new="laugh"/>commissioning <shift feature="voice" new="normal"/> bit <pause dur="0.5"/> because if there aren't any satsumas and she specifically wants satsumas <pause dur="0.5"/> then the trust has to provide <pause dur="0.3"/> and we ended up talking in this analogy of oranges which <pause dur="0.3"/> <shift feature="voice" new="laugh"/>you know i thought <shift feature="voice" new="normal"/>here we are in the N-H-S talking about oranges <pause dur="0.3"/> but it actually gave quite a good example <pause dur="0.4"/> that you can say you want to buy elderly care <pause dur="0.8"/> but what do you mean by elderly care do you want acute general medical beds do you want domiciliary rehabilitation do you want social care <pause dur="0.3"/> you know there there is a range of stuff around the elderly <pause dur="0.8"/> so it's about defining <pause dur="0.2"/> defining what you mean <pause dur="0.5"/> when you've defined it through need <pause dur="1.3"/> you then <pause dur="0.3"/> buy it <pause dur="0.3"/> and that's when you enter into agreement you say this is 
how much money we've got <pause dur="0.6"/> and this is how we'd like it to be <pause dur="1.0"/> where do we buy it from <pause dur="0.5"/> if there's social care services social # services et cetera <pause dur="0.9"/> there was a a very difficult time when the internal market took over <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> <vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/> being sensible i think at one point <pause dur="0.4"/> where we had two community trusts trying to provide <pause dur="0.4"/> counselling services one was a mental health trust <pause dur="0.3"/> and one was a community trust <pause dur="0.7"/> if a G-P referred to the mental health trust and it was a mental health referral that's <trunc>s</trunc> that's fine <pause dur="0.4"/> but if it was referred to the mental health trust and it was a general community <pause dur="0.4"/> <trunc>psycholi</trunc> psychological problem <pause dur="0.6"/> the mental health trust would be reluctant to pass it across because that would be income for them <pause dur="1.4"/> that would actually be income into their pot <pause dur="0.4"/> whereas now <pause dur="0.4"/> what we're saying is <pause dur="0.3"/> to <trunc>w</trunc> we should be dismantling all of that competition we should be assessing <pause dur="0.3"/> what it is we want to buy and who is the most appropriate provider <pause dur="2.2"/> then we purchase it 
and we determine quantity <pause dur="0.2"/> quality et cetera <pause dur="0.8"/> and then we negotiate the contracts <pause dur="0.4"/> and that's really i was a contracts manager <pause dur="1.1"/> you have this pot of money <pause dur="0.9"/> that's it <pause dur="0.2"/> you have to monitor it then within those guidance and <pause dur="0.3"/> what you were saying <pause dur="0.2"/> which we'll go on to now <pause dur="0.5"/> was the difficulties <pause dur="1.3"/> and we'll just touch on <kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="5"/> that briefly <pause dur="1.1"/> <vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/><pause dur="5.5"/> activity <pause dur="9.4"/> you have to decide when you're managing a contract <pause dur="0.3"/> how you're going to monitor <pause dur="0.3"/> what's happening <pause dur="1.6"/> in acute hospitals it's fairly <pause dur="0.4"/> robust <pause dur="0.3"/> because <pause dur="0.2"/> the <trunc>c</trunc> # <pause dur="0.5"/> contract minimum datasets gives a record <pause dur="0.4"/> who comes in who goes out how long they stayed <pause dur="0.4"/> and what happened to them during that process <pause dur="1.0"/> so from a purchasing manager as i was then and probably in the future primary care group <pause dur="0.4"/> they will be <trunc>a</trunc> able to have from a local hospital <pause dur="0.3"/> each specialty <pause dur="0.6"/> and activity across the months across a quarter <pause dur="0.5"/> that will have a price attached to it <pause dur="0.7"/> and they can 
work out by projecting forward whether they're actually within the <trunc>re</trunc> realms of their contract financially <pause dur="1.1"/> what is now being said nationally is that <pause dur="0.4"/> whereas you might get Solihull Hospital <pause dur="0.6"/> charges out <pause dur="0.3"/> # a hysterectomy at two-and-a-half-thousand pounds <pause dur="0.4"/> but Birmingham Heartlands may charge three <pause dur="0.8"/> there will be a national costing formula that will say a hysterectomy is always <pause dur="0.2"/> three-thousand pounds for an example or <pause dur="0.4"/> an acute general medical admission <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> <trunc>f</trunc> <pause dur="0.3"/> for whatever reason is <pause dur="0.4"/> and there will be a national pricing formula <pause dur="0.5"/> because that then gets away from the <trunc>compe</trunc> competition <pause dur="1.5"/> so the price will be linked to activity and it's it's activity times price <pause dur="0.3"/> that's the way the contract is monitored <pause dur="0.8"/> so it's based on <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="1.7"/> <vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/> # locks lumps of activity <pause dur="1.2"/> in the community it's actually measured by contacts so at the moment <pause dur="0.6"/> if you contract as a large purchasing organization for something like district nursing <pause dur="2.6"/> a health authority would contract 
that <pause dur="0.7"/> on how many people has that district nurse seen <pause dur="0.2"/> so how many contacts how many face to face contacts has an has been undertaken <pause dur="0.3"/> again during the quarter <pause dur="0.5"/> during a six month during a twelve month period <pause dur="0.4"/> and the trusts or the providers will put a price on that <pause dur="1.6"/> <trunc>i</trunc> <pause dur="0.3"/> the data <pause dur="0.2"/> and i'm sure from your experiences is less <pause dur="0.3"/> is less easy to analyse it's not as easy to interrogate <pause dur="0.4"/> and question what went on in that contact was it <pause dur="0.6"/> a lengthy contact of an hour did it last five minutes <pause dur="0.2"/> what happened to the patient <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> in that time <pause dur="0.6"/> so there's less sophisticated information in a community <pause dur="0.9"/> even less sophistication if you actually contract on a whole time equivalent basis which is what some of the fundholders did <pause dur="0.4"/> they actually said i don't want <pause dur="0.4"/> to have a contract on contacts i'm not interested <pause dur="1.0"/> i want to buy <trunc>e</trunc> either a whole <pause dur="0.2"/> district nurse <pause dur="0.3"/> time <pause dur="0.5"/> or <trunc>ho</trunc> <pause dur="0.3"/> nought-point-five whole time equivalent or whatever <pause dur="1.1"/> but the <pause dur="0.2"/> regional offices still want this activity measured by contacts <pause dur="0.8"/> because it can be <pause dur="0.5"/>

and can we work through some rationale <pause dur="0.3"/> in relation to <pause dur="0.5"/> working alongside you with the industry <pause dur="0.6"/> and there's still very much a big gap i think <pause dur="0.2"/> between <pause dur="0.4"/> general practice the <trunc>d</trunc> <trunc>d</trunc> pharmaceutical companies are not necessarily seen <pause dur="0.4"/> as partners in that process yet <pause dur="0.6"/> # they're actually seen as <pause dur="0.3"/> the competitors out in the field <pause dur="0.8"/> perhaps the providers of a <pause dur="0.8"/> a few <pause dur="0.2"/> diaries and a <trunc>n</trunc> <vocal desc="laugh" iterated="n"/> <shift feature="voice" new="laugh"/>and a nice lunch <shift feature="voice" new="normal"/><pause dur="1.9"/> now it's # <pause dur="1.6"/> the <pause dur="0.4"/> contracting the purchasing and commissioning process is changing <pause dur="0.4"/> and it's going to continue to change <pause dur="0.4"/> through the proces of primary care group development <pause dur="1.4"/> buildings <pause dur="0.2"/> will be part of the commissioning process so again <pause dur="0.2"/> grants for primary care premises will come into the decision making process around a P-C-G <pause dur="0.9"/> everything around that locality <pause dur="0.4"/> that involves <pause dur="0.3"/> the health improvement <pause dur="0.4"/> of people in that area will be discussed <pause dur="0.4"/> and agreed through <pause dur="0.5"/> a planning process with the primary care group <pause dur="1.3"/> and then they'll be coming back out to you and saying as providers possibly <pause dur="0.5"/> can you provide

actually only need five or six or seven <pause dur="0.9"/> and start to actually rationalize like they've done in health authorities <pause dur="0.3"/> they've actually said we don't need such a robust management structure we can actually manage with less <pause dur="2.2"/> so <pause dur="0.5"/> in the past it's been health authorities and trusts that have suffered <pause dur="0.7"/> the changes in the N-H-S and primary care to a degree has been allowed to <shift feature="voice" new="laugh"/>rumble <shift feature="voice" new="normal"/>on <pause dur="1.1"/> all of a sudden working with practice managers they're beginning to realize <pause dur="0.6"/> that this is no longer the case for them <pause dur="0.2"/> they could well also be at risk in the future <pause dur="0.8"/> because the budget that <pause dur="0.2"/> they <pause dur="0.3"/> have at the moment that protects them and keeps their employment safe with their doctors <pause dur="0.4"/> will be <pause dur="0.2"/> will come under scrutiny as part of the general expenditure of a primary care group <pause dur="3.2"/> training and development is another issue that is funded <pause dur="0.3"/> for primary care in G-M-S <pause dur="0.8"/> we're fighting hard in primary care to have a career structure <pause dur="0.6"/> so people like yourselves can actually start to do academic studies <pause dur="0.3"/> and become

so this is take Warwickshire <pause dur="1.1"/> then we had fundholding <pause dur="2.5"/> and health authorities <pause dur="0.5"/> which split that responsibility <pause dur="0.7"/> and at the beginning <pause dur="0.2"/> we had very few G-P fundholders <pause dur="1.6"/> and we had still the majority of care <pause dur="0.4"/> purchased by the health authority <pause dur="0.9"/> as G-P fundholding gathered momentum <pause dur="0.5"/> through the nineties <pause dur="0.6"/> we actually then started to have <pause dur="1.4"/> percentage of G-P fundholders in Warwickshire <pause dur="0.3"/> was around eighty-five per cent <pause dur="0.9"/> and <pause dur="1.2"/> the <trunc>gen</trunc> the the same amount of services that was within <trunc>h</trunc> health # was <pause dur="0.4"/> the balance <pause dur="0.2"/> however around that the health authority never lost <pause dur="0.3"/> things like learning disabilities <pause dur="0.6"/> mental health <pause dur="0.5"/> emergency care <pause dur="1.5"/> et cetera they they've always hung on to that <pause dur="0.3"/><vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/> but in relation to the <pause dur="0.3"/> fund what inclusion exclusion of fundholding <pause dur="0.3"/> fundholding grew <pause dur="0.3"/> and the responsibilities of the health authority reduced <pause dur="1.0"/> the difficulty with that is <kinesic desc="writes on flip chart" iterated="y" dur="4"/> underneath the G-P fundholders you had <pause dur="1.7"/><kinesic desc="indicates point on flip chart" iterated="n"/> all these different practices <pause dur="0.2"/> all with different working ideas all with different views on how services 
should be delivered <pause dur="2.3"/> forming a strategy <pause dur="4.5"/><kinesic desc="writes on flip chart" iterated="y" dur="4"/> and if we look at back at commissioning deciding <pause dur="0.8"/> from <pause dur="0.6"/><kinesic desc="indicates point on flip chart" iterated="n"/> this point of view <pause dur="0.5"/> what's best to buy <pause dur="0.5"/> how do you get all <kinesic desc="indicates point on flip chart" iterated="n"/> these different people to agree <pause dur="0.8"/> to change something <pause dur="0.3"/> very very difficult very very cumbersome <pause dur="0.5"/> so as a health authority officer <pause dur="0.7"/> we divided into <kinesic desc="writes on flip chart" iterated="y" dur="2"/> five groups <pause dur="1.3"/> which was the start of things to come in Warwickshire they started to say <pause dur="0.5"/> well let's start to <kinesic desc="writes on flip chart" iterated="y" dur="5"/> Nuneaton as one <pause dur="1.2"/> Nuneaton and Bedworth <pause dur="1.0"/> south Warwickshire <pause dur="0.2"/> et cetera so we started already to to focus our <pause dur="0.7"/> # view <pause dur="0.2"/> around local populations <pause dur="0.6"/> and involve <kinesic desc="writes on flip chart" iterated="y" dur="2"/> within those <pause dur="0.2"/> the G-Ps <pause dur="1.6"/> now what's happening with the White Paper <pause dur="0.3"/> is that actually takes that a step further <pause dur="0.3"/><kinesic desc="writes on flip chart" iterated="y" dur="8"/> and it makes them <pause dur="1.5"/> responsible <pause dur="1.4"/> but they're responsible <pause dur="0.5"/> for all <pause dur="0.6"/> the purchasing of that area <pause dur="0.7"/> so what it does do <pause dur="0.3"/> is it actually avoids the fragmentation <pause dur="0.8"/> it recreates the focus again <pause dur="0.3"/> and it ensures the involvement of doctors <pause dur="0.3"/> 'cause even when we were working <kinesic desc="indicates point on flip chart" iterated="n"/> here <pause dur="0.4"/> and we had a commissioning group <pause dur="0.7"/> it's only the <trunc>s</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> sort
