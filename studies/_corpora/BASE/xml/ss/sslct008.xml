you want to <pause dur="0.3"/> pick a topic from last term and have another go at it <pause dur="0.5"/> # i'm i'm willing to accept that <pause dur="0.4"/> okay because you hopefully now have a better idea of what's required of you <pause dur="0.4"/> so if you want to choose a topic from last term <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> then by all means do so and i'll put that mark in rather than the one that you've been given because <pause dur="0.3"/> as i say i think there's a learning process going on <pause dur="0.4"/> of what's required <pause dur="0.9"/> okay <pause dur="2.7"/> right <pause dur="0.2"/> that only applies to visiting students the rest of you know exactly what's required <vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" dur="1"/><pause dur="1.8"/> right <pause dur="16.9"/> oh <pause dur="0.3"/> it's another one of those <trunc>du</trunc> <pause dur="19.2"/> well today we're talking about globalization and liberalization you should all have a handout now <pause dur="1.1"/> # <pause dur="4.0"/> <gap reason="inaudible" extent="2 secs"/> </u> <u who="sm1124" trans="latching"> <gap reason="inaudible" extent="2 secs"/></u><pause dur="11.6"/><u who="nm1122" trans="pause"> have you covered globalization in in your International Relations course so are you doing that course <pause dur="1.1"/> okay <pause dur="1.4"/> well i'll # probably start off by asking you then what do you understand by globalization <pause dur="1.5"/> what's your how would you define it <pause dur="6.4"/> anyone <pause dur="4.5"/> don't be shy <pause dur="2.0"/> globalization you <trunc>n</trunc> if you were if somebody

about Malta <pause dur="0.4"/> and the axes they were using used greenstone <pause dur="0.4"/> which can only have come from somewhere in the Alps <pause dur="0.2"/> towards the Austrian frontier <pause dur="0.6"/> # which is i guess in a straight line's about a thousand miles away <pause dur="0.4"/> and we're talking about five-thousand years ago there was obviously trade going on <pause dur="0.2"/> even then <pause dur="0.5"/> # so there's nothing new about trade <pause dur="0.3"/> in that sense globalization has a very long history <pause dur="0.7"/> # so the idea that it's something new and something spectacular that <pause dur="0.2"/> you know we've really <pause dur="0.4"/> # got to deal with now as a new exciting phenomena <pause dur="0.4"/> in that sense is is overplayed <pause dur="1.0"/> there's another view about globalization isn't there that <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> to quote a a theologian recently who was writing about globalization <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> talked about it ravaging the planet <pause dur="0.3"/> all right which is the other view about globalization <pause dur="0.3"/> particularly in the context of developing countries <pause dur="0.6"/> # the idea somehow that globalization <pause dur="0.5"/> and one of the key instruments of it which are multinational companies <pause dur="0.5"/> # is somehow a 
vehicle for the exploitation of poor countries <pause dur="0.5"/> # and that they're worse off as a result of globalization <pause dur="1.1"/> and of course like any economic change <pause dur="0.7"/> they can be and there are gainers and and losers from from this process <pause dur="0.5"/> but our job is to take a more objective view <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> as i say stating that it's not something entirely new <pause dur="0.8"/> # the new part of it <pause dur="0.3"/> is the speed <pause dur="0.5"/> at which factor and product markets <pause dur="0.2"/> are being linked together <pause dur="0.5"/> that's the new part <pause dur="0.2"/> going back to what you were saying earlier <pause dur="0.3"/> about the speed of communication the speed and the flow of information <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> so the phenomena itself isn't isn't new it's just a continuation <pause dur="0.5"/> of traders for many thousands of years <pause dur="0.4"/> # engaged in the movement of people and the movement of goods <pause dur="0.6"/> # and today particularly services <pause dur="0.6"/> # but it's the speed at which i think the change is taking place <pause dur="1.0"/> # so the first question then is why <pause dur="0.5"/> the speed of change <pause dur="0.8"/> # in which factor and product markets have been much more closely integrated what are the forces 
giving rise to that <pause dur="0.9"/> and secondly what are the role of multinational companies or <pause dur="0.2"/> transnational corporations as they're more generally known perhaps outside of Britain <pause dur="0.7"/> # what is their role in this process they're seen as being central to it <pause dur="0.5"/> # what is their role in the process <pause dur="0.3"/> and what <trunc>i</trunc> what are the costs and benefits <pause dur="0.4"/> of multinational companies <pause dur="0.4"/> # that are operating <pause dur="0.5"/> # in post-developing countries <pause dur="0.2"/> that's what we'll be looking at today <pause dur="3.2"/> okay <pause dur="0.4"/> i've given you <pause dur="0.3"/> <kinesic desc="turns on overhead projector showing transparency" iterated="n"/> there <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> my definition <pause dur="0.7"/> of globalization <pause dur="0.5"/> it's <pause dur="0.3"/> the <reading>rapid increase in the integration of world markets <pause dur="0.4"/> particularly for goods and services <pause dur="0.2"/> and financial markets</reading> <pause dur="1.0"/> # <pause dur="2.0"/> do you have another handout there please is there a spare one <pause dur="0.5"/> yeah <pause dur="11.9"/><event desc="passes handout to observer" iterated="n"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> and i take this i mean i'd be interested in your views but i've listed some of the factors that seem to me to be important in driving the speed with which this is taking place <pause dur="0.4"/> disintegration of of # <pause dur="1.1"/> # of these markets but <pause dur="0.2"/> please tell me if you can 
think of other <pause dur="0.5"/> important factors that i've missed out <pause dur="0.8"/> the first one seems to me <pause dur="0.2"/> to be falling transport and communication costs <pause dur="0.5"/> mm <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> i mean that <pause dur="0.2"/> fall in transport costs <pause dur="0.2"/> particularly fuelled the huge expansion of trade from eighteen-seventy onwards <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> combined of course with the Industrial Revolution <pause dur="0.3"/> spreading <pause dur="0.3"/> # in # Europe and North America <pause dur="0.7"/> but we've seen a further revolution <pause dur="0.3"/> in transport costs <pause dur="0.3"/> i've put there that sea freights <pause dur="0.3"/> have fallen by seventy per cent in real terms <pause dur="0.4"/> # between nineteen-eighty and nineteen-ninety-six so it's still going on <pause dur="0.5"/> this is the containerization revolution <pause dur="0.2"/> this is the huge increase in the size of ships <pause dur="0.4"/> # and with it all the mechanization that goes with that <pause dur="0.5"/> # in port handling facilities <pause dur="0.3"/> and the rest <pause dur="0.8"/> # so we've seen huge investment <pause dur="0.4"/> # in all this new technology in in in shipping and port handling <pause dur="0.5"/> which has greatly reduced <pause dur="0.3"/> cost <pause dur="1.0"/> maybe perhaps given some of the sea disasters that we've seen <pause dur="0.4"/> # perhaps the pressure on costs is a bit 
too much <pause dur="0.5"/> # but that's another story <pause dur="0.7"/> and of course the <pause dur="0.2"/> huge fall in communications cost <pause dur="0.3"/> i don't know if anyone's got any <pause dur="0.7"/> numbers they could give me i couldn't find <pause dur="0.2"/> any easily about <pause dur="0.3"/> some number that might capture <pause dur="0.5"/> the huge fall in communication cost <pause dur="0.5"/> you know <pause dur="0.3"/> the <pause dur="0.4"/> <trunc>tr</trunc> the local cost of transmitting data back and forward say to America <pause dur="0.5"/> or the changes in the cost of telephone calls and <pause dur="0.2"/> so forth anyone any ideas on that <pause dur="1.1"/> read any articles no i couldn't come across anything <pause dur="0.3"/> off hand <pause dur="0.2"/> but it's quite obvious <pause dur="0.2"/> that there's been an enormous fall and that's continuing <pause dur="0.4"/> # with # all the mergers <pause dur="0.3"/> that we've seen in the and the and the new technology that keeps pouring in every year <pause dur="0.4"/> into the telecommunications industry <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.8"/> using satellites cables <pause dur="0.3"/> combined with computers and everything else <pause dur="0.5"/> so clearly that's <pause dur="0.2"/> must be a huge figure as well <pause dur="0.2"/> probably much much greater than the seventy per cent that i've given <pause dur="0.5"/> # over those # sixteen seventeen years <pause dur="0.8"/> so <pause dur="0.7"/> the fall in 
transport and and communication costs seems to me to be one critical factor <pause dur="0.3"/> speeding up this integration of markets <pause dur="1.1"/> secondly changes in technology <pause dur="1.5"/> # <pause dur="1.0"/> in the sixties and seventies and on into the eighties <pause dur="0.4"/> # it was still an era <pause dur="0.2"/> of sort of a Henry Ford <pause dur="0.2"/> type <pause dur="0.3"/> # assembly operations <pause dur="0.4"/> where you had huge integrated plants <pause dur="0.4"/> # benefitting from economies of scale <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> in production <pause dur="0.2"/> mm <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="1.5"/> and the big change in technology <pause dur="0.3"/> # as much as i understand it which is not a lot <pause dur="0.5"/> # is that that has <pause dur="0.8"/> completely changed almost right across the board <pause dur="0.7"/> # where new technologies computer controlled technologies in in particular <pause dur="0.3"/> have enabled the whole scale of production <pause dur="0.4"/> now to be much smaller than it was before <pause dur="0.7"/> to put it more technically minimum efficient scale of production <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> all right the lowest point of the of the long run average cost curve <pause dur="0.6"/> # minimum efficient scale of production <pause dur="0.4"/> # is now at a much lower level of output <pause dur="0.2"/> than it was before <pause dur="1.1"/> now that must be good news for developing countries <pause dur="0.5"/> mm <pause dur="0.5"/> 
because <pause dur="0.5"/> large-scale production <pause dur="1.2"/> inevitably <pause dur="0.3"/> centres production in the industrialized countries <pause dur="0.4"/> mm <pause dur="0.2"/> because <pause dur="0.4"/> they have the large markets <pause dur="0.2"/> they have access to capital <pause dur="0.2"/> and skilled labour <pause dur="0.2"/> and all the rest that is needed for these huge integrated plants <pause dur="0.6"/> and a small developing country <pause dur="0.3"/> finds it very difficult to break in <pause dur="0.5"/> to industries <pause dur="0.3"/> where there are large economies of scale in production <pause dur="0.9"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> so this change in technology <pause dur="0.4"/> which is decreasing minimum efficient scale of production <pause dur="0.8"/> must be good news surely for developing countries <pause dur="0.4"/> moving in <pause dur="0.2"/> particularly into the new technologies and new products and new industries <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="2.9"/> # leaving perhaps the larger assembly operations which may still be subject to economies of scale <pause dur="0.5"/> to # to the industrialized countries <pause dur="1.9"/> so we've <reading>changes in technology decreasing <pause dur="0.3"/> the minimum efficient scale of production</reading> <pause dur="1.2"/> and <pause dur="0.8"/> secondly <reading>changes in technology greatly increasing the speed and capacity <pause dur="0.3"/> to process information</reading> <pause dur="0.8"/> okay it's the combination of computers <pause dur="0.5"/> and <pause dur="0.4"/> 
# and information technology <pause dur="0.2"/> in in general <pause dur="0.2"/> satellites cables <pause dur="0.2"/> the rest <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> which enable us to transfer huge <pause dur="0.2"/> flows of information <pause dur="0.6"/> # highly technical information <pause dur="0.3"/> almost instantaneously <pause dur="0.3"/> from one side of the world to another <pause dur="1.3"/> # last year <pause dur="0.4"/> # i was # lucky enough to be in Mauritius <pause dur="0.6"/> # go there from time to time <pause dur="0.2"/> doing <pause dur="0.3"/> # some work for various organizations <pause dur="0.4"/> just happened to choose Mauritius <pause dur="0.4"/> # <vocal desc="laughter" n="ss" iterated="y" dur="1"/> <pause dur="0.8"/> and there the key sector indeed the only # manufacturing sector on the small island <pause dur="0.5"/> # is the clothing industry <pause dur="0.9"/> i mean in the <pause dur="0.5"/> to give you an idea of its expansion <pause dur="0.6"/> # in the late seventies there was hardly any clothing industry at all in Mauritius <pause dur="0.4"/> they were almost totally dependent on exports of sugar <pause dur="1.0"/> # sugar cane of course <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> # huge expansion <pause dur="0.2"/> in the population due to past growth of population <pause dur="0.5"/> so <pause dur="0.2"/> 
# they had ooh <pause dur="0.2"/> twenty thirty per cent measured unemployment <pause dur="0.2"/> and of course as we know in developing countries <pause dur="0.5"/> # real unemployment is always quite a bit greater than measured unemployment <pause dur="0.8"/> but you know twenty thirty per cent measured unemployment <pause dur="0.4"/> much higher percentages of unemployment among young people 'cause there weren't any jobs for them <pause dur="1.0"/> and so the government <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> intervened into this situation <pause dur="0.4"/> and through various <pause dur="0.5"/> processes that we'll be talking about in a moment <pause dur="0.4"/> # attracted in foreign direct investment particularly <pause dur="0.4"/> # Hong Kong investment <pause dur="0.5"/> to set up a clothing industry <pause dur="1.2"/> and by the <pause dur="0.6"/> nineteen-eighty-six eighty-seven <pause dur="1.0"/> they had become the the world's third largest exporter <pause dur="0.5"/> of <pause dur="0.2"/> # woollen clothing <pause dur="0.9"/> # you know proud boast is there isn't a single sheep on the island <pause dur="0.6"/> # but all the wool comes from Australia <pause dur="0.2"/> # it's made up then into woollen garments <pause dur="0.3"/> and then it's exported particularly to Europe <pause dur="0.3"/> but also to North America <pause dur="1.3"/> # <pause dur="0.9"/> having started off with woollen 
garments they also have # got into <pause dur="0.4"/> # cotton <pause dur="0.3"/> and into mixtures of cotton and artificial fibres and now it's a very thriving industry indeed it's the it's the main <pause dur="0.2"/> source of employment on the island <pause dur="0.4"/> and totally transformed the standard of living <pause dur="0.4"/> there in the matter of a decade <pause dur="0.7"/> so it's a a really a spectacular success story <pause dur="0.3"/> so far <pause dur="1.0"/> and going round some of these factories which of course were new factories <pause dur="0.4"/> # one of the points that was made to me <pause dur="0.4"/> was that <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="1.3"/> we only get the orders from Europe <pause dur="0.3"/> and some of these # factories were supplying fashion houses in in France in particular <pause dur="0.3"/> 'cause Mauritius has got a long history <pause dur="0.3"/> # of association with France it used to be a French colony <pause dur="0.4"/> before the # # Napoleonic Wars <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="1.3"/> and # the fashion houses in France <pause dur="0.6"/> only give the orders to the factories in in Mauritius <pause dur="0.2"/> at the very last minute <pause dur="0.4"/> you know <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> and then they'll say say it's sort of <pause dur="0.4"/> # # <trunc>s</trunc> spring clothing <pause dur="0.5"/> they'll get the orders round about September October <pause dur="0.4"/> and delivery's got to be 
now January <pause dur="0.3"/> you know <pause dur="0.7"/> # which of course a very short time period for them <pause dur="0.4"/> # to respond to this <pause dur="0.7"/> and one of the key factors in their ability to respond to it <pause dur="0.4"/> is the ability to transfer <pause dur="0.4"/> the details of the order <pause dur="0.2"/> the exact you know precise patterns that are needed <pause dur="0.4"/> the precise specification of the clothing the different sizes the different styles <pause dur="0.3"/> measurements <pause dur="0.2"/> that are <trunc>a</trunc> all needed <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> including all the instructions for setting up <pause dur="0.5"/> the numerically controlled <pause dur="0.5"/> # # machinery <pause dur="0.3"/> which they then have computer controlled machinery <pause dur="0.4"/> which is then used <pause dur="0.2"/> to cut the cloth <pause dur="0.4"/> and then it goes off for finishing which is more a sort of a a a labour intensive operation <pause dur="0.5"/> # you know the stitching and the and various <pause dur="0.4"/> bits and pieces <pause dur="0.4"/> # that gives the style to the garment <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> but a key factor was this ability to transfer very very detailed information <pause dur="0.4"/> to and fro the factory <pause dur="0.3"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> # the fashion houses <pause dur="0.5"/> # in the space of a second <pause dur="0.9"/> # and to transfer that information <pause dur="0.2"/> straight onto the new machinery <pause dur="0.6"/> as 
well as the fact <pause dur="0.2"/> that minimum efficient scale of production <pause dur="0.3"/> was much smaller <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> than it had been maybe <pause dur="0.2"/> you know fifteen twenty years before <pause dur="0.5"/> # using the old machinery <pause dur="1.5"/> so that's an example then <pause dur="0.2"/> of a way in which <pause dur="0.2"/> we've had a decrease in minimum efficient scale of production combined with <pause dur="0.6"/> # this technological revolution <pause dur="0.4"/> in transmitting information <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> combining together <pause dur="0.3"/> to give a strong comparative advantage <pause dur="0.4"/> # to a developing country such as Mauritius <pause dur="2.9"/> the third element that seems to me important are <pause dur="0.2"/> # changes in the organization of production <pause dur="0.6"/> # at an international level <pause dur="1.2"/> i mean all of you lot have heard about international sourcing <pause dur="0.5"/> and i'm sure you've seen articles and <pause dur="0.4"/> maybe diagrams showing <pause dur="0.3"/> # <trunc>lo</trunc> <trunc>th</trunc> <pause dur="0.3"/> where components for a car today come from <pause dur="0.6"/> # the gear box may be made in in # <pause dur="0.2"/> # Brazil <pause dur="0.3"/> # the powertrain maybe comes from <pause dur="0.2"/> # Taiwan <pause dur="0.3"/> # the seats are maybe made in Italy <pause dur="0.3"/> # the electronics <pause dur="0.2"/> # come from Germany and so forth <pause dur="0.4"/> and then it's all brought together <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> in the

# the organizational and managerial <pause dur="0.2"/> structures and norms <pause dur="0.4"/> and methods of # # and and practices <pause dur="0.2"/> of <pause dur="0.4"/> these huge <pause dur="0.4"/> # transnational corporations <pause dur="0.7"/> # so they build on these skills by investing heavily in people <pause dur="0.7"/> # that's why they're good organizations to join <pause dur="0.4"/> but it's essential for their survival that they do so <pause dur="0.7"/> # if they don't heavily invest in people <pause dur="0.5"/> and in organizational skills <pause dur="0.6"/> then the sheer size of the organization <pause dur="0.2"/> will be its downfall <pause dur="2.0"/> # <pause dur="1.0"/> and they also because they're producing on a comparatively large scale <pause dur="0.4"/> # they also develop sophisticated marketing networks <pause dur="1.2"/> # and again <pause dur="0.3"/> this is # a key ownership advantage <pause dur="1.9"/> locational advantage <pause dur="1.0"/> # is simply stating that it's more profitable <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="1.1"/> to produce whatever it is the goods or service <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> <vocal desc="cough" iterated="n"/> by utilizing assets <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> in different countries <pause dur="2.0"/> so that production takes place <pause dur="0.2"/> utilizing assets in different countries <pause dur="0.4"/> rather than just the home country <pause dur="0.5"/> of <pause dur="0.5"/> # the corporation <pause dur="1.0"/> mm <pause dur="1.4"/> so again this is another characteristic <pause dur="0.2"/> the there's this <pause dur="0.5"/> 
# locational advantage <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> which means that <pause dur="0.7"/> # they can <pause dur="1.3"/> use these assets <pause dur="0.2"/> particularly these intangible assets their <pause dur="0.2"/> their ownership advantage and produce the goods or service <pause dur="0.5"/> utilizing <pause dur="0.4"/> # the factors of production <pause dur="0.2"/> in a number of countries and not just the home country <pause dur="0.4"/> of the of the multinational <pause dur="1.1"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> otherwise you simply produce the product <pause dur="0.2"/> in your home country and then you simply export the good or service <pause dur="0.2"/> you wouldn't be <pause dur="0.2"/> a transnational corporation <pause dur="0.4"/> you would simply be a large company exporting <pause dur="0.6"/> we could talk about international production here <pause dur="0.5"/> so another key characteristics of the goods and services <pause dur="0.5"/> are that they can be more competitively produced <pause dur="0.6"/> # utilizing factors of production <pause dur="0.4"/> at an international level <pause dur="1.7"/> and the third element there which is <pause dur="0.5"/> the one that's perhaps most difficult for people to grasp <pause dur="0.4"/> is the internalization advantage <pause dur="3.2"/> # <pause dur="1.5"/> by internalization <pause dur="0.6"/> we mean <pause dur="0.5"/> overcoming market failure <pause dur="1.7"/> # in in open markets <pause dur="0.7"/> or regular markets if you like <pause dur="0.9"/> by developing 
internal markets <pause dur="0.3"/> within the transnational corporation <pause dur="1.5"/> now the clearest example of market failure <pause dur="0.4"/> and the need for an internal market therefore <pause dur="0.3"/> is the market for knowledge <pause dur="0.8"/> mm <pause dur="1.0"/> firms guard their ownership advantages their their knowledge <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="1.0"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> fiercely <pause dur="1.2"/> if you join one of these firms <pause dur="0.2"/> the <trunc>fir</trunc> one of the first things you'll do have to do <pause dur="0.4"/> is to sign the declaration <pause dur="0.5"/> which will list all sorts of things <pause dur="0.3"/> which you must not do <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> # and which you are will will be sued if you transfer knowledge outside of the firm <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> even without making it available to their competitors <pause dur="0.6"/> but you you <pause dur="0.4"/> # you must have a clear desk <pause dur="0.4"/> # you must lock away <pause dur="0.3"/> # your various pieces of information in certain places <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> it is absolutely forbidden <pause dur="0.2"/> to copy down onto floppy disks <shift feature="voice" new="laugh"/>sources <shift feature="voice" new="normal"/>of information <pause dur="0.4"/> # and so on and they <pause dur="0.2"/> # they they police <pause dur="0.3"/> their computer systems <pause dur="0.4"/> to make sure that people <pause dur="0.2"/> are not misusing this knowledge 'cause knowledge is the most precious commodity that they have <pause dur="0.5"/> in 
their competitive advantage <pause dur="1.0"/> and the problem for them is <pause dur="0.3"/> on the one hand for the firm or for the enterprise <pause dur="0.5"/> to work efficiently <pause dur="0.7"/> knowledge has to be freely available <pause dur="0.9"/> # within the corporation itself <pause dur="0.5"/> otherwise <pause dur="0.3"/> you're not exploiting <pause dur="0.4"/> your <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> # your <pause dur="0.3"/> # competitive advantage whether it's in computer systems or <pause dur="0.3"/> in producing cars or whatever it happens to be <pause dur="1.0"/> # on the other hand you want to guard this knowledge <pause dur="0.2"/> so that it doesn't <pause dur="0.2"/> # it's not available to your competitors <pause dur="1.4"/> also <pause dur="0.6"/> knowledge is a is a difficult product once you try and sell it <pause dur="0.8"/> hence all the complicated <pause dur="0.4"/> # legislation that we have <pause dur="0.4"/> on intellectual property rights <pause dur="0.5"/> remember again last term we talked about <pause dur="0.4"/> the W-T-O agreement <pause dur="0.4"/> on trade related <pause dur="0.2"/> intellectual property rights <pause dur="0.5"/> and that was <pause dur="0.2"/> fuelled particularly <pause dur="0.3"/> by American companies <pause dur="0.5"/> who were very concerned <pause dur="0.3"/> about firms throughout the world <pause dur="0.5"/> # ripping off their knowledge <pause dur="0.4"/> # for software or for anything that happened to be <pause dur="0.2"/> # you know i talked about in Taiwan it's <pause dur="0.2"/> politely

it is is no longer competitive <pause dur="0.9"/> so <pause dur="0.3"/> knowledge is your <trunc>o</trunc> often your most <trunc>comp</trunc> # precious <pause dur="0.2"/> competitive advantage <pause dur="1.1"/> but you can't sell that knowledge easily <pause dur="0.5"/> 'cause as soon as you put it into the <pause dur="0.3"/> <trunc>i</trunc> into the open market <pause dur="0.3"/> it becomes a public good <pause dur="0.6"/> mm becomes a a free good <pause dur="0.6"/> # anybody can rip it off <pause dur="0.5"/> # anybody can use this reverse engineering to see how you've built the product <pause dur="0.4"/> # what components you've used and how you've designed the circuitry and so forth <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> and you can't <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> adequately guard that knowledge <pause dur="0.5"/> through the law although you obviously as i say in the in in in the TRIPS aggreement <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> we've <pause dur="0.2"/> been trying to do that <pause dur="0.8"/> so knowledge is this very fragile commodity <pause dur="0.7"/> and 
what multinational companies transnational corporations do <pause dur="0.6"/> is to make this knowledge freely available within the company <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> but guard it against going outside <pause dur="1.5"/> so there <trunc>g</trunc> got market failure then <pause dur="0.2"/> and the market for knowledge <pause dur="0.4"/> you can't <pause dur="0.3"/> the firm cannot obtain <pause dur="0.4"/> # the <pause dur="0.5"/> # value <pause dur="0.3"/> of its knowledge by selling it in markets <pause dur="0.7"/> mm because it can't make it exclusive <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> so if it keeps it internal within the firm <pause dur="0.5"/> but then <pause dur="0.2"/> maximizes <pause dur="0.4"/> # the knowledge advantage that it has <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.8"/> by # <trunc>ha</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> by developing internal markets <pause dur="0.6"/> so that <pause dur="0.2"/> there is parts of the organization of access to the knowledge they require <pause dur="0.4"/> but don't have access to the knowledge <pause dur="0.2"/> that they don't need <pause dur="0.3"/> mm and you control <pause dur="0.2"/> the dissemination of knowledge in that way <pause dur="0.7"/> # to <pause dur="0.4"/> # guard against <pause dur="0.3"/> it # going to your competitors <pause dur="0.4"/> but at the same time <pause dur="0.2"/> exploiting it <pause dur="0.2"/> in an optimal manner <pause dur="0.3"/> # within the <pause dur="0.4"/> <trunc>i</trunc> in <pause dur="0.2"/> in the company <pause dur="2.7"/> now this knowledge of course it can't <trunc>simp</trunc> # isn't simply in terms of patent and # # various other proprietary knowledge like

higher risk <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="1.0"/> you still shouldn't have too much difficulty in financing that project <pause dur="0.3"/> mm <pause dur="0.4"/> there are sophisticated international banks <pause dur="0.5"/> who are <trunc>s</trunc> scouring the world <pause dur="0.4"/> looking for <pause dur="0.3"/> # good rates of return for their for their clients' money <pause dur="1.0"/> # if you're a small developing country there might be a problem <pause dur="0.3"/> if you're just too small for them to be bothered with <pause dur="0.4"/> you know anything less than a few billion dollars worth of investment <shift feature="voice" new="laugh"/> they might <shift feature="voice" new="normal"/> not be interested in <pause dur="0.5"/> # but on the whole <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> we've got sufficiently sophisticated international <pause dur="0.2"/> capital markets these days <pause dur="0.5"/> for <pause dur="0.3"/> investment <pause dur="0.5"/> # and the flow of investment <pause dur="0.4"/> not to be terribly important <pause dur="0.4"/> # as a benefit from multinationals <pause dur="2.0"/> obviously it is still important but <pause dur="1.1"/> one of the key points unfortunately about the flow of foreign direct investment is that it's heavily concentrated <pause dur="0.5"/> in a relatively few countries few developing or transitional economy <pause dur="0.2"/> and i've given you some figures there <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="1.0"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> though in in recent 
years <pause dur="0.4"/> investment been particularly in the huge economies of China <pause dur="0.2"/> also in in in in Brazil <pause dur="0.4"/> and then <pause dur="0.3"/> # Mexico <pause dur="0.2"/> principally because of NAFTA <pause dur="0.2"/> the North Atlantic <pause dur="0.5"/> # the # # # North American Free Trade Agreement <pause dur="0.4"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> # the transitional economy <pause dur="0.6"/> and <pause dur="0.8"/> the <pause dur="0.2"/> new NIX <pause dur="0.4"/> # Malaysia and Thailand <pause dur="2.6"/> conversely the whole of sub-Saharan Africa <pause dur="0.4"/> # only accounts for five per cent <pause dur="0.3"/> of foreign direct investment <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="3.0"/> but the second point i'll make <pause dur="0.7"/> is that <pause dur="0.5"/> as i say <pause dur="0.7"/> if you've got a worthwhile investment project you should be able to borrow in international capital markets <pause dur="0.7"/> and the involvement of T-N-Cs <pause dur="0.6"/> isn't just confined to foreign direct investment <pause dur="0.7"/> today there's a whole sophisticated <pause dur="0.2"/> forms <pause dur="0.3"/> of involvement <pause dur="0.6"/> which may or may not involve <pause dur="0.3"/> foreign direct investment <pause dur="0.5"/> licensing agreements <pause dur="0.2"/> joint ventures management contracts <pause dur="0.3"/> turnkey projects <pause dur="0.2"/> all sorts of ways <pause dur="0.5"/> in which <pause dur="0.4"/> # multinational transnational corporations <pause dur="0.4"/> can be involved <pause dur="0.4"/> in the production of a good or service <pause dur="0.2"/> in a developing country <pause dur="0.4"/> it 
doesn't just have to be a wholly owned <pause dur="0.3"/> # affiliate <pause dur="0.3"/> of the of the multinational <pause dur="0.3"/> and indeed increasingly today <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> transnational corporations <pause dur="0.3"/> are <pause dur="0.3"/> quite wary about having wholly owned affiliates operating in developing countries <pause dur="0.5"/> # they prefer joint ventures <pause dur="0.3"/> quite often governments in developing countries <pause dur="0.4"/> # require them to have joint ventures <pause dur="0.5"/> but in any case it it minimizes their exposure to risk <pause dur="0.6"/> by having a joint venture <pause dur="0.2"/> or by having a licensing agreement <pause dur="0.3"/> or the rest <pause dur="0.3"/> rather than <pause dur="0.3"/> putting large sums of capital in <pause dur="0.7"/> # as i say there's international capital markets to deal with that side of things <pause dur="2.8"/> so it's perhaps the second form of involvement then the the sort of non-equity forms of involvement which are increasingly important today in the activities <pause dur="0.4"/> of <pause dur="0.2"/> # transnationals <pause dur="1.9"/> the second benefit is increased employment <pause dur="0.6"/> # particularly for women in the manufacturing sector <pause dur="0.6"/> if you look at the <pause dur="0.3"/> opening chapter of your textbook <pause dur="0.4"/> there's # a little story in there <pause dur="0.3"/> about # <pause dur="0.6"/> a # <pause dur="1.2"/> a

manufacturing sector <pause dur="0.5"/> in developing countries <pause dur="0.4"/> so <pause dur="0.6"/> providing employment for women may be particularly valuable <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> in these countries <pause dur="1.3"/> third that it obviously increases real income <pause dur="1.4"/> remember <pause dur="0.3"/> it's the multiplier effect here <pause dur="0.3"/> okay it's not simply the direct employment <pause dur="0.5"/> say of women <pause dur="0.4"/> in an electronics assembly <pause dur="0.3"/> # plant or whatever it happens to be <pause dur="0.4"/> it's not simply that direct employment <pause dur="0.4"/> there's also the multiplier effects of that <pause dur="0.5"/> you remember that <pause dur="0.4"/> the multiplier effects can be quite substantial <pause dur="0.6"/> # because it's a labour intensive operation <pause dur="1.1"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> then <pause dur="0.7"/> the women employed in that factory will then go out they'll have a high propensity to consume <pause dur="0.2"/> all right given very low levels of income <pause dur="0.5"/> so a high proportion of their wages will be spent <pause dur="0.5"/> mostly on local <pause dur="0.4"/> # goods and services <pause dur="0.3"/> mm <pause dur="0.2"/> and that'll then lead to multiplier <pause dur="0.2"/> increases <pause dur="0.3"/> # in output <pause dur="0.5"/> employment <pause dur="0.5"/> and real incomes <pause dur="0.5"/> throughout the economy <pause dur="0.5"/> mm <pause dur="2.9"/> # fourthly <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> depending on the activity of multinationals and i'll come on to that <pause dur="0.2"/> # later on <pause dur="0.7"/> # there'd

all right <pause dur="0.5"/> # you know you set up your assembly plant <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> for <pause dur="0.4"/> # # <pause dur="0.2"/> say in Malaysia <pause dur="0.7"/> # for assembling electronic goods <pause dur="0.4"/> # whatever it happens to be <pause dur="1.1"/> but then Malaysia begins to develop and real wages rise <pause dur="0.6"/> and so you pack up shop and you go off to China <pause dur="0.4"/> because China's now got a much more open door policy <pause dur="0.2"/> and wage rates are a third those in Malaysia mm <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> and in when wage rates rise in in China <pause dur="0.2"/> well you go off to Africa okay <pause dur="0.3"/> so <pause dur="0.2"/> # footloose then <pause dur="0.6"/> because they're transnational corporations <pause dur="0.4"/> they have <pause dur="0.3"/> complete knowledge <pause dur="0.5"/> of where exactly <pause dur="0.5"/> is <pause dur="0.4"/> the most efficient <pause dur="0.2"/> and the cheapest <pause dur="0.4"/> # location <pause dur="0.2"/> for their production <pause dur="0.3"/> mm <pause dur="0.5"/> and they can utilize this information <pause dur="0.3"/> to switch production from one country to another <pause dur="0.7"/> footloose <pause dur="2.2"/> # <pause dur="1.4"/> you have to have be a little careful with that argument <pause dur="1.0"/> because it assumes that the costs <pause dur="0.4"/> of <pause dur="0.6"/> being here today and gone tomorrow <pause dur="0.4"/> are virtually zero <pause dur="0.5"/> and that's never the case <pause dur="0.8"/> when a transnational is deciding <pause dur="0.2"/> when it will locate production <pause dur="0.8"/> they will invest a lot of resources <pause dur="0.9"/> in <pause dur="0.6"/> 
looking at alternative locations <pause dur="0.7"/> what are the costs and benefits <pause dur="0.3"/> of locating in Sri Lanka as opposed to in Southern India <pause dur="0.2"/> as opposed to Mauritius <pause dur="0.3"/> et cetera okay <pause dur="0.4"/> and they'll be looking obviously <pause dur="0.2"/> at the local resources that are available <pause dur="0.2"/> the tax system <pause dur="0.5"/> but also the political situation how politically stable are the countries <pause dur="0.5"/> # what are their regulations governing repatriation of profits <pause dur="0.4"/> is there a possibility of nationalization <pause dur="0.4"/> all sorts of factors come in <pause dur="0.4"/> before they actually locate in a country <pause dur="0.8"/> so there's a <pause dur="0.2"/> a quite a considerable investment <pause dur="0.6"/> in setting up <pause dur="0.4"/> even a a a simple assembly operation <pause dur="0.5"/> in a developing country <pause dur="0.4"/> it's not costless <pause dur="1.0"/> having invested <pause dur="0.5"/> that time and energy and resources <pause dur="0.6"/> # they're not going to suddenly just pack up and go away tomorrow <pause dur="0.4"/> mm <pause dur="0.4"/> 'cause they'll have to repeat the exercise all over again for some other country <pause dur="0.9"/> so what tends to happen <pause dur="0.6"/> is that having located in a developing country <pause dur="0.5"/> they will remain there <pause dur="0.5"/> mm <pause dur="0.8"/> unless things get <pause dur="0.2"/> very bad or <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> # 
wage rates really go through the roof in which case <pause dur="0.3"/> they'll want to move somewhere else <pause dur="0.5"/> but the big decision <pause dur="0.3"/> really is <pause dur="0.6"/> do we expand production <pause dur="0.8"/> say in Malaysia <pause dur="0.3"/> okay in the electronics <unclear>theme</unclear> <pause dur="0.4"/> or do we set up <pause dur="0.2"/> a new plant in China <pause dur="0.7"/> it's the marginal decision like that <pause dur="0.5"/> which transnationals make <pause dur="0.6"/> rather than the absolute decision of closing one factory here <pause dur="0.5"/> and <pause dur="0.3"/> # relocating it to another country <pause dur="1.3"/> so it's more a case of <pause dur="0.2"/> where do we expand production do we use our existing <pause dur="0.3"/> # facilities <pause dur="0.2"/> in particular developing countries <pause dur="0.3"/> or do we go into a new situation <pause dur="0.6"/> what's the costs of uncertainty <pause dur="0.6"/> of of of moving into a new <pause dur="0.3"/> country and into a new situation <pause dur="1.3"/> so provided the experience then the initial experience <pause dur="0.6"/> # of setting up <pause dur="0.6"/> in the developing country <pause dur="0.5"/> # proves to be <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> profitable and worthwhile <pause dur="0.3"/> # venture <pause dur="0.3"/> they'll tend to stay there <pause dur="0.3"/> mm at least for some considerable period of time <pause dur="4.8"/> indeed there is some evidence to show that as real if the if the initial experience <pause dur="0.2"/> is a <pause dur="0.2"/> is a profitable 
one <pause dur="0.8"/> as real wages rise <pause dur="1.1"/> so instead of closing down the factory and moving somewhere else <pause dur="0.2"/> they'll change the nature of the production <pause dur="0.6"/> they'll they'll they'll move upmarket into higher value added operations <pause dur="0.4"/> so you might start with simple assembly operations <pause dur="0.8"/> but as the <pause dur="0.5"/> developing country the host developing country <pause dur="0.3"/> becomes more developed <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> a greater pool of skilled labour <pause dur="0.8"/> # higher levels of education and the rest <pause dur="0.5"/> so they'll move into higher value added operations <pause dur="0.2"/> rather than close the factory down <pause dur="1.0"/> # that's certainly what's happened <pause dur="0.4"/> in the newly industrialized countries <pause dur="0.4"/> # of South Korea Taiwan <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> but also in the next wave of NIX Malaysia <pause dur="0.3"/> # Thailand <pause dur="0.4"/> # and in Latin American countries <pause dur="1.1"/> so the reaction to rising real wages is not to close the factory <pause dur="0.8"/> generally speaking <pause dur="0.9"/> but rather to move into as i say higher value added operations <pause dur="0.7"/> but obviously again it's an empirical question <pause dur="4.1"/> loss of sovereignty <pause dur="2.5"/> # well that's really follows from what i've just been saying just now <pause dur="0.5"/> 
# <pause dur="0.2"/> in terms of the ability <pause dur="0.2"/> of a post-<pause dur="0.3"/>government <pause dur="0.3"/> to allocate resources <pause dur="0.3"/> # within its economy <pause dur="0.6"/> that's in in the economic sense of the term <pause dur="0.5"/> # # loss of sovereignty <pause dur="0.9"/> but it also could be more general <pause dur="0.4"/> in the sense that <pause dur="0.2"/> the multinational <pause dur="0.8"/> can be a terribly <trunc>ins</trunc> important source <pause dur="0.4"/> of employment <pause dur="0.6"/> government earnings <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> in the small developing country <pause dur="0.4"/> okay <pause dur="0.5"/> and so it can exert political influence <pause dur="0.4"/> as well as economic influence <pause dur="1.6"/> the multinational may well be able to influence government policy in general <pause dur="1.3"/> # for example they may influence <pause dur="0.4"/> be a strong influence <pause dur="0.5"/> for liberalizing <pause dur="0.2"/> trade policy <pause dur="1.0"/> mm <pause dur="0.4"/> so that they can <pause dur="0.2"/> import goods <pause dur="0.3"/> # free of tariffs and duties and other restrictions <pause dur="0.7"/> they may put pressure on post-governments <pause dur="0.3"/> to liberalize the capital account <pause dur="0.5"/> of the balance of payments <pause dur="0.5"/> so that they can move capital and earnings and profits <pause dur="0.4"/> in and out of the country <pause dur="0.3"/> # more freely than they <pause dur="0.4"/> # can at the moment <pause dur="0.9"/> they can exert influence on tax policies <pause dur="0.4"/> on labour <pause dur="0.2"/> and social and environmental legislation <pause dur="1.2"/> 
in terms of their own objectives <pause dur="1.2"/> in that sense then <pause dur="0.5"/> there can be a loss of sovereignty <pause dur="0.6"/> # as well as <pause dur="0.2"/> # the narrower <pause dur="0.7"/> aspect <pause dur="0.5"/> of <pause dur="0.5"/> you know threatening to pull out if you <pause dur="0.5"/> # if you don't do such and such <pause dur="3.4"/> and the final one i've list there # <pause dur="0.8"/> little phrase by a Latin American economist <pause dur="0.5"/> # Osvaldo Sunkel <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> there's the # dependence <distinct lang="es">dependencia</distinct> school <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> in # in # Latin America <pause dur="0.6"/> which paints as you would imagine a pretty <shift feature="voice" new="laugh"/> critical view <pause dur="0.2"/> <shift feature="voice" new="normal"/> about multinationals and they're thinking of course about the activities of American multinationals <pause dur="0.4"/> in Latin America <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> and Sunkel <pause dur="0.6"/> has this interesting phrase which i've put there <pause dur="0.5"/> # which is <pause dur="0.3"/> international integration <pause dur="0.3"/> and national disintegration <pause dur="1.9"/> what he had in mind <pause dur="0.3"/> is that <pause dur="0.6"/> the <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.9"/> the multinational companies <pause dur="0.5"/> of <pause dur="0.4"/> the nineteenth century <pause dur="0.2"/> and early twentieth century <pause dur="0.2"/> in Latin America <pause dur="1.1"/> which were very often British companies <pause dur="1.2"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> would be involved in building railways for example in developing port facilities <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> in developing 
the markets in these countries <pause dur="0.6"/> and not simply British investment but there was a lot of British investment particularly <pause dur="0.5"/> # from the sort of eighteen-eighties <pause dur="0.4"/> # into the early part of the <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> of the nineteen-hundreds <pause dur="1.2"/> and Sunkel says <pause dur="0.3"/> this form of activity <pause dur="0.8"/> by <pause dur="0.2"/> these foreign companies <pause dur="0.4"/> # led to national integration <pause dur="0.3"/> right <pause dur="0.2"/> bulding railways obviously helps to integrate the whole economy <pause dur="0.3"/> in a way that hadn't been possible before <pause dur="0.6"/> and <pause dur="0.3"/> that was beneficial to the country <pause dur="0.7"/> and he contrast those activities <pause dur="0.5"/> with modern <pause dur="0.4"/> # transnational corporations <pause dur="0.4"/> they're not at all concerned <pause dur="0.4"/> with <pause dur="0.2"/> except in very large markets like Brazil or China <pause dur="0.5"/> # with the national market <pause dur="0.2"/> all right <pause dur="0.5"/> it's it's what what they're concerned with <pause dur="0.2"/> is international production <pause dur="0.4"/> okay <pause dur="1.2"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> so that's the the international integration <pause dur="0.3"/> mm <pause dur="0.5"/> but it also leads to national disintegration <pause dur="0.3"/> in Sunkel's <pause dur="0.3"/> # terms <pause dur="0.6"/> because you create these enclaves <pause dur="0.2"/> these foreign enclaves <pause dur="0.2"/> mm <pause dur="0.6"/> these privileged elites the <sic corr="privileged">priviresed</sic> <trunc>e</trunc> elites <pause dur="0.3"/> 
work for the transnational corporation <pause dur="0.3"/> okay <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> at all levels <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> # the foreign companies <pause dur="0.3"/> will pay substantially more <pause dur="0.4"/> than the <pause dur="0.2"/> average wage rate that you find <pause dur="0.2"/> in the local economy <pause dur="0.4"/> whether it's for unskilled labour or skilled labour or professional workers <pause dur="1.1"/> the the transnational corporation always pays a premium <pause dur="0.4"/> and it offers <pause dur="0.3"/> very nice working conditions <pause dur="0.5"/> and there may be <pause dur="0.2"/> other benefits health benefits education benefits <pause dur="0.6"/> pensions schemes even <pause dur="0.6"/> totally unknown in developing countries <pause dur="0.5"/> # so there's all these benefits that you get for working for <pause dur="0.3"/> # a transnational corporation<pause dur="0.6"/>  # so you become a privileged elite <pause dur="0.5"/> mm <pause dur="0.5"/> and <pause dur="0.3"/> those that are associated with the transnational corporation at a political level <pause dur="0.5"/> or the firms supplying them <pause dur="0.3"/> become part of their elite <pause dur="0.5"/> but it's a foreign enclave <pause dur="0.4"/> it's the values of the transnational <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> which <pause dur="0.2"/> # you sell yourself for if you like <pause dur="0.2"/> according to Sunkel's view <pause dur="0.6"/> and these elites <pause dur="0.3"/> then distance themselves from the mass of people <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> almost look down 
their noses at them <pause dur="0.2"/> all right <pause dur="0.3"/> # at the poorer people <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> who <pause dur="0.2"/> # are not part of this <pause dur="0.2"/> privileged <pause dur="0.2"/> foreign enclave <pause dur="1.0"/> so that's what Sunkel has in mind then as as as a cost <pause dur="0.4"/> he sees the modern transnational <pause dur="0.5"/> as # as he puts it here <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> leading to international integration <pause dur="0.2"/> but national disintegration <pause dur="0.7"/> well <pause dur="0.2"/> i just throw that out <pause dur="0.3"/> as a as as another broader perspective <pause dur="0.5"/> than perhaps the more narrower one that we look on as economists <pause dur="1.7"/> well i'll stop at that point <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="1.2"/> obviously what i want you to think of <pause dur="0.5"/> is going through these costs and benefits and the activities of and and the <pause dur="0.7"/> # and the competitive advantage of multinationals <pause dur="0.3"/> is ultimately an empirical question <pause dur="0.6"/> okay <pause dur="0.5"/> that's really what i want you to go away with <pause dur="1.4"/> rather than that multinationals <pause dur="0.3"/> are the salvation of developing countries <pause dur="0.4"/> which perhaps is what the World Bank <pause dur="0.4"/> # would <pause dur="0.6"/> tend to suggest <pause dur="1.0"/> or <pause dur="0.5"/> maybe Sunkel's view <pause dur="0.6"/> that they lead to national disintegration and you shouldn't have anything to do with them <pause dur="0.4"/> mm <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> they're 
the sort of two extremes of the spectrum <pause dur="0.6"/> okay <pause dur="0.3"/> what i want you to do as economists <pause dur="0.4"/> is the usual <pause dur="0.7"/> # objective <pause dur="1.0"/> cost-benefit approach of course there'll be cost <pause dur="0.3"/> but there there there are also potential benefits <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> and looking at what the determinants of those costs and benefits are likely to be <pause dur="0.3"/> in any particular situation <pause dur="0.9"/> and therefore <pause dur="0.2"/> what you would also look for in the empirical evidence what what would be <pause dur="0.3"/> the sort of testable hypotheses <pause dur="0.5"/> that you would put up <pause dur="0.4"/> if you were looking at <pause dur="0.5"/> whether <pause dur="0.3"/> # the activities of <pause dur="0.3"/> # transnationals or particular transnationals <pause dur="0.5"/> in a developing country what were those effects <pause dur="0.2"/> likely to be what would be the hypothesis that you would set up <pause dur="0.5"/> in order to test <pause dur="0.3"/> whether net <pause dur="0.6"/> # they were a benefit or a cost <pause dur="0.6"/> to the host developing country <pause dur="1.5"/> and what i've given you there <pause dur="0.2"/> are <pause dur="0.5"/> key aspects look at the activities of of transnationals <pause dur="0.5"/> look at linkages with the local economy <pause dur="0.5"/> and apply them to the examples that i've given you over the page there <pause dur="0.5"/> if you'd like to think about that <pause dur="0.5"/> and then <pause dur="0.3"/> # we'll have a look at that next week <pause dur="1.4"/> any
