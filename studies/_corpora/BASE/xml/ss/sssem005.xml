<u who="nm5439">so we can let's let's start again # so this weeks talk is # # globalization and the the environment there are two # two presenters George and <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> # and George you're going to start us off # so so when you're when you're please when you're ready please just fire away</u>
<u who="sm5440">okay fine # # i # don't have a handout # for this # presentation # for my presentation # so you're just going to have to listen extra carefully # cause i'm sure you'll like but i don't know # # i'd like to start with a quote from # Martin Huston's approaches to global governance theory # # which is one of the central issues facing humans civilization at the end of the twentieth century is governance and the following questions have come up here who rules whose rules # what rules at what level in what form # many of these problems that give rise to questions such as these # are transnational and <trunc>tran</trunc> <trunc>trans</trunc> boundary in nature # with the result that the notion of global management has acquired increasing currency in some circles # this could not be more true than in the field of ecology # # i'll be talking about the nations response to environmental issues the rise of environmentalism # at the national level the questions of Brazil's rainforest and # reasons for global action # # so # i'll be expecting some questions from Brazil later on # it is fair to say we're all familiar at least on a basic level with the issues and problems surrounding the environment the terminology used is also widespread in the political discorse the ozone layer pollution global warming the issue of global warming underlines the nature of the problem and provides # # appointing to its basic solution which # we're coming to accept namely a global solution # now i'm sure you're getting slightly tired of the whole concept of globalization and the ever growing areas in to which it pulls but it does make some sense to look at the environment in terms of both a global crises and something that urgently requires a better solution # <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> contribute to this a great deal by defining the environment as a collective good now that's something that we touched on last week they define the earth's resources as strictly limited and that this collective good shared by everyone but owned by by no one # and that the selfish actions of the individual produces benefits for some but great harm to the wider community # now talking of the nation # ecological issues have been on the present agenda of the nation states for over twenty years at least according to speeches manifestos declarations of intent and general rhetoric of the main parties in addition new parties identified on the left of the political spectrum have sprung up across Europe # and are concerned primarily with the environmental cause # their impact # is very varied in Germany the green party called the balance of power in Herr Schroeder's coalition government and have a substantial impact on domestic policies and Germany's foreign policies especially with regard to the recent debate of the use of German troops abroad so we turn to a question of handling the environment on a global scale # i'd like to ask # how is it a global issue # and that may not be solved on a purely national level # talking of the rainforest # taking the lead on the environment Susan George makes clear that deforestation the use of C-F-Cs and poor industrial practices cause pollution # levels to rise # and is a direct cause of global warming as we now realize pollution carries across the world and the poor practice in one nation may lead to acid rain depletion of species skin cancer increasing in another nation far from the original polluter therefore a common practice in industry must be adopted to prevent this from continuing but a further dimension must be added that of debt now debt and self interest the larger scale <trunc>ec</trunc> of ecological problems are welcome in poorer and indebted and less developed countries # China is flagged as a key concern by Birnell # # doctor of # international assistance who ties C-F-Cs production to skin cancer in the UK # # and added that the # the smog in the United States is also increased by # by this production # the interests of many nations would be served by a form of global governance in this area but what would this mean # we were all very confused by these terms last week and it would not be for me to further define governance or indeed add to your confusion the nineteen-ninety-two Rio Earth summit was a very significant development in the way in which countries talk about the environment moving from a national to an international setting but has talk turned to action in nineteen-ninety the concept of a conservation debt squaw was promoted in the United States by president Bush this would mean funds would be provided for debt cancellation and the reduction of deforestation at the same time this was a specific project that # the aim of which was to help # the Brazilian rainforests specifically # as # as social scientists have pointed out that this is unique # in its scale # and in the # the fact that its # it's considered the lungs of the world # # congressional approval surprisingly # took place for this project # the scale of such a project led to no real progress being made in this area over the decade the following so this shows the importance of celebrating grassroots from the implementation and the funding of policies can the same be said of targets of current issues targets have been sent with many countries especially within the E-U agreeing to a united approach past experience has shown that global projects of this nature can take years and years to set up and at any point the political world may well be withdrawn and the project could fold # and so the issue # of cause and where the solution lies i think # can effects # the argument over the First World Third World # problems if its if its a debt issue i think # the the concept that jubilee two-thousand's promotion cancel Third World debt # is very interesting # and we should consider whether # simply cancelling debt in highly debited poor countries would affect the environment # would some incentive scheme would be put in place so that # as was proposed for Brazil debts would be cancelled money would be provided # for financial recovery but that would be very tied to # improving industrial practice reducing emissions # and obviously with the intent of # self interest of First World countries where # pollution is is considered a very high priority # and then the the problem of # hypocritical arguments # is the same as i'm told to be touched upon is the same # its the same because when you look at the case of nuclear <trunc>prolif</trunc> <trunc>prolifer</trunc> # you know what i mean the spreading of nuclear weapons # the First World # comes on to these agreements and says like you know clearly it's insane for India and Pakistan to have nuclear weapons cause this is a very bad thing and if # South American countries were to follow suit # Chile Brazil whoever was involved if more weapons were to be added # in that way this would be a very backwards step for the world # but clearly the United States Britain France # you know not considering giving out there own nuclear defences # and and you know the issues are very # similar # in this respect # very poor # industrial practice has gone in all of the # all of the Third World all of the First World countries # and to then say you must do as we say and not as we do you know its very # dubious # ground for me to follow # so there the basic # issues in u# the environment and globalization in the environment # and # and we'll now be discussing more issues and # so back</u>
<u who="nm5439">your presentation is directly connected to George's to lead on basically from what George is saying</u>
<u who="sf5443"># so my presentation will be more specific</u>
<u who="nm5439">okay okay so we'll use George's more as background <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> and do you also do you need the H-P</u>
<u who="sf5443"># yes # does anybody has # a handout</u>
<u who="nm5439">everyone's got this yeah</u>
<u who="sf5443"><gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> # i tried to focus on how political science has been dealing with and will be able to deal with the problem of global warming ordinarily # global warming is a highly I-P-E issue which requires deployment of various I-P-E theories we have studied my presentation will be divided into two parts in the first part i will examine the usefulness of what Cox called problems solving theories in explaining global warming as a political phenomenon i will argue that although problem solving theories such as environment economics and neoliberal institutionalism are useful to some extent they are not sufficient for us to have a sound understanding of the global warming problem in the second part i will argue that alternative I-P-E theories such as <trunc>constructvi</trunc> constructivism and neo-Gramscian theories will have much to offer in understanding the global warming problem the second part will be based on the ordinance of <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> on this book of Global Warming and Global Politics let's move on to the first part # <trunc>probl</trunc> problem solving theories and global warming in this part # i will first discuss about how the problem solving theories deal with global warming and and in the latter half of this part i argue the remit of problem solving theories # how do problem solving theories deal with global warming # i will # mention two theories environmental economics and neo-liberal institutionalism # economics is a typical problem solving theory and it has recently been getting prevalent in the <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> environment problem majority of literature on global warming is based on environmental economics i will i will explain the essence of environmental economics using # this illustration # the essential element of environmental economics is economic efficiency in order to achieve economy efficiency not only in sufficient in sufficient abatement but also excessive abatement # in other words environmental economics seeks to destroy the bonds between costs and benefits of environment <trunc>degra</trunc> degradation of abatement # in the graph # the intersection point of # marginal benefit curve and marginal cost curve is the optimal point in terms of economic efficiency a major problem that environmental economics has to solve is that of externality # particularly environmental economics is concerned with international spill over affects of environmental degradation environmental problems often cross boundaries of <trunc>administrati</trunc> administrative jurisdiction of states # which associates international coordination of environmental politics needless to say global warming is a typical example of such problems # this graph formulates the global warming problem and it explains why international policy is necessary in solving it # because greenhouse gasses spill over globally the global impact of one country's emission tends to be much higher than domestic impact # this is # for example # in this graph # this line shows # domestic marginal benefit of abatement and # in terms of global benefit # the marginal benefit is much higher # than domestic benefit </u>
<u who="nm5439"><gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> can i just can i just interrupt you for just a moment # what is what is sorry the vertical axis</u>
<u who="sf5443"># sorry # vertical axis is # monetary value</u>
<u who="nm5439">cost</u>
<u who="sf5443">yes cost you can use cost yes pound or a dollar</u>
<u who="nm5439">okay</u>
<u who="sf5443"># therefore # global marginal benefit of the using greenhouse gasses tend to be higher than domestic marginal benefit and given that each country behaves rationally the amount of # abatement will be Q # and # which is less than the global optimum of Q star # in other words abatement of Q is compatible with national interests # if the global optimal is to be achieved international coordination is required which will force or induce a country to carry out Q star abatement # the solutions that environmental economics tends to offer are for example carbon tax and trade <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> # however environmental economics is not concerned with whether such measures are politically feasible or not # i will move onto # neo-liberal institutionalism # as we have seen in the first time # neo-liberal institutionalism draws much on games <trunc>theor</trunc> theoretical account of international politics which is based on predetermined national interests # such national interests would be derived from the characterisation of environment economics # unlike environmental economics neo-liberal institutionalism tends to focus on political instruments to solve the global warming problem # the central assertion of neo-liberal institutionalists is that institutions play important roles in achieving international coordination # and <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> argues that neo-liberal institutionalism has provided to some extent anadequate account of international politics on global warming he notes that the international organizations such as U-N-E-P W-N-O and I-C-S-U have been highly important in generating outcomes in relation to global warming # so let me explain on the many problems on problem solving theories # it can be said # that about problem solving theories have provided some insights to consider the global warming problem nevertheless # the theories involve the following <trunc>defi</trunc> deficiencies # first it is difficult to calculate environmental costs and benefits so # this is due to the fact that environment preferences in general are not revealed in the market # if they are revealed in the market # it is easy to # work out these lines but in fact it is very difficult and although # various techniques have been developed to measure such non-market values each technique is subject to its own disadvantage and calculation of cost and benefits of global warming abatement is particularly difficult # because <trunc>scientific</trunc> scientific researches of global warming is now in progress and data of impact of global warming is variable therefore # it is difficult to specify not only the globally optimal amount of abatement but also the amount of abatement # that is compatible with national interests # given the difficulty of specifying national interests and optimal outcome # the very foundations of the problem solving theories are undermined # and # another remit # of problem solving theories is that # even if national interests and optimal outcome were calculated # problem solving theories would find it difficult to explain why actually some international cooperation took place in the nineteen-nineties # for example # in the Earth summit held at Rio de Janeiro in nineteen-ninety-two the United Nations framework convention on climate changed or U-N-F-C-C was adopted the U-N-F-C-C not only defined ultimate objective but also specified commitments of developed countries to return individually or jointly to the nineteen-ninety eleventh emissions of greenhouse gasses by two thousand furthermore the Kyoto conference of U-N-F-C-C in nineteen-ninety-seven sold the adoption of the Kyoto protocol # which is # described # here # and obviously # this progress is hard to <trunc>ex</trunc> explain from the viewpoint of problem solving theories which regards states as a rational utility maximizers # even the account of neo-liberal institutionalism is not sufficient # provided that it is based on the assumption of predetermined self-interests # because according to the neo-liberal institutionalism theory it is unlikely that states cooperate without perception of obvious future benefits from cooperation # this is the end of # first part # i will move on to the second part alternative I-P-E theories in explaining global warming # and this part # will be a review on Patterson's argument # um i first refer to constructivism and then history commentary and finally i make comments about them and constructivism Patterson argues that constructivist's accounts give more plausible interpretations of global warming than problem solving theories # as we have studied <trunc>constructivi</trunc> constructivism is concerned with the identities and or interests of actors such as states constructivism also pays attention to the level of inter-subjectivities that is the collective understandings that give a meaning to the material world constructivism would interpret states as trying inter-subjectively to develop norms and to # sorry # # constructivism interprets as trying inter-subjectively to develop norms and a sense of what their interests are in relation to global warming # this perspective would allow us to see the negotiations process of global warming in terms of # this perspective would allow us to see the negotiations process of global warming in terms of the production and reproduction of state identities as environmentally conscience states # # the emerging norm # that states should study their greenhouse gasses emissions can be seen as a transformation of their identities in relation to global warming # historical materialism # Patterson also argues that historical <trunc>material</trunc> materialism by which he means Marxist theories including the dependency theory and the neo-Gramcsian theory is very useful in understanding the global warming problem he states that historical materialism can explain the <trunc>unli</trunc> underlying forces influencing states positions in negotiations through the assumption of the states relationship to capital accumulation for example # much of the differences in industrialized states policies can be explained through the different relationships with economics have to energy and Patterson also argues # that historical materialism gives the most plausible <trunc>fram</trunc> framework for analyzing the North-South conflicts on global warming in the negotiations # nevertheless he does not provide anything between historical materialism and the actual international cooperation that took place in the nineteen-nineties instead he emphasizes that it is to be expected that proposes for emissions reduction will be resisted by powerful fractions of capital with substantially substantial capacity to exert exert # power over state decision making and finally # i # make comments on these arguments i i agree with Patterson # that constructivism and historical materialism are very useful in understanding the global <trunc>warmi</trunc> warming problem # i also agree with him that we should integrate the <trunc>constr</trunc> constructivist position on interstate relations with an understanding of the states positions within a global capitalist system however i do not think that his explanation on the relationship between historical materialism and the global warming problem is sufficient his explanation is too abstract and fragmented for example although he refers to the usefulness of the Gramscian usage of hegemony he just uses it to explain variety of forms of different characteristics of societies but i'd like to consider that the concept of hegemony is much more useful in explaining the fundamental traits underlying the global warming negotiations my intuitive hypothesis is that the process towards international cooperation in global warming reflects hegemonic incorporation of environmental issues on the part of the global capitalist system which would contain counterhegemonic movements of the greens against global capitalist # this is the end of my movement # thank you very much</u>
<u who="nm5439">all right # thank you very much George and Shigeru two very # wide-ranging presentations of the following material # especially Shigeru's presentation is quite # quite theoretical # very interesting # before we go into sort of general discussion is there anything in the two presentations which was a little bit hard to follow # or you wanted to <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> yeah</u>
<u who="sf5445"># this was about Patterson who <trunc>th</trunc> the link he made between constructivism and historical materialism # i didn't quite understand</u>
<u who="sf5443"># so yes he # yeah he states that it is necessary to link constructivism and historical materialism but he doesn't offer any concrete # ways to do it </u>
<u who="sf5445">to do it yeah</u>
<u who="sf5443">no he doesn't provide that</u>
<u who="sf5445">why why does he say it is important # why is it important to link these two</u>
<u who="sf5443"> # # i'm i'm not sure but # # maybe # maybe he thinks both theories are necessary to explain global warming and and that it will follow from this that it is necessary to integrate to make a coherent understanding of global warming</u>
<u who="nm5439">so he he just leaves <trunc>thi</trunc> this question hanging at the end he doesn't really #</u>
<u who="sf5443">no</u>
<u who="nm5439">he just says all of theories are sufficient historical matericalism is is the best solution or possibly we need historical materialism but he doesn't actually say why</u>
<u who="sf5445">could you amalgamate the two</u>
<u who="sf5443">yeah # maybe # maybe he thinks that both theories are necessary # # and sort of yes both theories are necessary to have a complete understanding of global warming # but # his argument does not # refer to such coherent aspects # but he only deals with the specific problems </u>
<u who="nm5439">right # okay so he's so he's indicating towards the sort of general than to a particular solution did anyone else Lucio did you have another question</u>
<u who="sm5442">let me just ask something about the conscious state </u>
<u who="nm5439">sorry</u>
<u who="sm5442">the # conscious state when you # when you talk about constructivism # conscious state i thought you mentioned conscious yes state</u>
<u who="sf5445">c-, conscious</u>
<u who="nm5439">i think # i think that you referred to environmentally conscious states</u>
<u who="sf5443">oh yeah # environmentally conscious state so #</u>
<u who="sm5442">what do you mean about <trunc>po</trunc> policies made by governments and stuff is that it</u>
<u who="sf5443">so # it may be that states are getting # # it may be that states are trying to # pretend # pretend or # appear that # they are environmentally friendly and so to make a political appeal # to be environmentally friendly</u>
<u who="nm5439">therefore therefore you're so that's that's <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> what you're saying states are attempting to appeal both internationally and domestically</u>
<u who="sf5443"># i think both</u>
<u who="nm5439">both</u>
<u who="sf5443">both internationally and domestically</u>
<u who="nm5439">that there have been environmentally friendly policies but are you saying that they are actually <trunc>inhere</trunc> sort of inherently becoming environmentally friendly or is this just a kind of propaganda</u>
<u who="sf5443"># it maybe a contentious point # and yeah # i think it needs to be # examined first</u>
<u who="nm5439">yeah i mean the reason i ask is the key key the key thing which i thought was interesting which you said that based on the theories of constructivism that there's a objective # subjective understanding amongst policy making in the East # in developed nations and maybe in undeveloped nations that there is a need to respond to the problems of the global environment so that's that's that's the key the key point i think but i wasn't but the the interesting issue in the debate is whether is how deeply held that is its just paying lip service to it whether its actually permeated down into the into the really into into the consciousness of these of these policy makers and states but that's something that we'll come back to has anyone else got any other points Luca</u>
<u who="sm5441">well # exactly what you were talking about i'd like to ask a question on that # on Patterson's argument on constructivism where he says that it's a collective understanding on the material world and states # or the elite # elitist states developing intersubjectively set of norms is that linked to norms or is that also in Patterson's view does that also comprise standards and then to come back to George's point start who are supposed to # is it is it the elitist states that are supposed to impose those standards and to enforce those standards and norms or is it going to be global governance framework kind of thing like can you elaborate on that</u>
<u who="sf5443"># maybe # maybe # i'll have made an <trunc>app</trunc> appropriate answer to your question so # yes # this is # one of the most important point and # if # if # so # if # we are to have # <trunc>com</trunc> <trunc>co</trunc> if we are to have a coherent understanding of what is going on <trunc>int</trunc> internationally <trunc>nego</trunc> international negotiations over global warming # # it would be necessary to consider whether # states are # really committed to # environment programs or not and # so # perhaps # if if the constructivism is to be # really useful # it is necessary for # constructivism to # prove that # states are moving from # from a # former situation to # more environmentally committed stage</u>
<u who="sm5441">on a global level</u>
<u who="sf5443">yeah</u>
<u who="nm5439">okay that's i mean that's a very interesting question i think we'll come back to that a little later in the discussion is there any other kind of technical sort of questions which anybody has if not there's i think maybe there's a whole range of issues which came out of both presentations and # maybe we could just go back a little bit and try and <trunc>com</trunc> sort of a categorize # compartmentalize some of the issues that we've come up with and try and work through them in stages perhaps # # i mean the first question that we should # i think George is addressing it # my impression is that George does does believe that this is the case # but my first question is # and i don't think i don't know if it's just me # you know saying something that sounds ridiculous or not # i mean these are really a global an environmental crisis or not # i mean certainly issue we're all conscious of # it certainly seems to be important # and it's become you know increasingly important to policy makers and also as we've seen from the readings this week it's become it's come on to the agenda I-P-E # but there really # i mean how how convinced are people that there is a genuine global environmental crisis brewing # you know is this is this just a fact of I-P-E or is this actually a genuine issue which we need to # need to address # i think from George's presentation # i think we would be convinced that there is # there are genuine problems which need to be addressed we really need to rethink some of our conceptions of I-P-E and how to understand this problem but what what what does everyone else feel</u>
<u who="sf5443">it's not imminent as such the global problems the environmental problem but at the rate countries are going down # you know # the rate there going # i mean i think in like # ten twenty years we will see a huge problem that will suddenly like take us by surprise so it's good to see that there is like you know the states are getting quite conscious about it but then there's also the other argument that they're being a bit too paternalistic with such opposing views like you don't develop like this you know # you don't pursue such you know development and # but then how are these states going to pursue their economic growth how are they going to grow if they don't if they don't cut green forests if they don't do things how are they supposed to move on # so that's i mean you don't want to say it you know i guess international institutions can play a roll # just in a very # broad ranging yeah</u>
<u who="nm5439">so so so in your own opinion # you'd say this is # there is really something seriously</u>
<u who="sf5443">there is something wrong # yeah # but there has to be an alternative yeah</u>
<u who="nm5439">happening which is a challenge or a mode of political economy in terms of what political economy is today so that # did did you want to add something to that</u>
<u who="sf5445">yeah i was just going to say because that's not how you can say we can sit there in Western Europe and come to this all this wealth as we have today because we've been cutting back our trees and its kind kind of like pathetic that we've like cut all of our forest back i mean if you think back a thousand years ago the U-K was one big one big forest then it was cut down # and now we're like telling telling telling Brazil and the whole South America and Africa don't cut back your forest # and that's kind of pathetic and we have done it # and we're not trying to restore our own green environment </u>
<u who="nm5439">right</u>
<u who="sf5445">and we like take it really far and we're like telling the developing country # don't develop don't develop the way we did # but we're not telling them how to should they do develop</u>
<u who="sf5443">i mean it's like # yeah you get people coming in this Greenpeace and stuff like that coming to Malaysia and saying things like let people live in the trees # let them do this # i mean come on you know # that's silly you know you want to move on # and you have all the comforts in life and then you tell us to just live basic i mean with basics that's you know</u>
<u who="nm5439">so therefore so that means this kind of # the attention which the environment problems are getting at the moment some would say that they are lacking that kind of historical perspective in terms of # you know we've been talking about development all the states have to go through this period of # you know altering their environment and it's all very well informed to those</u>
<u who="sf5445">and they're not really critical to themselves # they criticize # criticize everything else but not </u>
<u who="nm5439">okay # so all of that kind of shades into condescension or even hypocrisy # on the parts of of of the developed states</u>
<u who="sm5446">draw into that # the # nuclear pro-generation </u>
<u who="nm5439">well that's the same issue isn't it</u>
<u who="sf5445">that's the same thing	</u>
<u who="nm5439">Luca</u>
<u who="sm5441">i think it has not so much to do with history i mean you could approach it from a historical point of view # but i think it has to do with responsibility i mean if you talk about forests like you do the forests that are still there # in the Amazon or wherever they are # they're the lungs of the world # and if you cut them down you you have a serious problem so if there is an imminent global environmental crisis with respect to forests # which you could also talk about pollution like # George already pointed out # or or or nuclear waste or whatever i mean those are issues that are not limited to borders # it's the same in like in virtual reality # i mean it's not limited to borders # so there needs to be some kind of regulation # some kind of framework # setup i think to to address those problems # and a crisis is imminent # in that respect </u>
<u who="nm5439">okay # do you want to</u>
<u who="sm5441">social responsibility</u>
<u who="sf5445">yeah # we # the problem actually and i think that everyone's agreeing on that this is something environmental problems and of course there's some limitation to how much you can explore # but the one we're like putting question to is that the way we're using the environment in our rhetoric to pursue # i mean put up a discourse # an environmentalistic discourse and <trunc>we</trunc> <trunc>we</trunc> we're not even questioning it isn't in a way that when <trunc>ou</trunc> our perceptions # true # i mean that</u>
<u who="sf5443">this is like how a parent is telling a child # </u>
<u who="sm5441">no of course</u>
<u who="sf5443">don't do that because i've done it and it was wrong and now you don't do it and # then tell me another way of doing it # and that's what we're saying # it's obvious that we know it's wrong </u>
<u who="sm5441">its facing the facts its its facing the facts its quite obvious to a country what its responsibilities are</u>
<u who="sf5445">what's fact # what's fact </u>
<u who="sm5441">what's responsibility</u>
<u who="nm5439">what is i mean what is the fact i mean the fact is people are</u>
<u who="sm5441">you have to face the facts</u>
<u who="nm5439">well the fact is that there's environmental destruction going on # but people miss always argue it's always been going on # why are we suddenly so much more concerned about it now</u>
<u who="sm5441">it's a question of responsibility</u>
<u who="nm5439">wha-, <trunc>wha</trunc> what is it so suddenly the developed world having destroyed its environment for the last hundred years can suddenly turn around and say # okay we don't want anymore</u>
<u who="sm5441">it's a question of responsibility</u>
<u who="nm5439">so what facts are there # i mean the facts are that the states are # other states are trying to develop </u>
<u who="sm5441">no of course</u>
<u who="nm5439"># some states are developed # and it's perceived by some # that you know they're creating the fact of environmental destruction or # they're calling a crisis # when the fact is that it's it's all a process of development # which all states need to undergo</u>
<gap reason="inaudible" extent="uncertain"/>
<u who="sm5441">i think you're view's is too limited # i mean you see it simply in the form of development i think you should see it in the form in the form of responsibility as the responsibility of those countries who still have the natural resources # in in the form of forests or whatever they have the responsibility towards the rest of the world to keep those intact and whatever like development is is then it # comes in second place</u>
<u who="sf5443">this <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> has all just come about because there are more people getting skin cancer in the developed economies right and suddenly like this <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> oh we're getting the illness it's all the C-F-Cs its suddenly but this has been going on for so long and what about the damage i mean no one is talking about the damage to the Brazilian people as such no one's bothered by them it's bothered by the impact that goes onto the developed economies i think i mean # no one talks about people from there # like what impact it is on them </u>
<u who="nm5439">okay well lets have lets have a Brazilian</u>
<u who="sm5442">no it's just i find that the whole concept if we talk about environment if if you use in the context of the present system economic system political system <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> you cannot get to a a a kind of a result when markets are the ones who talk loud so countries are going to try to maximize as much profit as they can so therefore if you talk about the environment you also have to also talk about the economic system so is they are very much linked politically economic environment so i think that's would be the core of the problem</u>
<u who="nm5439">so when you said core of the problem so in other words what you're saying is that we have an international political economy </u>
<u who="sm5442">yeah you</u>
<u who="nm5439">which is sort of inherently destructive to the environment </u>
<u who="sm5442">yeah</u>
<u who="nm5439">that in its that's the argument of some some some would argue the other case but</u>
<u who="sm5442">we all live in a system where the idea of creating # # wealth is by depleting natural resources</u>
<u who="nm5439">right</u>
<u who="sm5442">by then # you know by doing that i mean is something that is a continuing # process so if you want to tackle it you have to create new alternatives where economic growth can be achieved without # depleting the natural resource</u>
<u who="nm5439">right I just want to go round the class here George you were</u>
<u who="sm5440">well # i was just going to say that # if we were going to look at this # self interest or just a realistic point of view # do # First World governments genuinely care about # people in Brazil # or you know do they care about rainforests because it affects them and i've # i mean i've recently been # been doing this whole question of # debt cancellation and all the arguments put are # well with relation to Mexico and it's drugs economy # Brazil rainforests i say that look well if you cancel debt it will mean that more people will get jobs # in the legal economy # and this will be good for the United States and for Britain because # less drugs will be coming through the ports and that's that's a reason to do it and they say the reason the reason to tackle the rainforest in Brazil from # you know for a positive reason for First World governments to do it is cause it will help them because as you say your children won't get skin cancer there won't be so much smog prevalent in the United States you know and reasons like this # they don't they don't necessarily care about # the people involved in these things you know and is this # is this a realistic point of view you know do people believe that's how First World governments # feel you know or do you generally think that they you know they care about levels of poverty and you know and how people live in # the much poorer countries</u>
<u who="sf5443">it's just that taking up Mozambique at what's happening recently # i mean we saw a natural disaster an environmental disaster but no country i mean the US can't even send <trunc>fli</trunc> I mean planes in # and they're operating with seven planes # and when there was a Gulf War and all that and they just went in directly i mean where <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> where's the Gulf War and stuff like that # that just shows how interested some countries are # i mean their being hypocrites outright # and that's sad come on let's face it the people are dying that we see on T-V it's appalling </u>
<u who="nm5439">can we link this then with the idea of social responsibility and maybe <trunc>Lu</trunc> Lucas can come back to that it's # i mean who has who's # who's i mean the the developed world to a large extent is asking the developing world to be to be responsible</u>
<u who="sf5443">what can you when there's a natural disaster</u>
<u who="nm5439">but responsibility in a sense it wants the developing world to to bear some of the costs # of # the developed world the developed world doesn't want to necessarily reciprocate in that way # it just it just says you know you do this if you do that okay well maybe we'll cancel some debt but they don't they're not doing it for any altruistic reasons they're just doing it you know because it's in their particular interests so <trunc>whe</trunc> when we talk about responsibility i mean they're not they're just saying that you have to be responsible because it's going to help us you know rather than the other way around to some extent is a large you know it's a large element of that</u>
<u who="sm5442">isn't it rather interesting that institutions like you know where are base the # policies international policies where they come <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> come and say listen you have to export to acquire more # # # have currency able to # develop so that's # i'll go back to the aspect of the whole process # where the in the economic system you have to deal with hard currency in the developing countries to do that you do have to kind of # use those # what they must have in a in a as a hard currency where you can sell it such as commodities like in Malaysia where they're selling hard # selling trees wood you know to to developed countries # # i think it's very # if you talk about environment and you think neo-liberal system is # is very # i mean almost impossible to sort it </u>
<u who="sf5443">yeah # and some countries are very # you know </u>
<u who="sm5442">primary commodities</u>
<u who="nm5439">this is is the next next question that i wanted to come to in terms of # how does it challenge us to sort of understand things about the system you know # the system of the international political economy # and what does it what do these environmental problems do how do they challenge our sort of preconceptions of are understanding up to this point about the way this international political economy works as a system # i think Shegara was was touching upon this # by looking at the different schools of I-P-E the different understandings and trying to critique them and say you know how they they fail to to cope with # you know with this kind of this this eventuality you know the fact that the more that we you know # push on with economic development # the more that this may actually be unsustainable now # you know some there are criticisms associated with each of the schools but also each one of the schools kind of # well especially the liberal school which is the dominant one at the moment you know tries to come back and say well actually you know we can achieve environmental # you know sustainable development and a sustainable environment # in certain ways # so in a sense this this it's all the solutions which are put forward by the developed states at the moment they quite sort of technocratic and i think what Shegara was getting at is they're kind of problem solving theories they're not critical theories so there kind of an existing system of largely liberal based <trunc>e</trunc> you know <trunc>eco</trunc> economic organization and all the all the all that the developed states want to do to a large extent is to kind of tinker with it and adjust it # but they're not asking as Lucio says for any kind of major restructuring of the system you know they just want to solve environmental problems by using kind of liberal based market economies but the the question is are these actually compatible # you know does anybody have any feeling you know kind of opinions on that i mean is is liberal based marketing economics actually compatible with sustainable development with sustainable growth # and a sustainable environment sorry i mean Lucio i think what you're arguing is that maybe not does anyone want to try and defend that position i mean people do it all the time # i mean the the developed states are doing it</u>
<u who="sm5441">i think it is # what if what if the environment is part of your your of your economy</u>
<u who="nm5439">mm right</u>
<u who="sm5441">look for instance at Israel or India or even Brazil # i mean it's in your own interest to plant like new trees for continuity for sustainable development of your industries # your paper industry or your or your like water industry or whatever # so its it is it is compatible # but it depends on the country but i think the responsibility of the countries is more important than</u>
<u who="nm5439">can you say why it depends on the country # what kind of country</u>
<u who="sm5441">well countries that have financial resources they for them it could work but they # but most of most of the countries don't really see it</u>
<u who="sm5442"># this is a point # <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> America is the most country that chop trees down than Brazil # if you put it in you you know # i mean America is much more of a of a # # it's got more effect in the whole environment system than more countries with this idea that they are concerned as the main <trunc>cau</trunc> the cause of environmental instability # its its its they are very much putting the blame to those that are weak to answer for it where there you know when actually the countries who are most depleting the forest are the developed # countries</u>
<gap reason="new phase of event" extent="uncertain"/>
<u who="nm5439">can you give some examples of how the environment can economists are trying to solve these costs</u>
<u who="sf5443">so for example as long as these curves are correct and if environmental economists can offer appropriate measure to shift from to Q to Q star it would be possible to solve the sustainable development of this point so for example by using a kind of taxation or tradable funds if if it is appropriately <trunc>cre</trunc> created it is not impossible</u>
<u who="sf5443">but then you have that <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> dilemma where users try to that yeah </u>
<u who="sf5443">of course yeah environmental economists we'll take into consideration the present <trunc>di</trunc> dilemma of development</u>
<u who="nm5439">there's also some interesting stuff been done by a there's a guy in the states called John Walley he's an economists and he's done stuff for the world trade organization he's a he's very well Known in his field and he's working on an idea of a sort of to go with the W-T-O or the W-E World Environmental Organization and one of his ideas is was was was that without you know getting to a kind of technocratic solution you know problem solving solutions sorry it's not the same as kind of tear up the whole system but to do it with some kind of finesse and adjust the system so you can avoid some of these environmental costs so one of his ideas also was that rich countries if they're getting worried say about deforestation in a particular country what they would do is that would say to the they would say to the the developing country which has these forests which you know obviously the rich countries need and wants them to preserve they would actually pay you we're going to rent the forest off of you okay you know we'll we'll we'll transfer you know we'll <trunc>trans</trunc> we'll give you a kind of transfer payment so we'll we'll transfer some money across and what you do is you you know you you look after those forests instead of you ripping them down and selling them we'll kind of rent them off you you know they'll stay on your your territory we're not going to do anything to them but we'll pay you some money to be just to sort of keep them preserved # which is which is one kind of solution but again you know its very sort of technocratic but obviously there are all these there are all these problems to that as well</u>
<u who="sf5443">it's condescending</u>
<u who="nm5439">well it is quite condescending but again you know its its this idea of well us what else can you do you know within the limits of of the of the system you know you've got to try and you know the developed states are not going go give up their advantaged position in in international political economy but they need some kind of you know you've got to work within the boundaries you've got to problem solve within the existing sort of paradigm but there are also all sorts of problem because you know you can imagine that then developing countries can sort of turn around and say well if you don't pay us the money we're going to rip down this forest they can hold the forest for ransom</u>
<u who="sm5442">i have a question why not developed countries just open up fields and plant loads of trees destroy loads of buildings that you know they've got a big house they have loads of space to create their own forest in twenty years to thirty years time they don't need us anymore so why don't they work in that way</u>
<u who="nm5439">but that's you see that's what political theorists say</u>
<u who="sm5441">that's the facts</u>
<u who="sf5443">what's that</u>
<u who="sm5441">that's the facts you have to face the facts</u>
<u who="sm5442">which facts</u>
<u who="sm5441">the facts are that the developing the developed world has industries and the developing world is developing </u>
<u who="sm5442">talk to me one simple</u>
<u who="sf5443">we need to grow we need to grow</u>
<u who="sm5441">we need to grow in another way the point the point</u>
<u who="sf5443">how are we going to grow in another way that's why we produce low added goods low value added goods</u>
<u who="sm5441">there are other possibilities to grow you leap forward you leap forward with communication technologies why not with other technologies and other other means of production </u>
<u who="sm5442">look fair enough but lets well lets understand it developed countries do have to develop to achieve a certain level of standard supposed to be kept the way </u>
<u who="sm5441">i completely agree with that</u>
<u who="sm5442">a country is set up now if you ask <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> to kind of # <trunc>consid</trunc> to kind of # to break this cycle this development cycle to give you air to breathe</u>
<u who="sf5443">yeah give you nice holiday destinations</u>
<u who="sm5441">it's like the movie Total Recall</u>
<u who="nm5439">yeah i i mean yeah i mean this <trunc>intere</trunc> i mean i think there are all sorts of it's interesting the way it's divided i mean Luca is a he is a critical theories and he doesn't like the system as it exists he wants to think outside the existing system and Lucio who is kind of saying that this is the way the system is and we have to try and <trunc>so</trunc> solve the problems</u>
<u who="sm5441">i don't see why not i see myself as a critical theorist and i'll explain why i'll explain why because Lucio was trying to solve the problem of development and he's using the existing theories the existing theories to develop and critical theory is exactly getting out of those theories right and maybe like developing a new problem solving theory and that's critical thinking it's not problem solving</u>
<u who="sm5442"><gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> your kind of # imperialistic notion by</u>
<u who="sm5441">why is it imperialistic</u>
<u who="sm5442">by # by # by <trunc>li</trunc> limiting my my development you are kind of keeping the status quo by saying do that you know you can do that you cannot do that but i can because i've got power and and wealth and power</u>
<u who="sm5441">but you do you can say listen if you don't pay us we'll continue cutting our down cutting down our forests</u>
<u who="sf5443">but it doesn't work that we don't have as much say as you do lets face it because we're not developed</u>
<u who="sm5441">but you have also the developed world is crying for it otherwise the whole issue the whole issue would not have been raised</u>
<u who="sm5442">wait this is important is very important don't you forget that we too have feelings we too <vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" dur="2"/></u>
<u who="sm5441">no no no no</u>
<u who="sf5443">i think we need a break</u>
<u who="sm5441">we'll talk about that later Lucio</u>
<vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" dur="2"/>
<u who="sm5442">we too we too can kind of get skin cancer we too are concerned as well we are not robots or whatever we do have those concerns it's not just you you know Western kind of <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> environmental minds</u>
<u who="sm5441">do you have feelings for <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/></u>
<u who="sm5442">i mean because we are suffering we are suffering as well it's not just a question of <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/></u>
<u who="nm5439">yeah yeah i mean it's a good point i just want to i just want to ask i want to ask Luca here and again i'm not i'm again i'm not trying to label you as as being the developed world or being whatever i think you're in that kind of problem solving area but the question sort of is though especially are you <trunc>pre</trunc> do you think then that the developed world should change its its its economic system does the developed world have to i mean in a sense what maybe what you're suggesting the sympathies you might suggest you know the developed world is saying they've got to develop in a certain way you can't develop in the same way we've developed because it's just too destructive you know if China tries to develop in the same sort of industrial pattern with a billion people it's just it's just not sustainable it's just it's just it's going to create such terrible problems that we can't cope with it so you've got to change your pattern of development you know maybe you're going to leap-frog into a new industry or whatever you know but there's some kind solution out there okay but but but that does involve imposing some form of of of restriction or you know a change in development pattern of other states okay and you're saying that's that's that's critical theory okay whatever but you know to turn it around then what about the developed world do you think the developed world also has to to change</u>
<u who="sm5441">of course</u>
<u who="nm5439">yeah so like what</u>
<u who="sm5441">the developed world has already changed</u>
<u who="nm5439">well how how has it</u>
<u who="sm5441">it's changing it's changing with norms and standards like pollution standards pollution norms like antipollution of course i mean you don't see that in the <trunc>develop</trunc> in the developing world do you</u>
<u who="nm5439">don't don't you think that the i mean the developed world is still the <trunc>pri</trunc> one of the prime polluting and #</u>
<u who="sm5441"><gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> i think i think a country like Nigeria is more polluting than for instance say than a country like Belgium </u>
<u who="sf5443">it's because of Shell Shell it's because Shell let's put it in perspective</u>
<u who="sm5441">its because of Shell that's the only reason but you can but you can impose you can impose Shell like say to Shell like listen like say why don't you impose these rules </u>
<u who="sf5443">Shell controls the whole thing do not be na've about it </u>
<u who="sm5441">they're going to leave the oil is there come on</u>
<u who="nm5439">what about what about the United States what has the United States changed i mean this is # yeah # we're always pinning bad things to the United States <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> it's the biggest economy in the world the biggest national economy and it's it's by far the biggest polluter in the world in terms of you know carbon dioxide emissions has the United States changed has anyone detected the United States trying to change its fundamental problem of economic growth has the <trunc>intern</trunc> international political economy of the United States changed over the last thirty forty years or so not not fundamentally</u>
<u who="sm5441">but there is there is a process of awareness and a process of awareness is not is not prevalent in the developing nations and that is a question of responsibility it's the responsibility of the developed world i think and you can say that sounds patronizing or whatever but it's it's the responsibility to the Western developed to the industrialized world </u>
<u who="sm5442">it's not patronizing it's demoralizing you are saying that we don't think do you say that the Western are the only ones that got knowledge you're saying that you know do you know we kind developed countries are people that stupid you know iron age stone age they do have education they do do have access to Internet they do know about you know world affairs so they are aware in <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> as much us the Western but the alternatives that Western world have and the alternatives that developing cultures have are different so you have to have a balance so you cannot you know</u>
