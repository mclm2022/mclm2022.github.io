<gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> used a humanistic view of education <pause dur="0.2"/> is where you see learners as individual selves who must be <pause dur="0.2"/> developed <pause dur="0.3"/> and the process of education as being <pause dur="0.2"/> developing <pause dur="0.8"/> the self <pause dur="0.4"/> bringing out the individual's best <pause dur="1.1"/> characteristics features allowing them to learn and to fulfil their potential <pause dur="0.5"/> whereas here <pause dur="0.2"/> we're more interested in producing <pause dur="0.2"/> useful members of society <pause dur="0.2"/> and here <pause dur="1.5"/> put extremely we're interested in in <pause dur="0.3"/> passing down <pause dur="0.5"/> tablets of stone <pause dur="0.2"/> from one generation to the next <pause dur="0.2"/> so three very very different <pause dur="0.3"/> views of education <pause dur="2.4"/> which will influence <pause dur="1.0"/> how we see <pause dur="0.8"/> language learning <pause dur="0.3"/> and that's <pause dur="0.5"/> the next page on your handout if you could have a look at the next <pause dur="0.4"/> diagram <pause dur="2.8"/><kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="15"/> i've got it on the <trunc>he</trunc> overhead transparency but you've also got in under two-point-two <pause dur="0.2"/> different education traditions so fitting into this <pause dur="2.6"/> analysis <pause dur="3.2"/> i've given them slightly different labels from <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> <pause dur="1.2"/> because these are the ones <pause dur="0.4"/> that <pause dur="0.5"/> Littlewood uses <pause dur="2.4"/> 
<gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> talked about an academic tradition <pause dur="0.5"/> he also talked about <pause dur="0.9"/> social reformist tradition and he talked about a humanist tradition but they map onto these three <pause dur="1.5"/> okay looking at each of these in turn <pause dur="1.0"/> and i hope as i'm talking about these you're thinking okay what's the tradition i come from <pause dur="0.5"/> what is my <pause dur="0.5"/> educational tradition <pause dur="0.2"/> is it <pause dur="0.2"/> changing <pause dur="1.3"/> thinking first of all about classical humanism <pause dur="0.3"/> remember the purpose here <pause dur="0.2"/> is to pass on <pause dur="0.3"/> knowledge from one generation to the next <pause dur="0.4"/> and here <pause dur="2.3"/> the main purpose of education is to transmit <trunc>volu</trunc> value knowledge and culture <pause dur="0.2"/> to an elite section of the next generation i think that point about elitism is quite important <pause dur="0.2"/> grammar schools in Britain <pause dur="0.2"/> for example <pause dur="1.0"/> selective education in many parts of the world <pause dur="0.5"/> the differences between <distinct lang="de">gymnasium</distinct> <pause dur="0.5"/> and technical <pause dur="0.2"/> schools <pause dur="0.2"/> for example <pause dur="0.7"/> reconstructionism <pause dur="0.6"/> to bring about desired <pause dur="0.2"/> social change <pause dur="0.9"/> and one <trunc>c</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/><vocal desc="cough" iterated="n"/> examples of this at the moment might be the Eastern European countries <pause dur="0.3"/> that are 
changing radically and changing their education systems <pause dur="0.2"/> from this <pause dur="0.3"/> to this <pause dur="0.4"/> in order to promote development <pause dur="0.8"/> and progressivism <pause dur="0.7"/> seen perhaps as the sort of trendy lefty <pause dur="0.5"/> view of education <pause dur="0.3"/> the # <pause dur="1.1"/> self-development <pause dur="0.2"/> finding out about yourself self-fulfilment education being there <pause dur="0.5"/> to allow you to be the best you can be <pause dur="0.2"/> in British government parlance <pause dur="0.3"/> at the moment <pause dur="1.1"/> so those three different traditions <pause dur="0.2"/> very different <pause dur="0.7"/> and each with a slightly different main focus <pause dur="1.5"/> if we look first of all at classical humanism <pause dur="0.6"/> the main focus there was to develop <pause dur="0.3"/> general intellectual abilities and within that context grammar translation fitted very well <pause dur="0.4"/> it prepared you <pause dur="0.7"/> to think <pause dur="0.3"/> it gave you an intellectual discipline <pause dur="0.2"/> intellectual training <pause dur="0.7"/> however <pause dur="1.2"/> if you actually want someone to contribute <pause dur="1.2"/> to life as a member of society <pause dur="0.2"/> you also need people who can communicate <pause dur="0.5"/> and <pause dur="0.4"/> do <pause dur="0.2"/> things <pause dur="0.3"/> in language <pause dur="1.3"/> as well as in mathematics history whatever <pause dur="0.7"/> and progressivism is to develop the individual person and 
there you might see <pause dur="0.2"/> from a language point of view more interest <pause dur="0.2"/> in helping learners learn about themselves <pause dur="0.2"/> how they learn best <pause dur="0.4"/> how do i learn a foreign language best what's the best way for me to do it <pause dur="0.2"/> as an individual <pause dur="1.5"/> very different attitudes to content <pause dur="0.6"/> classical humanism <pause dur="0.2"/> the language is there <pause dur="0.2"/> as a valued subject content <pause dur="2.5"/> under reconstructionism preparing you for the world of work and society <pause dur="0.6"/> it's a very utilitarian view <pause dur="0.2"/> you want knowledge and skills that are useful for social life <pause dur="1.6"/> and that's where <pause dur="0.3"/> people worry about government interference because the government will have perhaps a different view of what's useful <pause dur="0.4"/> # for social life and <pause dur="0.2"/> the individual <pause dur="1.5"/> and certainly may not think it's important to <pause dur="0.3"/> promote experiences <pause dur="0.2"/> that will stimulate growth <pause dur="0.2"/> intellectual growth personal growth <pause dur="0.8"/> so how do all of these fit in <pause dur="0.3"/> with language teaching and the goals of language teaching <pause dur="1.1"/> under a classical humanist approach <pause dur="0.3"/> yes you need knowledge of <trunc>diff</trunc> of of a different <pause dur="0.2"/> 
language system <pause dur="2.0"/> but you also need a better understanding of <pause dur="0.2"/> your own language <pause dur="3.0"/> and you need to be able to talk about language you need a metalanguage to talk about language linguistic awareness <pause dur="2.2"/> it's also useful <pause dur="0.2"/> to have <pause dur="0.3"/> knowledge and understanding of a different culture <pause dur="0.4"/> and civilization <pause dur="1.9"/> and all of these will promote <pause dur="0.2"/> general <pause dur="0.4"/> intellectual skills <pause dur="1.7"/> and if you look at A-level syllabuses in this country if you look at the baccalaureate in France <pause dur="0.3"/> if you look at <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> most countries high school <pause dur="0.2"/> leaving <pause dur="0.2"/> qualifications <pause dur="0.6"/> that is very often <pause dur="0.2"/> the view of of language that is promoted it's an intellectual development stage <pause dur="0.3"/> so that a native speaker could fail <pause dur="0.4"/> the exam <pause dur="1.1"/> a native speaker of English could easily fail the French baccalaureate in English in my opinion <pause dur="0.3"/> because you're having to display intellectual capacities <pause dur="0.3"/> and levels of learning and thinking <pause dur="0.2"/> that go beyond being able to speak the language <pause dur="0.9"/> in fact i think i might fail the French <pause dur="0.6"/> baccalaureate in 
English <pause dur="1.0"/> # okay so reconstructionism <pause dur="1.3"/> preparing you for life preparing you for society <pause dur="0.2"/> so there <pause dur="0.2"/> language is seen as a useful skill for many kinds of work <pause dur="1.2"/> wonderful for travel <pause dur="2.0"/> can get you out travelling <pause dur="1.8"/> better <pause dur="0.4"/> and wider possibilities for communication with others within <pause dur="1.5"/> the world of travel but also the world of work of business commerce <pause dur="2.6"/> and it will give you hopefully a better understanding <pause dur="0.3"/> of other members of society <pause dur="1.0"/> minority groups within your own society <pause dur="2.5"/> and also native speakers of the target language <pause dur="0.2"/> living within your own community <pause dur="2.0"/> so much more utilitarian and less intellectual view <pause dur="0.6"/> progressivism <pause dur="0.9"/> developing the self the humanistic approach has a much less restricted perspective of the world <pause dur="0.3"/> anything <pause dur="0.2"/> that helps you develop and grow <pause dur="0.3"/> is useful <pause dur="1.8"/> is much more interested in <pause dur="0.2"/> other ways of expressing <pause dur="0.2"/> your own self <pause dur="0.6"/> beyond the purely utilitarian <pause dur="0.2"/> pragmatic <pause dur="1.4"/> is interested in developing possibilities for future 
learning <pause dur="0.3"/> lifelong learning so trying to establish the foundations <pause dur="0.2"/> for future <pause dur="0.2"/> language learning <pause dur="0.3"/> there are language programmes called language readiness supervisors which actually don't teach language at all <pause dur="0.3"/> but get learners <pause dur="0.2"/> to think about <pause dur="0.2"/> language what's involved in language <pause dur="0.2"/> preparing them to go on <pause dur="0.2"/> and learn other languages <pause dur="1.6"/> and a richer interpersonal network for one's own existence so you're learning language there as part of your own <pause dur="0.3"/> personal development <pause dur="1.5"/> so three very different traditions i'm going to embarrass you now <pause dur="0.5"/> by asking you if you'd like to commit yourself <pause dur="0.7"/> and your education system to one of these traditions is there anybody here <pause dur="0.3"/> who feels they grew up <pause dur="0.3"/> in this <pause dur="0.4"/> tradition the classical <pause dur="0.4"/> humanism <pause dur="0.2"/> tradition i certainly did i went to an English grammar school <pause dur="0.3"/><kinesic desc="put hands up" n="ss" iterated="n"/> and that's what i had <pause dur="0.4"/> okay <pause dur="0.6"/> right <pause dur="0.9"/> anybody <pause dur="0.2"/> who <pause dur="0.3"/> # has grown up in a sort of reconstructionist education system preparing people for society <pause dur="0.5"/> for the world of work <pause dur="0.4"/> much more <pause dur="0.2"/> utilitarian view <pause dur="2.8"/><kinesic desc="put hands up" n="ss" iterated="n"/> okay <pause dur="0.7"/>

remember it <pause dur="2.2"/> and finally process <pause dur="0.5"/> here <pause dur="0.8"/> the goal is to create contexts which will stimulate <pause dur="0.6"/> the potential for natural language growth <pause dur="0.2"/> to help learners to develop naturally <pause dur="0.5"/> as language learners <pause dur="0.2"/> the syllabus provides a sequence of contexts no longer sequence of language <pause dur="0.2"/> or sequence of functions but contexts <pause dur="1.3"/> for learning <pause dur="0.8"/> learning now not learners so much but focusing on learning and how people learn and providing contexts for learning <pause dur="0.9"/> which are roughly graded <pause dur="0.8"/> it's got to be rough because i don't know how you do it systematically it's very difficult to grade context very <pause dur="0.4"/> relatively easy to grade structures <pause dur="0.7"/> quite difficult to grade functions almost impossible to grade contexts <pause dur="1.7"/> to the demands they make on communication skills rather than by strictly <pause dur="0.2"/> linguistic criteria <pause dur="0.3"/> so we've got a move <pause dur="1.5"/> from language <pause dur="0.5"/> to process <pause dur="1.0"/> language focus <pause dur="0.9"/> the what <pause dur="0.5"/> of linguistics <pause dur="0.4"/> to <pause dur="0.5"/> the how of linguistics and a shift in attention from what linguists can tell us <pause dur="0.8"/> to 
what <pause dur="0.4"/> sociolinguists can tell us and educationalists can tell us <pause dur="0.8"/> so influences coming in from other fields <pause dur="0.5"/> <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> talked about the broadening <pause dur="0.2"/> of our discipline <pause dur="0.6"/> beyond just pure linguistics <pause dur="0.3"/> into sociolinguistics psycholinguistics <pause dur="0.2"/> here we're broadening it into education <pause dur="0.2"/> as well <pause dur="1.9"/> any questions about that <pause dur="0.5"/> or comments <pause dur="4.6"/> three very different approaches three very different views <pause dur="0.2"/> of what's going on in education <pause dur="0.3"/> and how people learn <pause dur="3.7"/> and of course you can have <pause dur="0.3"/> a shift <pause dur="0.8"/> from one to the other as we saw from the descriptions that people gave earlier <pause dur="0.4"/> very often <pause dur="0.8"/> the shift will be according to level <pause dur="1.4"/> some people may find <pause dur="0.5"/> i think somebody described <pause dur="1.5"/> beginning <pause dur="0.2"/> levels focusing here <pause dur="0.3"/> on structures and more intermediate levels moving on into functions and perhaps at more advanced levels <pause dur="0.3"/> thinking about process <pause dur="0.3"/> but there will be other people who may have gone the other way <pause dur="0.5"/> and have decided that <pause dur="0.9"/> process is the important <pause dur="0.4"/> starting point <pause dur="0.3"/> what you do with language

judicious mixture of the two <pause dur="0.2"/> that there are occasions when you have to do this <pause dur="0.8"/> in order to allow the learner <pause dur="0.2"/> to focus on accuracy <pause dur="0.3"/> because <pause dur="0.3"/> they can't <pause dur="0.4"/> do this and this all the time that there are times when you need <pause dur="0.3"/> to look at the language <pause dur="0.9"/> particularly if it's very different from your mother tongue <pause dur="0.2"/> and where the teacher will control and manipulate drilling <pause dur="0.3"/> for example <pause dur="1.0"/> but there will be other occasions <pause dur="0.2"/> where the student the learner <pause dur="0.2"/> will be free to experiment and explore the language and make their own mistakes <pause dur="4.0"/> what's happening as we move down here of course to the teacher <pause dur="0.4"/> is <pause dur="1.2"/> the teacher is actually losing control <pause dur="0.5"/> the teacher is stopping being a teacher and i think when we think about language teaching we need to think about the role of the teacher <pause dur="0.3"/> here the teacher is boss <pause dur="0.3"/> the teacher is what doing what i'm doing now <pause dur="0.4"/> standing at the front <pause dur="1.1"/> controlling <pause dur="0.3"/> as you move down here the teacher's role changes here <pause dur="0.3"/> you are <pause dur="1.0"/> arbiter of the language you are <pause dur="0.2"/> linguistic model <pause dur="0.3"/>

curriculum and syllabus are two words that are very often used interchangeably particularly i think # <pause dur="1.9"/> between America and Britain there are differences <pause dur="1.2"/> i don't think it's particularly useful having two words that mean the same thing <pause dur="0.3"/> # when they can be used differently so what <pause dur="0.2"/> my definition here of curriculum is <pause dur="0.3"/> very much <pause dur="1.4"/> looking at what goes on in language learning <pause dur="0.3"/> not just aims and content <pause dur="0.4"/> but also methodology <pause dur="1.3"/> philosophy <pause dur="1.1"/> and evaluation <pause dur="1.0"/>
