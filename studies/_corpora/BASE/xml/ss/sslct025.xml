codecision and that's in JEPP <pause dur="0.5"/> ninety-five <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> there's other references as well <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="2.4"/> but i'll give those <pause dur="0.3"/> to you <pause dur="0.2"/> in the seminars and i'll give them to Pete directly <pause dur="2.1"/> okay so decision making why is it so important who cares about this tedious <pause dur="0.5"/> # part of the # European Union <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="1.0"/> as you'll see throughout the lecture here and as you've probably identified through your reading <pause dur="0.3"/> they don't get easier they get more and more complicated these decision making procedures <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> so <pause dur="0.7"/> # # <pause dur="0.3"/> part of the reason for # <pause dur="0.2"/> going through them <pause dur="0.3"/> in this lecture is to explain why that's happened <pause dur="0.5"/> and to # try and identify what the consequences are <pause dur="0.3"/> for the European Union Union as a system <pause dur="2.1"/> well what do procedures do well first of all they set up a certain set of rules and norms <pause dur="0.3"/> # which <pause dur="0.5"/> # dictate how people <pause dur="0.2"/> interact <pause dur="0.3"/> and this is important at the European level remember because <pause dur="0.3"/> we've talked about these theories of international <trunc>inte</trunc> of European integration from the international <pause dur="0.3"/> relations perspective <pause dur="0.5"/> and 
these approaches both emphasize the importance of rules and norms <pause dur="0.6"/> so from the intergovernmentalist perspective you've got sort of <pause dur="0.3"/> a realist <pause dur="0.2"/> <trunc>r</trunc> or even a regime approach <pause dur="0.2"/> which talks about the establishment of <pause dur="0.3"/> rules <pause dur="0.2"/> and # and routines oh sorry rules and norms <pause dur="0.4"/> # so that member states can cooperate and achieve <pause dur="0.4"/> their national interests in a more effective fashion <pause dur="0.6"/> from neofunctionalists <pause dur="0.2"/> you have rules which then spill over <pause dur="0.2"/> into <pause dur="0.4"/> new <pause dur="0.2"/> # policy areas and which promote a a shared sense of identity <pause dur="1.0"/> and we'll see that <pause dur="0.3"/> through the development of these rules over the over the history <pause dur="0.4"/> # especially over the last twenty years <pause dur="0.3"/> # of the European Union <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> you can see a development of more shared beliefs and <pause dur="0.4"/> more <pause dur="0.3"/> # discussion between <pause dur="0.6"/> the <trunc>inst</trunc> the key institutions of the European Union <pause dur="0.2"/> to the extent that their boundaries have become blurred <pause dur="0.7"/> and that's a very important element in the post-<pause dur="0.4"/>Amsterdam <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> effect of the codecision procedure <pause dur="1.4"/> and for more 
information on that i'll refer you to the # <pause dur="0.2"/> to these # <pause dur="0.3"/> to this <pause dur="0.3"/> web site reference where there's a lot more information about <pause dur="0.3"/> the conciliation procedure <pause dur="2.0"/> right we can see that <pause dur="0.3"/> decision making procedures have been very important in <pause dur="0.2"/> the history of European integration <pause dur="0.3"/> the Luxembourg compromise for example <pause dur="0.3"/> was a form of decision making procedure <pause dur="0.3"/> which radically affected <pause dur="0.3"/> the evolution of European integration <pause dur="0.2"/> in the nineteen-seventies <pause dur="0.4"/> you remember then that the # <pause dur="0.2"/> emphasis on reaching unanimity became an important <pause dur="0.3"/> rule <pause dur="1.1"/> in # <pause dur="0.2"/> in in <pause dur="0.2"/> council decision making <pause dur="1.3"/> well what we can see <pause dur="0.2"/> through the consultation cooperation codecision procedures <pause dur="0.3"/> is a movement towards <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="1.3"/> # a common <pause dur="0.3"/> focus on <pause dur="0.7"/> # promoting a shared <pause dur="0.6"/> # direction <pause dur="0.4"/> # a shared <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> pursuance of a European orientation a <trunc>com</trunc> a set of common interests <pause dur="0.4"/> # instead of <pause dur="0.2"/> the specific interest <pause dur="0.2"/> and this has partly been compensated <pause dur="1.2"/> by the # <pause dur="0.4"/> <trunc>in</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> increased role of the European Parliament <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> but it's also <pause dur="0.4"/> been the 
result of <pause dur="0.3"/> changing procedures <pause dur="0.3"/> in the Council of Ministers as well <pause dur="2.0"/> okay so there's four main decision making procedures in the E-U <pause dur="1.2"/> and i forgot one on your handout <pause dur="0.5"/> # which is the assent procedure <pause dur="0.9"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> these are the consultation procedure the cooperation procedure <pause dur="0.5"/> the codecision procedure and the assent procedure <pause dur="2.6"/> okay the first one <pause dur="1.1"/> is the consultation procedure <pause dur="3.5"/> and this one # encapsulate the # the the exam question which you often get <pause dur="0.4"/> or see we set a lot in past exam papers <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> of the commission proposes the council decides discuss <pause dur="0.7"/> and this very much used to typify <pause dur="0.3"/> the # the relationship <pause dur="0.4"/> of decision making between the council <pause dur="0.2"/> and the commission <pause dur="0.3"/> commission will come up with a proposal <pause dur="0.4"/> as its formal function requires <pause dur="0.2"/> and the council will make the decision <pause dur="0.2"/> the European Parliament only had <pause dur="0.2"/> a very limited impact <pause dur="0.2"/> on the decision making procedure <pause dur="0.3"/> the Economic and Social Committee had a very limited impact <pause dur="0.3"/> and they were effectively the main 
institutions that had <pause dur="0.3"/> # some input onto the <trunc>deci</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> onto the decision making process <pause dur="1.8"/> so the commission proposes the council decides <pause dur="0.4"/> is very much <pause dur="0.2"/> the # the descriptive of <pause dur="0.2"/> the consultation procedure <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> you have the commission <trunc>ini</trunc> initiates a proposal <pause dur="0.3"/> the European Parliament <pause dur="0.3"/> gives an opinion in other words it opines <pause dur="1.0"/> and then the Council of Ministers <pause dur="0.5"/> takes the decision either by a qualified majority <pause dur="0.4"/> or by unanimity <pause dur="4.5"/> and that was the key decision making procedure <pause dur="1.3"/> in # <pause dur="1.7"/> for much of the period of <pause dur="0.2"/> European integration <pause dur="0.4"/> up until <pause dur="1.1"/> # the Single European Act <pause dur="3.8"/> an important <pause dur="0.3"/> event though in the consultation procedure <pause dur="0.3"/> was the <pause dur="0.3"/> European Court of Justice's nineteen-seventy-nine <pause dur="0.3"/> isoglucose ruling <pause dur="0.5"/><vocal desc="sniff" iterated="n"/> </u><pause dur="2.6"/> <u who="sm1185" trans="pause"> nineteen-seventy-nine </u><pause dur="0.5"/> <u who="nm1177" trans="pause"> hey <pause dur="0.2"/> yeah nineteen-seventy-nine <pause dur="1.3"/> isoglucose is the sort of stuff John Barnes drinks you know <pause dur="0.8"/> gives you energy fast that sort of stuff <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> now <trunc>isoglu</trunc> the isoglucose <pause dur="0.2"/> ruling was important <pause dur="1.2"/> # because <pause dur="1.6"/> it <pause dur="0.3"/> forced the Council of Ministers <pause dur="0.3"/> to <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> 
wait for the European Parliament to give its opinion <pause dur="2.3"/> now previously this was something which <pause dur="0.4"/> # the Council of Ministers was went <pause dur="0.2"/> was meant to do <pause dur="0.2"/> but didn't necessarily have to <pause dur="1.3"/> and nineteen-seventy-nine was important because <pause dur="1.1"/> this was the year in which the European Parliament <pause dur="0.4"/> # was first <pause dur="0.5"/> elected <pause dur="0.2"/> through some form of direct election <pause dur="0.4"/> and so the European Court of Justice was recognizing this <pause dur="0.3"/> and requiring that the Council of Ministers took this on board <pause dur="0.3"/> and incorporated the European Parliament <pause dur="0.3"/> formally into its decisions <pause dur="1.8"/> or at least considered <pause dur="0.2"/> the opinion of the European Parliament <pause dur="0.3"/> in its decisions <pause dur="3.4"/> but it didn't really mean an awful lot i mean <pause dur="0.3"/> just 'cause the European <pause dur="0.6"/> Parliament's views were being considered <pause dur="0.3"/> didn't mean that the Council of Ministers was actually going to # <pause dur="0.4"/> to follow them at all <pause dur="4.5"/> and this is still the sort of relationship <pause dur="0.3"/> which you have in <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="1.0"/> in the second and third pillars of # <pause dur="0.6"/> the Maastricht Treaty such as common foreign and security policy <pause dur="3.4"/> 
and that means that the European Parliament <pause dur="0.3"/> has the right effectively to be involved in the in the # <pause dur="0.5"/> in # <pause dur="0.4"/> # discussions <pause dur="0.5"/> # that come up <pause dur="0.4"/> that that that <trunc>r</trunc> that result in particular decisions <pause dur="0.2"/> in these two pillars <pause dur="0.2"/> but it doesn't give it a formal <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> a formal role <pause dur="4.2"/> okay the second procedure <pause dur="1.9"/> is the cooperation procedure <pause dur="8.2"/> all right now if you flip over your page you'll see the cooperation procedure <pause dur="0.3"/> in its full glory <pause dur="3.2"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> briefly the cooperation procedure came about for two main reasons <pause dur="0.4"/> first of all the Single European Market programme if you remember had <pause dur="0.3"/> a list of three-hundred-odd <pause dur="0.3"/> proposals which they had to get through very quickly <pause dur="0.7"/> and this required the extension of qualified majority voting in the Council of Ministers <pause dur="0.3"/> in order to ensure that they'd <pause dur="0.3"/> get all these # all all these decisions made <pause dur="0.3"/> in time <pause dur="1.6"/> in time to meet the ninety-two deadline <pause dur="0.8"/> and the greater involvement of the European Parliament which comes through <pause dur="0.2"/> the cooperation procedure <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> compensated for the 
resulting loss in democratic accountability <pause dur="0.5"/> all right so you have a movement from <pause dur="0.5"/> the <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> accountability of <pause dur="0.3"/> the member states in the Council of Ministers <pause dur="0.5"/> to the European Parliament <pause dur="0.3"/> through the cooperation procedure <pause dur="3.3"/> # the second reason <pause dur="1.3"/> for the cooperation procedure was because M-E-Ps were  <pause dur="0.4"/> unrepresented <pause dur="0.7"/> under-represented rather in the decision making process despite their direct elections <pause dur="0.3"/> so there's a lot of action <pause dur="0.2"/> around the time of nineteen-eighty-four <pause dur="0.3"/> when the European Parliament came up with a draft treaty on European Union <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> which argued for a greater role of the European Parliament <pause dur="0.4"/> in decision making <pause dur="0.8"/> and the cooperation procedure was if you like the first <pause dur="0.5"/> significant institutional development <pause dur="0.3"/> that reflected <pause dur="0.6"/> # a recognition <pause dur="0.2"/> of <pause dur="0.9"/> the # of of the role of the European Parliament <pause dur="5.0"/> the key difference is that the cooperation procedure <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> introduces two readings <pause dur="3.5"/> in the Council of Ministers to the consultation procedure's single readings <pause dur="0.5"/> all right 
so the Council of Ministers has to think about it twice <pause dur="2.1"/> and the second reading forces the council <pause dur="0.3"/> to take into account the European Parliament's <pause dur="0.3"/> reaction <pause dur="0.3"/> to the council's common <pause dur="0.2"/> position <pause dur="10.3"/> okay have you got it in front of you <pause dur="1.1"/> your cooperation procedures <pause dur="1.2"/> # you want one there you go <pause dur="2.4"/> <event desc="passes out handout" iterated="n"/> there you go that's that's the one we're doing now <pause dur="1.4"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> okay so the commission initiates its proposal the European Parliament gives an opinion <pause dur="0.3"/> commission takes a view on the European Parliament's opinion so <pause dur="0.3"/> there has to be some sort of <pause dur="0.4"/> understanding mutual understanding there between the commission <pause dur="0.3"/> and the European Parliament <pause dur="1.1"/> and the Council of Ministers adopts <pause dur="0.2"/> a common position by qualified majority voting <pause dur="1.8"/> all right so that's the first reading <pause dur="1.4"/> by the Council of Ministers <pause dur="2.0"/> now the European Parliament then has a fixed amount of time three months <pause dur="0.3"/> to consider <pause dur="0.4"/> the # Council of Ministers' <pause dur="0.2"/> common position <pause dur="1.9"/> can either # approve <pause dur="0.3"/> the council position or take

more than fifty per cent <pause dur="0.3"/> so it might be sixty per cent or <pause dur="0.5"/> whatever <pause dur="0.5"/> and it just means it's a way of <pause dur="0.5"/> of making it harder to make the decision <pause dur="0.3"/> without it becoming <trunc>un</trunc> <trunc>un</trunc> unanimous <pause dur="1.0"/> yeah <pause dur="1.5"/> okay good <pause dur="0.7"/> right on to the # codecision procedure then <pause dur="5.0"/> right the codecision procedure was set up in the treaty on European Union <pause dur="0.7"/> and this this gave the greatest boost to the European Parliament's <pause dur="0.4"/> powers <pause dur="0.3"/> to date <pause dur="1.7"/> # we'll also talk about how it fitted in with the # <pause dur="0.5"/> with the # <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.9"/> Amsterdam Treaty as well which also extended the codecision procedure <pause dur="2.6"/><vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/><pause dur="1.1"/> all right it was # established under <pause dur="0.5"/> article one-eight-nine-B of the Treaty of Rome <pause dur="0.2"/> so it's very much pillar one business <pause dur="2.4"/> and it took the cooperation procedure a step further <pause dur="2.4"/> so this time rather than just placing the Council of Ministers under a lot of pressure <pause dur="0.3"/> after European Parliament amendments <pause dur="0.7"/> the # codecision procedure provided the E-P with the power <pause dur="0.3"/> to veto decisions <pause dur="2.2"/> so it could actually throw out <pause dur="0.5"/> the # the 
decisions of # <pause dur="0.3"/> the Council of Ministers <pause dur="3.4"/> however <pause dur="0.2"/> and this is <pause dur="0.2"/> what makes it different to <pause dur="0.3"/> the the # <pause dur="0.4"/> the Amsterdam amendments <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> the procedure doesn't encourage the E-P to to employ this veto <pause dur="1.5"/> and it really encourages the promotion of shared decision making <pause dur="0.6"/> all right again there's this <pause dur="0.5"/> attempt to try and set up procedures which <pause dur="0.5"/> get everybody to agree <pause dur="0.3"/> and to come to some sort of # <pause dur="0.4"/> # mutual agreement <pause dur="5.3"/> all right so if you have a look at your piccies again <pause dur="1.6"/> you can have a try at this one <pause dur="12.7"/><vocal desc="sniff" iterated="n"/><pause dur="2.4"/> right so <pause dur="0.8"/> for the first reading <pause dur="0.5"/> for the European Parliament and the council is the same as in the cooperation procedure <pause dur="0.9"/> all right so you've got the commission proposal to the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers <pause dur="0.5"/> the E-P opines <pause dur="0.4"/> and then the council establishes <pause dur="0.3"/> a common position by qualified majority voting <pause dur="5.5"/> and again <pause dur="0.2"/> you've got the European <pause dur="0.2"/> Parliament <pause dur="0.2"/> examining the council position <pause dur="0.7"/> sorry the common position <pause dur="0.3"/> and it can accept by doing nothing <pause dur="0.9"/> and 
then it just goes straight through that's easy <pause dur="1.5"/> rejection <pause dur="0.8"/> by the European Parliament is slightly different as well <pause dur="2.2"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> if the E-P decides to reject <pause dur="0.3"/> by an absolute majority the council can convene a conciliation committee <pause dur="0.8"/> now the conciliation committee is <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> well the idea is was established <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="1.2"/> through the budget which was another area where the European Parliament had <pause dur="0.3"/> large amounts of powers <pause dur="0.6"/> and the conciliation committee was attempted <pause dur="0.2"/> <trunc>w</trunc> was established to try and <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> ensure that they reached some sort of agreement <pause dur="1.3"/> and gave it greater <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="1.1"/> and gave problem areas greater decisions <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> greater consideration rather <pause dur="1.6"/> the make-up of the <trunc>com</trunc> conciliation committee <pause dur="0.3"/> is <trunc>as</trunc> is effectively <pause dur="0.5"/> fifty-fifty council <pause dur="0.4"/> and # <pause dur="0.8"/> and # European Parliament <pause dur="0.9"/> representatives <pause dur="6.0"/> and what you see here is a formal blurring of the boundary between the European Parliament <pause dur="0.6"/> and the Council of Ministers <pause dur="1.0"/> so the idea is to take <pause dur="0.3"/> members of each <pause dur="0.6"/> put them together in a room <pause dur="0.3"/> and get them to 
think about a solution <pause dur="1.4"/> and that's the idea is obviously here is to try and break down that <pause dur="0.3"/> antagonism between <pause dur="0.2"/> supranational and intergovernmental <pause dur="0.4"/> # sort of views of the world <pause dur="8.9"/> so after the council has convened a conciliation committee when after the European Parliament <pause dur="0.3"/> has rejected the common position <pause dur="1.5"/> the E-P can then confirm its rejection <pause dur="0.5"/> by an absolute majority <pause dur="13.4"/> okay so this is after the council has explained its position in greater detail to the European Parliament <pause dur="3.5"/> now if the European Parliament proposes amendments which is the sort of the # the dog leg out to the right of the diagram <pause dur="3.2"/> # the council can accept the amendments by a qualified majority voting <pause dur="0.9"/> if the commission agrees to the <trunc>ame</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> of the amendments <pause dur="0.7"/> and by unanimity if the commission doesn't <pause dur="2.7"/> but if the council <pause dur="0.5"/> doesn't like these amendments at all and rejects them <pause dur="0.9"/> then again a conciliation committee can be established <pause dur="4.1"/> now at this stage the conciliation committee 
acts as a last chance for the European Parliament <pause dur="0.3"/> and the council to <trunc>d</trunc> <pause dur="0.3"/> to agree <pause dur="0.8"/> so if it approves a <trunc>joint</trunc> <pause dur="0.4"/> if it produces a jointly approved text after six weeks' deliberation <pause dur="0.4"/> the text <pause dur="0.3"/> must be approved by the council by Q-M-V <pause dur="0.5"/> and by the <pause dur="0.4"/> by the European Parliament by <pause dur="0.3"/> absolute majority <pause dur="3.5"/> but if the conciliation committee cannot agree on a joint text <pause dur="0.3"/> then the balance back <pause dur="0.2"/> swings back in favour of the Council of Ministers <pause dur="2.6"/> all right so that <pause dur="0.3"/> the # Council of Ministers <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> can then <pause dur="1.5"/> refer back to the original common position <pause dur="0.4"/> and # <pause dur="0.7"/> and approve the legislation through qualified majority voting <pause dur="8.9"/><event desc="student enters room" iterated="n" n="sm1181"/> hiya <pause dur="0.2"/> so the Council of Ministers effectively wins out at the end of the day of the conciliation committee <pause dur="0.4"/> but the European Parliament can make it very difficult indeed <pause dur="0.4"/> and when it rejects <pause dur="0.4"/> # a decision it makes it practically impossible for the Council of Ministers to pass it through <pause dur="2.8"/> but the key thing here in the conciliation committee <pause dur="0.2"/> is to

any questions there on the codecision i've had to rush that last bit a bit <pause dur="2.1"/> no okay well you can sort them out in the in the # <pause dur="0.8"/> in the seminars if you like <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> oh right the assent procedure is the last <pause dur="0.3"/> sort of major procedure <pause dur="0.9"/> and in this one the commission proposes <pause dur="0.4"/> the E-P votes to approve or reject <pause dur="0.7"/> by an absolute majority <pause dur="2.3"/> and then it's # <pause dur="0.5"/> the E-P either rejects and the proposal fails <pause dur="0.4"/> or the E-P approves <pause dur="0.2"/> and the council <pause dur="0.2"/> adopts through <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> unanimity <pause dur="0.9"/> now the key thing here is that <pause dur="0.4"/> here the European Parliament has a solid veto <pause dur="0.8"/> but <pause dur="0.3"/> the <pause dur="0.2"/> areas to which this # <pause dur="0.2"/> relates <pause dur="0.4"/> are very limited it's essentially <pause dur="0.5"/> # agreements or associations with third party member states <pause dur="0.3"/> so <pause dur="0.3"/> member states outside the European Union <pause dur="0.3"/> or the accession of new member states to the E-U </u><pause dur="0.6"/> <u who="sm1196" trans="pause"> sorry <pause dur="0.2"/> can you just <pause dur="0.2"/> so the commission proposes it </u><u who="sm1196" trans="latching"> yeah </u><u who="sm1196" trans="overlap"> and the E-P votes on it </u><u who="nm1177" trans="latching"> yeah </u><pause dur="0.2"/> <u who="sm1196" trans="pause"> one way or the other </u><u who="nm1177" trans="latching"> yeah </u><u who="sm1196" trans="latching"> and if they reject it nothing goes to the council at all </u><u who="nm1177" trans="latching"> well it 
just # well it it # <pause dur="0.4"/> yeah it it fails <pause dur="0.2"/> yeah it that's it end of story <pause dur="0.4"/> yeah <pause dur="0.6"/> so <pause dur="0.4"/> the E-P has a solid sort of # veto here <pause dur="0.4"/> # but again as i said it's it's # <pause dur="1.1"/> it's on very limited areas <pause dur="0.5"/> and that's # <pause dur="0.4"/> that's important with respect to of <pause dur="0.3"/> to for example Turkish accession where this has been the European Parliament has been <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.9"/> a major advocate of <pause dur="0.6"/> of # human rights issues </u><u who="sm1186" trans="overlap"> <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> human <trunc>iss</trunc> third party issues <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/><vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" n="ss" dur="1"/></u><pause dur="0.3"/> <u who="nm1177" trans="pause"> they're the main ones </u><u who="sm1186" trans="latching"> and that's it really </u><u who="nm1177" trans="overlap"> yeah that's the main ones <pause dur="1.2"/><vocal desc="sniff" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.2"/> all right so how do these affect our understanding of # <pause dur="0.5"/> of the <trunc>th</trunc> the relevance of the theories <pause dur="0.3"/> well essentially what you can see here is that <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="1.2"/> with the movement of these decision making procedures the the <trunc>e</trunc> their evolution to a more <pause dur="0.3"/> complex <pause dur="0.3"/> and # <pause dur="0.3"/> a more <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="1.0"/> well increasingly informal basis <pause dur="0.4"/> the boundaries between the different institutions become <pause dur="0.3"/> less <pause dur="0.2"/> clearly defined <pause dur="0.4"/> so these distinctions between supranational <pause dur="0.3"/> and intergovernmental which we've seen <pause dur="0.3"/> have # typified much of the 
international relations approaches <pause dur="0.3"/> have become <pause dur="1.0"/> less relevant <pause dur="1.9"/> similarly when we're talking about the # <pause dur="0.4"/> the comparative politics approaches <pause dur="0.6"/> issues of accountability and transparency don't become more clear <pause dur="0.4"/> they become less clear <pause dur="1.0"/> so the decision making has moved away from <pause dur="0.3"/> the European Parliament <pause dur="0.3"/> and from the # # from the Council of Ministers <pause dur="0.3"/> and from even these formal decision making procedures <pause dur="0.3"/> are moved much more into informal relationships <pause dur="0.3"/> between <pause dur="0.4"/> # the the relevant subcommittees <pause dur="1.5"/> so transparency hasn't necessarily been improved <pause dur="0.3"/> and this is part of the <pause dur="0.7"/> part of # # of the problem # <pause dur="0.2"/> which Amsterdam was meant to try and <pause dur="0.4"/> resolve and which it hasn't effectively done <pause dur="1.1"/> # <pause dur="1.1"/> so thirdly what about this constructivist approach well to a degree that's been quite useful <pause dur="0.3"/> # because it <pause dur="0.2"/> it helps us understand how it is <pause dur="0.5"/> how these decision making procedures have affected the 
relationship between <pause dur="0.6"/> the different actors <pause dur="0.2"/> and how it's structured and restructured those <pause dur="0.2"/> relationships <pause dur="0.5"/> so <pause dur="0.5"/> members of the European Parliament <pause dur="1.1"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> cooperate more freely with the Council of Ministers' members <pause dur="0.5"/> and that <pause dur="0.9"/> to understand that you have to understand how <pause dur="0.3"/> their identities and their perspectives have been altered <pause dur="0.3"/> by the development of new institutional procedures <pause dur="0.2"/> and structures at the European level <pause dur="1.1"/> so there's another way of <pause dur="0.4"/> of integrating the # the more constructivist approaches to understanding European <pause dur="0.4"/> integration <pause dur="2.8"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> okay any questions <pause dur="2.0"/> all right <pause dur="0.9"/> okay have a look at this web page before next time <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> people in my seminar group <pause dur="0.4"/> we're going to do what we didn't do last time <pause dur="0.2"/> and then we'll rearrange <pause dur="0.2"/> we'll reschedule another <pause dur="0.3"/> seminar <pause dur="1.6"/> all right <pause dur="0.2"/> thank you very much
