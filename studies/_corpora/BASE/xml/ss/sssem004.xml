<u who="nf5413">well i thought before we actually start on today's programme i just wanted to remind you of the next directed time test which isn't # due # till seminar nine so this is a kind of early # an early warning really and just as now you're doing a medium term plan what we'd like you to do is work in twos or threes it can be the same group you've worked in to do the medium term plan is to do a lesson plan based on a single text or a variety of texts of your choice you don't need to write this down because it is in your handbook <kinesic desc="pointing at screen" iterated="n" dur="1"/> but again there are a series of criteria that your # lesson plan should show age group the objectives very important again reference to the national curriculum as well as the national literacy strategy opportunities to read and write in a variety of ways plans for differentiated learning and assessment opportunities so that's again i'm going to do you a lead lecture on that # next week and i'll bring you some paper and some O-H-Ts again if you would like to use those to make your presentation on i'll also be bringing you # the copy of the university lesson plan which you have in your handbook you can follow that if you wish it's not set in stablets tablets of stone you don't need to follow that exactly but what you must make sure is that all the objectives are covered in more detail obviously than you would if you were a teacher because we we it's part of reaching the standards that you you actually meet all those objectives within your lesson plan so that's an early reminder if you have something in your head with your group and you want to get on with it now before # before the lecture by all means go ahead # if if you would like to do that okay are there any questions about about this no-one has okay right well let's make a start then with with this this week's what we're going to do today is have a look at some stories in a book of short stories called No More School this is this is it No More School edited by Valerie Bearman and it's a book of short stories by different writers # about school okay so it has a theme and what we're going to do is to discuss some of these stories in order to find out more about how they are constructed those grammatical elements in them that make them stand as short stories in their own right and then to explore ways of using these stories with more experienced readers and because of the nature of what we're doing we're really talking key stage two probably upper key stage two although i haven't put a year and a term on this because # i think you should be free to use it flexibly and we've already discussed directed time test okay so that's that's a little bit about the objectives that we're going to do some time ago i went to a conference in York the National Association for the Teaching of English and we listened to a session by Jan Mark who you may have heard of Jan Mark is # a children's writer who writes both novels and short stories and she said when in her talk when i've finished a children's novel i feel exhausted but when i've finished writing a children's short story i feel clever and it all called us up short a little bit when she said that and i think it's rather significant in terms of what we're going to look at today and in your small groups could you just talk for a minute or two about what she might have meant by that what did she mean and then we'll draw some of your comments together</u>
<gap reason="inaudible" extent="uncertain"/>
<u who="nf5413">okay let's # let's try let's try and pick this up why do you think she kind of says that writing this short story left her feeling clever</u>
<u who="sf5415">you find it quite difficult to think up a story a short story # has like cut short whereas a novel is somewhat longer and more more drawn out and lasts a lot longer which gives you more time really to remember the character and your parts and all that whereas the short story is more structured </u>
<u who="nf5413">yeah that structure and as as you say it's this because it's short its got # it has to have a different structure a different form from the novel and so you haven't got much time to play around with character or setting or plot you've got to really telescope all those ideas into a few a few pages how might that affect the kind of language that you use do you think</u>
<u who="sf5415">you've got to be more direct about it because you can't just</u>
<u who="nf5413">that's right you've got to be more direct you can't # waste words it's a bit like writing a poem i think you've got to be absolutely precise and <trunc>i</trunc> it really sort of weigh every word is this word valuable in the context of this story is it going to take the ideas forward so direct use of language anything else about the language</u>
<u who="sf5416">it's got to be really interesting reasonably interesting ish </u>
<u who="nf5413">yeah yeah immediately interesting it's got to engage you hasn't it right from the first right that immediacy at the beginning which says something about your first even your first even your first sentence even just your first paragraph your first sentence it's got it's got to pop you in there you anything else</u>
<u who="sf5417">has it got to be plausible the child has got to believe that the story's real if they don't believe that it's real they're not going to enjoy the story</u>
<u who="nf5413">right it's got to it's got to have a sort of integrity right the child's got to <trunc>be</trunc>  believe that it it's real that it can happen even though it's only happening on a few pages of the book it's still got to have that sort of inner that inner integrity to it that that holds you and makes you believe in the characters and believe in the story # so you've got to create characters who are believable as well as a storyline that's believable it's no good having sort of cardboard cut out characters they've got to be they've got to stand out as real people in in this and going back to what you were saying about the structure you need to think about the ending right how is it going to end a lot of short stories have a sort of twist in the tail don't they they have a a little unexpected # plot turn at the end that the author's been leading up to and it makes you want to turn the pages to find out what's what's happening so that's sometimes that sort of twist at the end are any of you short story readers</u>
<u who="sf5417">how short is a short story</u>
<u who="nf5413">well there's a good question how short is a short story what do you think</u>
<u who="sf5417">well children's books you could say they're all short stories can't you the new Harry Potter <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/></u>
<u who="nf5413">Harry Potter #</u>
<gap reason="inaudible" extent="uncertain"/>
<u who="nf5413">is a short novel the same as a short story</u>
<u who="ss">no</u>
<u who="nf5413">no i hear why not</u>
<u who="sf5418">it usually needs more than one sitting to read a novel whereas a short story very often everyone's sitting reading in one sitting</u>
<u who="nf5413">you can read it in one sitting and it perhaps goes back to what you said right at the beginning about the form of it the structure # so that we we can sort of pick that up what what makes the short story that's what we want to do today think of ways of discussing that very same thing with # children in years five or years six and have a read of some yourself we are going to read some this afternoon but # think about short stories Somerset Maugham is a good short story writer Roald Dahl writes good short stories for adults you know his tales of mystery and murder and suspense you know a lovely twist in the tale there's a real art in writing the short story and something else i think to think about although it makes demands on the writer and here's Jan Mark saying she's feeling clever a short story i think also makes demands on the reader so whether you're # a ten year old or a forty year old or a ninety year old short stories make the reader feel clever i think in reading them as well as the writer in writing them can you think why that might be</u>
<u who="sf5415">well it's nice to finish a good long novel and you think yeah i've done that that was a good story it's the same with a short story isn't it the feeling of completion</u>
<u who="nf5413">that feeling of completion satisfaction as Sheila says you feel that there is a sense of closure there and i think because of what you said about the structure the language the developed character you in a way have to fill in quite a lot of narrative gaps you know it requires you to make sense of what the writer's saying in just a short time so you're having to do quite a lot of work in putting the events of the story together and probably in anticipating what might happen at the end so it it makes demands and these sort of demands are are what we could look at in terms of the children as well who are going to be doing the reading okay i'm going to read you a little story then i'm going to give you a copy of it and we're going to # look at this story and it's from the English Book of Fairy Tales edited by Joseph Jacobs if you don't own this do get one because all the well known tales are in here beautifully and economically told and they'll give you a real fund of stories that you can use in drama or in the literacy hour as well and i want you to think how this story i'm going to read you works from in relation to we've said already right are you sitting comfortably it's called the Golden Arm it's very short <reading>there was once a man who travelled all over the land in search of a wife he saw young and old rich and poor pretty and plain and he could not meet one who took his mind at last he found a woman young fair and rich who possessed a right arm of solid gold he married her at once and thought no man so fortunate as he they lived happily together but though he wished people to think otherwise he was fonder of the golden arm than all the wife's gifts besides at last she died the husband put on the blackest black and pulled the longest face at the funeral but for all that he got up in the middle of the night and dug up the body and cut off the golden arm he hurried home to hide his treasure and thought that noone would know the following night he put the golden arm under his pillow and was just falling asleep when the ghost of his dead wife glided into the room stalking up to the bedside she drew the curtain and looked at him reproachfully pretending not to be afraid he spoke to the ghost and said what has thou done with thy cheeks so red all withered and wasted away replied the ghost in a hollow tone what hast thy thou done with thy red rosy lips all withered and wasted away what has thou done with thy golden hair all withered and wasted away what has thou done with thy golden arm thou hast it</reading> that's it that's the end of the story <vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" dur="2"/> i'm going to give you i'm going to give you your own copy of this and i just want you to spend a few minutes talking together about how the sort of things we've said so far about the way it works as a story about the use of language</u>
<gap reason="next phase of event" extent="uncertain"/>
<u who="sf5419">what a long intro for such a short story i thought</u>
<u who="sf5421">i thought a short story was like</u>
<u who="sf5419">yeah there are different types though isn't there i mean the Yellow Wallpaper was really long</u>
<u who="sm5414">i suppose you you don't find out it leaves a lot to the reader it would be good if you were it would be good if you were getting the kids to write on from that wouldn't it so that they really get scared but they get scared and about the arm will he keep it or whatever</u>
<u who="ss">yeah <vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" dur="2"/></u>
<u who="sm5414"><gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> if you turned it's like when he gets to that night he went to bed he turns the whole lights out if you filled in no i'm being serious if you did it slowly if you build up to it like added your own into it more description like rather than just the ghost walked up to the side of the bed <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> and then you've got a five-year-old <trunc>pi</trunc> kind of pissing themselves</u>
<gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/>
<u who="sm5414">what if you changed one bit</u>
<u who="sf5422">like not have it </u>
<u who="sm5414">yeah would that make it more scary <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> make it so that we know he's afraid leaving out bit choose two or three </u>
<gap reason="new phase of event" extent="uncertain"/>
<u who="nf5413">okay first of all any any sort of general comments on the story general any sort of general reaction</u>
<gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/>
<u who="su">we didn't like it</u>
<u who="sf5419">you didn't like it right by the way it was first published in eighteen-ninety-eight so we're talking just over a hundred years ago it's a real # real sort of Victorian ghost tale you know part of a of a genre that you know you couldn't possibly tell the children at bedtime these days but there you are it was collected by <trunc>Jo</trunc>  Joseph Jacobs when he went around the country collecting traditional tales it's unauthored any more reactions</u>
<u who="sf5420">i felt quite cheated by it but then having looked at it again i think it's quite amusing because the bottom bit reminds me of Red Riding Hood and the wolf in grandma's bed</u>
<u who="nf5413">oh right that sort of repetition at the end yeah what big ears you've got what big eyes you've got that's the function of the folk tale this table talked about that as well the repetition there is something you often find in folk fairy tales to to # what is it for why is that why is that repetition there do you think</u>
<u who="su">is it to help with the memory</u>
<u who="nf5413">i think so its that's yes because don't forget these these were # oral tales repetition is part of of helping your memory along and maybe the listeners joined in at that point whenever i've done this with children before all withered and wasted away all joined in and i think probably the original # audience would have joined in there so it's got a function of helping helping memory there</u>
<u who="sf5423">it also makes <trunc>th</trunc> thou hast it makes it more surprising because you're expecting it to be all withered and wasted away</u>
<u who="nf5413">right so that's the kind of that's the twist in the end if you like # which you see in in different ways in modern short stories as well</u>
<u who="sm5414">we thought # you could make it a bit better by like if you bulked it out somewhat added a bit more description of your own into it rather than just she walked in looked at the side of the bed if you added more like scary descriptions and then we thought i don't know wif anyone else knows the Hairy Big Toe nobody's heard of it</u>
<u who="ss">no</u>
<u who="su">it's similar to the end bit it builds up throughout the thing and then someone finds this big hairy toe and then all the way through it says who's got my big then i think it's all down to you've got it so scary <vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" dur="2"/> so if you added more stuff like that you could #</u>
<u who="nf5413"># and also i've heard this done translated into a context for the present and you might think how you might want to do that but that it's possible to take the sort of the format of the folk fairy tale and translate it which is something you could ask children to do and as you say as well to to # make them more full to make more more of it and in fact if you wanted children to write their own version that's # an extremely good activity you could do with them either in individual groups or as a shared activity together if it's the first time they'll be doing it you'll notice that there's no use of names and a lot of these folk tales don't use names at all characters are a kind of function of the plot and that's something you might want to point out no names no proper nouns are are used in these stories how does this anonymous writer convey the settings of this story # how <trunc>wha</trunc>  does the language work to do that</u>
<u who="sf5424">it begins like a fairy story</u>
<u who="nf5413">sorry</u>
<u who="sf5424">it's starts like a fairy story</u>
<u who="nf5413">there once was there was once yes there's this traditional yeah that you might want to talk about to children there was once a man a very common opening so it's set in the that sort of <trunc>inter</trunc>  <trunc>inter</trunc>  indeterminate past isn't it past tense but we don't know when it was and that again is something we have in folk tales i don't quite know its a bit shadowy when all this happened but it happened once anything else about the setting there the language that's used to enable you to know more about where it happened anything that comes to mind</u>
<gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/>
<u who="sf5415">was it a small village i think it's a small English village ages and ages ago because</u>
<u who="nf5413">what makes you feel it's a small village</u>
<u who="sf5415">because he sounds like he has talked about it's said that he has to put the longest face on so <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/></u>
<u who="nf5413">oh that's right so it's it's as though he is play acting to somebody to some people with his blackest black and he's obviously got people looking at him so it sounds as though it's a small village mentality really and maybe he settled there after this travelling the lands look so he's been far and wide and then he comes back</u>
<u who="sf5418">i suppose you can talk about the oral tradition as well there the fact that in # old England there were more villages smaller towns</u>
<u who="nf5413">yes yes it could take you into looking at history the historical context of of living social conditions how do you get to know about him did you like him </u>
<u who="ss">no</u>
<u who="nf5413">and even before he chopped her arm off what was it that made you not like him where is the language that tells you that you don't like this guy</u>
<u who="sf5417">at last he found a woman </u>
<u who="nf5413">at last he found a woman okay it doesn't mince its words this does it at last he found a woman though this is part of what you were saying about the directness of the language of the short story anything else</u>
<u who="sf5425">there's the thing in the second paragraph at <trunc>les</trunc>  last she died </u>
<u who="nf5413">at last she died another at last as if he'd been waiting for this to happen at last it makes you wonder if he did <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> it doesn't it</u>
<u who="sf5425"><gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/></u>
<u who="nf5413">sorry</u>
<u who="sf5425">it says he was fonder of the golden arm <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/></u>
<u who="nf5413">he was fonder of the golden arm always mind speaks beside and how economical with language to actually # give you that information there in just that second part of the sentence </u>
<u who="sf5416">if it was a novel it wouldn't be written that way would it it would be written in such a way that you would have to work that one out yourself</u>
<u who="nf5413">quite possible yes yes and it would last over a much longer period </u>
<u who="sf5416">you'd get more information wouldn't you about how</u>
<u who="nf5413">yes yes that's right look how economically it's done there and you notice how the events that <trunc>c</trunc>  are often conveyed through the verbs he hurried home # he dug up he put on he got up he cut off he put right so all these events the one thing after the other you you get delivered to you through through # the the verbs of the sentences one after the other it comes at you how is the problem introduced because all of this looks as if it's going very well for him how does this anonymous writer introduce # a spanner in the works excuse me</u>
<u who="su">and the ghost of his dead wife glided into the room</u>
<u who="nf5413">yes that's right and again look just a sentence when the ghost of his dead wife glided into the room in fact not even a sentence just that # that clause you notice you don't waste time with description in these things not not the descriptive adjectives that you might find in the novel or the descriptive adjectives that you might find in the novel or the descriptive adverbs it's straight on with the story all the time stalking up to the bedside she drew the curtain no messing about there and then of course the resolution at the end thou hast it and if you were showing the children they'd notice that was written for extra emphasis in capital letters yeah which of course you don't get when you're telling it except you could put some emphasis into it but you can use this also to talk about the use of punctuation for for emphasis and for effect like that i think with children you might not want to use this story but you can use a kind of a short story that's similar for # identifying the features of short stories that you might want to discuss with them okay here's another one now here's one from the book that we're going to use and i'm just going to show you the first bit of it first it's one of the stories called The Night We Looked For Charlie by Alexander McColl Smith yeah and i'm just going to show you the opening sentence <reading>have you ever heard about Charlie my friend Nick whispered to me one night</reading> what do you know about this story just just by showing you the title and the first sentence what do you know</u>
<u who="sf5419">it's set at nightime</u>
<u who="nf5413">sorry</u>
<u who="sf5419">it's set at nightime</u>
<u who="nf5413">it's set at nightime okay you've got night there and night here</u>
<u who="su">it's two friends talking about Charlie</u>
<u who="nf5413">it's two friends because you've got my friend and they're talking about Charlie so we in a way we've got a little bit of a setting</u>
<u who="sf5416">they have to be quiet as well don't they because its whispered</u>
<u who="nf5413">right the word whispered not Nick said to me Nick whispered to me</u>
<u who="sm5414">it's kind of kind of like a legend or a myth or something </u>
<u who="nf5413">right because it's a sort of legend or a myth # so it's introducing a kind of an atmosphere of of # well it's nighttime and they're whispering so there's a secret this could be a bit secretive something not generally known about this this guy Charlie okay # it's also look we've got a first person narrator whoever is telling this story is Nick's friend we don't know who he is yet but it's written in the first person # and we know they're together at night and this is a bit of this is a bit of gossip okay # let's have a look at a little bit more of it then let's have a read of this paragraph here <reading>it was dark in the dormitory and everybody else was asleep Nick's bed was next to mine so we could talk about people at home sometimes at night particularly in the hot season when it was difficult to get to sleep we would talk late into the night although it was against the rules it was that sort of school i suppose there were all sorts of rules which did not seem to have much point but which nobody would ever dream of changing boarding schools used to be rather like that particularly this rather old fashioned boarding school on the edge of those great dry plains of Africa</reading> okay so we've got a little bit more now about the story just talk in your groups for a minute or two about the kind of # structure that is developing the kind of language that Alexander McColl Smith is using to get further into the story and any questions that are sort of forming in your head about it okay just for a couple of minutes</u>
<gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/>
<u who="nf5413">okay okay any more any more information what what can you tell us about what the author is doing about his use of the language about these two characters in the group about Charlie </u>
<u who="sf5418">well now it's caught your attention it's starting to give you a little more detail about where they are what they're doing the setting</u>
<u who="nf5413">the boarding school we know this suggests that he knows Nicholas well doesn't it Nick who is his friend we've got Nick they've got their beds next to each other so they're obviously good friends chums and we know something of where they are in Africa at a boarding school anything else about the narrator that you've learned from this</u>
<u who="sf5426">he's not writing it in the present he's remembering # perhaps when he was younger and at school</u>
<u who="nf5413">how do you know that Jane</u>
<u who="sf5426">because it says boarding schools used to be very much like that</u>
<u who="nf5413">right okay boarding schools used to be so it's not going on now it may still be but it was that sort of school there <trunc>we</trunc>  there were all sorts of rules boarding schools used to be so he they're very much he's looking back at this from another time at least we know he doesn't die at the end don't we you can't have a first person narrator who dies and incidentally this might be a time to talk to children again about the writer and the narrator not being the same # voice if you like Alexander McColl Smith # isn't the person who is talking in the story or if he is that's a coincidence because he actually he's taking on the narrative voice of a boy who is Nick's friend in the story okay let's just look at the remainder of the page then i said nothing for a moment outside the building there was the sound of cicadas a shrill sound of screeching insects that would continue until dawn i asked Nick who Charlie was Charlie's a miner he said rather Charlie was a miner a long time ago okay i'm going to give you i'm going to give you a copy of this now and i want you to just look at it that page and see how the writer is building up tension <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> use of dialogue</u>
<gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/>
<u who="su">the students are like at boarding school rules and stuff</u>
<u who="su">yeah but you find out the reference</u>
<u who="su">yeah</u>
<u who="su">it's very colloquial where it says it was that sort of school i suppose it's sort of you know</u>
<u who="nf5413">okay i'm sorry to stop you but obviously if you are doing this with children you could take more time and write questions down for them but obviously we are in a hurry to do this tension how is he building tension with this page altogether do you think</u>
<u who="sf5427">well we know it's nightime we've got insects</u>
<u who="nf5413">because we've got kids right we've got insects we've got whispering the insects are screeching what about that last sentence there</u>
<u who="sf5417">it makes you wonder what's happened to Charlie </u>
<u who="nf5413">that's right </u>
<u who="sf5417">you know he died but you want to know why</u>
<u who="nf5413">yes so it's holding your interest it's making you think ahead and i think Nanaki said he's a ghost isn't he so there's that element of mystery do do any of the other tables think he's a ghost</u>
<u who="sm5414">it leads it does it leads you false because for all we know the next line could be saying Charlie was a miner a long time but then he quit and became a baker <vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" dur="2"/> it lead it does intentionally it kind of leads you in the direction you are expected to go</u>
<u who="nf5413">we should find out we should try and find out okay is there anything kind of in the dialogue to do that you've got the opening opening # dialogue questions that sort of sets the suspense and you've got dialogue here so you've got here a writer whose using dialogue to move that to move the story forward move the mystery forward # by giving little facts like this and the sentence structure's rather interesting look at this <reading>i said nothing for a moment</reading> a short sentence <reading>outside the building there was the sound of cicadas a shrill sound of shrieking insects that would continue until dawn</reading> look at this right long complex sentence and then <reading>i asked Nick who Charlie was</reading> so you've got <reading>i said nothing for a moment i asked Nick who Charlie was</reading> so all that description there is framed with this thought that's going on in his head and that's a that's a rather nice juxtapositioning there i think that's done deliberately so you could talk to children about and see if they want to use in their own writing okay i'm going to read you a bit of the story then and then i'm going to stop just before the end and see if you can do some of your own writing <reading>tell me about him i asked i was far from sleepy and Nick's question aroused my curiosity i lay still as Nick told the story his voice quiet in the darkness if you try listening to somebody talking in the dark you'll find that it is very easy to listen there's nothing to distract you from what's been said there's just the voice Nick explained that in the hills that lay to the north of the school there were numerous old mineworkings these were tunnels which had been dug in the days when gold had been mined there then the gold had run out and the miners had left but they'd done nothing about the shafts that went deep in the ground one or two of them had rusted old fences around them and some had collapsed or filled with water many of them were still there though and this was the reason why we were forbidden to go into the hills Charlie had been a miner years ago who'd come across a very rich vein of gold the vein of rock in which this gold was found rose briefly to the surface and then dipped deep into the heart of the hills Charlie soon recovered a great deal of gold from the shallower part but after his lucky strike he had to dig deeper and deeper he didn't have to use very much equipment Nick said all that he used to go down into the depths of the shack was an old bucket lowered by a winch one of his men turned the handle and down he went in the bucket at the end of the rope he must have been brave i whispered they all were my grandfather new some of them he told me they never got scared no matter how deep they went Nick paused Charlie was very brave he went on but it didn't save him there was a rock fall in the tunnel and he dug and he never came up again they called some of the other miners to come and help rescue him and they dug through the rock fall to the tunnel beyond but they never found him but what happened i asked where had he gone nobody knows said Nick there were a whole lot of tunnels down there maybe he wondered into another tunnel and got lost maybe he fell down the shaft no-one ever saw him again i was silent for a few moments Nick said nothing more then he finished his story but he's still there he answered my brother knew someone who knew him a few years ago or saw this ghost rather it was him it was definitely Charlie i felt a cold chill i didn't believe in ghosts or did i i suppose i wasn't sure when i asked when did whoever he was see him he went up beyond the top games fieldhe went up with one or two others for a dare one night they were looking into one of the mine tunnels when suddenly they felt there was someone there they turned round and he was standing not far away holding the shovel then he seemed to fade away right before their eyes they ran all the way back non stop i found it difficult to get to sleep after Nick had told his story and throughout the next day the tale kept going round my mind as i sat in the classroom my gaze wandered out of the window there were the gum trees and there was the top games field and then just beyond the field the hills started with their dry boulder strewn flanks and their tunnels and Charlie i decided to find whether any of the others had heard of Charlie and it turned out that they had everyone seemed to know somebody who knew somebody who'd seen him stories about ghosts and strange happenings were always a bit like that you never meet anyone who's actually seen anything himself it's always someone else slowly i learned a bit more about Charlie it seemed that what Nick had said was true he always carried shovel and that he had a miners cough old miners coughed badly because of all the dust and you often heard Charlie before you saw him or so they say i wondered if Charlie was still around most of the stories about him seemed to be rather old and i thought that he might have given up his appearances by now perhaps ghosts retired after a while once they became bored with wandering about it couldn't have been much fun walking about the school grounds carrying a shovel and coughing then one day somebody saw Charlie and this time i heard the story directly from Gordon the boy who saw him Gordon was a year or so younger than i was he'd only been at the school for a couple of terms but even in that short time he'd made a reputation for himself he was very good at sports but he was also an open honest person not the sort to make something up and that's why i chose to believe him when he told me what had happened it was a Saturday evening i belonged to the chess club which sometimes met on saturday evening in one of the classroom blocks this was some distance away from the hostels and was surrounded by a stand of giant gum trees which had been planted many years before these trees made a strange sound when the wind blew through their branches it was a hushing sound rather like the sound <trunc>ma</trunc>  made by waves in the sea there were four chess games being played that night and i had drawn Gordon as opponent our game was taking a long time to finish and i wondered if it would end in stalemate the others had packed up and gone back to the hostels but the master in charge of the club told us that we could finish our game then we were to turn off the lights and go back to the dormitory it was my move i couldn't think what to do and i sat there with my head in my hands studying the board Gordon sighed this is taking ages he said i'm going to stretch my legs he got up from teh table and walked towards the open door outside there was nothing but the blackness of the African night he stood in the dorrway for a few moments and then i heard him gasp i looked up he was stil standing with his back to me but i knew immediately that something was wrong what's going on i said rising to my feet he turned round his expression was frozen his skin drained of colour i i saw his voice faltered i saw it seemed as if it was impossible for him to finish what he wanted to say i saw Charlie i couldn't think of anything to say i dashed over to where he's been standing and looked out into the night there was no moon so i could see very little but i did feel something that i had never felt before a terror so real and overwhelming that it made my heart thump like a hammer within me without a word we packed up our chess board and the pieces and turned out the light then came the hardest part which was to close the door behind us and run back through the trees to our dormitory we looked neither side of us nor behind us our eyes fixed on the distant friendly lights of the dormitory Gordon didn't say anything more that night but the next day he came up to me after breakfast and told me mor about what he's seen its definitely him he said he was right there in front of me looking at me or rather looking through me and suddenly he wasn't there anymore i thought about Charlie a lot after that and a few weeks later when Nick and i were watching a cricket match and nothing much was happening on the Saturday afternoon i told him what was on my mind i want to see if Charlie really exists i said Gordon surely saw him and i believe him i think we should look for him Nick turned and stared at me what do you mean he said i lowered my voice although there was really no one about to hear what we were saying i think we should go out one night i said we could go to the mine workings and see if he appears Nick's eyes were wide ouselves he stuttered <trunc>a</trunc>  at night i nodded i must have seemed very brave to him but i didn't feel brave inside but i'd made the suggestion now and i felt i had to stick to it well <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> you're not scared are you Nick swallowed not if you aren't he said quietly and with that the plan was hatched and it only remained for us to decide what we were going to do i think we should go tonight i said after a few moments there was a full moon last night so we should be able to see quite well Nick nodded he was scared and so was i though neither of us was prepared to admit it not yet Mr Anderson our house master was early that night he called out lights three minutes before he should have done there was a mad scramble as everyone made their final preparations for bed and then there was darkness i tucked myself into bed shivering with anticipation Nick and i planned to wait an hour before we set off an had our clothes all ready under our beds the minutes dragged by my watch had luminous dial and i could see the position of the minute hand at twenty past eight i decided i could wait no longer and and whispered across to Nick who answered me immediately time to go i suppose if you still want to course i do i whispered back and he slipped out of bed and began dressing in the dark we were both ready within a minute or so then still in stockinged feet for silence we crept out of the dormitory and into the long corridor outside the doors were always kept unlocked in case there was a fire and soon we were out of the building and standing in the strange half darkness of the moonlit night neither of us said anything as we began the walk up towards the top playing field the school grounds looked so different at night everything was bigger and more threatening the gum trees seemed to tower impossibly high above us the buildings were squat black shapes like stranded whales everything which was so comfortable and familiar by day was sinister and unknown at night we skirted round the first of the classroom blocks there was a light on in one of the rooms and we didn't want to be seen no official would have been around at that hour because the teachers would long since have gone home to their bungalows people left lights on though and i and i thought that's what must have happened we crossed over the road that led to the bungalows we were now not far from the very edge of the school grounds and we could already make out the dark tangle of the undergrowth that marked the limits of the top playing field i was surprised at how much light there was not enough to see very far but certainly enough to make out individual bushes and holes in the ground we stopped at the edge of the field do you know where to go Nick asked i've never been further than this i shook my head no i confessed but as long as we go slowly it will be alright what about the mine shafts Nick said his voice quiet beside me lots of them are still open we have to be careful not to fall in i knew he was right this was the reason why we were forbidden to go there it would have been much more sensible to turn back then and to give up the whole ridiculous idea of seeing Charlie but i was determined not to appear cowardly in front of Nick walk right behind me i said i'll look out we started into the bush as we made our way i felt my heart thumping with fear inside me somewhere within a voice was saying quietly turn back turn back i ignored it suddenly Nick touched my arm i heard something he whispered i strained to listen there were the usual sounds of the African night the faint screeching of insects from somewhere but nothing else Nick had left his hand touched my arm and i felt it trembling are you frightened i asked i can feel your arm shaking yes he said i am i swallowed hard so am i i said then i don't think it's such a good <trunc>i</trunc>  idea to look for Charlie after all nothing more was said we just turned around and began to make our way back slowly and carefully conquering the terrible temptation to rush headlong home away from the dark hills and the secrets we were much less frightened by the time we reached the playing fields and when Nick grabbed me by the arm again i thought he was just fooling around look lets get down get down i obeyed him instinctively dropping to the ground beside him then i looked round and saw what was disturbing him and coming directly towards us along the road that led to the bungalows was this solitary <trunc>fing</trunc>  figure</reading> now i wonder in your groups if you could just try and finish that story i'm just going to give you ten minutes to do this i realise that you might not all finish but but we'll see how you kind of get on</u>
<gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/>
<u who="sf5428">and he's been seen lots of times hasn't it so it must be like very angry</u>
<u who="sf5417">and it's just something he can do over and over again</u>
<u who="sf5428">and he is Charlie</u>
<u who="sf5417">so far in this brainstorm we've got the caretaker seeing the kids go out <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> the kids think the caretaker is Charlie the caretaker is # either digging for his gold or he's burying his cat</u>
<u who="sf5429">or he's working on his vegetable patch</u>
<u who="sf5417">or he's working on his vegetable patch</u>
<u who="sf5429">at night</u>
<u who="sf5427">i know but that's the whole point of the story that Charlie was a goldminer and Charlie found a big thing of gold and the school was next to the gold mine</u>
<u who="sf5417">so in the so so in the end of the story when the children find out that the caretaker's not in</u>
<u who="sf5428">he used to go down with them and fill it up with gold and it was whilst he was down there getting the gold that the mine</u>
<u who="sf5429">the story's beginning to come back isn't it</u>
<u who="sf5428">slowly seeping back</u>
<u who="sf5417">are we going to have the ending where the children discover that the caretaker's not Charlie but the caretaker</u>
<u who="sf5429">yeah</u>
<u who="sf5417">could we not have</u>
<u who="sf5429">and he's very innocent like</u>
<u who="sf5430">he's digging for Charlie's gold</u>
<u who="sf5428">he's been a naughty boy </u>
<u who="sf5430">he's digging for Charlie's gold</u>
<u who="sf5428">he hates children</u>
<u who="sf5430">yeah one of those he's one of those yeah</u>
<u who="sf5417">could you not have a could you not have a you know his ring fell off and he didn't have time to go out and have a look </u>
<u who="sf5429">in the middle of the night</u>
<u who="su">yeah but it still has to be</u>
<u who="su">isn't he digging the tunnel</u>
<u who="sf5430">i want i want the caretaker to be Charlie</u>
<u who="su">do you</u>
<u who="sf5428">its a disused mine isn't it</u>
<u who="sf5431">yeah cause it is a disused mine isn't it</u>
<u who="su">i do too</u>
<u who="sf5417">so the caretaker could be Charlie or he could be charlie's <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/></u>
<u who="su">he could be charlie's <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/></u>
<u who="sf5432">is it Charlie so what are we saying</u>

<u who="sf5432">maybe Charlie is the grandad</u>
<u who="nf5413">okay now i realise you didn't have a chance to get very far and again this is just a kind of # rehearsal of what you do in the classroom but nevertheless lets lets just hear very briefly what each of you have done and lets see how we might sort of take this on if you were using this with year five or six # lets start with your group</u>
<u who="sf5432"># ours isn't very nice</u>
<u who="nf5413">go on</u>
<u who="su">its the alternative one</u>
<u who="sf5432">Charlie # it is Charlie but # there's a big story behind it because Charlie didn't like his wife as she used to beat him with the golden arm <vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" dur="2"/> so # therefore he feigned his own death ran away and # subsequently has no money and kind of he so he relies on the boys smuggling food from the school canteen</u>
<u who="nf5413">aha right right that's an interesting twist a bit of intertextuality there <vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" dur="2"/> right what about <trunc>Ha</trunc>  Hannah's group here read out what you've got</u>
<u who="sf5422">we've written an actual paragraph and then Steve's going to tell the ending</u>
<u who="sm5414">no</u>
<u who="sf5422"><trunc>ab</trunc> above the noise of the insects we could just make out a rasping coughing sound me and Nick looked at each other we scrambled frantically into the undergrowth that lay by the side of the path the figure drew nearer looking around searching knowing somebody was watching him he beckoned inviting us to follow him into the darkness of the night <vocal desc="ghost noises" iterated="y" dur="4"/></u>
<u who="nf5413">see how they've picked up picked up the language of the story Steve can you finish it for us</u>
<u who="su">well we wanted the ending to be</u>
<u who="sm5414">well they get rather than following they get eaten by a lion <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/></u>
<u who="su"><gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> a baby lion</u>
<u who="sm5414">oh oh <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> or they follow him into the mine and he turns round and he's not got a face at all </u>
<u who="nf5413">well there's the # the sort of genre there of the horror genre thank you thank you your table your </u>
<u who="sf5435">shall i read out what we've got </u>
<u who="nf5413">yeah you read out what you've got</u>
<u who="sf5435">the figure was coming from the shadow the moonlight beyond the wooden <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> he's coming nearer said Nick the hair stood up on the back of their necks and they shivered in fear a voice spoke from the gloom what are you doing here</u>
<u who="sf5436">it doesn't make sense</u>
<u who="nf5413">yes yes # and again they've got lots of ideas and they've been doing some drafting for it but just at one point let's all just get our ideas down because they were spending time talking so that process of thinking and planning is is very very important there what about your your table at the back</u>
<u who="sf5437">i'll do it yeah</u>
<u who="su">yeah</u>
<u who="sf5437">he carried a long handled implement that glinted in the moonlight illuminating the darting movement of his eyes he glided <trunc>effortl</trunc>  effortlessly towards us we stood frozen desperate to run but too curious to move the only noise we could hear was the pounding of our hearts echoing in our ears suddenly he was upon us as his face appeared from out of the shadows we realised who it was <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/></u>
<u who="nf5413">lovely and again it's picking up that that nice <trunc>at</trunc> atmosphere of the language your table</u>
<u who="su">the figure moved over the ground the shovel glinting in the moonlight Charlie's brother was at last going to find his brother's body and be able to lay him to rest</u>
<u who="su">that's nice</u>
<u who="nf5413">tell us how you got got to there with your planning <vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" dur="2"/></u>
<u who="sf5417">well we started off by thinking that the caretaker saw the children go out and went out to find out what they were doing and then decided that it wasn't ata ll what we wanted then we decided that # the caretaker could be # not Charlie at all but the children would think he's Charlie so then we think maybe he the caretaker was going out just to find some gold or he was burying his cat or he was working on his vegetable patch and then we decided that that wasn't a very good idea so then we decided that maybe he could be Charlie and we didn't like that either so then we decided it was Charlie's brother and that he was looking for his brother</u>
<u who="nf5413">you see what sort of planning went into that they did a sort of a bubble diagram didn't you of all your ideas so lots and lots of speaking and listening # from different groups went into those ideas if you did this with children you would have to think if and when you wanted to finish the actual story with them whether you wanted to do that as a class or whether you gave it them to read at home what you wouldn't want to do is make them think that their ending was in any way inferior to the one that's been published in fact it might be better so you have to be quite careful i'll read it to you before the end of the afternoon there's only a page left so we'll come we'll come back to that what i want you to do now is to do a group activity and because of time i'm going to ask you to just # for you to be group one and i'll bring you the stuff in a minute you to be group two group three <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> and you can be group five </u>

<u who="nf5413">alright this is one of the stories this is Sam's Duck and it was also published as a picture story book so that that makes sense with what i actually want you to do if i can have those back at the end</u>
<gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/>
<u who="sf5422">shall we have a look at the picture book first</u>
<u who="sf5421">yeah do you want to read it out</u>
<u who="sf5422">it's a long story isn't it its not a short story</u>
<u who="su">not really</u>
<u who="sm5414">we could read a couple of if we read a few pages each a page each or something that's six pages</u>
<u who="nf5413">come on then this is one of the stories the son's death and we've also published as a picture story book so that makes sense of what i actually want to do if i could have those back at the end</u>

<gap reason="new phase of event" extent="uncertain"/>
<u who="sf5436">its not really a story though is it</u>
<u who="sf5438">no no it says though write part of a play based on the story so it could be something completely different imagine the kids doing the next step it doesn't have to be use the story take one page of it because it just says to write and perform part of a play based on it so you're doing a little mini-play so you can <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> so you can confuse the idea of the story</u>
<u who="su">so shall we do two rival gangs</u>

<u who="sf5429">mm because they haven't got one and they want one</u>
<u who="sf5431">we don't need as caretaker</u>
<u who="su">no we don't need a caretaker</u>
<u who="su">do you need a narrator</u>
<u who="su">yes unless you want to learn a big pile of lines you need someone to set the scene</u>
<u who="su">you're not listening to my point of view</u>
<u who="su">i think you need a narrator you need a scene setter you don't want to be there learning lines</u>
<u who="su">who wants to be the narrator</u>
<u who="su">i don't mind being the narrator</u>
<u who="su">what's she going to say more importantly</u>
<u who="su">setting the scene of two rival gangs like Romeo and Juliet</u>
<u who="su">will we have dialogue</u>
<u who="su">right so can we say that again so i can copy it</u>
<u who="su">Sheila's obviously a gang leader</u>

<u who="su">maybe you can say kind of go away go away</u>
<u who="nf5413">alright i'm going to very reluctantly stop you there <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> now i've given you five activities and # one of those as you can see is directly related to the S-A-Ts because this one of the stories NO More School in fact the lead story is set as one of the S-A-T questions at key stage two so we're hearing from this table about the kinds of things that were asked of that so as you can see they put it as a book for ten eleven year olds # the kind of activities though i hope are generic and the sort of ones that you could use # with with # children year five year six as as appropriate would you like to just start and give us the sort of gist of what you did and the kind of things you you found</u>
<u who="sf5436"># okay we were looking at # opening sentences so we looked through them and decided which one we though was the most engaging and which one we felt that we would most want to read # then we got to the Sam stuff the sentence Sam is a person of very few words so when he said it was all brilliant we knew he really meant it # we thought that is it going to be a mystery what was he talking about what was brilliant # so and we were looking at that <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> okay so the style of writing is the first person narrative so you get your class to discuss this get them to tell you parts of it and get them to tell you how its written who who's telling the story and then how they would tell their own story if they were using the same technique in telling the first person or would they be an like an omniscient narrator then # we looked at the grammar and we looked at # what tense it was written in what does this tell us about the story about what's happening when it's happened and then # looked at the plot how it engages the reader so does the sentence # make you want to read the rest of it # and then they could use it as a model to get them to write their own opening sentence maybe with a mystery in it as well get them to try and use the same idea and then <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> the characters because obviously you've got the person in there and you've got the narrator so talk about that and how in their own story they could introduce characters <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> differently and then do you think it is effective and why so basically do they like it <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/></u>
<u who="nf5413">that's a super analysis there well done that table # the things you could do with the children you might actually make a poster of those opening sentences and put it up in your writing area so they could see them and have them as sort of story starters that they could use themselves very good thank you which leads us nicely on to Sandra you chose Sam's Duck as your favourite opening this table looked at the language differences between the version of Sam's Duck in this book and the picture story book version # and they spent quite a bit of time reading the picture story version they decided they wanted to do that first so they read it together what did you do then</u>
<u who="su">we sort of skimmed through the proper <trunc>b</trunc>  short story book which was went into much more detail # and we thought the picture book we could probably use with year two to year three</u>
<u who="su">yeah as young as year two</u>
<u who="su">but also but that # the short story was probably more year five</u>
<u who="ss">five</u>
<u who="su">and it would be quite interesting for the older children to do a comparison between the two because the picture book is quite long it's quite meaty really but # we though we could do it over a week with year two and #</u>
<u who="nf5413">yes mm</u>
<u who="su">we felt like doing things like reading up to a certain point in this one and then with the # year fours and year fives i mean and then reading up to the same point in the longer version and seeing if you find out anything more what what else do you find out from reading the longer version what does the description tell you and also the value of the pictures in Sam's Duck even though the writing even though the writing's abridged do you get more from the pictures do you learn just as much <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/></u>
<u who="nf5413">that's an interesting one and i this short story doesn't actually does does it give you a description of Sam do you know he's a black boy</u>
<u who="ss">no i don't think so no there's not enough no</u>
<u who="nf5413">interrupts: i don't think you do so it's looking at choices made by illustrators as well so don't you know i've told you before you know picture story books are not just for key stage one there's some as you say that one is meaty and there's some interesting work on comparisons you can do there do you prefer one to the other</u>
<u who="su">i think the pictures are just gorgeous really </u>
<u who="su">its a really nice book</u>
<u who="su">we read that one properly though but we didn't read this one properly to be fair but </u>
<u who="nf5413">and we'll make sure that we order six copies of that for the library the story book as well as the other one so that they are there for you if you want to borrow it on placement thankyou very much the S-A-T-S table</u>
<u who="su">okay # we were looking # at S-A-T-S papers for No More School # and we'll short of give a short presentation on S-A-T-S procedure the types of questions that children are asked and the reading knowledge that they need for it and # then generally our views so the first one procedure sorry # the procedure # they really need to read # the texts in the booklet and then answer the questions in the booklet # and they are allowed to refer back and they get forty-five minutes to do so # or they get fifteen minutes to read the book first and then they get forty-five minutes to answer it but they are allowed to refer back to the books and the questions # in the book actually tells some of the children where to find it what page to look on so it's not like they've always got to read the whole thing through again # it'll says things like # see page six and things like that # the type of questions they have to answer in several ways because they've got short answers several line answer questions long answers and multiple choice answers # and it it's illustrated in the book which answers they are required to give # by the amount of space they are given so if they're given a few lines they are obviously meant to fill those lines and if they're they've got the multiple choice they just like circle whichever one's the right answer # the skills or the knowledge that they need from the book # they are tested on their comprehension whether they know the plot and they can describe the character analysis why do you think this why do you think that can they give reasons for answer to back up the text opinion # again can they drawn on evidence to give their own opinions # and their general knowledge they are asked at the end if they were to rename the book what sort of book they would call it # and again they would have to give an explanation as to why they think the book should be called that # going on to our views # # yeah we were asked about # this kind of reading task for assessing children's reading # we said it was quite a # big comprehension task really it's asking for an analysis of the text all the time # so you'd probably need to work on comprehension and drawing on knowledge from texts with the children # it shows progression from understanding and their reading about texts so it slowly it builds up from being multiple choice questions # to the last few questions where they are asked to give their own opinion and to draw results from that it tests their own ability to formulate their own opinion which could be quite challenging for some children # and also we think that its quite a short time allowed for children to read the book i mean it's quite a few pages # there's two bits to it the first bit is one two three four five six seven eight pages long which is probably <trunc>qui</trunc>  plus the extra bit that's quite a lot for them to read in fifteen minutes # so you'd probably need to teach them cause obviously you can't change the exam book you'd need to teach them skim reading skills and how to draw information from the task or from a piece of text in a short period of time</u>
<u who="nf5413">thank you very much we'll be looking at the testing arrangements in year three in a lot more detail but that's a very good analysis thank you of the kinds of # complex information that is required and the the questions asked and indeed you need to ensure these children are are are really taught well in order to be able to do this successfully when you go into school on placement next term do ask about the testing arrangements and if you have a chance of working with the teacher doing any assessment do do take advantage and and do that thank you very much now the table who looked at the cloze procedure questions can you tell us a little but about how you did that what i did for you was to choose a paragraph and i omitted words different kinds of words sometimes nouns sometimes verbs sometimes prepositions # a range of words # and asked them to go ahead and put them back in so how did you get on</u>
<u who="sf5435"># well i'll talk to you and Amy and Becky were doing it and # the way that they did it was one of them would suggest something and the other one would either argue or agree and most of the time most of the time # they knew that there had to be a verb in there # so if it was like the past tense they knew that there had to be a past tense very</u>
<u who="nf5413">yes</u>
<u who="sf5435">such as <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> began to wish </u>
<u who="nf5413">using their syntactic knowledge then you see</u>
<u who="sf5435">yeah they knew that when it said Kevin blank a first year in his local blank they knew that # the the thing of the story was school so they knew how to be related to school but then it was suggested that maybe it was a particular school because # if it was the first year he's got to be quite an old first year to be in in this sort of context of this story so we just left it as school # there was words such as enjoyed that were added in but that could have been used for anything it could have been enjoyed or liked or something like that but they chose the most interesting one # there was one bit where it wasn't very clear there was a bit of a disagreement about what it meant because the first second paragraph says it started one day before Easter and they both someone suggested day so it started one day before Easter but one of them thought it meant one day as in Easter Saturday before Easter and everyone thought it just meant one day as in one day in a period before this time so there was discussion over that # a lot of the time they read ahead and then went back to see what would fit in and they left one of the ones at the end of the first paragraph to the end of the second paragraph right and that's about it yeah</u>
<u who="nf5413">right okay so we've said its # its you've definitely used your knowledge of syntax your knowledge of semantics you know the meaning of the story # strategies reading ahead # any other particular strategies Jane </u>
<u who="sf5437">well i was just listening to the other two and what was quite uncanny is that they did it # purely by reaction # that when we if there was any discussion they didn't say something like it has to be a verb because but they both knew that it needed to be a verb so it was sort of instinctive</u>
<u who="nf5413"><trunc>implic</trunc> just that sort of implicit knowledge</u>
<u who="sf5437">it was instinctive yes and the other strange thing is that # although they got a lot of it by instinct once they went back and and read through and then started to think about it more on one occasion they actually changed something which was correct to a word which was incorrect the first time they got it right on instinct but the second time when they were thinking about it they thought about it a bit too much it would have been better to go with the instinct but in school # it must be a fantastic assessment tool to see how well children read because you you can't do it if you're not well read can you </u>
<u who="nf5413">yes yes absolutely this is one of the values of using closed i think especially if you've got the teacher there you can use it as a sort of a guided activity and you can make notes on these kinds of things you you learn so much about how the children read # it's very very useful to do that and you can if you like omit all the same typw of words you can omit all the verbs or all the adverbs if you feel it's going to test their reading in different ways # or make them read ahead or read back so i do i do think it its a <trunc>use</trunc>  very useful activity to think about # in terms of formative assessment and in terms of getting the children to talk about their reading and discuss the strategies they use thank you very much that group # now the final group had another short story called The Ballet quite a short one and you can see why i asked you to do i don't know how far you got because it's quite a demanding thing i asked of you but just tell us how far you got so far and what sort of things you did</u>
<u who="sf5429">well we started off by # looking at the passage and then we decided which part we'd actually like to focus upon and we all found a bit where we could all be involved so that was the the # whatever can't think of the word yeah so we chose a part which was interesting and that we could explore as well and then we assigned characters because we knew what <trunc>pe</trunc> each of them were like and we looked at the thing again and we decided on having a narrator who could set the scene because we needed to have an opening and then we didn't get very far unfortunately </u>
<u who="nf5413">no</u>
<u who="sf5429">but we decided that this was what we were going to do </u>
<u who="sf5428">write the opening</u>
<u who="sf5429">yeah but the opening was brilliant because there were so many opportunities and possibilities for this sort of activity we were looking at you know sort of the literacy hour you know it could either be an opening activity something that the children would enjoy and then it could go on and be extended to a certain child and # do all sorts of other things with it</u>
<u who="sf5417">we could use we could use the themes that were brought up in the story to # open discussions within the classroom # like William # you see we've got two rival gangs and so you could discuss gangs and # we also thought you could bring in history into the second one </u>
<u who="su">because it happens in a football field <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/></u>
<u who="sf5417">you could you could ask the children to become certain characters and try and think about how that character would have felt at that time # so we thought # you could use it in lots of different ways and that's wy we didn't get too far because <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> one thing that's very hard to control</u>
<u who="sf5430">because they were sort of trying to play out their own war scenes so that's why the games would help</u>
<u who="nf5413">and all that sort of discussion and getting into the heads of those characters would be a very valued activity in history in English in drama in the literacy hour</u>
<u who="sf5417">and they'd enjoy performing something that they'd written at the end or the end of the week depending on how much time they had</u>
<u who="nf5413">yes indeed</u>
<u who="sf5417">it would give them a sense of achievement as well</u>
<u who="nf5413">it would and if you've got a video camera in the classroom you could video them i mean you were all videoed a little bit doing your did did you find that it changed the nature of what you were doing or might have done if you'd been making a presentatioin yeah i think i think it does so when you get into the classroom you may well have a video camera use it use it make use of it we're about we're right on time but i just wonder if if you could spare one minute and since Jamie's got a copy of the book i'm going to pick on her and ask her if she'd open page seventy about a third of the way down we just have time to finish reading you the last little bit of the story so you know what happens with Charlie</u>
<u who="sf5438"><reading>so there coming directly towards us along the road that led to the bungalows was the solitary figure Charlie i whispered it must be Charlie Nick said nothing we were both paralysed with fear and couldn't move the figure was now a bit closer i strained my eyes trying to make out more details of the ghost where was the shovel and why had we not heard the cough then the answer came it's Mr Anderson Nick hissed and he's going to see us it is possible that the housemaster heard Nick for he suddenly stopped and looked about him we had dropped down at the edge of an irrigation ditch and this is probably what saved the day for us he saw us all right but i think that he only saw half of us or perhaps even only half of one of us and at that very moment that he gave a start and peered in our direction fumbling to switch on his torch Nick deliberately gave a cough it was the cough that did it Mr Anderson's arm shot up in the air and the torch fell to the ground with a thud then uttering the most extraordinary cry of alarm the terrified housemaster ran as fast as he could up towards the bungalows and safety Nick and i stayed where we were for a few moments he thought you were i began Charlie finished Nick and then we laughed and our muffled laughter continued all the way back to the boarding house Mr Anderson always had breakfast with us and Nick and i studied him closely the next morning as he sat at the head of one of the refectory tables he seemed thoughtful and Nick and i exchanged glances later that day Mr Anderson took us for a geography lesson and afterwards as we were packing up our books Nick went up to his desk and spoke to him do you # believe in ghosts sir i watched Mr Anderson's expression very closely and knew that the question had surprised him ghosts he said too jovially of course i don't are you sure sir Nick went on it's just that people say there's an old mine around here they call him Charlie Mr Anderson rose to his feet come come Nick don't you worry about this Charlie he's quite harmless i'm sure so you do believe in him after all then crowed Nick he added you haven't seen him have you Sir Mr Anderson was silent i thought he looked a little bit pale well he faltered and then Nick produced Mr Anderson's torch i think this is yours sir you dropped it after you saw Charlie the housemaster's jaw sagged then very slowly he took the torch and slipped it into his pocket i knew then that he understood what had happened and i waited anxiously to see what he could do we could get into serious trouble for having been out at night but then if we were punished people would know that Mr Anderson had run away from a ghost let's just forget all about it said Mr Anderson smiling you agree not to go out when you shouldn't and i'll agree to being a bit braver if i ever see the real Charlie agreed said Nick</reading></u>
<u who="nf5413">thank you Jamie well read thank you very much thank you everyone very much if you leave your books over there</u>
