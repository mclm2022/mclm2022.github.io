<u who="nm5477">we're gonna seek to sort of integrate well pull all together the module basically and also to make evidence of all modules that you've been involved with in essence what we are gonna do as part of a production simulation exercise which is <trunc>base</trunc> which is software based and based on computers next door which when <trunc>w</trunc> when it comes to making decisions about how we are gonna run a business we go next door and use the simulation package but in essence what we've really got the tools that you've now become <trunc>con</trunc> conversant with and for the rest of these seminar sessions you'll be using # in isolation we're gonna seek to use them all together with the end aim of running a business profitably running a manufacturing business as effectively and as profitably as we both <trunc>ca</trunc> as we all can do as we <trunc>men</trunc> as Morag mentioned earlier what we are really striving to do is satisfy the four requirements right product right place right time right cost and the tools that we're gonna utilise or we hope to utilise in order to satisfy those four aims and objectives are in are ensconced in the production simulation exercise we are gonna make decisions regarding capacity what capacity we have and how we use it we are gonna make decisions about inventory and in inventory with the things like raw materials sub-assemblies work in progress and finished goods and are we gonna be making decisions with your inventory levels your inventory strategy and how you utilise that inventory and also your delivery performance are you going to satisfy customers all of the time or are you gonna fall victim to the cost trade off and only satisfy the more profitable end of our business so <trunc>w</trunc> we are really gonna be looking at using those three tools to satisfy the four primary objectives that we talked about in the class okay the simulation background we are gonna be making or you are gonna be making in syndicates of i guess of four we're gonna be making aerials locomotive aerials okay and basically there's the simulation background working in groups of four syndicates of four the you're gonna be running a business it's gonna be your company and you run it as you see fit okay the decisions you make will be your decisions rightly or wrongly the consequences of those decisions the effectiveness of those decisions the results of those decisions will be your business's okay now really in each trading period for this manufacturing business you're gonna be concerned with making four key decisions the quantities to manufacture the volumes to produce in terms of inventory and raw materials what you're gonna buy and when you're gonna buy it your resource allocation how many people you're going to utilise how many shifts you're going to utilise what percentage of the factory you're gonna utilise really your all your four key resources how you're going to allocate them and where you're going to allocate them and the costs involved with doing that and also at later levels when we start to trade to trade <trunc>prof</trunc> profitably you're gonna have the opportunity to do some money management to invest in to shift money around various accounts all this based on software next door the game will be split into two levels or the simulation will be split in two levels the first level is really to lead you into the game so the decisions you make are not too catastrophic the decisions you make don't have a major major impact on your later effectiveness to run the business we appreciate you're gonna be learning as you're going through the game however later levels increase we're gonna play two levels the first level what you <trunc>sa</trunc> your decisions what you say you're gonna make you actually make what you say you're gonna purchase you actually receive quite obviously in the real world that is not always the case if you schedule to manufacture one hundred things happen you have scrap rates <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 word"/> reject rates test requirements so you have to allow for that sort of an occurrence in your inventory planning in your production planning some later levels increase some general information general information about the business and i guess you've all got the # within the manual you've got or if not we can give you a a broad outline of the various costs et cetera associated with running this business there is some general some general business information you have you have procured each syndicate has purchased a business okay that business cost you three-hundred-eighteen-thousand pounds for the company so you've spent three-hundred-eighteen-thousand pounds to gain this business and in this business you've got the good will the hardware the software the plant the machinery the lease hold et cetera et cetera you've arranged and agreed an overdraft of five-hundred-thousand pounds with with a lender typically a bank quite obviously do not exceed that overdraft except with the permission of myself or Kostas okay I will tell you now if you need to exceed that overdraft you're not running your business well okay the software will actually tell you if you are going overdrawn it will flash red lights at you and tell you that things are not as they should be each of the four syndicates are not directly competing with each other so for <trunc>argu</trunc> arguments sake if we have syndicates one two three and four the actions of syndicate four do not impact on the actions or the results of syndicate one vice versa they're not linked however that is not to say that we cannot compare and contrast the various results of each syndicate in actual fact we do that so we will compare the the effectiveness and efficiency and if you like the skill of how you run run <trunc>you</trunc> this business okay but the results are not linked at all okay so you're not directly competing with each other but we can but we can compare contrast and the results of each group each syndicate each company any orders that you miss so for argument's sake if you've failed to satisfy a given customer those orders are gone forever they are not carried over to subsequent weeks following weeks more than that quite obviously if you miss an order to a customer the cost to you is not simply the cost of that missed order so if you've miss an order for one-hundred-thousand pounds for argument's sake the actual cost is not the hundred-thousand that you've missed because there's obviously an add-on and bolt-on opportunity cost of the chances of that customer every calling back to you so in the simulation we actually penalise you for missing an order so every time you miss an order you will see penalty costs occur those penalty costs are twelve percent of the value of the order okay so if you miss an order for one-hundred-thousand pounds you will be penalised twelve-thousand pounds and that <trunc>cr</trunc> and that money will be taken from your account your trading accounts okay credit on a single transfer is instantaneous basically when you decide to buy something or pay somebody or sell something that transfer is instantaneous as soon as you say yes, i'm gonna purchase it or yes i'm gonna sell it <trunc>tran</trunc> the transfer is instantaneous material you procure and agree to buy arrives on a Monday morning so it can be used in that week's manufacturing so if you if you buy a previous week to arrive in the coming week you can use it as soon as it arrives it arrives on a Monday and you can use it as of Monday we're not getting involved with things like goods on goods inspection acclimatization or anything like that what you produce that week during that week that week is available for collection for your customers on the Saturday so what you produce that week can be sold that week okay what we are gonna get you to do at the end of the end of <trunc>th</trunc> the module the end of on Friday afternoon Friday morning stroke afternoon we're going to get you to give a presentation the aims and objectives of that presentation is to give you the opportunity to reflect on what you did well what you did badly what you've learnt from the exercise and really if you were to run the exercise again what would you do differently because in essence that's what learning is all about isn't it so we give a presentation at the end what i want you to do in the short term Kostas is gonna pass around some financial details about the business we ultimately will ask you fill in a decision sheet okay and that decision sheet will contain the following information we are gonna ask you to break into syndicates and call <trunc>you</trunc> and give yourselves a company name as all companies need to do in order to <trunc>pr</trunc> protect your financial dealings you need a password i'll <trunc>as</trunc> i'll ask one if i only ask one thing of you the one thing i will ask is don't forget your password make it a password every member of the group can remember because if we cannot get in we cannot retrieve the information so you need to have a password the team can remember don't forget it the financial transactions don't worry too much about those in the early days you haven't got any money to transfer around you've borrowed money you have a negative overdraft <trunc>you</trunc> you've got no money to sort of transfer across so <trunc>tha</trunc> that first part is not an issue to you the first two or three weeks the orders you're gonna place the aerial consists of three constituent parts the aerial assembly the finished product consists of three constituent parts it consists of a main body a central aerial and accessories nuts and bolts and washers et cetera you need to place orders for those you need to <trunc>de</trunc> describe also to decide what you're gonna produce and when you're gonna produce it days you can produce five-thousand maximum on days so you can assemble five-thousand so if you have five-thousand accessories in stock five-thousand aerials and five-thousand main bodies you legitimately can manufacture five-thousand on days if you want to produce extra or alternatively you wanna work nights only you can <trunc>manu</trunc> manufacture three five-hundred maximum capacity on nights is three five-hundred evenings we have a capacity of two-hundred-fifty per evening shift and you can work five evening shifts so you can produce a maximum of a thousand two fifty on an evening shift Saturday morning shifts we have a capacity of six-hundred okay when you bought the business you not only bought the good will of the business you actually bought some stock you actually bought some inventory so in stock you have already from starting in week one eleven-thousand units of main bodies thirteen-thousand units of aerials and twelve-thousand units of accessories finished stock you have four-thousand units so that's the working stock you've got so quite obviously if the demand of the first week of your trading is below four-thousand you can satisfy it with your stock no penalties if the demand for the first week of trading happens to be four-thousand-one units you will suffer the penalty of one unit 'cause you haven't got it you haven't manufactured anything what we are gonna do in the short term folks Kostas and i <trunc>wi</trunc> will between the four groups Kostas and i will be floating around asking answering any questions you may have and i'm sure you'll have one or two questions about the various costs and trade-offs et cetera the first thing i'm gonna ask you to do within the next twenty minutes is i'm gonna split you into your teams i want you to select the team name okay the trading name as i'm fully aware that you tend to sit by your friends and colleagues and like-minded people i'm gonna try and get to to sort of break the ice a little bit as it's the second session of the day so i'm gonna split the teams for you i'm gonna i'll do that quite randomly i'm gonna <trunc>na</trunc> label you off into teams one to four team one can go to that bench there, team two to that bench team three to that bench and team four to this bench so if you go around the room team one team two team three team four team one team two team three team four you team one two three Alex team four team one team two team three team four okay can i invite you to get into your various syndicates then folks decide what your team's name is gonna be when you've decided on your team name have a <trunc>bri</trunc> have a brief discussion about your objectives aims and strategy okay # and set yourself a target for team name within ten minutes so you have ten minutes to decide on your team name and then a further tenor fifteen minutes at most to discuss your general strategy okay <gap reason="new phase of event" extent="uncertain"/> can i just have your attention for two minutes guys what i'm asking what i'm asking you to <trunc>des</trunc> # to decide your your organisation # your business objectives and strategy do you all understand the difference between the strategy and objectives</u>
<u who="su">yeah i do put very very simply the strategy is the strategy is what you want to achieve what you want to do or the objective is what you want to do what you want to achieve the strategy is how you're gonna do it okay and also what measures up what you'll use to monitor your performance how are you gonna measure yourselves against what you want to do how are you gonna measure yourselves against your strategy are you doing it are <trunc>y</trunc> are you achieving or are you likely to achieve your aims and objectives how are you gonna measure it okay so if you are for <trunc>argum</trunc> just as a just as an example if your aim if your aim your objectives # or your strategy whatever is to satisfy customers one-hundred percent of the time all of the time how are you gonna measure your performance against that well quite obviously the number of overdue orders is a good measure in this instance penalty costs would be a good measure okay if your aim objectives or strategy is to minimise costs of the product quite obviously monitoring the unit cost on a week by week basis is a good measure of that performance okay so can you all come up with at least one but preferably two aims and objectives and a strategy that you're gonna utilise to achieve those aims and objectives okay in the next ten minutes <gap reason="new phase of event" extent="uncertain"/> okay guys the four company names the four companies in competition this week are Air Dynamic Incorporated very very innovative a name <vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" dur="2"/> What You Ask Is What You Get Arial tech and Sagapo and i take that Sagapo means something in Greece Kostas</u>

<u who="su">yeah, yeah </u>
<u who="nm5477">the software will tell you the unit cost of your products which is indicative of the <trunc>u</trunc> your resource utilisation if the unit cost is sixty seventy eighty pounds the full resources haven't been as used well as if your unit cost is below forty the product sells for forty-five pounds obviously you're looking at a unit cost of ideally below forty so utilisation resource utilisation may be <trunc>bet</trunc> a a good measure may be unit cost average unit cost sale </u>

<u who="su">which are delivered from </u>

<u who="sm5482">the first one is to increase customer satisfaction profitably. </u>
<u who="sf5489">in the first objective </u>
<u who="nm5478">the first objective is increase satisfaction profitably </u>
<u who="ss">yeah </u>
<u who="nm5478">pro-, alright so how do you achieve this through objectives </u>
<u who="sm5482">The strategy we're going to follow is maximum delivery </u>
<u who="nm5478">delivery yeah </u>
<u who="sm5482">second # strategy provide quality goods </u>

<u who="nm5477"><gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 word"/> the unit costs are measured there </u>
<u who="nm5478">okay </u>

<u who="nm5478">sales performance </u>
<u who="nm5477">how do you quantify <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 word"/> how are you going to quantify making a penalty cost you need to quantify sales performance sales performance is a subjective thing isn't it so how are you gonna quantify it</u>
<u who="sm5482">the perspective of the <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 word"/> also </u>
<u who="nm5478">okay so you took the monitoring or measuring and maybe penalty costs or overdue orders </u>
<u who="su">yeah could be </u>
<gap reason="inaudible" extent="3 sec"/>
<u who="su">yeah </u>
<u who="nm5477">or missed orders </u>
<u who="sm5482">alright </u>
<u who="nm5478"><gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 word"/> other </u>
<u who="ss"><gap reason="inaudible" extent="uncertain"/> </u>
<u who="nm5478">you haven't finished sorry <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 word"/> </u>

<u who="sm5482"><gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 word"/> strategies each strategy is going to # <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 word"/> </u>
<u who="nm5478">that's okay it's alright </u>
<u who="nm5477">that's fine we are just going to put some points here so on the way that you play the game or the method of the game </u>
<u who="su">okay </u>
<u who="nm5478">on on on the book on the e <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 word"/> play the game on the mid of the e of the game we're gonna see if you change <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 word"/> any of these okay you are just gonna have an indication of what was the beginning and what it takes # okay</u>
<u who="nm5477">you see it's it's there will inevitably be a conflict of interests in it's it's very very difficult almost impossible to have two objectives or two strategies that you say we are going to satisfy customers one-hundred percent of the time all of the time but we are not going to carry an inventory they are not compatible you know yeah so we <trunc>sh</trunc> all we want all we want to do is to enable you guys to reflect back in a couple of days' time and say put it in perspective and say okay our initial aims and objectives were probably a bit ambitious or we were overlooking and we didn't go back two days in hindsight and if you like contextualise it or put it in context that's useful to you okay</u>
<u who="nm5478">so # second team </u>
<u who="sm5479">yeah our objective is to increase profitably <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 word"/> </u>
<u who="nm5478">alright</u>
<u who="su">and the second objective is to increase market share understanding is that what we are going to borrow is effective inventory management second objective is to effective utilisation of resources</u>

<u who="nm5478">how about the right time <vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" dur="2"/> is it alright </u>
<u who="su">delivery </u>

<u who="sm5484">it's both to arrive or not to arrive <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 word"/> </u>
<u who="nm5478">because delivery can be the right time or the right </u>
<u who="sm5484">it's both </u>
<u who="nm5478">alright how do you measure this </u>
<u who="sm5484">measurements the fastest net profit cash flow and # the cost of penalties for <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 word"/> missed orders in in units and money </u>
<u who="nm5478">in units and money okay alright you are gonna see the # how how many orders you miss and then this translates to penalties to to money in notes okay and the # </u>

<u who="sf5490">The objectives are increased profit and satisfy the customers with our time deliveries and # the strategy is # the first one is the minimising # inventory because of the cost of the # inventory and # second one is # our preferences to to viewers in <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 word"/> because is cheaper </u>
<u who="nm5478">yeah </u>
<u who="sf5490">And the third one is increasing # the sale mm the size productions </u>
<u who="nm5478">alright </u>

<u who="su">on time </u>
<u who="nm5478">units on time okay and then # about this # producing basis don't take it for granted because for many of you it's not # possible to <trunc>sat</trunc> to satisfy <trunc>th</trunc> <trunc>the</trunc> the units the demands # with only five-thousand units sometimes it is possible sometimes it's not # cash flow cash flow is very important is the most important thing in the company a company can run with losses but cannot run with no cash if you get # in <trunc>ma</trunc> a lot of times negative in your cash flow and in this case your negative maybe below of the five-thousand pounds that you have in loan then the company belongs to the bank that gave the money and you take holidays <vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" dur="2"/> okay so try <trunc>t</trunc> to figure out how not to exceed these limits but the the # objectives and the strategy to success on this game are there the right points are there the question is how you're gonna to make this reality on the game and how you're gonna make on the end money profits okay </u>
<gap reason="new phase of event" extent="uncertain"/>
<u who="nm5477">okay guys decision making quite obviously you're faced with the decisions that we pointed out earlier you have a green decision sheet in front of you that looks something like that okay as you can see from the decision sheet we're currently trading in week thirteen so you have bought the business at the end of week twelve okay what information you have to help you make the decision well quite obviously we are not a made-to-order organisation we have to build the inventory in the anticipation of selling it so we are a made-to-stock organisation if you haven't got it in stock you cannot sell it okay i'm going to go through all the decisions you need to make and the starting status so okay what information do you have to help you make your first decision what do you have in order to make if you like to make your first your first forecast you have last year's a past issue of last year's demand last year's sales history which is attached <trunc>a</trunc> as an as an appendices to the to the first page and also you have this year's first twelve weeks demand  okay so you have a historic profile of past demand and if you remember when we talked about forecasting and we spoke about forecasting being one of two # particularly # objective or <trunc>quantif</trunc> quantifiable forecasting we talked about objective forecasting and the extrapolating or casting forward past histories of demand and even be what's called a moving average or aggregating the past demand or following the trend or # # trend analysis both techniques or both systems might be of use it's for you to decide which is most appropriate or if in fact objective forecasting is at all appropriate it may be that you deem that the demand is so sporadic so unpredictable that an intuitive # subjective approach to forecasting may be better it's for you to decide what i will ask of you is in by a quarter to five is that gonna be long enough</u>
<u who="ss">yeah</u>
<u who="nm5477">yeah within twenty-five minutes can i ask you to have the first decision made okay the first decision made for four-forty-five with those filled in forget the first two you've got no money to invest you can't you can't do anything with the with the the financial transactions the only decisions here that really concern me you need to decide how many main bodies you're going to order how many aerials # aerials you're going to order how many accessories you're going to order, accessories have a two week lead time aerials and main bodies have got a one week lead time you need to decide what you are gonna produce and when you're gonna produce it maximum five-thousand on days three-thousand-five-hundred at night or having differing costs and that's your opening inventory status so for four-forty-five twenty-five minutes to go can i ask you to fill in the front sheet of the green forms you have the first decision sheet we'll then we'll then take you next door and we'll key in that data into simulation and we'll see how well or otherwise you did in your decision okay go</u>
<gap reason="new phase of event" extent="uncertain"/>
<u who="sm5484"><gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 word"/> we should be able to meet that demand you'll be too late if we start planning in week seventeen for week eighteen when we expect a peak so what i'm saying we need enough build up any but for now so as far as we are concerned probably the demands from right here in this range keeping with this trend [mm] and that's it as far as this week is concerned [mm] probably less slowly we will increase the production rate and probably just three weeks before this peak here we will start planning for this</u>

<u who="nm5477">it within level two yeah we don't introduce that yet </u>
<u who="sm5484">we have enough to sell three-thousand </u>

<u who="sm5484">yeah yeah </u>
<u who="sm5485">yeah you can see that because over here <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> and then we gonna be around that the same level <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 word"/> we do week fourteen and seven <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 word"/> we are at a low level so that there's no idea for a start <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 word"/> and the # build up is gonna be less if you see <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 word"/> only for this period because after this peak we alw we are gonna be changed with something like that</u>

<u who="sm5485">yeah yeah </u>
<u who="sm5486">so can we remedy this situation </u>
<u who="sm5484"><gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 word"/> we are gonna have this kind of fluctuation that's only as far as sales is concerned i can only <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 word"/> </u>

<u who="sm5485">let's see how much of it we have because by by week fourteen this <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 word"/> main body is gonna be a finished product <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 word"/> <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 word"/> </u>

<u who="sm5484"><gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 word"/> week fourteen <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 word"/> so depending on <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 word"/> eleven-thousand <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 word"/> under a value of one-thousand <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 word"/> i'm saying inventory of raw materials </u>
<u who="sm5485">yeah but the point i'm trying to make is why you sum <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 word"/> </u>
<u who="sm5484">you can actually produce nine-thousand in one week you have the capacity to produce nine-thousand but you don't have the materials <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 word"/> what i'm saying is that the cost of <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 word"/> inventory <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 word"/> yeah so value is forty-five multiplied by some quantity i'll <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 word"/> three five-hundred <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 word"/> into forty-five it's only seven-hundred-seventy-seven <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 word"/> whereas in day shift night <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 word"/> it's twenty-one-thousand</u>
<u who="su">probably</u>
<u who="sm5484">no problem <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 word"/> so # will be con <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 word"/> so the end of the day we take nine-thousand <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 word"/> the order we don't know we estimating <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 word"/> ten-thousand <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 word"/> let's see </u>
<u who="sm5481"><gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 word"/> so minus sixty-five that's for week fifteen <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 word"/> i'd say that's six-thousand exactly <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 word"/> so week fifteen <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 word"/> </u>
