<u who="nf1091"> anyway so there was Professor Guillebaud and he was explaining that <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> the <trunc>contra</trunc> and <pause dur="0.2"/> see <unclear>well</unclear> again he wasn't being terribly well understood <pause dur="0.4"/> because <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> Humphries had a set of questions he was supposed to ask this unfortunate man <pause dur="0.5"/> and he was going to ask them regardless of what it turned out this guy had actually been saying so it went in the usual way of try the guy's trying to make point A <pause dur="0.6"/> and Humphries is asking question X <pause dur="0.7"/> and there's just no way that point A and question X can be got into the same ballpark <pause dur="0.8"/> and what <pause dur="0.5"/> Guillebaud's great idea was he actually said i mean <pause dur="0.2"/> it's just like doctor speak he is a doctor i might say <pause dur="0.6"/> # he said well you know <pause dur="0.3"/> most people try to be good <pause dur="1.1"/> but they don't always succeed so we're going to try and help them <pause dur="0.4"/> take care of things when they're not being so very good <pause dur="0.4"/> most <trunc>pe</trunc> we're going to help them be careful was what he was saying <pause dur="0.4"/> and i thought <pause dur="0.6"/> how on earth do you decide <pause dur="0.3"/> that <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> in order to be good you have to resist the constant pressure to 
sexual activity in this society in what way is it good <pause dur="0.3"/> to resist it <pause dur="0.4"/> the agenda is actually do it <pause dur="0.7"/> but <pause dur="0.2"/> he's still got the idea that you're good <pause dur="0.3"/> if you don't it's like people who say that the baby was very good <pause dur="0.4"/> when what they mean is the baby was very silent <pause dur="0.3"/> possibly dead <pause dur="2.4"/><vocal desc="laughter" n="ss" iterated="y" dur="2"/> # which is not my idea of good at all so and there was all of this stuff <pause dur="0.3"/> and he said # that most of the people in the world <pause dur="1.1"/> were born by accident <pause dur="1.5"/> which isn't true either <pause dur="0.9"/> we know the proportion of accidental conceptions more or less from # the endless surveys that women are so <pause dur="1.1"/> good as to supply data for and it's somewhere about <pause dur="0.5"/> it's still too high it's about a quarter i think but it's certainly not <pause dur="0.2"/> all or even most <pause dur="0.6"/> so there was all of this going on and what is his contraceptive of the future his contraceptive of the future is an implant <pause dur="0.5"/> that will be put in <pause dur="0.2"/> adolescent girls so that they won't get pregnant <pause dur="1.7"/> and i just <pause dur="0.4"/> nobody identified this as a gender issue <pause dur="0.8"/> and there's only 
me in the car shouting <vocal desc="laughter" n="ss" iterated="y" dur="5"/> across Hertfordshire saying <pause dur="0.2"/><shift feature="loud" new="f"/>why don't you caponize the fucking boys why have you got to caponize the girls <pause dur="0.2"/> why is it always the girls <shift feature="loud" new="normal"/><pause dur="0.5"/> the thing is i kind of know the answer as well because it's the girls <pause dur="0.4"/> who have been programmed to desire sexual intimacy at any cost <pause dur="0.5"/> it's the girls who can't ask for a condom to be used who don't feel sufficiently <pause dur="0.5"/> desirable or in control or anything to be able to <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> demand <pause dur="0.5"/> or impose conditions to sexual intimacy <pause dur="0.4"/> so i kind of knew the answer but i wanted somebody to say to him <pause dur="0.7"/> # you know have you never heard of chlamydia have you never heard of human papilloma virus <pause dur="0.3"/> do you really not care <pause dur="0.3"/> about herpes in young women <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> do you consider as a member of the Family Planning Association <pause dur="0.3"/> that you have a duty to protect the fertility of young women so that they <pause dur="0.3"/> have the option of planning a family <pause dur="0.3"/> instead of exposing them to sterilizing disease <pause dur="0.3"/> because <pause dur="0.2"/> of your <pause dur="0.3"/> hidden agenda <pause dur="0.2"/> which is to 
stop them having any children whatsoever as far as i can see <pause dur="1.3"/> so having failed to identify the extraordinary gender bias in this <pause dur="0.5"/> or however <pause dur="0.7"/> the way in which Guillebaud's attitudes were completely <pause dur="0.2"/> unregenerate <pause dur="0.6"/> # so that it's <pause dur="0.5"/> # and of course who did they put up against him they put up a defender of family values who i may say <pause dur="0.7"/> did not a bad job <pause dur="0.3"/> of defending feminist values <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> but <pause dur="0.2"/> would have <pause dur="0.3"/> been horrified to have been told that that's what she was doing and she said you know <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> we're turning these girls into sex objects i thought you might as well <trunc>s</trunc> you know acknowledge <shift feature="voice" new="laugh"/>where this notion comes from <shift feature="voice" new="normal"/><pause dur="0.5"/> this is making them and i think that's right i mean it's making them think that their <pause dur="0.4"/> their primary their primary social function is to be <pause dur="0.3"/> involved in <pause dur="0.2"/> penetrative sex that <pause dur="0.2"/> without that they might as well be dead <pause dur="0.7"/> and so and she had a real point and she made her points <pause dur="0.5"/> fairly well i thought <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> but what was interesting to me is that the people <pause dur="0.3"/> <trunc>d</trunc> dealing with this 
issue just could not see <pause dur="0.9"/> the gender aspect of it and yet they want to tell us <pause dur="0.3"/> that feminism has nothing to teach them <pause dur="0.6"/> they were literally and they <trunc>sa</trunc> if they say feminism is dead <pause dur="0.5"/> i'm prepared to agree because it's dead in their heads there wasn't a fizz there wasn't a button <pause dur="0.3"/> marked gender on their keyboard <pause dur="0.6"/> and so there was no way they could actually <pause dur="0.4"/> understand the <pause dur="0.2"/> the discourse they were having <pause dur="0.5"/> so then we got to <pause dur="0.2"/> and i was asked to be in this ridiculous is feminism dead debate <pause dur="0.5"/><shift feature="voice" new="laugh"/> and said <shift feature="voice" new="normal"/>that # no <pause dur="1.3"/><vocal desc="laughter" n="ss" iterated="y" dur="1"/> didn't explain just said no <pause dur="0.4"/> and so it was Kathy Lette instead another <pause dur="0.2"/> gabby Australian gets sat in the hot seat <pause dur="0.8"/><vocal desc="laugh" n="ss" iterated="n"/> and the editor of <trunc>cosmopol</trunc> <vocal desc="laughter" n="sl" iterated="y" dur="2"/><pause dur="0.3"/> and the editor of Cosmopolitan <pause dur="0.4"/> said <pause dur="0.8"/> # which is still the best selling women's magazine in England so if feminism is dead we'd better galvanize it and frankenstein it and get it back on the road if that's still the case <pause dur="0.7"/> # so she was saying oh well you know women <pause dur="0.3"/> have achieved all the things they want to 
achieve more or less <pause dur="0.3"/> and the thing that i can't bear is all this ranting on about men and <pause dur="0.4"/> all this assumption that men are the enemy # <pause dur="0.6"/> and you know it was so terrible in the late <trunc>sev</trunc> somebody always identifies a time when feminists told you what to do <pause dur="1.1"/> it was and in the late seventies and early eighties it seems is the time when feminists kept telling people what to <shift feature="voice" new="laugh"/>do <vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" dur="1"/> which i thought was really funny <shift feature="voice" new="normal"/><pause dur="0.4"/> because every time i hear it it's a different set of years apparently we've always been telling people what to do <vocal desc="laughter" n="ss" iterated="y" dur="1"/> and they've never done any of it <vocal desc="laughter" n="ss" iterated="y" dur="2"/> as far as i can see <pause dur="1.8"/> and Kathy Lette was very funny the so that # Kathy was asked are you still kicking and screaming and God bless her she said well i am <pause dur="0.7"/> but then of course she made it entirely a matter of <pause dur="0.7"/> pay inequality <pause dur="1.5"/> # so that the whole dimension of misogyny which is what really preoccupies us the most i think <pause dur="0.6"/> # so that it was all done in the Natasha Walter frame of careers and how we can have it all 
in a career <pause dur="0.4"/> as if careers are the point which of course they're not <pause dur="0.2"/> the point is a life worth living not a career necessarily <pause dur="0.7"/> so that was that was interesting because <pause dur="0.4"/> Kathy's instincts were all in the right place <pause dur="0.4"/> but it was very apparent to me hurtling <shift feature="voice" new="laugh"/>along the <shift feature="voice" new="normal"/>A-five-o-seven <pause dur="0.6"/> that what was needed was some <pause dur="0.3"/> new <pause dur="1.0"/> slogans and some <pause dur="0.2"/> new awareness of where the <pause dur="0.6"/> the hot spots are where the <distinct lang="it">punto dolente</distinct> as Italians say where the painful points are <pause dur="0.6"/> # because Kathy wasn't anywhere near <pause dur="0.2"/> angry enough # i mean even <shift feature="voice" new="laugh"/>though <shift feature="voice" new="normal"/><pause dur="0.4"/> she's well aware of what happens to the birthing woman and what happens to the rearing mother and <pause dur="0.4"/> so forth <pause dur="0.4"/> # that she didn't think that that was part of it because it was already couched in that term and i've already had my say about <pause dur="0.4"/> it was all in <pause dur="0.8"/> in the rhetoric of equality <pause dur="1.3"/> which <pause dur="0.2"/> to me becomes <pause dur="1.2"/> really without substance after a while because <pause dur="0.4"/> it's not even a question of <pause dur="0.2"/> of pay equality <pause dur="0.7"/> there was also there was <trunc>m</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> other stuff too of course about <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> mothers and 
teachers and the child care sector and so on <pause dur="0.4"/> but again not identified as a feminist issue <pause dur="0.4"/> or indeed a gender issue <pause dur="0.5"/> okay so that's my proem <pause dur="0.9"/> now please could i have a question <pause dur="3.1"/> <shift feature="voice" new="laugh"/>you're all sitting <kinesic desc="indicates line of audience" iterated="n"/> i was going to go like this though <vocal desc="laughter" n="sl" iterated="y" dur="1"/> <shift feature="voice" new="normal"/></u><u who="sf1092" trans="overlap"> oh right <pause dur="1.3"/> you keep talking about this gap i think <pause dur="0.3"/> you know we've all felt this gap <pause dur="0.4"/> between <pause dur="0.3"/> academic feminism where i think feminism's very very much alive </u><u who="nf1091" trans="overlap"> mm </u><u who="sf1092" trans="overlap"> <pause dur="0.3"/> albeit <pause dur="0.3"/> threatened at <pause dur="0.2"/> at points and whatever <pause dur="0.4"/> and <pause dur="0.3"/> popular feminism which seems to be a very different kind of species <pause dur="0.3"/> can you <pause dur="0.5"/> do you see any way of bridging <pause dur="0.3"/> that gap <pause dur="0.9"/> or is it that we all have to <pause dur="0.3"/> frankenstein our <pause dur="0.2"/> discourse i mean how can we get <pause dur="0.5"/> the debates <pause dur="0.3"/> that have been conducted in the academy for the last thirty years <pause dur="0.3"/> somehow into the public realm <pause dur="0.5"/> because the questions of things like the what you've been talking about such as equality and sexual difference have been very much burgeoning debates </u><pause dur="0.3"/> <u who="nf1091" trans="pause"> mm-hmm </u><u who="sf1092" trans="latching"> within <pause dur="0.4"/> the feminist 
academy <pause dur="0.2"/> for some time <pause dur="0.3"/> but they don't seem to have made any impact at all <pause dur="0.5"/> on <pause dur="0.5"/> the public <pause dur="0.9"/> if that's a <pause dur="0.6"/> workable distinction </u><pause dur="1.0"/> <u who="nf1091" trans="pause"> well i think it is a workable distinction <pause dur="0.2"/> and i think some of the reasons are are <pause dur="0.2"/> very well set out by <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> <pause dur="0.2"/><kinesic desc="indicates member of audience" iterated="n"/> in the stuff that you have written for <pause dur="0.5"/> i can't <trunc>remem</trunc> the handbook <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> because it's true that <pause dur="0.2"/> academic feminism has to follow certain models of academic discourse <pause dur="0.6"/> and they are controlling models and they're also debating models <pause dur="0.4"/> so they don't allow much <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> room for recasting ideas and behaviours <pause dur="0.5"/> they <pause dur="0.2"/> they almost insist upon well they do insist upon a measure of detachment <pause dur="0.4"/> and this comes into conflict with the whole feminist <pause dur="0.4"/> insistence on first person evidence <pause dur="0.3"/> and of what it actually feels like <pause dur="0.5"/> now i mean i would justify what i have done <pause dur="0.2"/> in writing The Whole Woman <pause dur="1.5"/> as an attempt to bridge that <pause dur="1.2"/> gap but also i mean what will actually happen is what happened to me before <pause dur="0.4"/> which is that the academic feminists will ignore me <pause dur="0.2"/> it will be as if 
the book had never been written <pause dur="0.4"/> and they'll get a lot of their student intake because of the existence of the book <pause dur="0.4"/> but it will not be discussed seriously and in fact <pause dur="0.4"/> i mean it has actually happened in the past it works both ways this gap <pause dur="0.4"/> that what i write is <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> interpreted <pause dur="0.6"/> by <pause dur="0.3"/> academic feminists as it was interpreted by the tabloid press they take on board the tabloid press caricature of the argument <pause dur="0.7"/> so they <pause dur="0.2"/> they talk about # you know The Female Eunuch being <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> a sex manual <pause dur="0.7"/> it's not a sex <vocal desc="laughter" n="ss" iterated="y" dur="1"/> manual at all <pause dur="0.6"/> the fact that it's sometimes <pause dur="0.7"/> talked of in that way <pause dur="0.7"/> # is something that you would think <pause dur="0.2"/> that a feminist <pause dur="0.3"/> <trunc>w</trunc> <pause dur="0.5"/> would be aware of that she'd be sensitized to the possibility of a book that actually claimed that women were <trunc>sensu</trunc> sexual beings <pause dur="0.4"/> might be interpreted as # a sex handbook <pause dur="0.7"/> or you know a a <pause dur="0.2"/> and # you as i get serialized by people like Cosmopolitan in a way i've deserved it <pause dur="0.7"/> and <vocal desc="laughter" n="ss" iterated="y" dur="1"/> <pause dur="0.2"/> if <trunc>n</trunc> i mean this was the whole point about the # <pause dur="0.8"/> the 
interaction with things like Playboy <pause dur="1.2"/> i mean one # Playboy made me journalist of the year which i think is hilarious <vocal desc="laughter" n="ss" iterated="y" dur="1"/> <pause dur="0.6"/> because they were trying to buy respectability all they managed to do was to purchase for me an a certain amount of disrespect or <pause dur="0.2"/> unrespectability so <pause dur="0.6"/> and the same thing is going to happen again <pause dur="1.1"/> i'm <pause dur="0.5"/> horrified <pause dur="0.9"/> by the hype <pause dur="0.2"/> that is going to be given to this book <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> just because <pause dur="1.0"/> i don't like hype and i just think of myself as a reviewer i would go for the jugular <pause dur="0.2"/> i would read this book looking for all kinds of hypocrisy and self-serving and so forth <pause dur="0.8"/> and everybody else is going to do exactly the same i think or certainly all the people who i would think of as my <pause dur="0.9"/> my native <pause dur="0.2"/> allies will <pause dur="0.5"/> go to town on it which will cause me a good deal of grief <pause dur="0.7"/> but <pause dur="0.5"/> you have to do it <pause dur="0.5"/> because there'd been lots of good books <pause dur="0.4"/> published that had <pause dur="0.2"/> that would have had an effect upon <pause dur="0.3"/> the level of <pause dur="0.2"/> feminist discourse in the public arena <pause dur="0.4"/> but the but the public never read them <pause dur="1.4"/> the public <pause dur="0.5"/> 
never even knew that they existed they weren't reviewed they weren't foregrounded at all <pause dur="0.8"/> and so here am i you know in bed with The Daily Telegraph <pause dur="0.2"/> which <pause dur="0.3"/> # i can assure you my bed is one place The Daily Telegraph has never been <pause dur="0.7"/><vocal desc="laughter" n="ss" iterated="y" dur="1"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> and i cannot read the paper for embarrassment <pause dur="0.7"/> i feel <pause dur="0.2"/> soiled after i've read a Daily Telegraph <pause dur="0.3"/> editorial <pause dur="0.3"/> and there i'm going to be in all my glory <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> but still <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="1.1"/> preaching to the unconverted which is a good place to be <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.8"/> i don't get the money from the serialization it's nothing to do with me <pause dur="0.7"/> and i can remember weeping and wailing to David Hare on <pause dur="0.3"/> at an airport that i couldn't i just couldn't bear the thought of March <pause dur="0.9"/> because the book is going to be given away on railway stations they're going to give people chapters to read on the train <pause dur="0.6"/> and he said God can you imagine how happy i would be if that had ever happened to any of my plays don't you <vocal desc="laughter" n="ss" iterated="y" dur="2"/> dare complain <pause dur="0.8"/> but you don't understand i'm going to feel so shafted by the

run it as if as if it was a Chinese government of the twelfth century <pause dur="0.4"/> because somehow people understand that if you <pause dur="0.2"/> if you actually discuss things openly all these mad women i mean God knows what they might say <pause dur="0.4"/> i don't know if anybody does think like that but i think they are very homosocial these people <pause dur="0.6"/> # and they don't <trunc>re</trunc> and the women that they've <pause dur="0.2"/> got close to them they have extremely difficult relationships with if you think of Clare Short <pause dur="0.3"/> and Mo Mowlam <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="0.8"/> so it seems to me that instead of saying see see all these women have got into Parliament i mean anybody with half a brain must realize <pause dur="0.5"/> that we have never had such silent back-benchers <pause dur="0.5"/> these back-benchers are mute <pause dur="0.5"/> and we're doing all sorts of insane things without a mandate from the people or from the U-N or from anyone <pause dur="0.4"/> and still this <pause dur="0.2"/> silence <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> and <pause dur="0.3"/> the three monthly attacks on single mums <pause dur="0.8"/> there are single mums sitting in Parliament <pause dur="1.1"/> what is going on <pause dur="0.8"/> so i didn't understand what <pause dur="0.3"/> Fay was up to but <pause dur="0.3"/> one of my 
problems as deciding to be the person who stands on this <pause dur="0.6"/> like the Colossus at Rhodes with one foot in the academy and the other foot <pause dur="0.2"/> in the popular media <pause dur="0.8"/> is # that i <trunc>kee</trunc> i have <pause dur="0.2"/> always to support <pause dur="0.2"/> another <pause dur="0.2"/> woman let alone feminist <pause dur="0.5"/> in a public debate i will not mud wrestle for the media <pause dur="0.5"/> with occasional <pause dur="0.5"/> startling exceptions like when i lost my temper with Suzanne Moore and smacked her about a bit <pause dur="0.8"/> i think senior feminists can clip people round the ears <shift feature="voice" new="laugh"/>occasionally <pause dur="0.9"/><vocal desc="laughter" n="ss" iterated="y" dur="1"/> it'll do them nothing but good <pause dur="0.6"/> <shift feature="voice" new="normal"/> # <vocal desc="laughter" n="ss" iterated="y" dur="2"/> but so that i can't although i really would like to say to Fay oh <pause dur="1.5"/> i don't doubt at all you know that men are suffering <pause dur="0.3"/> masculinity is a terrible system <pause dur="1.2"/> but why do you think it's women's fault <pause dur="0.2"/> how do you get <pause dur="0.2"/> how do you get your mind round to that position <pause dur="0.4"/> i mean even if you say look <pause dur="0.4"/> women used to support men <pause dur="0.5"/> any man no matter how beaten up by his trade union or by his employer or <pause dur="0.2"/> by the police <pause dur="0.6"/> could rely on a supportive little woman who'd 
put <pause dur="0.2"/> a hot meal meat and two veg on the table in front of him and tell him he was marvellous <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> and now she's saying # excuse me but i want something for myself <pause dur="0.2"/> this is the fantasy that that's what's happened i mean a lot of what's happened is women saying listen <pause dur="0.3"/> i've got to go out to work 'cause otherwise we don't pay this mortgage goodbye <pause dur="0.5"/> # your tea's in the oven or <trunc>y</trunc> indeed your tea's in the freezer <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> and <pause dur="0.5"/> so that but somehow even if you could say <pause dur="0.4"/> that women have withdrawn their support of men and therefore men are in free fall <pause dur="0.5"/> then it just goes to prove the justice of the women's case that <pause dur="0.2"/> the entire system was resting on their backs <pause dur="0.4"/> they were the tortoises that were holding up the elephant <pause dur="0.3"/> and the tortoises walked away and the elephant has fallen over <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> and of course it's painful and difficult if that's what's happened but i don't think it's what's happened <pause dur="0.5"/> i think the way in which the argument about men's malaise <pause dur="0.4"/> their suicide attempts their successful suicides 
their unemployability <pause dur="0.4"/> their level of criminal activity and alcoholism and so on <pause dur="0.4"/> the way this discourse is couched <pause dur="1.1"/> it just ignores factors that are really <shift feature="voice" new="laugh"/>important <shift feature="voice" new="normal"/><pause dur="0.5"/> like <pause dur="0.2"/> poverty <pause dur="0.2"/> like <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> unemployment <pause dur="0.2"/> we know that unemployment is a cause of <pause dur="0.5"/> of disease <pause dur="0.5"/> <trunc>i</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> and we know that poverty is a cause of disease <pause dur="0.3"/> but for some reason <pause dur="0.5"/> if we see a disproportionate <pause dur="1.1"/> reaction to <pause dur="0.8"/> a change in fortunes by men we'd sort of <pause dur="0.2"/> look <pause dur="0.2"/> towards women and say <pause dur="0.3"/> that must be your fault <pause dur="1.2"/> which is <pause dur="0.2"/> i mean it's so gratuitous it's amazing <pause dur="0.7"/> and every time you actually deconstruct the language of inculpation of women <pause dur="0.8"/> # you see how gratuitous it is and you also see <pause dur="0.3"/> how it goes from <pause dur="0.2"/> guarded statements <pause dur="0.7"/> to <pause dur="0.4"/> absolute certainty in the course of a single discussion <pause dur="0.2"/> thus didst thou <pause dur="0.7"/> # and i don't understand quite i mean i have <pause dur="0.2"/> occasionally i say darkly that it must be the effect of H-R-T flooding the brain <pause dur="0.7"/> # because Fay is on <shift feature="voice" new="laugh"/>H-R-T <shift feature="voice" new="normal"/>Fay has had a facelift and Fay does <pause dur="0.4"/> have a new husband all these things can be guaranteed 
to turn a girl's brain <pause dur="0.2"/> i think <vocal desc="laughter" n="ss" iterated="y" dur="3"/> <pause dur="1.7"/> so i'm waiting for her to come to her senses <vocal desc="laughter" n="ss" iterated="y" dur="2"/> <pause dur="1.4"/> and i don't want to have been so terribly rude about her in the interim that i <vocal desc="laughter" n="ss" iterated="y" dur="1"/> <shift feature="voice" new="laugh"/>can't we can't have <shift feature="voice" new="normal"/>any further <pause dur="0.4"/> dealings <pause dur="0.6"/> and as for Natasha Walter <pause dur="1.0"/> i i <trunc>th</trunc> i think Natasha Walter has no idea what it's all about <pause dur="0.9"/> # <trunc>th</trunc> <pause dur="0.6"/> that's another thing as well i mean her the <pause dur="0.5"/> there is a conviction in this country that feminist discourse occurs in the newspapers <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.8"/> and that that's it <pause dur="1.1"/> that there # so that Natasha Walter didn't bother <pause dur="0.2"/> to bone up on feminist theory or gender theory <pause dur="0.5"/> # she just sort of wrote about <pause dur="0.3"/> an idea of feminism as a kind of grim puritanical era sometime in the past <pause dur="0.3"/> from which she as a butterfly had just emerged <pause dur="0.3"/> and could <trunc>s</trunc> go from flower to flower <pause dur="0.4"/> in her <pause dur="0.4"/> her # <pause dur="0.2"/> nice dresses and strappy sandals <pause dur="0.6"/><vocal desc="laughter" n="ss" iterated="y" dur="1"/> made by child labour in south-east Asia <pause dur="0.4"/> which isn't going to cause her a moment's <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.9"/> malaise or <pause dur="0.3"/> anxiety so <pause dur="0.6"/> yes it <trunc>w</trunc> i was probably the new feminism <pause dur="0.4"/> that did it <pause dur="1.3"/>

with herself <pause dur="0.7"/> i don't think these things are innate i do think they are cultural i think <pause dur="1.1"/> looking for differences in the cochlea or the you know the anterior something or other <pause dur="0.4"/> fissure of the corpus cavernosum and so on <pause dur="0.4"/> that all this is fascist nonsense <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> and <pause dur="0.6"/> we have the right to be <pause dur="0.2"/> gay <pause dur="0.3"/> and the possibility of being gay as women <pause dur="0.6"/> with men it's slightly different because there is such an extraordinary set of power relationships revolving within <pause dur="0.4"/> gay culture itself <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="1.8"/> so this then brings me to the whole question of transsexuals now if we think about my gay friends my gay friends get <trunc>terrib</trunc> men i mean get terribly angry about transsexuals they say <pause dur="0.5"/> they're just gay men <pause dur="0.2"/> who can't come to terms with the fact that they're gay <pause dur="0.4"/> and they have and and that they desire men sexually so they have to have themselves mutilated and make themselves into fake women <pause dur="0.6"/> this is a very hard view <pause dur="0.6"/> # but i don't think it should be automatically discounted because for me <pause dur="0.4"/> the core of this is 
in the mutilation of the body <pause dur="0.3"/> as i've said to you i i take the body as a repository of feminist value <pause dur="0.8"/> because we build it <pause dur="1.2"/> the things you see around you have all been built out of one out of a woman's bodily substance whether they're male or female or <pause dur="0.5"/> tattooed or pierced <shift feature="voice" new="laugh"/>or <shift feature="voice" new="normal"/><pause dur="0.5"/> transsexual or whatever <pause dur="0.7"/> # and that all the things that technology does to them <pause dur="0.5"/> are in some ways an attempt to prise <pause dur="0.6"/> to prise away the maternal principle <pause dur="0.4"/> and to devalue the maternal principle <pause dur="0.6"/> # the patriarchy although we're being told we've got equality what i think has happened at <pause dur="0.5"/> as we approach the millennium <pause dur="0.5"/> is that patriarchy is triumphant <pause dur="0.5"/> and it is triumphant in the sense that it has managed to <pause dur="0.7"/> bleed all the meaning <pause dur="0.3"/> out of <pause dur="0.5"/> maternity we don't have matriarchy so there's no point my even using the term <pause dur="0.4"/> it's managed to bleed the significance out of it <pause dur="0.4"/> to criminalize it and marginalize it as <pause dur="0.4"/> a kind of survival <pause dur="0.2"/> kind of evolutionary survival that we can improve upon <pause dur="0.4"/> we can improve

concept <pause dur="0.7"/> there's no such thing as social inclusion society is people <pause dur="0.3"/> but they've decided that <shift feature="voice" new="laugh"/>there's society <shift feature="voice" new="normal"/>and then there's <pause dur="0.3"/> excluded people ah <pause dur="1.0"/> it's it's all <trunc>s</trunc> i think it's all done in such bad faith <pause dur="0.9"/> it is so cynical <pause dur="1.1"/> so manipulative <pause dur="0.2"/> of the electorate i'm ashamed of this Labour Party </u><gap reason="break in recording" extent="uncertain"/> <u who="nf1091" trans="pause"> i've always found it <pause dur="0.5"/> really interesting <pause dur="0.2"/> that <pause dur="1.1"/> at the time when the family the <pause dur="0.2"/> elder generation starts to fall apart <pause dur="0.6"/> the burden naturally falls on the shoulders of <pause dur="0.3"/> the menopausal female <pause dur="0.4"/> the older <pause dur="1.2"/> sister or whatever the daughter <pause dur="0.6"/> and then at a very difficult time in her own life when she's having to come to terms with the endings of things and # and no new beginnings <pause dur="0.5"/> she's also having to embark on this stressful business of <pause dur="0.8"/> shepherding her parents <pause dur="0.7"/> carefully and comfortably out of the world if that's what she can do <pause dur="0.4"/> and there's an aspect of this which i find very interesting and i <trunc>h</trunc> i daren't discuss it in a loud voice because it's going to cause a <pause dur="0.5"/> bit 
of a <trunc>sh</trunc> <pause dur="0.7"/> scandal <pause dur="0.7"/> that in those cases that i know of where a sick parent has agreed that she wishes to end her life <pause dur="0.9"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> she has chosen her daughter <pause dur="0.2"/> as her accomplice <pause dur="0.8"/> and that part of the battle between the doctors who now want to take it over and do it <pause dur="0.3"/> is actually again a concealed sort of gender battle <pause dur="0.3"/> we can't just it's like women controlling the birthplace and then suddenly says <pause dur="0.6"/> well Christ they're also controlling the deathplace <pause dur="0.3"/> we can't have that <pause dur="0.2"/> get in there get in there now <pause dur="0.3"/> we should be deciding when these people end their lives we can't just have this <pause dur="0.3"/> you know saving up your <pause dur="0.4"/> your narcotics for the big <pause dur="0.5"/> bang and and your daughter coming and holding you in her arms and <trunc>n</trunc> and so whatever it is that you've decided to do <pause dur="0.5"/> so there's this <pause dur="0.3"/> you daren't talk about this of course it'll be a tremendous fuss if i did <pause dur="0.4"/> but i find it very interesting <pause dur="0.5"/> and i <pause dur="0.2"/> it's terribly hard to find out about because like so much of what women do like abortion used to be <pause dur="0.4"/> we don't talk about it <pause dur="0.4"/> 
a daughter who has just killed her mother <pause dur="0.7"/> is not going to sit on the bus stop and say oh by the way last week i knocked my mother off i mean it's <pause dur="0.5"/> <vocal desc="laughter" n="ss" iterated="y" dur="1"/> you hear about it in very privileged circumstances and it's a very privileged discourse <pause dur="0.4"/> so i'm thinking as i always think because <pause dur="0.4"/> this is why i write at all <pause dur="0.5"/> women don't know that what's happening to them is happening to everybody else <pause dur="1.2"/> so they have a Caesarean <shift feature="voice" new="laugh"/>and <shift feature="voice" new="normal"/>you say why did you have a Caesarean and they say oh well <pause dur="0.4"/> the baby was labouring and blah blah blah and so forth and i'd been in labour for two-and-a-half hours and <shift feature="voice" new="laugh"/>whatever <shift feature="voice" new="normal"/><pause dur="0.3"/> and you say oh really <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> and she believes that her <pause dur="0.2"/> her Caesarean is <pause dur="0.2"/> totally necessary <pause dur="0.3"/> and then you look at the figures and realize they can't be totally necessary how can the healthiest women in the world be needing so many Caesareans <pause dur="0.4"/> so you have to go back but <pause dur="0.3"/> the statistics can never be made to fit cases <pause dur="0.4"/> and everybody <pause dur="0.2"/> takes advantage of that gap <pause dur="0.6"/> and the same 
thing is happening now i think with the question of women in the deathplace <pause dur="0.6"/> so that we haven't even realized that maybe there is a relationship and a function to be protected here <pause dur="0.4"/> like there was in the case of abortion <pause dur="1.1"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> it is still interesting to me how much of our lives is secret <pause dur="0.9"/> from <pause dur="1.2"/> other women <pause dur="0.5"/> even other women who are quite close to us <pause dur="0.5"/> and that we still haven't managed to <pause dur="0.3"/> foreground this <pause dur="0.8"/> # and if we did it would be transgressive just like black culture <pause dur="0.2"/> we they would decide that what we had been doing was transgressive and we couldn't do it any more <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> and if you actually if you then think <trunc>ab</trunc> <pause dur="0.4"/> of the nanny crisis in terms of this <pause dur="1.4"/> what are we what are we saying about the nannies <pause dur="0.4"/> not that parents kill children much much much more often than nannies do that is amazingly rare <pause dur="0.3"/> we're saying <pause dur="0.2"/> we want more system of control of nannies we want nannies to be <pause dur="0.3"/> X-rayed fingerprinted tattooed you know we want to be able to <pause dur="0.4"/> track them day and night we want closed-circuit television

of building these structures in all sorts of circumstances in prisons in the street in playhouses in <pause dur="0.6"/> in # nursery <shift feature="voice" new="laugh"/>school <pause dur="0.5"/> and so on <shift feature="voice" new="normal"/>but this <pause dur="0.5"/> these tendencies <pause dur="0.4"/> agglomerating tendencies of men men in groups <pause dur="0.5"/> are important i mean this has been argued for a long time that feminists needed to understand them <pause dur="0.2"/> to defend themselves <pause dur="0.8"/> # because they have ways of dealing with marauders <pause dur="0.6"/> that we still haven't quite understood so they reform and regroup in <trunc>e</trunc> ever more arcane locations <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="2.1"/> where <pause dur="0.4"/> the problem about being women is we don't have those structures <pause dur="0.4"/> we've never had them historically that and so i argued that maybe we should look at <pause dur="0.5"/> segregated societies to see how women construct <pause dur="1.3"/> # <pause dur="1.3"/> how they make social cohesion within the female group or indeed if they make it may be that they don't <pause dur="0.7"/> but i think they do <pause dur="0.8"/> and they do around the figure of a senior woman and so on <pause dur="0.9"/> # but when <pause dur="0.2"/> i mean the connection with sexuality <pause dur="0.3"/> is <pause dur="0.5"/> is one that has that <pause dur="0.2"/> that has to be made i

just went straight ahead into absolute disastersville <pause dur="1.4"/> so i said well # <pause dur="1.1"/> i want to what is involved in this test <pause dur="0.2"/> # he said well i don't know i said well <pause dur="0.3"/> <vocal desc="laughter" n="ss" iterated="y" dur="2"/> i i was told to ask so i'm asking what is involved in the test so he went out of the room and he came back <pause dur="0.8"/> with this <shift feature="voice" new="laugh"/>bag <shift feature="voice" new="normal"/>which i could see had a plastic cup in it <pause dur="0.2"/> <vocal desc="laughter" n="sl" iterated="y" dur="2"/> and he sat down on a seat and he carefully read the pamphlet <pause dur="1.2"/> then he put the pamphlet back in the bag and he came out and he said to me well <pause dur="0.6"/> # what you do is you pee into this plastic cup <vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" n="ss" dur="1"/>and you send it off to this laboratory and they will tell you whether there's <pause dur="0.4"/> a certain # <pause dur="0.7"/> substance in your urine <pause dur="2.0"/> so i said what a metabolite of calcium or something <pause dur="0.7"/> he said no i think he said it's a sort of protein <pause dur="0.4"/> so i said oh well they're testing bone resorption aren't they <pause dur="0.3"/> not <pause dur="0.9"/> not bone density <pause dur="1.0"/> and he said <pause dur="0.8"/> oh <pause dur="0.9"/> ah i suppose they are <pause dur="0.3"/> so i said well that means that all you find out from having this test is that you need another test <pause dur="3.2"/> <vocal desc="laughter" n="ss" iterated="y" dur="1"/> which i said can't you just get the other
test by asking the doctor for it <pause dur="1.2"/> the bastard was totally blank at this state <pause dur="0.9"/> <vocal desc="laughter" n="ss" iterated="y" dur="1"/> so then i said # <pause dur="0.3"/> # i was going to buy the test just for <trunc>in</trunc> just for information 'cause i do that just keep it <pause dur="0.3"/> you know so i can <pause dur="0.2"/> talk about it somewhere else <pause dur="0.6"/> so i said how much does it cost <pause dur="0.2"/> to have this test to find out if you need a test <pause dur="2.5"/> <vocal desc="laughter" n="ss" iterated="y" dur="1"/> and he said nineteen-pounds-ninety-nine <pause dur="1.7"/> <vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" dur="1"/> i said <pause dur="0.5"/> there's nothing new under the sun <pause dur="0.2"/> now this is just a naked attempt to exploit women's anxiety <pause dur="0.4"/> to the best of my knowledge what they are testing <pause dur="0.5"/> as far as i could see <pause dur="0.3"/> was # <pause dur="1.0"/> one of the <pause dur="0.3"/> substances associated with osteoclasts <pause dur="0.5"/> and there could be lots of reasons i guess 
why you are pissing those out <pause dur="0.5"/> and as far as i know and i'm my research is not that old <pause dur="0.5"/> there's <pause dur="0.9"/> no proof that they actually <pause dur="0.9"/> strongly related to osteoporosis at all <pause dur="0.9"/> anyhow i promised you these <pause dur="1.0"/> <kinesic desc="holds up bag" iterated="n"/><vocal desc="laughter" n="ss" iterated="y" dur="1"/> now the problem is i've only got twenty <pause dur="1.0"/> because they're all been given away to # <pause dur="0.9"/> Richard Branson and <shift feature="voice" new="laugh"/>people i don't know <vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" dur="1"/> <shift feature="voice" new="normal"/><pause dur="0.7"/> well i they're given away by the publicity people and they've got the dreariest idea of who counts </u><u who="sf1107" trans="overlap"> <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> on the train with one </u><pause dur="0.8"/> <u who="nf1091" trans="pause"> <vocal desc="laugh" iterated="n"/><pause dur="1.3"/> <vocal desc="laughter" n="ss" iterated="y" dur="1"/> so what i'll do is # i'll stand here and if you want one <pause dur="0.6"/> i'll give you one as you come out
