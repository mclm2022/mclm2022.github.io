<u who="nf1139"> # <pause dur="0.4"/> in the course handout the overview for the whole course <pause dur="0.6"/> # i included <pause dur="0.4"/> # an outline of <pause dur="0.2"/> the topics that i'm going to cover <pause dur="1.1"/> and one of the major components is <pause dur="0.3"/> comes under the basic heading inflation targetry <pause dur="0.3"/> and that's what we're going to start <pause dur="0.3"/> almost immediately today <pause dur="1.1"/> now inflation targetry really <pause dur="0.3"/> in my view covers <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> well basically all of the current macroeconomic monetary policy <pause dur="0.3"/> # framework <pause dur="0.2"/> and policy <pause dur="0.4"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> basis in the U-K at the moment <pause dur="0.6"/> and i think that's really important <pause dur="0.2"/> not only because <pause dur="0.3"/> it's important for the U-K but also the U-K's policy <pause dur="0.3"/> has been extremely influential throughout the world <pause dur="0.4"/> i mean a lot of countries <pause dur="0.2"/> refer to the U-K when they look at <pause dur="0.2"/> how they should set out their monetary policy <pause dur="0.4"/> we've just been very very influential <pause dur="0.4"/> that's partly as we'll see because we started quite early <pause dur="0.5"/> not necessarily through design <pause dur="0.4"/> but partly through accident of nature <pause dur="1.2"/> # so that's going to constitute <pause dur="0.3"/> # at least half the 
course really discussing inflation targets <pause dur="0.5"/> the the current policy regime <pause dur="0.5"/> arguments for and against the this regime compared to other previous regimes <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> all of this is really tied in with # <trunc>top</trunc> topics that you may well have covered previously like central bank independence <pause dur="0.5"/> just so i know <pause dur="0.2"/> roughly where to pitch that sort of topic i'd be interested to know who did <pause dur="0.4"/> ECAP-<pause dur="0.5"/>two or the one that's taught by <gap reason="name" extent="2 words"/> last year <pause dur="0.4"/> can you just stick up your hand if you did that <pause dur="1.7"/><kinesic desc="put hands up" n="ss" iterated="n"/> okay how many people didn't then <kinesic desc="put hands up" n="ss" iterated="n"/> it's <trunc>e</trunc> going to be easier <pause dur="0.2"/> just a few <unclear>okay</unclear> <pause dur="0.8"/> okay so <pause dur="0.2"/> you've already covered topics like central bank independence which which is going to be really really useful <pause dur="0.3"/> and also hopefully what i'm going to say today and in <trunc>f</trunc> <pause dur="0.3"/> # future lectures <pause dur="0.3"/> relates to that <pause dur="1.3"/> # <pause dur="1.1"/> okay we're <trunc>al</trunc> also going to talk about <pause dur="0.3"/> other <pause dur="0.2"/> what you <pause dur="0.3"/> might think of in principle as general economic issues like <pause dur="0.4"/> are there costs of inflation <pause dur="0.5"/> but really i'm hoping to help you see that <pause dur="0.3"/> that sort of 
question really underlies the design of policy it should really drive <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> what policy looks like in the U-K and beyond <pause dur="1.3"/> okay <pause dur="0.3"/> also once we've discussed <pause dur="0.2"/> that sort of policy framework issue <pause dur="0.3"/> we also are going to have to look at how monetary policy actually works <pause dur="0.5"/> because we're going to move from assessing <trunc>mo</trunc> we just look at the Bank of England setting interest rates through <pause dur="0.2"/> to affect policy <pause dur="0.3"/> to <pause dur="0.5"/> see how that actually affects the real the real economy <pause dur="0.3"/> to how it how it actually affects inflation <pause dur="0.3"/> and the paths through which it can act <pause dur="0.5"/> because an understanding of that <pause dur="0.6"/> is going to also influence how we think policy should be set up <pause dur="2.2"/> then we've finished basically <pause dur="0.2"/> that side of monetary policy <pause dur="0.4"/> and then we move onto <pause dur="0.2"/> EMU <pause dur="0.4"/> as a topic which it i'm sure you're already familiar with but also <pause dur="0.4"/> it's obviously of <pause dur="0.2"/> great relevance today <pause dur="0.6"/> # we'll look at the transition to EMU the costs and benefits <pause dur="0.2"/> that sort of thing <pause dur="0.3"/> and then we're going to end up talking about <pause dur="0.5"/> an issue which has really i guess come to the fore over the last year <pause dur="0.4"/> with crises in Asia <pause dur="0.3"/> in Russia <pause dur="0.4"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> you know potential
crises beyond that <pause dur="0.2"/> in <trunc>f</trunc> in the financial world this is to do with <pause dur="0.3"/> stock exchange market volatility <pause dur="0.6"/> and exchange rate volatility <pause dur="0.9"/> both of those <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> are potentially endemic problems and problems that <pause dur="0.3"/> at the moment don't look like they're going to <trunc>wi</trunc> go away <pause dur="0.7"/> and also presenting real headaches for policy makers in <trunc>t</trunc> in terms of the designer institutions <pause dur="0.6"/> are the I-M-F the World Bank current set-up are they sufficient to deal with these sorts of <pause dur="0.4"/> relatively new problems which seem to have <pause dur="0.4"/> arisen through <pause dur="0.2"/> # the increased capital flows <pause dur="1.6"/> now in terms of what we expect from you from this course <pause dur="0.4"/> i guess Steve probably may have already given you <pause dur="0.2"/> some idea <pause dur="0.9"/> the course tries to tie in economic theory quite heavily with # <pause dur="0.6"/> policy <pause dur="0.6"/> and policy aspects <pause dur="0.3"/> so we will be using theoretical models quite <pause dur="0.2"/> well quite a lot as i'm sure Steve's already done <pause dur="0.6"/> but <pause dur="0.6"/> in for example the assessments that you've got to do by the end of this term it <pause dur="0.2"/> we don't necessarily 
require you to <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/><kinesic desc="makes quotation mark gesture" iterated="n"/> be theoretical to use those sort of models <pause dur="0.6"/> it is possible in this course <pause dur="0.3"/> because it's a policy course <pause dur="0.4"/> to <pause dur="0.2"/> provide arguments in a non-mathematical manner <pause dur="0.8"/> and for example <pause dur="0.6"/> well the analysis one sometimes sees in the Economist <pause dur="0.5"/> is <pause dur="0.2"/> actually a <trunc>go</trunc> <trunc>e</trunc> <trunc>e</trunc> good example of economic analysis and that type of <pause dur="0.4"/> argument although not necessarily potentially using economist language which some people <pause dur="0.5"/> # don't don't like very much has its <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> problem <pause dur="0.6"/> that sort of analysis I-E verbal analysis of economic policy and economic theory is perfectly adequate <pause dur="0.8"/> so i mean don't <pause dur="0.5"/> if for those of you who don't like theory if i <pause dur="0.4"/> put up a model i'm going to try and explain it intuitively <pause dur="0.8"/> # to try and # to try and ensure that you know maths isn't <pause dur="0.5"/> the overriding <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> thing that's important <pause dur="2.0"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> what else to say <pause dur="0.8"/> at the end of this lecture i'm going to try and finish a bit early so we can discuss <pause dur="0.4"/> and get volunteers for seminars <pause dur="0.6"/> and get times for seminars in particular Steve <pause dur="0.3"/> Broadberry's 
already given you <pause dur="0.2"/> the topics for his <pause dur="0.2"/> his first seminar and he needs some volunteers for that but i'm going to deal deal with that at the end <pause dur="2.2"/> right in terms of reading <pause dur="0.4"/> you'll see in the handout that i've given for week one <pause dur="0.2"/> it's relatively unusual in the sense that the reading list is is admittedly <pause dur="0.6"/> # very long <pause dur="0.9"/> but <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> one <pause dur="0.2"/> you don't have to read <pause dur="0.2"/> everything <pause dur="0.5"/> two <pause dur="0.4"/> a lot of the <pause dur="0.3"/> # items are very very short they're one or two pages <pause dur="0.3"/> particularly those published by the Bank of England which are descriptive of the current policy framework <pause dur="1.5"/> # also it's actually quite interesting they are short and <trunc>y</trunc> really by going through them # <pause dur="0.2"/> <trunc>f</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> the first the first sort of sub-heading i put under reading <pause dur="0.4"/> is institutional readings <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> i should point out that a lot of them do <trunc>cos</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> contain a sort of assessment of the current framework <pause dur="0.3"/> but they're in <pause dur="0.3"/> inverse chronological order <pause dur="0.2"/> so you start from the current <pause dur="0.4"/> policy regime and go backwards <pause dur="0.3"/> and they they 
finish <pause dur="0.3"/> really <pause dur="0.3"/> i guess at the first change in about <trunc>nineteen-ninety-f</trunc> <pause dur="0.7"/> # five <pause dur="0.2"/> they should do <pause dur="2.0"/> okay so reading those a lot of them are available on the web <pause dur="0.4"/> on the Internet 'cause the bank <pause dur="0.2"/> Bank of England's site's very good <pause dur="0.4"/> at producing documents on the Internet <pause dur="0.6"/> i've starred the ones that are most important i've i've only starred three <pause dur="0.6"/> but those three i really really recommend quite highly <pause dur="0.4"/> not just for this lecture but for all the way through the course there's a Bank of England <pause dur="0.4"/> what they call a fact sheet on monetary <kinesic desc="holds up sheet" iterated="n"/> policy in the U-K <pause dur="0.3"/> it's just a <pause dur="0.2"/> a four three or four page <pause dur="0.7"/> thing which goes through the policy framework <pause dur="0.3"/> it actually goes through topics that we're going to be dealing with next <pause dur="0.3"/> like <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> alternatives <pause dur="0.5"/> # like the monetary aggregates which are alternative <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> policy frameworks <pause dur="0.3"/> it goes through techniques like <pause dur="0.3"/> what the Bank actually does in the money markets in order to set interest rates <pause dur="0.5"/> which we also <pause dur="0.2"/> look at and 
it basically gives you an overall <pause dur="0.5"/> # picture of <pause dur="0.3"/> monetary policy in the U-K over the last few years <pause dur="1.1"/> the other thing that i really really very highly recommend <pause dur="0.4"/><kinesic desc="holds up paper" iterated="n"/> is this article by Mervyn King which he <pause dur="0.5"/> gave at the L-S-E <pause dur="0.4"/> last <trunc>s</trunc> <pause dur="0.4"/> # September October i think <pause dur="0.9"/> # The Inflation Target Five Years On <pause dur="0.8"/> and Mervyn King is the chief <trunc>economi</trunc> well is the chief <pause dur="0.7"/> used to be the Chief Economist is now Deputy <pause dur="0.3"/> Governor at the Bank of England <pause dur="0.4"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> he writes very well in that <pause dur="0.4"/> this article it's # twenty-something pages long <pause dur="0.2"/> it really covers <pause dur="0.3"/> mm you could say maybe the first seven <pause dur="0.3"/> or half the course really <pause dur="0.2"/> all in one paper so <pause dur="0.3"/> i really recommend that very highly <pause dur="1.6"/><vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/><kinesic desc="holds up book" iterated="n"/> the other <pause dur="0.6"/> thing i'm <pause dur="0.2"/> going to recommend is <pause dur="0.2"/> there's a one star next to the Bowen article in this book <pause dur="0.3"/> now this is a book i recommended right in the first reading list Targeting Inflation <pause dur="0.4"/> several copies available in the S-R-C <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> <trunc>i</trunc> <pause dur="0.4"/> the only problem with the book <pause dur="0.2"/> is <pause dur="0.6"/> that it's relatively old it's published ninety-five 
or at least it comes from a conference in ninety-five <pause dur="1.6"/> and i mean since then in the U-K there's been quite a lot of developments so the Bowen article in that <pause dur="0.5"/> relates to <pause dur="0.4"/> obviously quite a relatively old version of <pause dur="0.2"/> monetary policy <pause dur="1.4"/> the Haldane article on the reading list is is equally if not <pause dur="0.4"/> is equally good if not better than the Bowen <pause dur="0.9"/> now that's from the Bank of England Quarterly Bulletin <pause dur="0.6"/> just in case you're not aware <vocal desc="sniff" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.3"/> well i'm going to be recommending a lot of readings from the Bank of England Quarterly Bulletin <pause dur="0.7"/> the current year is available behind the counter in the S-R-C <pause dur="0.5"/> previous years are filed with journals <pause dur="0.9"/> so <pause dur="0.5"/> everything is reasonably readily <trunc>acce</trunc> accessible at the moment <pause dur="0.9"/><vocal desc="sniff" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.3"/><vocal desc="sniff" iterated="n"/><pause dur="1.6"/> right <pause dur="0.5"/> if there are any questions about that <pause dur="1.3"/> great okay well let's move straight on to <pause dur="0.8"/> looking at the first topic then <pause dur="1.0"/> inflation targetry <pause dur="3.9"/><event desc="puts on transparency" iterated="n"/> i'm not sure that i necessarily like the <pause dur="0.4"/> like the term targetry but it was one <pause dur="1.2"/> that <pause dur="0.2"/> 
Alex Bowen <pause dur="0.8"/> who i guess is quite quite important # figure in the Bank in terms of dealing with <pause dur="0.7"/><kinesic desc="turns on overhead projector showing transparency" iterated="n"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/><vocal desc="sniff" iterated="n"/> inflation targeting <pause dur="0.4"/> he was one of the first people to <pause dur="0.6"/> coin that phrase </u><gap reason="break in recording" extent="uncertain"/> <u who="nf1139" trans="pause"> now <pause dur="1.0"/><kinesic desc="reveals covered part of transparency" iterated="n"/> the <pause dur="3.0"/> inflation targeting in the U-K <pause dur="0.6"/> dates from <pause dur="0.8"/> October nineteen-ninety-two <pause dur="2.8"/> and although i haven't <pause dur="0.3"/> # put anything on the handout about the circumstances <pause dur="0.2"/> under which inflation targeting in the U-K was adopted <pause dur="0.7"/> i think they are actually very important and also <pause dur="0.5"/> you know provide an interesting background <pause dur="0.4"/> to what's been happening in monetary policy <pause dur="1.4"/> the U-K <pause dur="0.3"/> left the exchange rate mechanism <pause dur="0.3"/> on sixteenth of September nineteen-ninety-two <pause dur="0.4"/> does anyone know what sixteenth September nineteen-ninety-two is known as </u><pause dur="0.6"/> <u who="ss" trans="pause"> Black Wednesday </u><u who="nf1139" trans="overlap"> Black Wednesday yeah <pause dur="0.9"/> okay Black Wednesday <pause dur="0.7"/> that as you may be aware was a <pause dur="0.6"/> # dramatic day <pause dur="0.5"/> in <pause dur="0.4"/> the history of U-K monetary policy <pause dur="1.2"/> it 
was the day when George Soros <pause dur="0.2"/> <trunc>manage</trunc> manager of a <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> of of investment fund <pause dur="0.4"/> decided that the U-K exchange rate was <pause dur="0.3"/> unsustainably overvalued <pause dur="1.0"/> so he took a massive gamble <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> virtually i think all of his <pause dur="0.3"/> # funds <pause dur="0.4"/> <trunc>d</trunc> # <pause dur="0.2"/> numbering millions billions of dollars <pause dur="0.4"/> was bet <pause dur="0.4"/> against the pound <pause dur="0.6"/> right <pause dur="0.2"/> so basically he was # selling pounds <pause dur="0.3"/> like mad <pause dur="0.3"/> in favour of other countries <pause dur="0.6"/> that put massive pressure on the U-K exchange rate which was currently fixed at <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> i think it was three-seventy-five <pause dur="0.3"/> deutschmarks at that point <pause dur="1.6"/> people # Soros was basically betting because <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> well the U-K currency was <trunc>relative</trunc> <pause dur="0.6"/> relatively uncompetitive at that rate and it was <trunc>wer</trunc> quite well known and had been quite well known for a while that that was the case <pause dur="0.3"/> but Soros at that point <pause dur="0.5"/> amidst <pause dur="0.4"/> instability in general in the currency markets i mean Italy was also hit at that at the same time by <pause dur="0.3"/> general exchange rate instability <pause dur="0.4"/> Soros took a bet against the U-K currency <pause dur="1.2"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> i guess one of the 
reasons i'm i'm giving this course is that <pause dur="0.2"/> i have a background in central banking <pause dur="0.3"/> and i was working at the Bank of England at the time <pause dur="0.9"/><vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/> i worked at the Bank of England for five years <pause dur="0.9"/> it was just the most <pause dur="0.3"/> remarkable day <pause dur="0.3"/> i've <pause dur="0.3"/> well one of the <trunc>re</trunc> most remarkable days i've i've encountered because <pause dur="0.3"/> when i arrived at the Bank of England in the morning to discover that <pause dur="0.3"/> interest rates had been put up <pause dur="0.3"/> by three per cent already <pause dur="0.4"/> and there was <pause dur="0.4"/> basically panic in the corridors <pause dur="0.3"/> if one's just a general Bank of England worker there's <pause dur="0.7"/> some <pause dur="0.2"/> kind of <pause dur="0.2"/> delay in the flow of information so actually <pause dur="0.5"/> one of the people in my office got rung up by one of his friends who was a city dealer saying <pause dur="0.3"/> what on earth are you doing with the # interest rate you know if # you've just raised it five per cent what <trunc>wh</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> what is going on <pause dur="0.5"/> what was going on <pause dur="0.3"/> was that the Bank was having to <pause dur="0.4"/> buy pounds <pause dur="0.4"/> in <pause dur="0.2"/> vast quantities <pause dur="0.5"/> i mean the Bank reserves i think at the start of that day were <pause dur="0.2"/> in the 
region of fifty-billion <pause dur="0.2"/> pounds <pause dur="0.6"/> and we were in serious danger <pause dur="0.5"/> at the rate of spending of <pause dur="0.3"/> pound of of # <pause dur="0.3"/> foreign <trunc>ec</trunc> foreign reserves <pause dur="0.3"/> that we were having to undertake in order to <pause dur="0.5"/> in effect in a sense counteract Soros and his cronies <pause dur="0.5"/> # of losing all our reserves by the end of the day <pause dur="1.5"/> now the only strategy that was open to the Bank <pause dur="0.7"/> rather than selling <pause dur="0.4"/> our foreign exchange reserves <pause dur="0.2"/> was to put up interest rates <pause dur="1.0"/> if you put up U-K interest rates obviously <pause dur="0.2"/> people are going to want to invest <pause dur="0.3"/> more <pause dur="0.2"/> in the U-K pound because they get a higher return <pause dur="0.6"/> so just <pause dur="0.2"/> price and # <pause dur="1.0"/> by demand and supply <pause dur="0.2"/> you'd hope by <pause dur="0.4"/> raising the return on pounds people are going to stop selling <pause dur="1.4"/> it didn't work <pause dur="0.4"/> and where do i mean <pause dur="0.3"/> how could it work we had just had <pause dur="0.4"/> a speculator who'd decided i'm <kinesic desc="clicks fingers" iterated="n"/> going to sell now <pause dur="1.5"/> and # there's nothing you can do if they sell <pause dur="0.2"/> in such large quantities <pause dur="0.5"/> you've just got almost no time in which to react <pause dur="0.5"/> so by twelve o'clock it was clear that the <pause dur="0.2"/> rate <pause dur="0.2"/> of interest 
increase that had happened already we'd <pause dur="0.4"/> announced that the markets <pause dur="0.5"/> that <pause dur="0.6"/> we'd actually reset <pause dur="0.2"/> minimum lending rate which is <pause dur="0.6"/> almost an official interest rate which we don't normally set in the Bank of England <pause dur="0.4"/> it was set <pause dur="1.0"/> at <trunc>al</trunc> almost to tell the markets <pause dur="0.2"/> we know that we're in an emergency situation <pause dur="0.3"/> and we we've got to tell you that this is the interest rate even if you want to <trunc>l</trunc> have a lower interest rate <pause dur="0.3"/> we're going to <pause dur="0.4"/> # not allow that we're going to have a higher interest rate <pause dur="0.8"/> so twelve per cent <pause dur="0.3"/> we then decided to raise it to fifteen per cent <pause dur="0.2"/> there was speculation that well it was clear actually in the amongst the Economics department that that wasn't going to be enough <pause dur="0.7"/> we were talking in terms of <pause dur="0.5"/> twenty per cent even fifty per cent <pause dur="0.9"/> interest rates <pause dur="0.3"/> i mean just as a <pause dur="0.3"/> almost as a signal to the markets that we were serious <pause dur="0.5"/> obviously <pause dur="0.3"/> that's going to cost us a huge amount if we set interest rates at fifty per cent <pause dur="0.2"/> because someone's going to have to pay that 
interest rate <pause dur="1.2"/> and it was undoubtedly going to have to be the government or the Bank of England <pause dur="1.4"/> so we were all willing to adopt a relatively costly strategy <pause dur="0.6"/> in order to try and defend our our status in the E-R-M <pause dur="0.3"/> # to defend the <pause dur="0.3"/> the pound's exchange rate <pause dur="1.8"/> but by <pause dur="0.2"/> by the afternoon it was clear that even <pause dur="0.2"/> that wasn't working <pause dur="0.2"/> and the <trunc>chan</trunc> the Governor headed off <pause dur="0.3"/> to the Treasury <pause dur="0.4"/> to have a meeting with the Chancellor <pause dur="0.6"/> and <pause dur="0.4"/> amidst # <pause dur="0.3"/> huge <pause dur="0.4"/> massive embarrassment <pause dur="0.7"/> to monetary policy making in the U-K <pause dur="0.4"/> we decided that we were going to have to <pause dur="0.8"/> quit the E-R-M <pause dur="0.7"/> and the the magnitude of that <pause dur="0.8"/> should not be underestimated <pause dur="0.3"/> it was the <pause dur="0.4"/> it and had been for several years <pause dur="0.3"/> the sole <pause dur="0.5"/> # objective of monetary policy to maintain a fixed exchange rate particularly with the deutschmark <pause dur="0.7"/> and to let that go <pause dur="0.5"/> just almost in a day <pause dur="0.3"/> is just <pause dur="0.3"/> # really <pause dur="0.2"/> highly embarrassing <pause dur="0.7"/> it meant that the Bank of England credibility <pause dur="0.5"/> you know we'd promised to maintain that exchange rate the Bank of England credibility <pause dur="0.4"/>

should be set at <pause dur="0.5"/> so much per cent <pause dur="0.5"/> because <pause dur="0.2"/> economic conditions are such that <pause dur="0.5"/> and he would elaborate on the economic conditions <pause dur="1.4"/> and the Governor himself looking at it from the Bank of England's perspective <pause dur="0.3"/> he was advised on what to say by <pause dur="0.9"/> what was then known as the Monetary Review Committee <pause dur="1.3"/> # it was just a monthly meeting of experts of economists <pause dur="0.4"/> and the Bank of England <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="1.0"/> okay <trunc>w</trunc> so once once <pause dur="0.2"/> once the Governor had met the Chancellor <pause dur="0.5"/> in fact the Chancellor gave instructions to the Governor <pause dur="0.2"/> as to what level of to set interest rate interest rates <pause dur="0.2"/> and the Bank would operate in the money markets <pause dur="0.6"/> to set those rates <pause dur="1.6"/> so <pause dur="0.9"/> the Governor-Chancellor meetings had gone on beforehand <pause dur="0.2"/> really what this entailed was <pause dur="0.4"/> an admission to the press that they had <unclear>#</unclear> because previously they tried to keep them a bit secret <pause dur="0.4"/> i mean no information about them used to be released <pause dur="1.7"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> they were formalized <pause dur="0.8"/><vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.6"/> obviously now under this regime there was no targets for the exchange

price expectation surveys <pause dur="0.4"/> like <pause dur="0.2"/> the unemployment rate like output like retail sales <pause dur="0.9"/> all the things one sees analysed in the newspapers <pause dur="0.3"/> which affects how the economy's <pause dur="0.3"/> heading or how we think the economy's <pause dur="0.3"/> going to look like in the future <pause dur="3.9"/> now <pause dur="0.3"/><vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/><pause dur="2.1"/> what do <pause dur="2.3"/> what does policy look like now <pause dur="1.3"/> well i'm going to jump a little bit <pause dur="0.6"/> # i'm going to come back to talk about the inflation target <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> forecast later on on the inflation report <pause dur="0.4"/> but <pause dur="0.4"/> to # pre-empt that <pause dur="0.4"/><kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="6"/> one of the <pause dur="0.2"/><vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/><pause dur="1.0"/> main <pause dur="0.4"/> aspects of the inflation report <pause dur="1.0"/> is this <pause dur="3.4"/> <unclear>between</unclear> <pause dur="1.2"/> no <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/><pause dur="0.2"/> this is the <pause dur="0.9"/> actually the forecast from August ninety-seven <pause dur="3.7"/> and right from when the inflation report <pause dur="0.2"/> was first published <pause dur="3.1"/> we # the Bank published a picture of what it thought <pause dur="0.2"/> inflation was going to look like in <pause dur="1.3"/> a number of years' time <pause dur="1.6"/> in doing so <pause dur="0.2"/> the Bank had to choose <pause dur="0.9"/> an inflation horizon <pause dur="0.3"/> 
because remember what inflation remember <trunc>d</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> what the inflation target looks like <pause dur="0.5"/> the inflation target <pause dur="0.3"/> at that time although it's changed a bit <pause dur="0.6"/> looked like <pause dur="0.5"/> you've got to achieve inflation of <pause dur="0.2"/> between one and four per cent <pause dur="0.5"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> below two-and-a-half per cent over a number of years <pause dur="2.6"/> there are several things the Bank could have done <pause dur="0.2"/> in terms of trying to meet that <pause dur="0.2"/> meet that # target <pause dur="1.5"/> it could have looked at inflation now <pause dur="0.7"/> and said <pause dur="0.4"/> look inflation now is <pause dur="0.3"/> # four per cent <pause dur="0.7"/> as it was at that time roughly <pause dur="0.2"/> four or five per cent <pause dur="1.7"/> us trying to meet an inflation target of two-and-a-half per cent of the <trunc>l</trunc> <pause dur="0.8"/> means that obviously inflation's too high we've got to try and bring it down so we need to raise interest rates <pause dur="2.4"/> but the Bank <pause dur="0.5"/> and <pause dur="0.3"/> any monetary policy person will tell you that that's <pause dur="0.2"/> that's wrong <pause dur="1.3"/> that's wrong because <pause dur="0.4"/> the Bank raising interest rates <pause dur="0.4"/> has no effect on inflation now <pause dur="0.5"/> it can't <pause dur="0.5"/> i mean inflation now is already in the system <pause dur="0.6"/> and interest rates <pause dur="0.7"/> if you think of <pause dur="0.2"/> almost a 
tree <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> interest rates are are right at the root of <pause dur="0.2"/> or the root of the tree <pause dur="0.9"/> at the end you've got inflation inflation's an outcome <pause dur="0.7"/> it takes <pause dur="1.6"/> a long time <pause dur="0.4"/> for interest rates to have an effect <pause dur="0.2"/> working right the way through the economy <pause dur="0.3"/> to affect inflation <pause dur="0.6"/> so looking at inflation now <pause dur="0.2"/> and basing interest rates decisions on that <pause dur="0.7"/> would have been <pause dur="0.2"/> incorrect because <pause dur="1.0"/> it well one just <pause dur="0.2"/> almost doesn't know what the effect of interest rate decisions now <pause dur="0.6"/> would be one doesn't know <pause dur="0.8"/> very <trunc>clear</trunc> the lags between the changes in monetary policy I-E changes in interest rates <pause dur="0.5"/> and final outcomes are notoriously <pause dur="0.7"/> long and variable now Milton Friedman <pause dur="0.2"/> i think was the first person to coin <pause dur="0.4"/> the <pause dur="0.5"/> long and variable lags in relation to monetary policy <pause dur="2.3"/> you change your <trunc>tr</trunc> interest rates now sometime in the future <pause dur="0.4"/> through <trunc>mil</trunc> Milton Friedman's black box or through whatever <pause dur="0.8"/> you're going to affect output and inflation <pause dur="0.3"/> and the whole the <unclear>rent</unclear> economy and the money <pause dur="2.8"/> so instead of 
looking at inflation now <pause dur="0.2"/> the Bank obviously had to look at inflation in the future <pause dur="0.6"/> but unfortunately that that means <pause dur="0.3"/> that the Bank has to try and forecast <pause dur="2.5"/> to an insider in the Bank of England the Bank <pause dur="0.3"/> having to place a huge amount of emphasis on a forecast was actually quite funny <pause dur="1.1"/> because Mervyn King <pause dur="0.9"/> who had been a professor at the L-S-E and who'd # <pause dur="0.2"/> been brought in <pause dur="0.3"/> really with a history in terms of <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> almost <pause dur="0.4"/> # corporate economics <pause dur="0.4"/> the economics of the firm <pause dur="0.4"/> he's famous for Kay and King about the tax system <pause dur="0.3"/> he's he's a brilliant microeconomist <pause dur="0.3"/> he'd for some reason been brought in as the Bank of England's Chief Economist <pause dur="0.5"/> who <pause dur="0.2"/> you normally think of as a macroeconomist <pause dur="1.6"/> he he not being a macroeconomist <pause dur="0.2"/> had a very very dim view of macroeconomics in general <pause dur="0.7"/> and of economic forecasting in particular <pause dur="1.3"/> he disliked <pause dur="0.3"/> the large macroeconomic models that were current <pause dur="0.4"/> at that time <pause dur="0.4"/> and those macroeconomic models were really <pause dur="0.6"/> at that time the things that would have been <pause dur="0.5"/> 
used to produce a forecast <pause dur="0.2"/> there's no other way <pause dur="0.3"/> that the Bank of England <pause dur="0.2"/> at that time would have produced a forecast they would have <pause dur="0.5"/> churned through the current situation in their model <pause dur="0.3"/> and got and one of the model would predict inflation would be in two years' time <pause dur="1.3"/> so Mervyn had arrived about two years before <pause dur="0.4"/> they produced this forecast and had <pause dur="0.2"/> almost scrapped the forecasting division <pause dur="1.2"/> so in this <pause dur="0.2"/> in this <pause dur="0.6"/> # situation where we <pause dur="1.2"/> had to produce a forecast we had almost almost # <pause dur="0.3"/> no means of doing so <pause dur="0.8"/> they had to <pause dur="0.3"/> reinvent <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> a forecasting mechanism quite quickly <pause dur="2.2"/> they did so <trunc>ba</trunc> <pause dur="0.3"/> # by the by by <pause dur="0.6"/> # developing a <pause dur="0.2"/> a much smaller macroeconomic model <pause dur="0.3"/> # they call it a six equation macroeconomic model <pause dur="0.6"/> it's an equation <pause dur="0.3"/> or # a model which is <pause dur="0.4"/> much more based on economic theory <pause dur="0.4"/> like it has a labour market which looks like a labour market you see in economic theory models <pause dur="0.4"/> and so on <pause dur="0.9"/> so it was that that was initially used to generate the forecast <pause dur="2.3"/> in terms of <pause dur="0.2"/> the forecast 
horizon <pause dur="0.4"/> right that's where <pause dur="0.2"/> that's the point at which <pause dur="0.3"/> the forecast is made and in this case it's August ninety-seven <pause dur="0.8"/> what the forecast does is look at what inflation's going to look like <pause dur="0.4"/> two years hence <pause dur="1.1"/> so the two year period <pause dur="0.4"/> is important <pause dur="0.3"/> it's what the Bank chose as its best <pause dur="0.7"/> notion <pause dur="0.3"/> of the <pause dur="0.4"/> time horizon of the effect of monetary policy <pause dur="0.5"/> it chooses two years <pause dur="0.3"/> it's important to remember that <pause dur="0.4"/> in choosing those two years what the Bank's saying is <pause dur="0.3"/> if we raise interest rates now <pause dur="0.3"/> we think that that's going to have a maximum effect on inflation <pause dur="0.5"/> in two years' time <pause dur="3.2"/> i'm going to talk about the interpretation of this forecast <pause dur="0.4"/> # a bit more in later lectures <pause dur="0.4"/> but just # <pause dur="0.3"/> to give you an idea <pause dur="0.4"/> these <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="1.2"/><kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> these bands <pause dur="0.5"/> are for those anyone who did stats last year they're confidence intervals <pause dur="0.2"/> right <pause dur="0.6"/> the middle <pause dur="0.3"/> point <pause dur="0.7"/> is <pause dur="1.2"/> the ten per cent <pause dur="0.2"/> region <pause dur="0.3"/> where inflation is most likely to be <pause dur="0.5"/> and it goes out in ten per cent <pause dur="0.5"/> intervals all the way so <pause dur="0.3"/><kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> this region <pause dur="0.2"/> between 
here and here it <unclear>would be</unclear> <pause dur="0.4"/> <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> <pause dur="0.2"/> twenty per cent <pause dur="0.3"/> here <pause dur="0.5"/> at the most these would be thirty and so on to ninety <pause dur="5.5"/> the forecast is a bit odd <pause dur="0.4"/> to be honest <pause dur="0.7"/> because <pause dur="0.4"/> like any forecast it's influenced by judgement <pause dur="1.4"/> you can turn out <pause dur="0.3"/> a forecast from a model but that isn't <pause dur="0.8"/> this it forecast <pause dur="0.2"/> now and even <pause dur="0.2"/> initially <pause dur="0.7"/> wasn't entirely model driven <pause dur="0.4"/> it has some judgement incorporated in it which i want to talk about <pause dur="0.6"/> a bit later <pause dur="2.6"/> so <pause dur="0.4"/> what we had now as a centrepiece for <pause dur="0.5"/> # monetary policy making <pause dur="0.3"/> is this inflation forecast <pause dur="3.0"/><kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="2"/> an inflation forecast <pause dur="0.3"/> really now <pause dur="0.2"/> now forms <pause dur="2.3"/> the intermediate target <pause dur="2.9"/> intermediate target <pause dur="0.3"/> okay <pause dur="0.2"/> we have a final target of inflation <pause dur="1.8"/> we can't affect inflation directly <pause dur="0.2"/> we need a means of doing so <pause dur="0.5"/> and that means is the intermediate target <pause dur="0.5"/> previous intermediate targets just <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> so you get the idea where the exchange rate under the E-R-M <pause dur="0.4"/> and money <pause dur="0.4"/> supply <pause dur="0.3"/> under money <pause dur="0.2"/> <trunc>mon</trunc> money target in the nineteen-eighties <pause dur="2.7"/> so <pause dur="1.3"/> as Mervyn <pause dur="0.2"/> King wrote <pause dur="0.3"/> quite early 
on <pause dur="0.5"/> <reading>the most appropriate guide to monetary policy is the best obtainable forecast <pause dur="0.3"/> of the probability distribution</reading> <pause dur="0.2"/> which is those <pause dur="0.4"/> kind of bands that i showed you <pause dur="0.5"/> for inflation <pause dur="0.3"/> <reading>over a time horizon defined by how long it takes # for a change in monetary policy to affect inflation <pause dur="1.2"/> and monetary policy is to be adjusted to maximize the probability <pause dur="0.5"/> of hitting the inflation target range</reading> <pause dur="1.1"/> in two years' time <pause dur="2.6"/> <vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.3"/> so that was the situation <pause dur="0.2"/> right from nineteen-ninety-two <pause dur="0.7"/> some changes have taken place since then <pause dur="1.0"/> in particular <pause dur="1.7"/> a small change but a meaningful one <pause dur="0.3"/> in nineteen-ninety-three <pause dur="0.7"/> was that the Bank of England was given discretion <pause dur="0.4"/> over the timing of interest rate changes <pause dur="1.8"/> now what does that mean <pause dur="0.3"/> well it means <pause dur="0.8"/> not it means that the Bank was no longer constrained to make that change immediately after the Governor-Chancellor meeting <pause dur="0.2"/> it can 
make it any time before the next meeting <pause dur="0.9"/> and the point of this <pause dur="0.3"/> it was it was actually <trunc>ins</trunc> <trunc>ins</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> instituted <pause dur="0.6"/> immediately after there'd been a furore in the press <pause dur="0.8"/> about the timing of interest rate changes from in relation to some <pause dur="0.3"/> local government elections <pause dur="0.4"/> the Governor <pause dur="0.4"/> was charged <pause dur="0.4"/> with or it it was it was claimed that the <pause dur="0.3"/> Chancellor had decided not to raise interest rates <pause dur="1.0"/> <trunc>speci</trunc> or and <pause dur="0.3"/> change the timing of interest rates specifically so they wouldn't rise just before some local government elections <pause dur="0.9"/> so that was relatively minor but it meant that the Bank could only change them within a month <pause dur="1.6"/> in fact <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> the markets get very jittery <pause dur="0.7"/> unless you tell them <pause dur="0.2"/> what the interest rate decision is <pause dur="0.7"/> # almost immediately after the meeting they start <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> they start their animal spirits going to quote Keynes' phrase <pause dur="0.6"/> and # <pause dur="0.3"/> get rather panicky if volatility rises so they have to really <pause dur="0.4"/> make the changes really soon after a meeting <pause dur="3.1"/> the next change was in <pause dur="0.2"/> 
April ninety-four <pause dur="1.0"/> this Treasury Select Committee the representatives of <pause dur="0.2"/> the House of Parliament <pause dur="0.2"/> had recommended that <pause dur="1.0"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> really they <trunc>sh</trunc> the Bank should be more open <pause dur="0.3"/> they should they should be more open about monetary policy <pause dur="1.8"/> and they should publish the minutes of the Governor-Chancellor meeting <pause dur="0.5"/> and they did so in ninety-four <pause dur="0.9"/> with a six week delay <pause dur="0.7"/> now previously <pause dur="0.8"/> interest rate decisions <pause dur="0.6"/> had not been made secret until after the <pause dur="0.4"/> # thirty year rule <pause dur="0.2"/> for <pause dur="0.2"/> for # not being made public until after the thirty year rule <pause dur="0.3"/> because they were regarded as secret <pause dur="1.5"/> okay so <pause dur="0.2"/> this was a big improvement in terms of transparency <pause dur="0.3"/> in terms of the openness of decisions <pause dur="3.3"/> the first <pause dur="0.3"/> then major <pause dur="0.2"/> restatement of the <pause dur="0.2"/> of the inflation target came in <pause dur="0.3"/> ninety-five <pause dur="2.1"/><kinesic desc="puts on transparency" iterated="n"/> now the Mansion House speech is worth looking out for <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> it's <pause dur="0.4"/> is often <pause dur="0.2"/> a scene for <pause dur="0.8"/> # the announcements of large policy changes and it certainly was in ninety-five <pause dur="1.4"/><vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.4"/> because <pause dur="0.6"/> the target was redefined <pause dur="0.4"/> as two-point-five per cent or less <pause dur="0.5"/> by spring 
ninety-seven <pause dur="0.2"/> and beyond <pause dur="3.0"/> really what this involved was a change of emphasis <pause dur="0.5"/> remember the first thing that had been said in the previous <pause dur="0.3"/> incarnation of the target <pause dur="0.3"/> that was really the range of one to four per cent <pause dur="1.6"/> now <pause dur="0.2"/> in order to <pause dur="0.5"/> # i guess show that <pause dur="0.2"/> that hadn't been a mistake <pause dur="0.2"/> it was just <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> it was it that it hadn't been a <trunc>s</trunc> mistake to say one to four per cent <pause dur="0.3"/> the Chancellor predicted that keeping inflation <pause dur="0.4"/> at about <pause dur="0.3"/> two-and-a-half per cent or less <pause dur="0.4"/> meant that inflation was going to range <pause dur="0.2"/> between one and four per cent <pause dur="0.4"/> over the long term <pause dur="1.0"/> okay <pause dur="0.6"/> it's important that <trunc>y</trunc> that you understand <pause dur="0.4"/> a bit about how the Bank works the Bank <pause dur="0.9"/> the Bank doesn't like to lose face so it didn't want to admit that it was wrong in setting one to four per cent range <pause dur="0.9"/> it <pause dur="0.4"/> it kind of restated it <pause dur="0.4"/> putting much more of the emphasis on the mid-point <pause dur="0.2"/> the two-and-a-half per cent <pause dur="0.5"/> although it added the caveat or less <pause dur="1.7"/> but keep it really almost scrapping the range just <pause dur="0.9"/> keeping it as a almost a 
sideline <pause dur="3.0"/> there are still questions a bit about the horizon <pause dur="0.5"/> i mean if you think about what the Bank's trying to do <pause dur="3.2"/> achieving an interest rate # an inflation rate <pause dur="0.2"/> of any given per cent <pause dur="1.0"/> is possible <pause dur="1.8"/> say if you want to if you say if you want to move from four per cent to two-and-a-half per cent <pause dur="1.7"/> that's obviously going to take some changes in interest rates <pause dur="0.9"/> if you pushed interest rates up to say fifteen per cent <pause dur="0.4"/> it's much more likely that you're going to get to two-and-a-half per cent quicker <pause dur="0.4"/> than if you pushed inflation <trunc>in</trunc> interest rates to nine per cent <pause dur="1.6"/> okay <pause dur="0.4"/> so you've got questions about the time horizon for policy <pause dur="1.3"/> does policy <pause dur="0.3"/> need to get there quicker <pause dur="0.6"/> or <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> can we move more slowly <pause dur="0.2"/> and more gently <pause dur="2.0"/> it's quite likely that there's some sort of trade-off <pause dur="0.4"/> in the sense that if you raise interest rates really high <pause dur="0.6"/> you're going to lose <pause dur="0.2"/> more output <pause dur="0.3"/> there's more likely to be a recession <pause dur="0.4"/> the faster <pause dur="0.2"/> monetary policy moves <pause dur="1.0"/> so the time horizon <pause dur="0.3"/> over which <pause dur="0.7"/> you have to 
achieve the target <pause dur="0.2"/> is really important <pause dur="0.5"/> can i leave it <pause dur="0.3"/> two years before i get two-and-a-half per cent <pause dur="1.3"/> Mervyn King interpreted this horizon to be over a long period <pause dur="0.5"/> and indeed <pause dur="0.6"/> often the word on average over a long period <pause dur="0.2"/> was used <pause dur="3.1"/> okay interest rate decisions at that time still taken by the Chancellor <pause dur="2.2"/> the Labour government <pause dur="2.7"/> changed all that <pause dur="5.2"/><kinesic desc="writes on transparency" iterated="n"/> after only four days in office <pause dur="0.7"/> shocking <pause dur="0.6"/> # not <pause dur="0.3"/> well shocking the press shocking the country <pause dur="0.6"/> and shocking the Bank of England itself <pause dur="1.8"/> Gordon Brown announced that they'd be independent <pause dur="0.9"/> i mean this is this is really a quite a surprise <pause dur="1.0"/> the Bank does have discussions with <pause dur="0.3"/> the opposition <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> but i'm sure that even they didn't expect <pause dur="0.6"/> to have that <pause dur="0.5"/> presented to them quite so quickly <pause dur="2.7"/> this is the current framework <pause dur="1.7"/> the Bank has what's known as operational responsibility for interest rates <pause dur="1.7"/> what does that mean well it's it has one form of independence it has operational independence <pause dur="6.1"/><kinesic desc="writes on transparency" iterated="n"/> 
it has to <pause dur="0.2"/> set interest rates <pause dur="0.5"/> and it can decide what interest rates <pause dur="0.2"/> it wants to set <pause dur="1.2"/> but it has to set them conditional <pause dur="0.3"/> on its <trunc>expaysh</trunc> <trunc>ec</trunc> its expectation that they're going to be consistent with <pause dur="0.4"/> the government's inflation target <pause dur="8.0"/><kinesic desc="writes on transparency" iterated="y" dur="8"/> now if the Bank <pause dur="0.4"/> had the possibility of setting the target as well <pause dur="1.8"/> it would be goal independent <pause dur="1.2"/> but it doesn't <pause dur="0.5"/> so it just has <pause dur="0.3"/> operational independence it can decide what <pause dur="0.3"/> what level to set the <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> interest rates at but it can't decide <pause dur="0.3"/> what it's aiming at <pause dur="4.0"/> the other new thing <pause dur="0.3"/> is <pause dur="0.2"/> that <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="1.2"/> in addition to the independence <pause dur="1.3"/> the Bank was not required simply <pause dur="0.3"/> to <pause dur="0.6"/> follow an inflation target <pause dur="0.9"/> but subject to that target it was required to <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> promote growth <pause dur="0.2"/> promote growth and finance basically <pause dur="2.0"/> there was also a restatement of the form of the target <pause dur="1.3"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="n"/> okay <pause dur="0.2"/> that two-and-a-half per cent <pause dur="0.5"/> is contrasted with the two-and-a-half per cent or less <pause dur="0.2"/> that was the <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> previous <pause dur="0.8"/> inflation target for the nation <pause dur="1.0"/> what's the difference here <pause dur="0.9"/> 
well two-and-a-half per cent is basically <pause dur="0.6"/> just a single point <pause dur="0.7"/> what you had before <pause dur="1.5"/> was <pause dur="0.3"/> two-and-a-half per cent <pause dur="1.6"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="2"/> or less in other words you could go lower <pause dur="2.1"/> Labour <pause dur="0.7"/> being slightly <pause dur="0.3"/> more pro-growth <pause dur="0.2"/> than the Conservatives <pause dur="0.3"/> thought it very important that the or less was scrapped <pause dur="0.4"/> why was that <pause dur="0.4"/> because it <pause dur="0.3"/> thought that if the Bank <pause dur="0.5"/> was run by someone who was very very hawkish <pause dur="0.4"/> and very very risk-averse <pause dur="0.5"/> the Bank would know <pause dur="0.4"/> that <pause dur="0.3"/> they couldn't go above two-and-a-half per cent but they could definitely go below and they'd still get a tick they'd still get a gold star for achieving their objective <pause dur="0.8"/> so hence they could actually <pause dur="0.2"/> the Bank under previous policy <pause dur="0.4"/> could actually <pause dur="7.4"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="6"/> could actually # have a much more deflatory policy than was actually good for the country <pause dur="1.6"/> so just <kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> this point target without the or less <pause dur="0.2"/> which is the current target <pause dur="0.3"/> is symmetric <pause dur="0.2"/> so the Bank has the same incentive to go above as it does below <pause dur="2.4"/> it's not commonly stated these days 
but <pause dur="0.5"/> a year ago <pause dur="0.8"/> there # quite a lot was made of <pause dur="1.0"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> this <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="n"/><kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> one percentage point higher or lower <pause dur="0.6"/> than the target <pause dur="0.4"/> so that's <pause dur="0.2"/> one-and-a-half to three <pause dur="0.2"/> three-and-a-half per cent <pause dur="1.2"/> if <pause dur="0.2"/> those limits are exceeded <pause dur="1.6"/> if inflation <pause dur="0.4"/> range is <pause dur="0.2"/> between one per cent <pause dur="0.3"/> higher or lower than target <pause dur="0.3"/> the <reading>Bank has to publish an open letter</reading><pause dur="1.5"/> supposedly to the Chancellor <reading>explaining why inflation has deviated from the target and what action it intends to take</reading> <pause dur="2.9"/> that's <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> that's a really interesting move <pause dur="0.3"/> and potentially <pause dur="0.2"/> highly embarrassing <pause dur="0.9"/> as Mervyn King <pause dur="1.0"/> now <pause dur="0.4"/> as <trunc>mer</trunc> Mervyn King reckons that this measure is quite likely to as he put it <pause dur="0.3"/> restore the lost art of letter writing <pause dur="0.2"/> to the British <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.8"/> people <pause dur="0.9"/> because he reckons it's actually quite <pause dur="0.2"/> likely <pause dur="0.5"/> that the inflation target's going <pause dur="0.3"/> # that inflation is going to be three-and-a-half <pause dur="0.2"/> more than three-and-a-half or less than one-and-a-half per cent <pause dur="1.2"/> so far it hasn't happened <pause dur="0.2"/> remarkably <pause dur="1.8"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> but if it did then the Bank would actually have to <pause dur="0.9"/> set out several things in 
a letter <pause dur="0.4"/> the way it's interpreted <pause dur="0.2"/><kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> this requirement <pause dur="0.5"/> is that the Bank is going to have to say <pause dur="0.4"/> why <pause dur="0.2"/> inflation has gone higher than the <pause dur="0.3"/> this <pause dur="0.2"/> this range <pause dur="0.7"/> in other words <pause dur="0.3"/> what specific shock to the economy <pause dur="0.5"/> it could be an exchange rate shock <pause dur="0.4"/> it could be <pause dur="1.0"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> really that's that's the main thing that's going to happen an exchange rate shock <pause dur="1.2"/> that left <pause dur="0.4"/> us <pause dur="0.4"/> really <pause dur="1.7"/> unable to keep inflation within the one one-and-a-half to three-and-a-half per cent <pause dur="0.4"/> band <pause dur="0.2"/> if you like to call it that <pause dur="2.1"/> and also the Bank has to say <pause dur="0.2"/> how long it's going to be before it reckons inflation's going to get back within the target <pause dur="0.5"/> # range <pause dur="1.5"/> but one one thing you've got to <pause dur="0.8"/> i guess be aware about this this little one per cent either side <pause dur="0.6"/> aspect is that they no longer call it a range it's not like the original one to four per cent <pause dur="1.3"/> it's supposedly just <pause dur="1.0"/> just a way of monitoring <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> the specifics of what the Bank actually does it's it's not it's not part of the target the target is actually regarded as 
two-and-a-half per cent <pause dur="0.9"/> it's not like the Bank is going to be <pause dur="0.4"/> excessively penalized <pause dur="0.5"/> it's not going to be regarded as failing <pause dur="0.4"/> in other words <pause dur="0.4"/> if it exceeds <pause dur="0.2"/> one-and-a-half <pause dur="0.3"/> per cent or three-and-a-half per cent <pause dur="0.3"/> it's just that it has to explain why <pause dur="2.6"/> so really there are no <pause dur="0.3"/> there are no actual limits <pause dur="0.4"/> to how far inflation goes <pause dur="0.5"/> above two-and-a-half <pause dur="0.4"/> or below two-and-a-half <pause dur="2.7"/><kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="5"/> which is different <pause dur="2.9"/> an important thing about the new <pause dur="0.5"/> regime <pause dur="0.2"/> is that <pause dur="0.2"/> it formalized <pause dur="2.4"/> how the inflation targets came to be renewed <pause dur="1.4"/> previously there'd just been the odd statement of what the target was <pause dur="0.4"/> but now it's institutionalized that every budget <pause dur="0.5"/> which occurs in <pause dur="0.6"/> November every budget you're going to have a restatement of the target <pause dur="0.6"/> but there was <pause dur="0.3"/> you know addendum that the there was no expectation that the two-and-a-half per cent will remain in force 
for at least the current current Parliament <pause dur="0.7"/> so you can expect <pause dur="0.3"/> every government to come in will make a major restatement of the target <pause dur="1.5"/> and then will <pause dur="0.3"/> will carry on through that Parliament <pause dur="3.0"/> in extreme circumstances the Treasury is allowed to overrule the Bank <pause dur="0.2"/> but those extreme circumstances what would they be like <pause dur="0.2"/> well they'd be like a war <pause dur="0.5"/> like a major crash on European stock markets <pause dur="0.6"/> maybe something like that <pause dur="6.0"/><kinesic desc="reveals covered part of transparency" iterated="n"/> okay <pause dur="0.4"/> now some institutional things had to change at the Bank obviously <pause dur="0.3"/> 'cause the Bank was now <pause dur="0.6"/> # given the task of setting interest rates itself it could decide what level of interest rates to set <pause dur="0.8"/> the Bank's not <pause dur="0.2"/> the Bank is a public <pause dur="0.6"/> is a public institution it's not privately owned <pause dur="0.3"/> but there was a need to control what the Bank did to monitor it <pause dur="0.3"/> to make it accountable <pause dur="0.7"/> and it <trunc>wa</trunc> that was done in various ways <pause dur="0.6"/> one way in particular <pause dur="0.4"/> was the setting up of the Monetary Policy 
Committee <pause dur="1.6"/> now <pause dur="0.8"/> this <pause dur="0.7"/> is a bit it it kind of parallels the Governor-Chancellor <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="1.2"/> meetings <pause dur="0.2"/><kinesic desc="writes on transparency" iterated="n"/> in the sense that <pause dur="0.2"/> there are four people on it <pause dur="0.4"/><kinesic desc="writes on transparency" iterated="y" dur="6"/> who are appointed <pause dur="2.8"/> by the Chancellor <pause dur="2.8"/> and those people are supposed to be <pause dur="0.2"/> experts <pause dur="0.3"/> in fact they're all economists of one sort <pause dur="0.9"/> Willem Buiter <pause dur="0.3"/> is i think still possibly on leave from Cambridge University <pause dur="0.4"/> Charles Goodhart from the L-S-E <pause dur="0.2"/> and he used to be <pause dur="0.2"/> Chief Economist at the Bank of England <pause dur="0.2"/> <unclear>#</unclear> <pause dur="0.7"/> DeAnne Julius <pause dur="0.2"/> is the <pause dur="1.7"/> honorary female on the committee <pause dur="0.6"/><vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" n="ss" dur="1"/> she used to be <pause dur="0.6"/> she used to be at British <pause dur="0.2"/> Airways i think <pause dur="0.6"/> and <pause dur="1.1"/> she's supposed to be the industry representative on the committee <pause dur="1.1"/> and Sir Alan Budd is an old mate of <pause dur="0.2"/> Mervyn King's <pause dur="0.3"/> he's from the Treasury he was the <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> Treasury <pause dur="0.5"/> Chief Economist under <pause dur="0.2"/> the previous government <pause dur="2.5"/> so they all know each other pretty well <pause dur="0.3"/> and to call them employments of the Chancellor is stretching it a bit because <pause dur="0.2"/> well i mean <pause dur="0.3"/> you know <pause dur="1.0"/> anyway as well as them <pause dur="0.3"/><vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" n="ss" dur="1"/> there's 
Eddie George the Governor <pause dur="1.1"/> the two Deputy Governors <pause dur="0.8"/> Clementi was appointed from the City <pause dur="0.3"/> and his responsibility <pause dur="0.2"/> is to look after <pause dur="0.9"/> really the markets <pause dur="0.4"/> the Bank can be divided into two <pause dur="0.3"/> you've got the <trunc>m</trunc> people who make monetary policy <pause dur="0.3"/> and the people who deal with the markets <pause dur="0.4"/> and the two are often at loggerheads <pause dur="0.4"/> so you've got these two Deputy Governors <pause dur="0.3"/><kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/>  this this chap is going to be <pause dur="0.2"/> be telling the committee <pause dur="0.4"/> what the response of the markets is going to be to any given interest rate decision <pause dur="0.3"/> and obviously that weighs heavily on the what the Bank's going to do <pause dur="0.7"/> Mervyn King used to be Chief Economist <pause dur="0.8"/> # but he's been promoted <pause dur="0.4"/> # he's obviously <pause dur="0.6"/> much more on on the economics side he's on the principal side he's also a <pause dur="0.7"/> eminent <pause dur="1.4"/> and enormously <pause dur="0.4"/> # respected economist <pause dur="0.7"/> Plenderleith again is on the market side Vickers is on the monetary policy side <pause dur="0.3"/> Vickers again <pause dur="0.3"/> is the current Vickers is the current Chief Economist <pause dur="0.3"/> but again a really bizarre appointment <pause dur="0.4"/> because <kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> this chap was from <trunc>ox</trunc> 
professor at Oxford University a very <pause dur="0.5"/> bright young professor <pause dur="0.5"/> but what's his what's his # background it's <trunc>noth</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> it's not macroeconomics what is it it's game theory <pause dur="1.1"/><vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" n="ss" dur="1"/> game theory <pause dur="0.4"/> bizarre <pause dur="0.6"/> but he's # again he's <pause dur="0.2"/> he's a very <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> you know able <pause dur="0.5"/> able person <pause dur="3.2"/> so <pause dur="1.5"/> right so that's the Monetary Policy Committee <pause dur="0.2"/> they meet monthly <pause dur="2.3"/> and again <pause dur="0.8"/> we have the situation that they've made a change which institutionalizes # <pause dur="0.3"/> things that were already happening <pause dur="0.4"/> because remember i told you that <pause dur="0.3"/> every month in the Bank the Monetary Review Committee met <pause dur="0.7"/> that Monetary Review Committee <pause dur="0.3"/> often had an informal vote as to what it thought interest rates should do <pause dur="1.2"/> that's been replaced by <pause dur="0.7"/><kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/>  these people at the top <pause dur="0.9"/> okay these people at the top <pause dur="0.3"/> but <pause dur="0.3"/> in the same way as they had before <pause dur="0.3"/> these people are advised by <pause dur="0.4"/> the economists in the Bank of England <pause dur="1.0"/> so you've almost got the same thing happening in the Bank you've 
still got a load of economists <pause dur="0.3"/> turning out what they think <pause dur="0.2"/> # responding to the <trunc>lat</trunc> <trunc>d</trunc> latest data in the month turning out what they think's going to happen to the economies <pause dur="0.4"/> and advising the people in the Bank <pause dur="0.4"/><kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> even these supposedly <pause dur="0.4"/> external <pause dur="0.3"/> appointed by the Chancellor experts <pause dur="0.3"/> they all have <pause dur="0.5"/> Bank <pause dur="0.5"/> # workers <pause dur="0.8"/> who are advising them as to what to think about the economy <pause dur="1.2"/> so really this was a major move by the Chancellor <pause dur="0.2"/> he's he's <pause dur="0.2"/> given up his right to <pause dur="0.8"/> right to set interest rates <pause dur="0.3"/> and given it almost totally to the Bank who are operating in a very similar system to the what they used to do before <pause dur="2.9"/> right one person one vote the Chancellor <trunc>ha</trunc> the Governor has <pause dur="0.3"/> an overriding vote a second vote if there's <pause dur="0.7"/> a tie <pause dur="0.5"/> then their decision's announced <pause dur="0.2"/> well after one day effectively they meet they the meetings supposedly go on for two days but <pause dur="0.3"/> on the morning of the second <pause dur="0.4"/> they announce their decision <pause dur="2.0"/> okay i'm i'm going to stop there <pause dur="0.5"/> regarding this but <pause dur="0.4"/> can you just # <pause dur="0.6"/> hang on for one minute <pause dur="0.3"/> 'cause i need to set times
