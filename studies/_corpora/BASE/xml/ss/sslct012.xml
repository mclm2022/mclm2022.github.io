sustainability <pause dur="0.5"/> they've been looking at the strategic <pause dur="0.2"/> level <pause dur="0.6"/> looking at strategic aspects <pause dur="0.4"/> around <pause dur="0.6"/> land <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.8"/> housing development transport <pause dur="1.0"/> now we we call it strategic but in fact there's as you probably gather by some of the stuff that <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> and <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> have been talking about <pause dur="0.4"/> there's quite a lot of local things <pause dur="0.3"/> in their lectures as well about local green transport plans and the like <pause dur="1.3"/> and i think that's a a sort of thing that i would <pause dur="0.3"/> emphasize vis-Ã -vis the exam when it comes <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> is that there is quite a bit of overlap between strategic aspects and the local aspects although there is a a formal division in the lecture programme <pause dur="0.5"/> there's a fair amount of crossover <pause dur="0.3"/> and in that sense <pause dur="0.4"/> when it comes to exams <trunc>d</trunc> doing questions you can use material <pause dur="0.6"/> from one <pause dur="0.3"/> block <pause dur="0.6"/> alongside <pause dur="0.2"/> the other block so there's no necessary divide <pause dur="0.3"/> which again <pause dur="0.3"/> reflects sustainable development sustainable development <pause dur="0.5"/> which is <pause dur="0.3"/> attempts to be holistic <pause dur="0.5"/> to integrate and deal with all these things together as much as 
possible <pause dur="0.2"/> it fits <pause dur="0.4"/> the kind of concepts of sustainability <pause dur="1.4"/> however <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="1.2"/> the next few weeks will be taken up with <pause dur="0.2"/> what we call local aspects local dimensions of sustainable development <pause dur="0.2"/> looking at U-K <pause dur="0.2"/> experience <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> i will be covering <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> material <pause dur="1.4"/> related to <pause dur="0.6"/> local authority <pause dur="0.4"/> what local authorities are doing in relationship to <pause dur="0.6"/> sustainable development <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="1.3"/> i will be <pause dur="0.2"/> looking at <pause dur="0.5"/> the local economy looking at local economic development <pause dur="0.2"/> and sustainable development what is a green economy <pause dur="0.3"/> if you like <pause dur="1.1"/> # <gap reason="name" extent="2 words"/> will be covering aspects of urban design looking at <trunc>sustain</trunc> sustainable urban design <pause dur="0.7"/> and finally the last <trunc>sess</trunc> session we'll do at the end of term <pause dur="0.6"/> will be me talking about the concept <pause dur="0.2"/> of the ecological city <pause dur="0.9"/> an ecological city is really <pause dur="0.3"/> an attempt to put together <pause dur="0.6"/> all the different aspects that you've been covering in this course <pause dur="0.7"/> as they apply to <pause dur="0.3"/> cities in general <pause dur="0.5"/> so in that sense it kind of goes back strategic again <pause dur="0.6"/> it starts strategic goes local and then comes 
back out <pause dur="1.6"/> so today's session <pause dur="0.5"/> # and what i'll do is i'll probably speak for about forty minutes <pause dur="0.2"/> take a break <pause dur="0.3"/> and then finish off <pause dur="0.3"/> after a coffee <pause dur="0.8"/> is i'm going to talk about <pause dur="0.2"/> # <trunc>l</trunc> the local <pause dur="0.5"/> # environment <pause dur="0.7"/> the <pause dur="0.2"/> role of local government <pause dur="1.2"/> and also look at the interaction <pause dur="0.5"/> with the community <pause dur="0.5"/> particularly through <pause dur="0.7"/> the idea and processes of Local Agenda <pause dur="0.2"/> Twenty-one <pause dur="0.6"/> which is the <pause dur="0.6"/> mechanism <trunc>o</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> i guess <pause dur="0.6"/> where local authorities are trying to engage <pause dur="0.3"/> with local communities <pause dur="3.0"/><vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/><pause dur="1.7"/> i've given out a handout which kind of <pause dur="0.9"/> gives the main <pause dur="0.3"/> points or the main headings that i will <trunc>re</trunc> be referring to you can annotate my <pause dur="0.3"/> note <pause dur="1.5"/> or write your own notes to add to them <pause dur="0.9"/> there's a fair amount of <pause dur="0.3"/> literature in the reading list that you can use <pause dur="0.4"/> and i've asterisked the stuff that i think is most relevant <pause dur="1.4"/> there is i think <trunc>t</trunc> <trunc>ab</trunc> again # but i'll mention this now and i'll mention again <trunc>le</trunc> next week there's one <pause dur="0.7"/> # journal which i find <pause dur="0.8"/> very relevant to the stuff that i cover <pause dur="0.8"/> it's called # <pause dur="1.3"/> and i think it's on the reading 
list actually on one of the the it's called <trunc>env</trunc> # Local Environment News <pause dur="1.3"/> which is in the # <pause dur="0.2"/> Land Management Resource Centre there's copies of Local Environment News <pause dur="0.5"/> in the Resource Centre <pause dur="1.1"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> and <pause dur="0.4"/> i've mentioned a few articles in the reading list from it but again it's worth having a flick through that journal <pause dur="0.5"/> because it's it's published every month <pause dur="0.6"/> it <pause dur="0.2"/><vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/> reports <pause dur="1.1"/> on various initiatives that are going on <pause dur="0.5"/> today <pause dur="1.8"/> going on at this moment in local authorities in local communities in local economies <pause dur="0.7"/> so you <trunc>c</trunc> if you skim through that journal you can pick up <pause dur="0.3"/> other <trunc>th</trunc> other things apart from i'm being talking about <pause dur="0.4"/> so again as a revision aid <pause dur="0.4"/> it's probably worth having a look at that journal <pause dur="0.5"/> # nearer the time when you get to the exam <pause dur="4.0"/> we're all aware <pause dur="0.5"/> as you've already <pause dur="0.9"/> mentioned or <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> has already mentioned with the <pause dur="0.6"/> the rise of the environmental agenda <pause dur="1.2"/> various environmental problems <pause dur="1.3"/> have arisen and been acknowledged <pause dur="1.0"/> in the media by academics <pause dur="0.3"/> by environmental pressure 
groups and now increasingly <pause dur="0.5"/> by the world's governments <pause dur="2.3"/> those issues <pause dur="1.1"/> like <pause dur="0.5"/> the pollution arising from economic processes <pause dur="0.5"/> the depletion of the ozone layer <pause dur="1.2"/> overexploitation <pause dur="0.2"/> of natural resources <pause dur="1.3"/> the loss and damage to habitats and wildlife <pause dur="1.8"/> population growth <pause dur="0.6"/> poverty and famine <pause dur="0.3"/> in certain parts of the world <pause dur="0.5"/> all those issues have sort of come together <pause dur="0.6"/> and being acknowledged <pause dur="0.7"/> they've led <pause dur="1.5"/> over the last thirty years or so to a number of <pause dur="1.7"/> major <pause dur="0.6"/> international agreements conferences <pause dur="1.2"/> # to legislation <pause dur="0.2"/> at different levels European <pause dur="0.2"/> directives <pause dur="0.8"/> U-K national <pause dur="0.8"/> acts of Parliament <pause dur="0.9"/> and again as part of the handout <kinesic desc="holds up handout" iterated="n"/> and again just as an aide-memoire <pause dur="1.6"/> i've got a i've i've sort of <pause dur="0.2"/> <trunc>d</trunc> constructed a broad picture <pause dur="1.2"/><vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.9"/> of some of those <pause dur="0.4"/> what i call pathways of environmental law <pause dur="1.8"/> the way that those issues have been picked up at different levels <pause dur="0.4"/> at the U-K level the European level and international level <pause dur="0.9"/> leading to <pause dur="0.4"/> conferences <pause dur="1.1"/> action plans <pause dur="0.8"/> strategies and acts <pause dur="0.4"/> and directives <pause dur="1.2"/> so again that's really sort of 
summarizing very briefly <pause dur="1.0"/> the major pieces <pause dur="0.5"/> of environmental law that have arisen <pause dur="1.0"/> particularly over the last <pause dur="0.2"/> thirty or so years <pause dur="9.0"/> this is <pause dur="0.9"/> a lot of these environmental issues have been identified at the global level <pause dur="0.2"/> have been seen to be global problems <pause dur="2.7"/> but there has been a push <pause dur="1.4"/> by <pause dur="0.2"/> national international organizations <pause dur="0.7"/> to act locally <pause dur="1.5"/> and there is a <pause dur="0.5"/> a rationale <pause dur="1.2"/> for local action <pause dur="1.4"/> particularly <pause dur="0.9"/><vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.6"/> the emphasis on local action very much came out <pause dur="0.9"/> of <pause dur="0.2"/> the Rio conference <pause dur="1.5"/> on Agenda Twenty-one <pause dur="1.6"/> in nineteen-ninety-two <pause dur="1.6"/> that conference that international conference produced <pause dur="3.4"/> an action programme for sustainable development into the twenty-first century <pause dur="1.5"/> and the whole emphasis of the Rio <pause dur="0.3"/> conference <pause dur="1.3"/> was <pause dur="0.8"/> on <pause dur="0.7"/> involving <pause dur="0.6"/> a range of stakeholders <pause dur="0.7"/> in sustainable development in the actions <pause dur="0.2"/> towards sustainable development <pause dur="2.6"/> it also emphasized widespread participation as widespread as possible <pause dur="0.3"/> to kind of <pause dur="0.3"/> expand the range of people <pause dur="0.9"/> that were working towards sustainable development <pause dur="4.7"/> also the other 
thing about Rio <pause dur="0.7"/> which again <gap reason="name" extent="2 words"/> probably has picked up on <pause dur="1.2"/> is that it defined <pause dur="0.6"/> sustainable development <pause dur="0.3"/> in quite broad terms <pause dur="1.0"/> it defined it in socio-economic <pause dur="0.3"/> terms <pause dur="0.2"/> not just environmental <pause dur="0.6"/> so the environmental problems <pause dur="1.5"/> that had risen <pause dur="1.1"/> to prominence <pause dur="0.9"/> were increasingly being redefined because <pause dur="0.8"/> it was <pause dur="0.7"/> humans <pause dur="0.2"/> it was us <pause dur="1.1"/> human beings social social animals <pause dur="0.4"/> who were causing <pause dur="0.5"/> and influencing environmental problems <pause dur="1.6"/> so <pause dur="0.2"/> words coming from Rio <pause dur="0.9"/> for sustainable development <pause dur="0.5"/> <reading>improving the quality of human life <pause dur="2.0"/> whilst living within the carrying capacity of supporting ecosystems</reading> <pause dur="0.9"/> that's the kind of message <pause dur="0.5"/> coming from Rio <reading>improving the quality of human life <pause dur="0.7"/> whilst living within the carrying capacity <pause dur="0.5"/> of supporting ecosystems</reading> <pause dur="2.5"/> so very it's very much again <trunc>de</trunc> defined in terms of <pause dur="0.5"/> human processes <pause dur="0.2"/> quality of life issues <pause dur="1.6"/> in relationship to environmental constraints <pause dur="4.7"/> one of the key outcomes of Rio <pause dur="0.2"/> of the Rio conference in ninety-two was <pause dur="0.5"/> Agenda Twenty-one <pause dur="1.6"/> chapter eight of Agenda 
Twenty-one <pause dur="2.5"/> called on the world's governments and local communities <pause dur="0.9"/> to prepare <pause dur="0.7"/> Local Agenda Twenty-ones <pause dur="1.5"/> for their countries and for local areas within them <pause dur="4.4"/> the need <pause dur="0.5"/> to operate at the local level <pause dur="0.8"/> the community level to produce these Local Agenda Twenty-ones <pause dur="2.1"/> was based on a <trunc>ver</trunc> # on a number of premises <pause dur="1.7"/><vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.8"/><vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.6"/> firstly <pause dur="0.6"/> the need to tackle environmental problems at all relevant levels <pause dur="1.1"/> in other words <pause dur="1.9"/> environmental problems were being caused by actions <pause dur="0.6"/> not just by <pause dur="0.4"/> international governmental policy <pause dur="0.4"/> but also by <pause dur="1.1"/> businesses <pause dur="0.4"/> organizations and individuals living their lives carrying out their businesses carrying out their functions <pause dur="1.1"/> so in order to tackle environmental problems you need to address them and act at all levels wherever wherever <pause dur="0.4"/> the decision making <pause dur="0.8"/> processes <pause dur="0.7"/> are taking place are causing <pause dur="0.2"/> or influencing the quality of the environment <pause dur="3.9"/> secondly <pause dur="0.6"/> another rationale for <trunc>ou</trunc> operating locally <pause dur="0.4"/> is to build <pause dur="0.4"/> consensus between all key interests <pause dur="2.8"/> in other words to incorporate <pause dur="1.2"/> all 
the major stakeholders all the groups as far as possible <pause dur="0.9"/> in this process of sustainable development <pause dur="2.9"/> and there was also an emphasis at Rio <pause dur="0.5"/> to include to be socially inclusive and include those groups that are normally marginalized <pause dur="1.2"/> so there's an emphasis <pause dur="1.3"/> on involving <pause dur="1.6"/> the poor <pause dur="0.2"/> the unemployed <pause dur="0.4"/> children <pause dur="2.7"/> ethnic groups <pause dur="3.5"/> male and females <pause dur="2.0"/> within <pause dur="0.3"/> the process <pause dur="3.9"/> in order to do that again you need to operate where people <pause dur="0.4"/> are <pause dur="0.2"/> operating themselves <pause dur="0.8"/> and communities are seen as one of the key areas where <pause dur="0.8"/> people see are identify with local areas and therefore those are the areas <pause dur="0.5"/> that are most meaningful <pause dur="0.7"/> for these people <pause dur="0.2"/> to be involved in decision making <pause dur="3.3"/> also <pause dur="0.5"/> apart from trying to involve people <pause dur="0.8"/> there was a need <pause dur="0.3"/> seen at the national international level to spread ownership to spread a sense of ownership <pause dur="0.5"/> of sustainable development <pause dur="0.7"/> down <pause dur="0.3"/> into local communities <pause dur="1.5"/> so the <trunc>s</trunc> the <trunc>n</trunc> the nations of the world at Rio were signing up <pause dur="0.5"/> some <pause dur="0.2"/> reluctantly <pause dur="0.7"/> others more enthusiastically <pause dur="0.5"/> but there was a feeling that <pause dur="0.6"/> this <pause dur="0.5"/> 
agreement at international level needed to <pause dur="0.4"/> permeate down <pause dur="0.2"/> through <pause dur="0.5"/> the different layers <pause dur="0.2"/> of government the different layers of society and economy <pause dur="2.0"/> and finally another rationale for local <pause dur="0.2"/> action <pause dur="0.5"/> in sustainable development <pause dur="1.0"/> is that it allows local solutions <pause dur="1.8"/> local decision making <pause dur="0.6"/> local knowledge <pause dur="0.3"/> to be used <pause dur="2.9"/> the <trunc>u</trunc> European Union <pause dur="0.7"/><vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.2"/> used the word <pause dur="0.4"/> subsidiarity <pause dur="1.7"/> to describe this <pause dur="0.2"/> that you should <pause dur="0.2"/> devolve <pause dur="0.2"/> power and decision making <pause dur="0.4"/> down as far as <pause dur="0.4"/> as is possible <pause dur="0.4"/> as far as is appropriate <pause dur="2.6"/> okay there will be some decisions there'll be some actions that needed to be taken internationally <pause dur="0.9"/> there'll be some that need to be taken at national level <pause dur="1.2"/> there's some that <trunc>n</trunc> need to be taken at regional level <pause dur="1.1"/> but there are others that need to be taken at the local level so again it's that idea of trying to <pause dur="0.8"/> devolve influence and power and decision making as much as possible <pause dur="1.9"/> so that's the kind of <pause dur="0.5"/> rationale <pause dur="0.5"/> arguments why <pause dur="0.5"/> you should have local <pause dur="0.8"/> action on sustainable development <pause dur="3.1"/> in terms of the U-K <pause dur="0.4"/><vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/><pause dur="2.4"/> there 
have been a number of <pause dur="0.2"/> phases since <pause dur="0.7"/> the late eighties i guess when <pause dur="0.5"/> after the <trunc>brundtla</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> Brundtland Report in eighty-seven <pause dur="0.4"/> local authorities and governments in the U-K started becoming aware and committed in various ways <pause dur="0.6"/> to sustainable development as a concept <pause dur="2.6"/> and in local authorities <pause dur="1.2"/> there was <pause dur="0.6"/> a significant <pause dur="0.4"/> # commitment <pause dur="0.7"/> produced <pause dur="1.2"/> during the late eighties and early nineties <pause dur="2.3"/> Jeremy <trunc>raemaek</trunc> Raemaekers' article which is on the reading list <pause dur="0.6"/> reviews <pause dur="0.8"/> action that was being taken in the <pause dur="1.4"/> late eighties and early nineties <pause dur="0.4"/> and in some respects his phases he's he's divided up into different phases <pause dur="1.2"/> his phases of action <pause dur="0.3"/> # # by local authorities <pause dur="1.8"/> are very much the ones that have continued so the work that was done in the early nineties has really continued through <pause dur="0.7"/> into the new century <pause dur="0.8"/> so it's worth just reviewing them <pause dur="2.0"/> the first phase <pause dur="0.9"/> of local authority action was was geared around <pause dur="1.1"/> producing environmental charters and action plans <pause dur="1.2"/><vocal desc="sniff" iterated="n"/><pause dur="1.4"/> 
now what happened was <pause dur="0.2"/> after Brundtland <pause dur="1.3"/> <trunc>a</trunc> an organization that is very astute an <trunc>e</trunc> environmental organization which is very astute Friends of the Earth <pause dur="2.8"/> said we want local government we want government in the U-K to take up <pause dur="0.2"/> take on board sustainable development <pause dur="0.5"/> so they what the <trunc>s</trunc> Friends of the Earth did is they produced a model charter <pause dur="0.3"/> you know <pause dur="1.0"/> for sustainable development <pause dur="1.0"/> it's really a kind of a a policy <pause dur="0.2"/> statement or commitment <pause dur="0.3"/> by an organization to the principles of sustainable development <pause dur="0.8"/> and Friends of the Earth produced this charter <pause dur="0.3"/> and sent it to all the chief execs the chief executives of all local authorities in the U-K <pause dur="0.4"/> and said <pause dur="0.5"/> you should be signing up to this Brundtland there's been a Brundtland Report United Nations is pushing this <pause dur="0.3"/> the <trunc>uni</trunc> the European Union is pushing this <pause dur="0.3"/> you need to take action at the local level <pause dur="1.3"/> and so they produced this <pause dur="0.6"/> model charter and said you could do this <pause dur="1.0"/> and of course local local authority chief execs said <pause dur="0.3"/> oh look they've already got they've 
already done one for us <pause dur="1.3"/> so we can use this one <pause dur="0.3"/> so you know the <trunc>ch</trunc> Friends of Earth are very astute they say well if you give them <pause dur="0.2"/> what they need <pause dur="0.5"/> without them having to do much work for it they'll use it and that  and that's what basically happened local authorities started signing up <pause dur="0.6"/> producing these environmental charters <pause dur="0.6"/> which is really <pause dur="0.9"/> just a commitment <pause dur="0.2"/> it was a broad statement of commitment <pause dur="1.2"/> to the principles of sustainable development <pause dur="3.1"/> and also <pause dur="0.3"/> at about the same time <pause dur="1.1"/> so that kind of put it on the agenda that put it on the local agenda <pause dur="1.6"/> at the same time local authorities started saying well what do we do <pause dur="0.7"/> environmentally <pause dur="1.1"/> you know let's <pause dur="0.2"/> let's <pause dur="0.3"/> have a look <pause dur="0.3"/> at our environmental practices <pause dur="0.5"/> 'cause 'cause local authorities <pause dur="0.8"/> who have been involved in environmental health waste disposal <pause dur="0.4"/> planning and development <pause dur="0.7"/> were involved in environmental <pause dur="0.2"/> policy anyway <pause dur="1.5"/> so they they started producing <pause dur="0.3"/> kind of quick and dirty and i think that is the key words quick and dirty <unclear>and then</unclear> dirty  
quick and dirty <pause dur="0.4"/> action plans <pause dur="0.7"/> so they kind of they asked all the departments of the local authority <pause dur="2.1"/> what are we doing what are you doing <pause dur="0.2"/> that <pause dur="0.9"/> is supporting sustainable development <pause dur="0.6"/> so all the departments wrote back with what <pause dur="0.2"/> what actions they are doing <pause dur="0.5"/> to support <pause dur="1.5"/> # environmental protection and sustainable development <pause dur="0.6"/> and local authorities <pause dur="0.2"/> often quickly produced these and said right this is our <trunc>environment</trunc> this is our statement of environmental action <pause dur="1.1"/> this is what we are doing <pause dur="0.2"/> and maybe even intending to do <pause dur="1.2"/> so that that first phase <pause dur="0.4"/> which was in about the late <pause dur="0.2"/> you know <pause dur="0.2"/> from eighty-seven through to <pause dur="0.4"/> eighty-nine <pause dur="0.2"/> very quick stuff <pause dur="1.4"/> really put sustainable development on the local political agenda and also <pause dur="0.9"/> made initial commitment by local authorities and also outlined what they were doing <pause dur="0.6"/> in this area <pause dur="3.2"/> second phase <pause dur="1.1"/> was the production of State of the Environment Reports <pause dur="1.4"/> SOTERs <pause dur="0.2"/> for <shift feature="voice" new="laugh"/> short <shift feature="voice" new="normal"/><pause dur="0.9"/> State of the Environment Reports and Environmental Audits <pause dur="2.1"/> these were a <pause dur="0.2"/> a bit more thorough <pause dur="0.3"/> 
so you've got the quick and dirty stage one <pause dur="0.9"/> once that the dust had settled on them they said right <pause dur="1.0"/> # we need to <pause dur="0.2"/> map out the state of our local environment <pause dur="3.5"/> so <pause dur="0.4"/> and it usually was planning departments who had access to <trunc>m</trunc> a lot of this information <pause dur="0.8"/> produced documents which ranged in thickness from <pause dur="0.3"/> so thick to so thick <pause dur="0.4"/> or in volumes <pause dur="0.5"/> which kind of mapped out the state of the local authority's environment <pause dur="0.7"/> so they looked at their environmental assets their environmental problems <pause dur="0.9"/> they mapped <pause dur="0.4"/> so G-I-S started becoming used <pause dur="0.2"/> G-I-S was used to map out <pause dur="0.8"/> the various <pause dur="1.9"/> environmental resources <pause dur="0.2"/> operating locally the <trunc>pr</trunc> you know the <trunc>s</trunc> the sites of <trunc>s</trunc> <trunc>scienti</trunc> special scientific interest <pause dur="1.0"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> areas of outstanding natural beauty <pause dur="0.3"/> nature reserves <pause dur="0.9"/> that kind of thing <pause dur="0.2"/> it was very much a mapping <pause dur="0.6"/> exercise of the state of the local environment <pause dur="1.3"/> at about the same time circa nineteen-ninety <pause dur="1.3"/> they also started to be a bit more thorough <pause dur="0.3"/> about the local authority's <pause dur="0.3"/> actions <pause dur="1.0"/> 
they started undertaking environmental audits <pause dur="0.4"/> of local authority policies <pause dur="1.1"/> and practices <pause dur="4.1"/> this is where i bring in my one of my overheads # <pause dur="1.2"/> yes <pause dur="0.4"/> i've got a overhead which kind of <pause dur="0.8"/><kinesic desc="puts on transparency" iterated="n"/> shows the # <pause dur="1.4"/> what we're talking about here <pause dur="1.7"/> this is a this is this is the sophisticated version <pause dur="0.8"/> of what a # <pause dur="1.0"/> environmental audit should be doing <pause dur="4.4"/> this is # <pause dur="1.1"/> like i say something that's been developed over time <pause dur="1.1"/> the idea behind eco-audit is to appraise your policies and actions as an organization it can be a private organization like a developer <pause dur="0.2"/> and developers have done these things as well <pause dur="1.0"/> or a business like B-T or Shell <pause dur="0.6"/> or a local authority <pause dur="0.2"/> in this case <pause dur="1.8"/> you need as part of the a start in the process you need to get that <trunc>co</trunc> corporate commitment <pause dur="0.7"/> which is what these charters really did they sort of <pause dur="0.3"/> put the thing on the agenda <pause dur="1.6"/> you need to <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> review initial review of your environmental impacts of you policies and your practices <pause dur="1.1"/> so the policies you have <pause dur="1.1"/> the money you spend where you spend it <pause dur="0.7"/> 
what impact does it have on the environment <pause dur="2.8"/> you should and this again is a case of <trunc>sh</trunc> lots of shoulds in here <vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/> you should produce an environmental policy <pause dur="2.0"/> which kinds of maps out what you intend to do <pause dur="0.7"/> what the objectives are of the council the local authority <pause dur="2.4"/> you should specify that in terms of actions and targets <pause dur="2.1"/> and then you kind of enter <pause dur="0.2"/> you enter this circle this <pause dur="3.8"/> benevolent circle of environmental care i guess you might call it <pause dur="1.7"/> <trunc>s</trunc> having specified actions and targets that you are going to undertake as an organization <pause dur="0.7"/> you gain corporate <pause dur="0.9"/> management commitment through a a management programme to implement the policy <pause dur="0.2"/> so you basically spread these targets these commitments these policies <pause dur="0.4"/> throughout the organization you get them to sign up <pause dur="0.6"/> to do things <pause dur="1.4"/> like <pause dur="0.9"/> increase recycling <pause dur="0.3"/> locally or <pause dur="0.6"/> to <pause dur="0.3"/> # protect <pause dur="0.9"/> all your nature reserves or to manage then improve those areas <pause dur="0.6"/> so those are the kind of things you might include in there <pause dur="2.1"/> you <pause dur="0.2"/> undertake internal audits to 
check whether things are happening so you check that people are doing these things and that the the the the the targets are being met <pause dur="1.0"/> you produce an environmental report <pause dur="1.3"/> you <pause dur="0.3"/> you can and you should <pause dur="0.6"/> to be <pause dur="0.3"/> # authorized <trunc>un</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> through this get verification from an independent <pause dur="0.6"/> auditor <pause dur="0.4"/> there's environmental auditors who can check <pause dur="0.5"/> that <pause dur="0.5"/> what you've done is correct <pause dur="0.9"/> and you can register for <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="2.5"/> under the <trunc>nati</trunc> as a national standard that you have got the system in place and you're implementing it <pause dur="0.5"/> and then you basically keep going around in circles <pause dur="0.9"/> refining improving <pause dur="0.5"/> developing new targets developing new policies to improve your environmental performance <pause dur="1.3"/> that is the ideal <pause dur="0.4"/> kind of auditing system we're talking about <pause dur="1.1"/> in the early days <pause dur="0.6"/> local authorities <pause dur="1.3"/> were not shall we say as <pause dur="0.2"/> sophisticated in in this and they were basically just doing initial assessments <pause dur="0.4"/> targeting and <pause dur="0.9"/> implementation processes <pause dur="6.0"/> but <pause dur="0.4"/> phase two <pause dur="0.8"/> in the early nineties moved to phase three <pause dur="0.9"/> phase three was <pause dur="0.3"/> 
very much more using this <pause dur="2.6"/> to produce an environmental management system <pause dur="1.6"/> to try and <pause dur="0.6"/> make this <pause dur="0.2"/> a self-sustaining process <pause dur="1.9"/> so they moved from <pause dur="0.2"/> if you like <pause dur="0.2"/> a partial auditing <pause dur="0.2"/> process to a full <trunc>i</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> auditing process <pause dur="1.0"/> and for instance <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> <pause dur="0.7"/> and i often use <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> 'cause <pause dur="0.3"/> for <pause dur="0.6"/> <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> Borough as an example <pause dur="0.5"/> <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> Borough implemented this kind of system <pause dur="0.9"/> an environmental management system <pause dur="1.4"/> for its # leisure services department <pause dur="0.8"/> it's interesting that they haven't got much further than that <pause dur="0.7"/> because it takes a lot of effort <pause dur="0.5"/> to get these things up and running a lot of <pause dur="0.6"/> political commitment and a lot of officer commitment <pause dur="0.3"/> to actually run with these kind of things <pause dur="0.6"/> to create a kind of <trunc>e</trunc> environmental audit <pause dur="0.4"/> a management system <pause dur="0.7"/> which is <pause dur="0.2"/> self-sustaining <pause dur="4.2"/> so stage three was if you like a more sophisticated version of the earlier <pause dur="0.4"/> auditing process moving into <pause dur="0.5"/> a management system which runs constantly <pause dur="0.7"/> through the organization <pause dur="2.8"/> at about the same time <pause dur="1.5"/> this is sort of <pause dur="0.3"/> ninety-two three 
four five onwards <pause dur="2.2"/> in response to Rio <pause dur="1.4"/> in ninety-two <pause dur="0.9"/> local authorities many local authorities started developing their own Local Agenda Twenty-one <pause dur="3.0"/> and you can see these two things in parallel <pause dur="1.1"/> this kind of environmental audit and management system is very much looking at the local authority <pause dur="0.7"/> internally it's an internal <pause dur="0.3"/> organizational <pause dur="0.2"/> tool <pause dur="0.7"/> for improving environmental <pause dur="0.2"/> performance <pause dur="1.6"/> Local Agenda Twenty-one is a more external <pause dur="0.4"/> process <pause dur="0.5"/> it is outside the local authority <pause dur="5.7"/> it involves <pause dur="2.3"/> engaging in <pause dur="0.5"/> dialogue <pause dur="1.6"/> developing <pause dur="1.5"/> action <pause dur="1.2"/> programmes <pause dur="0.6"/> with partners with the stakeholders <pause dur="1.4"/> with community groups with businesses <pause dur="0.2"/> with schools <pause dur="0.5"/> with <pause dur="0.6"/> other organizations <pause dur="0.4"/> that are working living and operating locally <pause dur="3.6"/> so you can see these two as linked <pause dur="0.5"/> the environmental management systems <pause dur="0.2"/> internal <pause dur="0.7"/> to the organization <pause dur="0.4"/> Local Agenda Twenty-one much more <pause dur="0.2"/> external <pause dur="1.1"/> but basically <pause dur="0.3"/> developing the same idea of trying to 
build action <pause dur="0.8"/> programmes <pause dur="0.7"/> policies and actions <pause dur="0.3"/> to support sustainable development at the local level <pause dur="2.4"/> there is i guess possibly a <trunc>s</trunc> a phase five <pause dur="1.1"/> in the <trunc>la</trunc> latter part of the # <pause dur="1.4"/> nineteen-nineties <pause dur="2.7"/> some new tools started being used more often <pause dur="3.2"/> as part of this broad programme <pause dur="1.1"/> things like sustainability appraisals were <trunc>d</trunc> being done <pause dur="3.0"/> so <pause dur="0.2"/> policies and <trunc>pla</trunc> plans and programmes <pause dur="1.0"/> the local authority have like their <pause dur="0.2"/> development plan <pause dur="1.8"/> or their economic development strategy or their tourism strategy <pause dur="0.7"/> or their housing strategy <pause dur="3.9"/> were appraised <pause dur="0.3"/> they were looked at <pause dur="0.4"/> and checked <pause dur="0.3"/> against sustainability criteria <pause dur="1.8"/> at the same time <pause dur="0.9"/> local authorities <pause dur="0.6"/> started <pause dur="0.2"/> as did the government started developing indicators in other words ways to measure <pause dur="0.2"/> sustainable development <pause dur="2.3"/> sometimes these were kind of technical <pause dur="0.4"/> you know energy efficiency <pause dur="0.5"/> per <pause dur="0.9"/> per housing <pause dur="0.2"/> you you know <pause dur="0.2"/> in in relationship to housing units <pause dur="0.7"/> or it could be <trunc>mu</trunc> much more # broad like <pause dur="0.4"/> having fish <pause dur="0.5"/> certain types of fish <pause dur="0.4"/> in the river <pause dur="0.7"/> but that was a kind of indicator that things were getting better <pause dur="0.6"/> that there were improvements in the environment <pause dur="1.3"/> 
and also at the same time targets were being developed <pause dur="0.4"/> so again <pause dur="0.3"/> they were getting much stronger on developing targets <pause dur="0.9"/> what are we trying to improve how much by how much <pause dur="2.0"/> so <pause dur="0.6"/> you could say that <pause dur="0.2"/> the mid-<pause dur="0.2"/>nineties with <pause dur="0.5"/> environmental management systems and local agenda <pause dur="0.8"/> rolled forward <pause dur="0.2"/> into the current <pause dur="0.2"/> century <pause dur="1.0"/> developing some new tools <pause dur="1.2"/> sustainability appraisals indicators and targets <pause dur="0.3"/> to try and develop <pause dur="0.2"/> this theme <pause dur="3.8"/><vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/><pause dur="2.7"/> what i'll do is i'll just cover <trunc>s</trunc> <pause dur="0.4"/> in <trunc>bi</trunc> little bit more detail <pause dur="0.3"/> some points about state of the environment reporting <pause dur="0.3"/> and then we'll have a break <pause dur="0.6"/> and come back and talk about Local Agenda Twenty-one <pause dur="8.5"/> the rationale for state of the environment reporting <pause dur="1.1"/> before developing an action programme <pause dur="1.6"/> local authorities <pause dur="0.3"/> need to identify it and quantify the nature <pause dur="0.5"/> of <pause dur="0.3"/> the environment or the environmental assets <pause dur="1.2"/> and problems in an area <pause dur="0.3"/> so in order to actually <trunc>sta</trunc> 
before you start taking action <pause dur="0.8"/> in this sphere <pause dur="1.0"/> you need to identify the state of the environment so that's the reason <pause dur="0.4"/> for undertaking a state of the environment report <pause dur="2.4"/> another <pause dur="0.8"/> reason <pause dur="0.2"/> why local authorities did state of the environment reports <pause dur="1.3"/> was they saw it as an opportunity to start bringing in <pause dur="0.6"/> outside partners <pause dur="1.3"/> because in order to get some of this information and data <pause dur="0.7"/> local authorities had to contact other organizations <pause dur="3.1"/> and <pause dur="0.6"/> particularly some of the environmental <pause dur="0.2"/> groups <pause dur="0.8"/> Friends of the Earth <pause dur="1.6"/> Royal Society for the Protection of Birds <pause dur="1.2"/> Greenpeace <pause dur="0.9"/> local <trunc>environm</trunc> # <pause dur="0.2"/> wildlife trusts <pause dur="1.0"/> had information that that was was plugged into this state of the environment report <pause dur="0.9"/> so in that sense it also was part <pause dur="0.7"/> of the process of going outside of the local authority <trunc>invol</trunc> starting starting <pause dur="0.3"/> to involve people <pause dur="2.3"/> there are numerous examples of state of the environment reports <pause dur="1.0"/> # <pause dur="1.0"/> there is a <pause dur="0.5"/> a kind of U-K <pause dur="1.2"/> version <pause dur="0.8"/> of state of the environment <pause dur="1.2"/> it's <trunc>basic</trunc> the indicators <pause dur="0.6"/> report done in 
nineteen-ninety-six <pause dur="0.6"/> which kind of maps out the state of the U-K environment <pause dur="1.6"/> there's there's been state of the <trunc>re</trunc> <pause dur="0.3"/> environment reports done at city-wide level <pause dur="0.2"/> LPAC <pause dur="0.2"/> did one for London <pause dur="1.2"/> to look at the state of London's environment <pause dur="2.6"/> Hertfordshire <pause dur="0.2"/> have got two a two volume <pause dur="0.7"/> thick <pause dur="0.2"/> state of the environment report <pause dur="2.1"/> <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> before it was abolished <pause dur="1.8"/><event desc="student enters room" iterated="n" n="sf1149"/> <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> just before it was abolished <pause dur="2.6"/> produced a state of the environment report which was very thin <pause dur="0.2"/> very short summary of it <pause dur="3.2"/> do you want a <pause dur="0.2"/> a handout to help you on your way <pause dur="2.9"/><event desc="passes student a handout" iterated="n"/> we're kind of # <pause dur="0.5"/> oh we're actually only on we're only on number two </u><u who="sf1149" trans="latching"> okay <unclear>thank you</unclear> </u><pause dur="3.1"/><u who="nm1148" trans="pause">  <vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/> <pause dur="5.6"/> <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> which which <pause dur="0.2"/> <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> Borough prides itself on its environmental performance and its <pause dur="0.2"/> commitment to sustainable sustainable development <pause dur="0.9"/> but they only produced a state of the environment report in nineteen-ninety-seven they were quite late <pause dur="0.4"/> compared to many local authorities <pause dur="2.2"/> but it's interesting the later state of the environment reports often include much more social <pause dur="1.1"/> 
information <trunc>s</trunc> social data <pause dur="0.7"/> so for instance <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/>'s <pause dur="0.2"/> has <pause dur="0.2"/> chapters and indicators on social on the social environment <pause dur="0.9"/> on economic development <pause dur="0.7"/> and on health <pause dur="2.1"/> so the later state of the environment reports started to spread out <pause dur="0.2"/> into this <pause dur="0.2"/> broader range of socio-economic <pause dur="0.5"/> information <pause dur="3.7"/><vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.2"/> there are <pause dur="0.3"/> a number of issues and problems <pause dur="0.3"/> with regard to <pause dur="0.8"/> undertaking these state of the environment reports <pause dur="3.0"/> it takes time to produce them <pause dur="0.3"/> it takes a lot of energy to get <trunc>t</trunc> the data together <pause dur="4.5"/> and it takes resources <pause dur="0.8"/> so many local authorities <pause dur="1.0"/> haven't done a state of the environment report because of that problem <pause dur="1.5"/> or like <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> <pause dur="0.9"/> delayed it until <pause dur="0.2"/> late in the nineteen-nineties <pause dur="2.8"/> some local authorities actually use consultants <pause dur="0.6"/> to produce <pause dur="0.4"/> state of the environment reports so they actually use consultants to do this job for them <pause dur="8.8"/> so there are difficulties and issues around the time and resources required <pause dur="1.3"/> there's another problem which is a a <trunc>sen</trunc> or ownership sustainable development is 
supposed to build a sense of ownership <pause dur="0.3"/> you remember <pause dur="2.2"/> and most of these state of the environment reports are prepared by the local authority by officers <pause dur="1.0"/> a kind of technical exercise of collecting information <pause dur="5.1"/> some like Humberside before it was abolished another county that was abolished <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> Humberside County Council used consultants to do it <pause dur="1.0"/> but again there's a difficulty you're you're basically handing over the ownership of this process to outside <pause dur="0.3"/> parties <pause dur="2.3"/> in one at least one case # Gloucestershire <pause dur="0.7"/> Gloucestershire County <pause dur="0.2"/> got a <pause dur="0.5"/> a forum of stakeholder groups together <pause dur="1.6"/> an environmental forum and they <pause dur="1.1"/> were the organization that produced the state of the environment report <pause dur="0.3"/> this again was the <pause dur="0.3"/> probably the best example one of the best examples <pause dur="0.3"/> of trying to spread ownership and involvement <pause dur="0.5"/> in this stage <pause dur="0.7"/> by getting a range of stakeholder groups environmental groups businesses <pause dur="0.3"/> community groups <pause dur="0.4"/> to actually <pause dur="0.3"/> put together this report helped <pause dur="0.3"/> build <pause dur="0.5"/> this sense of 
ownership <pause dur="1.2"/> but many like i say <pause dur="0.8"/> ended up <pause dur="0.3"/> being left on a shelf as a technical <pause dur="0.3"/> exercise <pause dur="3.3"/> another issue <pause dur="0.2"/> was the range of issues that it incorporated <pause dur="1.5"/> many of the early ones and <pause dur="0.2"/> many of them generally concentrate on the physical environment <pause dur="4.0"/> more recently as i mentioned <pause dur="0.2"/> in the case of <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> <pause dur="1.1"/> they've <pause dur="0.5"/> expanded <pause dur="0.5"/> the kind of issues to look at what you might call the social <pause dur="0.9"/> environment as well as the physical <pause dur="0.3"/> natural <trunc>envi</trunc> environment <pause dur="2.5"/> so <trunc>so</trunc> some <pause dur="0.6"/> tackle <pause dur="0.6"/> the environment in <pause dur="0.7"/> in one way and some in <trunc>oth</trunc> in another <pause dur="2.1"/> finally <pause dur="0.6"/> questions can be raised about state of the environment reports <pause dur="0.4"/> i should have brought a couple along to show you but <pause dur="1.3"/> they end up often being a collection of facts <pause dur="0.7"/> with little direction <pause dur="0.7"/> they're really just a <pause dur="0.2"/> a research <pause dur="0.3"/> information collection exercise <pause dur="0.8"/> and once you've produced it you say so what almost <pause dur="0.2"/> there is a danger of saying so what <pause dur="4.0"/> certainly the best <pause dur="2.0"/> local state of the environment reports were then used were then taken forward <pause dur="0.9"/> as part of the 
environmental action programme <pause dur="0.3"/> so they actually were <pause dur="1.4"/> linked <pause dur="0.3"/> to subsequent policies <pause dur="0.6"/> and strategies that were being developed <pause dur="1.8"/> Lancashire's # <pause dur="1.1"/> environmental forum was a very good example of this <pause dur="0.2"/> there's an environmental forum in Lancashire <pause dur="0.5"/> and they produced a state of the environment report which was then quickly turned <pause dur="0.4"/> into an action plan <pause dur="7.8"/> in response to some of these issues <pause dur="0.5"/> some local authorities are developing <pause dur="0.2"/> more holistic <pause dur="0.9"/> and more focused sustainability reports <pause dur="2.1"/> i mentioned Lancashire <pause dur="1.7"/> they produced this initial <trunc>acti</trunc> # <pause dur="0.3"/> state of the environment report which then influenced the policy making <pause dur="0.3"/> then they did a second one they did a second green audit <pause dur="1.4"/> which was a lot more focused around the policies that they were developing at the time <pause dur="1.5"/> and also a lot more holistic it covered health <pause dur="0.5"/> poverty <pause dur="1.0"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> economic development et cetera <pause dur="6.6"/> they also have been used again where they've been useful they've been used <pause dur="0.9"/> often as a basis for then deciding on indicators <pause dur="0.9"/> in

Agenda Twenty-one statement <pause dur="3.5"/><vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/><pause dur="1.3"/> there were a number though with no commitment <pause dur="0.5"/> no response <pause dur="1.5"/> or <pause dur="1.0"/> a <trunc>c</trunc> <trunc>d</trunc> definite commitment not to do one <pause dur="0.8"/><vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/><pause dur="2.0"/> however that's <pause dur="0.2"/> a <trunc>s</trunc> sizable minority majority i suppose sizable majority of <pause dur="0.6"/><vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/> local authorities <pause dur="1.0"/> have been working on it <pause dur="0.4"/><vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/><pause dur="4.3"/> in terms of <pause dur="0.3"/><vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/> oh boy <pause dur="0.3"/> how local authorities have done this <pause dur="1.0"/> # Steven Young and this again that's # # on the reference list Steven Young has done some research survey work looking at local authorities researching them <pause dur="1.2"/> # done a <pause dur="0.2"/> a kind of comprehensive review as as far as possible <vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/> of the different approaches to Agenda Twenty-one <pause dur="0.7"/> at the local level <pause dur="1.2"/> and he's identified <pause dur="0.2"/><vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/><pause dur="1.0"/> four basic approaches that local authorities have <pause dur="0.2"/> have used <pause dur="0.3"/> to produce <pause dur="0.9"/> these <pause dur="0.4"/> action plans these statements of sustainable development at the local level <pause dur="1.0"/> firstly # <vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/> a top down strategy <pause dur="2.8"/> in which the local authority <pause dur="0.2"/><vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.4"/> is firmly in control of the process <pause dur="1.2"/> # maybe involves consultation <pause dur="0.2"/> with # <pause dur="0.5"/> inverted commas around consultation <pause dur="2.2"/> involves some consultation with local 
community groups and local environmental groups but very much it's a local authority controlled <pause dur="0.5"/> process <pause dur="1.2"/> and as you can gather from what we said about <pause dur="0.2"/> Agenda Twenty-one and Rio <pause dur="0.7"/> that kind of process is really <pause dur="0.2"/> not in line with the philosophy <pause dur="0.7"/> of sustainable development as <pause dur="0.4"/> proposed <pause dur="0.2"/> at <pause dur="0.3"/> the Rio conference <pause dur="1.8"/> second approach <vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/> has been <pause dur="0.5"/> a limited dialogue strategy <pause dur="1.4"/> # heavily top down from the local authority but with some flexibility <pause dur="0.4"/> with some negotiation <pause dur="0.4"/> and compromise <pause dur="0.4"/> from the local authority <pause dur="0.8"/> on what's finally included or going to be included <pause dur="0.6"/> in <pause dur="0.3"/> these <pause dur="0.6"/> local <pause dur="0.6"/> sustainable development strategies <pause dur="2.9"/> thirdly <vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/> he identified a yes but strategy <pause dur="1.1"/> this applies a bottom up <vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/><pause dur="1.3"/> and relatively open process of discussion with local <pause dur="0.2"/> community groups and others <pause dur="2.5"/> but there are certain key policies certain <pause dur="0.3"/> key proposals <pause dur="0.8"/> which remain non-negotiable <pause dur="1.1"/> so in other words the local authority go to the local community and say right we want to produce this we want you to be involved <pause dur="0.8"/> but <pause dur="0.4"/> and this is 
the but <pause dur="0.2"/> there are certain <trunc>th</trunc> certain things we're committed to we're committed to <pause dur="0.3"/> building this road <pause dur="0.6"/> or we're committed to <pause dur="0.9"/> allocating this green field for housing development <pause dur="0.3"/> or whatever <pause dur="0.3"/> so they kind of set out the rules <pause dur="0.4"/> before the start <pause dur="1.6"/> at its worst form <pause dur="0.5"/> it <trunc>em</trunc> it this this but <pause dur="0.4"/> emerges during the process in other words they say oh we want to get your views we want you to be involved <pause dur="0.6"/> and then people start get involved <pause dur="0.6"/> going along to meetings or <pause dur="0.8"/> making comments <pause dur="0.3"/> and then suddenly the local authority turns around and says ah <pause dur="0.2"/> no sorry but <pause dur="1.3"/> so the worst kind is when they tell you halfway through <pause dur="0.5"/> that this is # there is a but <pause dur="1.6"/> but in its best form <pause dur="0.2"/> and <trunc>r</trunc> <vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/> reminds me of Islington when i used to work with Islington Council <pause dur="0.2"/><vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.5"/> they tell you beforehand they say <pause dur="0.5"/> we're going to enter into dialogue we're going to involve people but <pause dur="0.3"/> there are certain things we're not going to move on we are committed to equal opportunities <pause dur="0.2"/> was Islington's but <pause dur="0.6"/> # we are committed to <pause dur="0.3"/> social housing <pause dur="1.0"/> they 
had sort of <pause dur="0.2"/> very good <pause dur="0.7"/> right on P-C objectives <pause dur="1.1"/> but that's <pause dur="0.2"/> so that's a kind of the best better form of it if they tell you before you start this process what the limits are what the goalposts are <pause dur="0.3"/> at least the <pause dur="0.2"/> people can say okay i accept that <pause dur="0.2"/> or <pause dur="0.8"/> or they won't join in <pause dur="2.1"/> finally <pause dur="0.4"/> # Steven Young <pause dur="0.2"/><vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/> identified a bottom up strategy <pause dur="0.8"/> which is the ideal type <pause dur="0.8"/> in relationship to Local Agenda Twenty-one <pause dur="1.3"/> it involves active engagement with a full range of interests <pause dur="0.6"/> so you you are really open the gates <pause dur="0.5"/> to bring in <pause dur="0.2"/> the range of interests in your local area <pause dur="3.2"/> you as an authority you listen <pause dur="1.5"/> it's a listening process <pause dur="4.8"/> you learn <pause dur="0.2"/> you listen and then you learn <pause dur="0.3"/> which is kind of the opposite <pause dur="0.2"/> <unclear>that what's</unclear> what you're trying to do now and which i never do <pause dur="0.4"/> being a lecturer an academic you never listen to people <pause dur="0.7"/> you've <trunc>d</trunc> you develop the skill of talking <pause dur="0.3"/> and telling people what to do <pause dur="0.6"/> and then marking their essays on that basis <pause dur="0.6"/> now i'm being cynical <pause dur="0.8"/> # <vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/><pause dur="1.4"/> it's <pause dur="0.5"/> not necessarily leading the process but sharing <pause dur="2.4"/> ownership with the partners in 
the process <pause dur="1.9"/> so that's the ideal type that's <pause dur="0.2"/> if you were doing Local Agenda Twenty-one as it's supposed to be done that's the kind of process you would <pause dur="0.5"/> you would apply <pause dur="1.2"/> also the local authority <vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/> will be prepared to make radical changes to its policies and practices <pause dur="1.9"/> as part of that process <pause dur="0.3"/> so <pause dur="0.3"/> if local <trunc>p</trunc> <pause dur="0.4"/> stakeholders as part of this process of consensus building <pause dur="0.3"/> arrive at a view that you should <pause dur="1.0"/> you should build in the green belt <pause dur="1.4"/> or that you should invest as much money as you can <pause dur="0.7"/> in a <pause dur="0.6"/> public transport initiative <pause dur="0.5"/> then the council would say <pause dur="0.7"/> yep <pause dur="0.3"/> that's what we'll do <pause dur="1.0"/> it's listening and responding <pause dur="0.6"/> again i <trunc>g</trunc> i go back to Baltimore because it's interesting <pause dur="0.6"/> i'm the the post grads know about this but <pause dur="0.3"/> Baltimore have just <pause dur="0.5"/> produced a new plan for Baltimore Plan Baltimore which is a broad strategy <pause dur="0.5"/> but they're actually <trunc>ma</trunc> the major part of their plan in Baltimore is to go to local community groups <pause dur="0.6"/> so they've set up a whole series of community initiatives <pause dur="0.6"/> to get local 
communities to come forward with ideas and proposals of what they want <pause dur="0.2"/> locally <pause dur="0.6"/> and the and the council have committed themselves <pause dur="1.4"/> wherever possible to fund <pause dur="0.8"/> those <pause dur="0.6"/> ideas and initiatives <pause dur="0.3"/> so it's the same thing <pause dur="0.3"/> but they've never heard of Local Agenda Twenty-one in Baltimore <pause dur="2.6"/> the thing in the U-K <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> or or or certainly Steven Young's view <pause dur="0.7"/> was that this had not been achieved in the U-K this ideal type <pause dur="1.2"/> was not in evidence in the <trunc>su</trunc> in the survey that he looked at <pause dur="1.2"/> but he did find evidence <pause dur="0.4"/> that it was being developed that this kind of approach this open listening <pause dur="0.5"/> responsive <pause dur="1.1"/> non-dictatorial approach was being developed <pause dur="0.5"/> so there was evidence <pause dur="0.2"/> that things were moving that way <pause dur="1.3"/><vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/><pause dur="1.7"/> there are examples of this process <pause dur="0.4"/> in fact there are there are examples at different levels and i will mention some <pause dur="0.7"/> more strategic levels as well as the local level <pause dur="1.2"/> in the U-K <pause dur="0.6"/> this kind of <pause dur="1.8"/> stakeholdering involvement has occurred at the national <pause dur="1.1"/> the regional <pause dur="0.2"/> and the local level <pause dur="0.9"/> at the <trunc>r</trunc> 
at at at the national level there is a U-K round table <pause dur="0.2"/> on sustainable development <pause dur="2.8"/> and <pause dur="0.7"/> this round table has produced advisory reports which is supposed to feed in <pause dur="0.2"/> to government policy so there has been an initiative at least at the national level <pause dur="2.1"/> they produce reports on transport <pause dur="0.5"/> housing capacity <pause dur="0.3"/> energy <pause dur="0.5"/> economic development <pause dur="0.5"/> a range of reports <pause dur="2.0"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> they are kind of monitoring government policy in that area to try and <pause dur="0.2"/> change it to make it more sustainable <pause dur="2.9"/> at the regional level <pause dur="0.3"/> i've been directly involved <pause dur="0.2"/> with an organization called SERPLAN which is the regional <pause dur="0.4"/> planning conference for the south-east of England <pause dur="1.4"/> and as part of their new regional planning strategy <pause dur="0.5"/><vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.5"/> they set up a sustainability panel <pause dur="1.4"/> of stakeholder groups <pause dur="2.5"/> including academics like me <pause dur="2.6"/> which worked through <pause dur="1.5"/> a series of initiatives <pause dur="0.6"/> to try and make their regional strategy sustainable <pause dur="1.0"/> and indeed eventually they called it a sustainable development strategy for the south-east <pause dur="0.4"/> of England <pause dur="2.4"/> ironically as you 
may or may not know that strategy then had <pause dur="0.3"/> went through public consultation and # <pause dur="0.4"/> public examination <pause dur="0.5"/> where it got hammered <pause dur="0.5"/> by the panel chair <pause dur="0.7"/> who basically suggested that # SERPLAN's strategy was <pause dur="0.5"/> well economically unsustainable i guess <pause dur="0.7"/> # and criticized it quite heavily <pause dur="0.6"/> however <pause dur="0.3"/> the process <pause dur="0.4"/> occurred there was this <pause dur="0.6"/> <trunc>rou</trunc> # round table a forum <pause dur="0.5"/> where different interests were involved at the regional level <pause dur="2.2"/> it's also occurred at county level i've mentioned Gloucestershire <pause dur="0.2"/> with their regional their their county forum Lancashire had has got one <pause dur="2.3"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> Hertfordshire <pause dur="0.8"/> a number of other counties <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> <pause dur="0.3"/> the one we're in now had one <pause dur="0.7"/> <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> got abolished <pause dur="0.3"/> a couple of years back as a county council but for a few years <pause dur="0.3"/> from ninety-four through to ninety-seven <pause dur="0.6"/> it also had an environmental forum <pause dur="0.9"/> where <pause dur="1.2"/> these initiatives to try and make <pause dur="0.2"/> the policies and practices of the council and the county <pause dur="0.6"/> more sustainable occurred <pause dur="2.0"/> there are there is an article which i think is on

is engaging with business and trying to make <pause dur="0.2"/> businesses in <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> <pause dur="1.0"/> more sustainable <pause dur="0.6"/> things like green transport plans <pause dur="0.2"/> which this university <pause dur="0.6"/> is now implementing <pause dur="1.4"/> kicking kicking and # screaming its way into <pause dur="0.2"/> parking charges going up <pause dur="0.4"/> which we all know about <pause dur="0.3"/> and love <pause dur="1.7"/> so there's a a business Agenda Twenty-one <pause dur="1.2"/> and thirdly <pause dur="0.6"/> there was a # neighbourhood <pause dur="0.5"/> Agenda Twenty-one <pause dur="1.7"/> which they called GLOBE <pause dur="0.2"/> if you've ever seen GLOBE <pause dur="1.1"/> Go Local on a Better Environment <pause dur="0.9"/> is it what it stands for go <trunc>bet</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> Go Local on a Better Environment GLOBE <pause dur="0.5"/> so they have about nine <pause dur="0.5"/> GLOBE groups in <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> <pause dur="0.9"/> which are neighbourhood level <pause dur="1.0"/> and in fact you are sitting in one of our <pause dur="0.3"/> in one of the neighbourhoods 'cause the university has its own <pause dur="0.4"/> GLOBE group <pause dur="0.8"/> which i am a member <pause dur="0.3"/> not a very active member of it these days <pause dur="1.6"/> which i bet you don't know about do you <pause dur="0.9"/> not many people know about this as they say but there is a university GLOBE group <pause dur="0.2"/> which has made <pause dur="0.7"/> undertaken some survey work on cycling and <pause dur="0.4"/> made inputs on waste

# <pause dur="0.3"/> two of the <pause dur="0.4"/> the <trunc>m</trunc> two of the two or three of the <trunc>m</trunc> the early groups the early groups are the most active <pause dur="0.2"/> well the most active <pause dur="0.5"/> <trunc>n</trunc> # Newtown <pause dur="0.4"/> have been very active <pause dur="1.0"/> # Battle in off the Oxford Road <pause dur="1.0"/> have been active <pause dur="0.9"/> Katesgrove <pause dur="0.5"/> and Southcote <pause dur="1.1"/> have been very active groups and Caversham as well <pause dur="3.3"/> so there actually are these local neighbourhood groups and there's a there's a <trunc>neighbourh</trunc> there's a forum <pause dur="0.2"/> the council <pause dur="0.8"/> has a <trunc>c</trunc> has a forum <pause dur="0.8"/> and that forum is is made up of all these <pause dur="0.6"/> neighbourhood groups but they also have <pause dur="0.2"/> councillors members the <pause dur="0.2"/> the senior <pause dur="0.3"/> members of the council <pause dur="0.2"/> involved <pause dur="0.3"/> senior officers from the departments of the council come along <pause dur="0.5"/> and answer questions and feed information and receive <pause dur="0.5"/> information <pause dur="0.3"/> from the GLOBE groups <pause dur="0.2"/> so they've they've been

environmental policy and action which everyone can sign up to which benefits everyone <pause dur="0.6"/> to try and resolve conflicts of interest <pause dur="1.6"/> it was interesting # <pause dur="0.3"/> in Lancashire for instance Lancashire <pause dur="0.7"/> they spent a long time negotiating with major stakeholder groups <pause dur="1.1"/> business and others <pause dur="0.9"/> and they got to a stage where they could agree to about something like ninety-six per cent of the proposed actions in their plan <pause dur="1.1"/> but there was there was still <pause dur="0.2"/> # four per cent or so <pause dur="0.2"/> of things that they couldn't get agreement on so they left it they kind of put it on the back burner and said right we're <pause dur="0.3"/> we're not going to <pause dur="0.7"/> # derail the process just because there's four per cent of issues here that people can't agree on <pause dur="0.3"/> so they kind of put it on the back burner and they come back to it and they've come back to it <pause dur="0.4"/> those issues to try and address them again <pause dur="0.6"/> so there are ways of managing <pause dur="0.2"/> this process of of conflict mediation <pause dur="1.9"/> they've used visioning visioning has become a big thing in Agenda Twenty-one <pause dur="0.8"/> so you i 
don't know <pause dur="0.4"/> there's lots of little stories of you know <pause dur="0.2"/> people getting together in village halls in in villages <pause dur="0.5"/> and they <trunc>pi</trunc> they they they sort of almost wipe wipe your brain clean they say right clear your brain of everything <pause dur="0.7"/> and let's <pause dur="0.6"/> and create a vision <pause dur="0.5"/> what do you want <pause dur="0.2"/> your village or neighbourhood to be like <pause dur="0.2"/> in twenty years' time <pause dur="0.7"/> so you kind of just clear it and say what way if you <trunc>wa</trunc> if you wanted an ideal vision of the future <pause dur="0.4"/> what would it be <pause dur="0.6"/> and they use that visioning as part of <pause dur="0.3"/> the <trunc>ob</trunc> then the objectives well how do we get there <pause dur="0.4"/> so they start working back and saying right what do we need to put into place to move towards that vision <pause dur="4.2"/> they've done <trunc>apprais</trunc> village appraisals <pause dur="0.3"/> they've done planning for real exercises planning for real is kind of # <pause dur="0.2"/> getting community groups <pause dur="0.6"/> into a room usually with the developers <pause dur="0.4"/> and the planners <pause dur="0.6"/> to negotiate and discuss <pause dur="0.4"/> development proposals on particular schemes <pause dur="0.5"/> so they run <pause dur="0.3"/> again Islington have run planning for real <pause dur="0.7"/>

those people who don't usually join in <pause dur="0.8"/> i i've talked to the Agenda Twenty-one guy at <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> and he says well there's about <pause dur="0.3"/> in each of each of these GLOBE groups there's probably about <pause dur="0.6"/> maybe tops five per cent <pause dur="0.4"/> maybe not <pause dur="0.5"/> of the local population that's in that are involved in some way <pause dur="1.1"/> but maybe about another <trunc>thir</trunc> about thirty per cent <pause dur="0.3"/> have heard about it <pause dur="0.9"/> obviously <pause dur="0.4"/> not the thirty per cent in in the university here <pause dur="0.6"/> but # <pause dur="0.5"/> we're still talking about seventy per cent who haven't even heard about <pause dur="0.4"/> what's happening in <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> <pause dur="0.3"/> despite that it's very proactive and it advertises itself and it has <pause dur="0.4"/> puts it in the paper quite regularly <pause dur="0.6"/> people just don't pick it up <pause dur="3.4"/> # <pause dur="2.1"/> there certainly is apathy <pause dur="0.4"/> people do not <pause dur="0.4"/> want to get involved <pause dur="0.7"/> don't want to be involved in this <pause dur="0.7"/> don't care <pause dur="0.2"/> in fact there was research done in Lancashire <pause dur="0.9"/> # part of the Lancashire programme they they they actually interviewed they kind of <pause dur="0.2"/> took <pause dur="0.2"/> at random <pause dur="0.3"/> people from the community <pause dur="0.9"/> and <pause dur="0.3"/> got them into little workshops and discussed 
sustainable development <pause dur="1.0"/> and many of them were <pause dur="0.2"/> apathetic because they basically just didn't believe <pause dur="0.3"/> they didn't have any faith <pause dur="0.2"/> in local government <pause dur="0.3"/> or big business <pause dur="0.3"/> or the central government to do anything <pause dur="0.6"/> there was apathy because they basically felt <pause dur="0.5"/> they won't do anything <pause dur="0.5"/> or it won't matter <pause dur="0.5"/> 'cause it's all run from <pause dur="0.5"/> Washington <pause dur="0.8"/> or from global conglomerates who go on and <pause dur="0.6"/> pollute the <trunc>at</trunc> pollute the atmosphere and the seas or whatever <pause dur="0.5"/> so <trunc>the</trunc> there is apathy a large <trunc>ap</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> element of apathy <pause dur="0.2"/> in this <trunc>br</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> in the communities <pause dur="1.0"/> which which again is is just very difficult to break down <pause dur="2.1"/> there is social exclusion </u><pause dur="2.2"/> <u who="sm1150" trans="pause"> # <pause dur="0.4"/> is with with all of them is there a problem of being a sort of a lack of direction <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> as it gets <unclear>more</unclear> further and further away from <pause dur="0.8"/> i mean # i'm wondering about the expertise of <pause dur="0.5"/> # some of these GLOBE groups and now </u><u who="nm1148" trans="overlap"> yeah </u><u who="sm1150" trans="overlap"> i just thought <pause dur="0.3"/> # if <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> only put itself together</u><u who="nm1148" trans="latching"> yeah </u><u who="sm1150" trans="latching"> # <pause dur="0.3"/> is there do they put someone in a position who knows actually what's <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> of the government's actually about or </u><pause dur="0.4"/> <u who="nm1148" trans="pause"> yeah well it well it well <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> you know using <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> as example as a good example <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> don't want to define things they they don't want to <pause dur="0.2"/> dictate <pause dur="0.6"/> so they've allowed the local groups to define their own terms what this means for them <pause dur="0.6"/> what it means for them <pause dur="0.2"/> actually is very simple things like dogs' mess <pause dur="0.8"/> you know that that <pause dur="0.2"/> was the key 
issue <pause dur="0.4"/> in Southcote <pause dur="0.7"/> ward # <pause dur="0.2"/> neighbourhood <pause dur="0.6"/> was dogs' mess <pause dur="0.4"/> that is sustainable development <pause dur="0.8"/> you know and <trunc>w</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> so if you look at it you think well is that <pause dur="0.3"/> is that what sustainable development is about well <pause dur="0.3"/> to them <pause dur="0.3"/> it's important <pause dur="0.2"/> so you can <pause dur="0.2"/> they you have to work with their own definitions of what's important <pause dur="0.7"/> also about direction <pause dur="0.5"/> another problem and i don't know if i can't remember if it's on my list is is <pause dur="0.2"/> local groups tend to think locally <pause dur="0.4"/> they tend to see the world <pause dur="0.6"/> in the neighbourhood <pause dur="1.0"/> and so <pause dur="0.4"/> <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> have tried to introduce a transport <pause dur="0.3"/> group <pause dur="0.3"/> to think about strategic transport issues in <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> <pause dur="1.0"/> and they've had a very bad <pause dur="0.6"/> response or a bad <unclear>i'm sorry</unclear> a very <pause dur="0.7"/> limited <pause dur="0.5"/> perspective from GLOBE groups <pause dur="0.5"/> they just <pause dur="0.3"/> don't see <pause dur="0.9"/> the strategic issues <pause dur="0.2"/> so you you you're right there are problems <pause dur="0.4"/> about <pause dur="0.5"/> well direction <pause dur="0.7"/> vision <pause dur="0.3"/> i suppose <pause dur="0.6"/> # and <pause dur="0.3"/> and and and whether it really is about sustainable development or about <pause dur="1.3"/> more mundane things i don't know it depends but you you've got <pause dur="0.3"/> from <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/>'s point of view 
they feel they got to respect <pause dur="0.8"/> giving these people <pause dur="0.8"/> # a their voice <pause dur="0.3"/> to listen to them <pause dur="2.3"/> # <pause dur="2.8"/> social exclusion <pause dur="0.7"/> many groups are again <pause dur="0.2"/> apathetic because they've been excluded from decision making for years <pause dur="1.1"/> and not listened to so they're not going to get involved <pause dur="0.6"/> <trunc>sh</trunc> i remember when i was in Sheffield <vocal desc="laugh" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.2"/> Sheffield did something like this they did a <pause dur="0.3"/> they did a city centre plan for Sheffield back in actually back in well early nineties <pause dur="1.0"/> and they wanted to <trunc>e</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> engage with local groups who are normally marginalized so they they they <pause dur="0.2"/> <trunc>sp</trunc> specified # Asian women <pause dur="1.1"/> young unemployed <pause dur="0.5"/> people <pause dur="0.8"/> and a <trunc>gr</trunc> and various other groups that they wanted to have dialogue with and they set up they set up workshops <pause dur="0.7"/> the young unemployed one <pause dur="1.2"/> these young kids who were basically pissed off <pause dur="0.4"/> about being on the dole <pause dur="0.4"/> and getting nothing out of society basically smashed the place up <pause dur="0.4"/> they just they smashed the they had they had # a <trunc>fo</trunc> a forum meeting or a workshop <pause dur="0.7"/> and after sort of growling a bit 
because they didn't see what how this was relevant to their <pause dur="0.3"/> needs this <pause dur="0.2"/> <trunc>wh</trunc> why do why do you <trunc>wh</trunc> why do you want some input on a <pause dur="0.7"/> on a city centre plan when all's we need is a job <pause dur="0.6"/> you know and and you've got to then got to convince people that this might lead <pause dur="0.4"/> to a better economy and a better environment <pause dur="0.5"/> but they basically smashed the place up <pause dur="0.3"/> and it <pause dur="0.2"/> fell apart <pause dur="0.6"/> but that <pause dur="0.3"/> you know if you're dealing it goes back to Baltimore <pause dur="0.6"/> dealing with some of the areas that we were walking around in Baltimore must be very difficult to getting people engaged <pause dur="0.6"/> given the conditions and issues that they're facing <pause dur="1.8"/> so social exclusion <pause dur="0.2"/> involvement of people <pause dur="0.9"/> # <vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/><pause dur="4.3"/> the <pause dur="0.3"/> <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> solution was to concentrate on real issues in other words <pause dur="0.8"/> if dogs' <pause dur="0.4"/> muck is the issue that people are worried about then let's deal with it <pause dur="0.2"/> in other words let's build <pause dur="0.3"/> from the bottom <pause dur="0.2"/> <shift feature="voice" new="laugh"/>you know <shift feature="voice" new="normal"/><pause dur="0.4"/> let's build awareness and and and involvement <pause dur="0.5"/> if if <pause dur="0.2"/> dogs' <sic corr="muck">musk</sic> is the issue then they <pause dur="0.2"/> they they say right well let's concentrate on it <pause dur="0.6"/> so they 
as i say a lot of the initiatives in Southcote are are going round flagging dogs' muck <pause dur="0.4"/> they have little flags they put <pause dur="0.3"/> on the grass <pause dur="0.2"/> identifying to show people how extensive this problem is <pause dur="0.2"/> awareness building <pause dur="0.6"/> so it's interesting you can start from very <pause dur="0.5"/> mundane <pause dur="0.2"/> but very important issues for people <pause dur="0.9"/> and the hope <pause dur="0.2"/> the hope again is that it then raises awareness <pause dur="0.4"/> raises people's <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.9"/> eyes above the local <pause dur="1.1"/> but it's been a problem <pause dur="1.8"/> range of interests involved again # <pause dur="0.2"/> well it goes back <pause dur="0.4"/> it's very you know if you're if you're if you're a <pause dur="0.2"/> officer <pause dur="0.2"/> working for the council <pause dur="0.5"/> and you want to facilitate a local <pause dur="0.2"/> agenda process <pause dur="1.1"/> you're you're likely to go to the people that are active <pause dur="0.3"/> you know those are the people that have <pause dur="0.4"/> shown interest in the past that are more prepared to get involved <pause dur="0.9"/> and so you end up with a kind of <pause dur="0.8"/> a list of acceptable <pause dur="0.7"/> people <pause dur="1.2"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> so there's a danger you you therefore don't include or don't seek out <pause dur="0.5"/> those groups that <pause dur="0.2"/> that might cause trouble like <trunc>unemploy</trunc> well 
Sheffield were brave you know they kind of went right we're going to involve the <pause dur="0.2"/> young unemployed of Sheffield <pause dur="0.4"/> it failed <pause dur="0.9"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> but certainly not many other other authorities would say <shift feature="voice" new="laugh"/>ooh <shift feature="voice" new="normal"/> no way <pause dur="0.6"/> you know we're not going to get into a dialogue <pause dur="0.6"/> with # <pause dur="0.4"/> people down this part of town or whatever <pause dur="0.4"/> so it can be tricky <pause dur="1.6"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> conflicts of interest <pause dur="0.2"/> you know <pause dur="0.4"/> we live in a <pause dur="0.4"/> society with <trunc>dif</trunc> people have different interests and you have conflicts of interest <pause dur="0.3"/> planning <pause dur="0.5"/> has historically been about <pause dur="0.7"/> mediating <pause dur="0.3"/> conflicts between developers and residents between <pause dur="0.2"/> environmental groups and companies <pause dur="0.8"/> between neighbourhoods and other neighbourhoods or whatever <pause dur="1.6"/> but there are some conflicts <pause dur="0.6"/> like the ones in Lancashire that could not be resolved they negotiated they <pause dur="0.4"/> built up consensus they had workshops <pause dur="0.3"/> but still there was a a a small minority of issues or <trunc>proble</trunc> or policy <pause dur="0.2"/> objectives <pause dur="0.4"/> which were not agreed upon <pause dur="3.1"/> so <pause dur="0.2"/> in that sense there are some issues that <pause dur="0.6"/> maybe cannot be resolved 
through consensus building <pause dur="0.4"/> or certainly <pause dur="0.3"/> take <pause dur="0.7"/> # make it very difficult <pause dur="1.5"/> coordination <pause dur="1.2"/> i've just mentioned you know the tendency for <vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.9"/> for local people to think local <vocal desc="laugh" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.2"/> not think global <vocal desc="laugh" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.9"/> they they <trunc>g</trunc> they think and act local <pause dur="0.9"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> the thing about sustainable development <pause dur="0.2"/> as Rio said is you need to take action at all levels <pause dur="1.0"/> so if the people of <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> <pause dur="0.7"/> did have a problem with transport <pause dur="0.9"/> then they've got to think about how that problem which level <pause dur="0.4"/> they need to <trunc>a</trunc> tackle it you know who do they lobby <pause dur="0.3"/> or <pause dur="0.2"/> argue for <pause dur="0.3"/> if they want to push a transport issue they have to go to the regional level really nowadays <pause dur="0.8"/> # they could go through the local transport plan but they need to think <pause dur="0.7"/> you know strategically <pause dur="0.5"/> and that's often a problem <pause dur="0.7"/> also all these initiatives you know the local the county region and central they're not linked <pause dur="1.1"/> the only way they are linked <pause dur="0.7"/> is really <pause dur="0.2"/> by certain individuals <pause dur="0.8"/> who are who are members of each of these fora <pause dur="0.9"/> but often they don't know the others exist <pause dur="0.8"/> so 
you have these kind of different layers of <pause dur="0.3"/> fora <pause dur="0.7"/> but there's no linkage <pause dur="0.2"/> SERPLAN when i was working with <trunc>ser</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> SERPLAN on their strategy <pause dur="0.8"/> we produced a participation strategy <pause dur="0.2"/> and one of the key things <trunc>wi</trunc> within it was to try <pause dur="0.4"/> and use <pause dur="0.4"/> the local groups the county <pause dur="0.2"/> particularly the county level <pause dur="0.3"/> fora <pause dur="0.7"/> to plug in as a kind of consultation mechanism <pause dur="0.2"/> to <pause dur="0.2"/> to get that feedback on the on the regional strategy <pause dur="0.6"/> but it never really happened it never really worked it was never developed <pause dur="0.4"/> so there's there is a fragmentation <pause dur="0.6"/> between these different levels of <pause dur="0.2"/> Agenda Twenty-one <pause dur="0.3"/> stakeholder groups <pause dur="3.3"/> integration <pause dur="0.4"/> we've talked about coordination between the levels <pause dur="0.3"/> integration <pause dur="1.1"/> the danger is and it's always been a danger in organizations <pause dur="0.2"/> you give <pause dur="0.3"/> you give a guy some <pause dur="0.3"/> guy <pause dur="0.4"/> the job title you're Agenda Twenty-one officer <pause dur="0.3"/> there there there he is he sits there you we're doing the job we got a guy doing it <pause dur="0.4"/> or a team doing it <pause dur="0.5"/> but the thing about <pause dur="0.3"/> the thing about sustainable development and Agenda Twenty-one 
is it it's got to permeate decision making <pause dur="0.6"/> it needs to be integrated across <pause dur="0.2"/> the organization <pause dur="2.9"/> and you have problems 'cause people <pause dur="0.6"/> doing their jobs <pause dur="0.4"/> as they've always done their jobs <pause dur="0.5"/> don't want to change the way they do their jobs they don't want to take on board these environmental <pause dur="0.5"/> funny things <pause dur="0.4"/> i remember i i did a project <pause dur="0.2"/> # for the government <pause dur="0.3"/> on defence estate looking at redundant defence estate <pause dur="0.8"/> and <pause dur="0.8"/> we had meetings with the <trunc>mi</trunc> Ministry of Defence who run <pause dur="0.3"/> the defence estate <pause dur="1.0"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> i did this paper for them <pause dur="0.3"/> about environmental appraisal <pause dur="1.1"/> and i said <pause dur="0.3"/> you can look at the <trunc>im</trunc> <pause dur="0.3"/> the defence estate in different ways and one way you can look at it <pause dur="0.4"/> is to # have a sustainability or environmental appraisal of the development process that occurs redevelopment <pause dur="0.7"/> and also you you have development appraisal financial <pause dur="0.2"/> you know like <pause dur="0.2"/> land mangers do <pause dur="0.8"/> it's what <trunc>la</trunc> it's what surveyors do they do development appraisals <pause dur="0.3"/> to to evaluate the market <pause dur="0.5"/> viability of a development scheme <pause dur="0.6"/> and this
