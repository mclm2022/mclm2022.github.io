<u who="nm1220"><kinesic desc="projector is on showing slide" iterated="n"/> this morning <pause dur="1.7"/> <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> and i will give a sort of joint session <pause dur="0.6"/> looking at how you formulate a manufacturing strategy <pause dur="0.5"/> we talked a lot yesterday <trunc>but</trunc> <pause dur="0.5"/> about how you need to integrate <pause dur="0.6"/> your operations strategy with all your other strategies we looked at <trunc>s</trunc> <pause dur="0.5"/> some tools and <pause dur="0.5"/> for doing that with <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> <pause dur="0.4"/> we had a look at the effect of that on a small real company H-G Plastics <pause dur="0.7"/> last night <pause dur="0.7"/> now we're actually going forward to look at <pause dur="0.4"/> what goes into an operations strategy <pause dur="0.7"/> and <pause dur="1.2"/> how you then go through a process of putting it together we'll look <trunc>a</trunc> be looking at some academic models <pause dur="0.8"/> as i say that sounds very boring but they are ones <pause dur="0.2"/> we'll see later <pause dur="0.2"/> that real companies use in real life <pause dur="1.4"/> and <pause dur="0.4"/> basically <pause dur="0.4"/> do something different can we ask you all <pause dur="0.6"/> to shut your manuals please <pause dur="0.6"/> just manage without the slides for a while <pause dur="0.3"/> you'll see why in a minute <pause dur="0.3"/> 'cause we're going to 
ask you to do an exercise and the answer's on the slides <pause dur="1.0"/> so <pause dur="0.6"/> just to make it slightly more difficult for you if you could close your manuals <pause dur="0.8"/> # just for the first few minutes of the session <pause dur="0.8"/> and i'll now pass over to <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> who's going to start this morning off </u><pause dur="1.0"/> <u who="nf1221" trans="pause"> okay good morning </u><pause dur="0.4"/> <u who="ss" trans="pause"> good morning </u><u who="nf1221" trans="latching"> oh hurray <vocal desc="laugh" iterated="n"/><pause dur="1.1"/> right <pause dur="0.5"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> we're looking at the development of manufacturing strategy then <pause dur="0.3"/> and we're taking it from the work that we did yesterday on strategy integration so you'll need to remember some of the things we did yesterday <pause dur="0.4"/> can you remember that far back <pause dur="0.7"/> <kinesic desc="nod heads" iterated="n" n="ss"/> yes just about good <pause dur="0.7"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> the objectives then of the session for this morning are <pause dur="0.4"/> to be able to understand what manufacturing strategy is and be able to define it so you should <pause dur="0.2"/> have a much better understanding of what it actually is today <pause dur="0.6"/> # 
operation strategy too <pause dur="0.4"/> and you should be able to discuss and give examples of how it can be formulated <pause dur="0.5"/> so we're looking at the actual process <pause dur="0.5"/> and the content of of <pause dur="0.2"/> making <trunc>man</trunc> of developing manufacturing strategy <pause dur="3.7"/> <kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> we're going to look at how you'd formulate manufacturing strategy and we're going to ask you the questions for that <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="1.4"/> hence why we don't want you to look in your manuals yet <pause dur="1.0"/> and then we're going to introduce three <pause dur="0.2"/> different frameworks for developing manufacturing strategy <pause dur="0.3"/> there are more than three <pause dur="0.3"/> we have preselected these three <pause dur="0.3"/> because we believe it gives you a variety of different frameworks <pause dur="0.3"/> to consider <pause dur="0.4"/> # there are many more for which at your leisure you're welcome to go to the library <pause dur="0.3"/> we've referenced more in our notes which are very comprehensive <pause dur="0.4"/> but we're only covering three today <pause dur="0.5"/> Terry Hill <pause dur="0.4"/> Platts and Gregory and John Miltenburg so they're the three that you'll be using <pause dur="0.4"/> and 
you may wish to use some of the material as well <pause dur="0.3"/> when you do your S-C-L case study which i believe you start this afternoon <pause dur="0.5"/> okay so <pause dur="0.6"/> do take some note of this <pause dur="2.1"/> we will remind you of some of the key strategic tools for formulating strategy we will link back to what we did yesterday <pause dur="0.5"/> # you will also cover more analytical tools <pause dur="0.5"/> in your S-C-L case study which you will do for the remainder of the week okay so we'll be bringing some of them in today <pause dur="0.4"/> because they do come <trunc>i</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> under the frameworks <pause dur="0.7"/> and at the end we'll be just reviewing summarizing if you like <pause dur="0.2"/> the key characteristics of the different frameworks <pause dur="0.3"/> obviously as i was saying to you yesterday about Master's level <pause dur="0.3"/> about understanding and application <pause dur="0.4"/> one of the key things that we'll be measuring is your ability <pause dur="0.4"/> for critical analysis <pause dur="0.7"/> okay <pause dur="0.4"/> and critical analysis is looking at things like <pause dur="0.4"/> what are the characteristics of all these frameworks what are the strengths what are the weaknesses <pause dur="0.3"/> what are 
<trunc>m</trunc> what is my view how can i compare the two <pause dur="0.3"/> so we'll be sharing that <pause dur="0.2"/> with you at the end <pause dur="1.2"/> okay <pause dur="0.8"/> as a general <pause dur="0.3"/> set of guidelines i've got some slides on the principles of strategy <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> and then i'll ask you to do an exercise # without hopefully the use of your manuals <pause dur="0.4"/> so <pause dur="0.3"/> again for the purposes of this lecture <pause dur="0.5"/> you are all directors of <pause dur="0.6"/> hypothetical companies <pause dur="0.4"/> okay <pause dur="0.4"/> and you're thinking about how you're going to develop a manufacturing strategy <pause dur="0.6"/> so what i'm putting up next is some information on just general principles <pause dur="0.4"/> for strategy formulation <pause dur="0.3"/> and this is applicable to any type of strategy formulation <pause dur="0.4"/> okay <pause dur="0.3"/> so it's not just true for manufacturing <pause dur="0.4"/> and i have to say that if i asked you to brainstorm <pause dur="0.2"/> these you'd probably come out with them all yourself so i'm not going to go through them in <pause dur="0.4"/> laborious detail <pause dur="0.4"/> okay <pause dur="0.3"/> just some prompts for common sense <pause dur="0.6"/> <kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> so strategy is long term <pause dur="0.2"/> okay <pause dur="0.3"/> we're looking at five ten fifteen years <pause dur="0.3"/> most companies that i work with 
in the food industry consider five years to be a long time <pause dur="0.4"/> we were talking the aeronautical group yesterday <pause dur="0.4"/> twenty years is probably the <shift feature="voice" new="laugh"/>same<shift feature="voice" new="normal"/> <pause dur="0.4"/> vision for them <pause dur="0.2"/> so it depends on the company and the industry <pause dur="0.3"/> but <trunc>y</trunc> it's a long term view that you're taking <pause dur="1.4"/> you're dealing only with the major issues you're not dealing with tactical or operational <pause dur="0.5"/> issues you're dealing with the major long term issues <pause dur="0.9"/> you're looking at what differentiates the company from its competitors and we looked yesterday <pause dur="0.4"/> about that differentiation didn't we starting with the Porter <pause dur="0.4"/> grid <pause dur="0.4"/> about differentiation or cost focus et cetera <pause dur="0.4"/> # so <pause dur="0.2"/> you're actually stating there <pause dur="0.5"/> within the strategy the actual identity for the company what is it that's different about your company <pause dur="0.4"/> and you should see that throughout the strategy <pause dur="1.2"/> you're concentrating the effort then on those particular issues and we did look yesterday about 
focus <pause dur="0.4"/> with the Puttick grid and other things <pause dur="0.3"/> so that's where that would come in <pause dur="0.2"/> in terms of the strategy <pause dur="0.4"/> we're looking at a pattern of decision making over time you don't make all the decisions in one go <pause dur="0.3"/> you set down some policies <pause dur="0.2"/> in which you can make decisions in the future <pause dur="1.5"/> pervasive means that it affects the whole organization so the argument is that everybody in the organization should know about the strategy <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> that is easier said than done in my experience <pause dur="0.4"/> # when we teach these programmes to <pause dur="0.3"/> # participants who already work <pause dur="0.3"/> a lot of them are <pause dur="0.2"/> unaware or a little bit unclear <pause dur="0.3"/> about the actual strategy of the company that they work for that is not unusual <pause dur="0.7"/> it sounds amazing but it isn't actually unusual <pause dur="0.4"/> so # <pause dur="0.6"/> i think this one is very important so strategy should affect everything <pause dur="3.4"/> and just to <trunc>ca</trunc> a point at the bottom there just for you to note that this is what we believe distinguishes strategy from tactics and operational plans <pause dur="0.7"/> okay <pause dur="3.9"/> <kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> 
so it's a formal procedure <pause dur="1.7"/> one involving a multidisciplinary team <pause dur="1.2"/> different strategies should be formally evaluated before making decisions because you obviously can predict a set of different futures can't you <pause dur="0.5"/> yeah <pause dur="0.4"/> will we have a war in Iraq will we have an oil crisis <pause dur="0.3"/> et cetera <pause dur="0.3"/> # and you can predict different futures and set your strategies to suit them <pause dur="1.6"/> should <pause dur="0.2"/> <trunc>strate</trunc> strategies should be communicated as i mentioned <pause dur="0.3"/> you should look at the risks <pause dur="0.5"/> associated with the external factors and we spent <pause dur="0.3"/> half an hour yesterday looking at external drivers didn't we in the in the companies <pause dur="0.3"/> so you need to look at the risks and be able to have some <pause dur="0.8"/> contingency plans <pause dur="0.2"/> to meet <pause dur="0.4"/> most of those potential <pause dur="0.7"/> external events <pause dur="0.4"/> and monitoring events <pause dur="0.6"/> should be carried out continuously <pause dur="0.3"/> okay but we'll perhaps come back to that <pause dur="0.4"/> a little bit later on <pause dur="0.4"/> and the strategy should be reviewed regularly <pause dur="0.2"/> okay so they are the general points for strategy <pause dur="0.3"/> which hopefully you'll all have in your 
minds now <pause dur="0.4"/> when we ask you <pause dur="0.3"/> to do <pause dur="0.3"/> this task <pause dur="0.8"/> what we'd like you to do is to answer those four questions in the groups <pause dur="0.2"/> # are you going to <pause dur="0.5"/> organize it into S-C-L groups or just let them sit in their </u><u who="nm1220" trans="overlap"> # i think it'll probably <pause dur="0.8"/> be easier to do it geographically in the room rather than S-C-L groups </u><u who="nf1221" trans="overlap"> okay <pause dur="0.2"/> so the groups that we had yesterday when i did order winners and qualifiers and the external drivers okay <pause dur="0.6"/> and i'd like you on one sheet of flip chart paper <pause dur="0.4"/> one sheet per group <pause dur="0.2"/> okay so you have to fit the entire thing on one sheet of paper <pause dur="0.3"/> that we can read on the board <pause dur="0.3"/> so please <pause dur="0.3"/> no writing at ten <pause dur="0.2"/> points <pause dur="0.2"/> okay <pause dur="0.8"/> and <pause dur="0.4"/> we'd like you to answer these questions <pause dur="0.5"/> from your own <pause dur="0.5"/> general knowledge <pause dur="1.4"/> okay <pause dur="0.7"/> this is not a test <pause dur="0.3"/> this is for us to be able to pitch the lecture <pause dur="0.8"/> do you 
understand <pause dur="0.4"/> if if i know what you understand then i know what to teach you <pause dur="0.8"/> okay <pause dur="0.3"/> so i'm trying to understand what you know <pause dur="0.3"/> and this is in all this is about i will do it in groups <pause dur="0.3"/> and we will understand <pause dur="0.4"/> from these <pause dur="0.5"/> questions <pause dur="0.3"/> what you know <pause dur="0.3"/> i would be grateful if you don't look at your books it's not a test <pause dur="0.3"/> but all the answers are in the manual so <pause dur="0.8"/> you're likely to be bored if you just read it all out of there put it on there <pause dur="0.3"/> i think you know everything <pause dur="0.3"/> and leap off <pause dur="0.5"/> into a higher level <pause dur="0.4"/> of manufacturing strategy <pause dur="0.3"/> nobody's going to win there <pause dur="0.3"/> okay <pause dur="0.4"/> so please try not to use your manuals if you're stuck then look <pause dur="0.4"/> all right i don't want you to <pause dur="0.2"/> to have not do anything <pause dur="0.3"/> but in your groups you should be able to answer these questions <pause dur="0.4"/> pretend that you own a company or that you run a company <pause dur="0.3"/> even the <pause dur="0.2"/> in the sectors that you were doing yesterday <pause dur="0.7"/> the other example you could use is <pause dur="0.2"/> the business that you designed for your context of <pause dur="0.5"/> business module <pause dur="0.7"/> did you all 
develop your own company </u><pause dur="0.2"/> <u who="sf1222" trans="pause"> mm </u><u who="nf1221" trans="overlap"> yeah <pause dur="0.2"/> well use that one then <pause dur="0.4"/> okay use that product <pause dur="0.5"/> okay <pause dur="0.3"/> so think of a product <pause dur="0.5"/> think <pause dur="0.3"/> how you would develop a manufacturing strategy <pause dur="0.7"/> okay that's that's that's what we'd like you to do <pause dur="0.7"/> so we want you to define it <pause dur="0.4"/> as if you were writing it for a dictionary <pause dur="0.6"/> we'd like you to just <pause dur="0.2"/> indicate who should be responsible <pause dur="0.6"/> # don't just say everybody <pause dur="0.3"/> i would like a little bit more detail than that <pause dur="0.5"/> how often should it be reviewed <pause dur="0.7"/> and then the major <pause dur="0.3"/> question is the last one <pause dur="0.3"/> which is what should be in it <pause dur="0.5"/> what decision areas do you need to make what goes into a manufacturing strategy <pause dur="0.3"/> what kind of decisions will you have to make <pause dur="0.4"/> when you're deciding <pause dur="0.4"/> what to make <pause dur="0.3"/> and what not to make <pause dur="0.3"/> okay <pause dur="0.4"/> does that make sense does everybody understand the questions <pause dur="0.4"/><kinesic desc="nod heads" iterated="n" n="ss"/> yeah <pause dur="0.3"/> 
obviously <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> and i will come round as often as you wish <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> we'll give you <pause dur="0.4"/> twenty minutes we'll give you till twenty to ten <pause dur="0.3"/> to do this <pause dur="0.3"/> please put your syndicate number on the <pause dur="0.7"/> top <pause dur="0.4"/> of the page it was <kinesic desc="indicates groups" iterated="y" dur="8"/> one two three wasn't it four and five <pause dur="0.4"/> syndicate groups yeah <pause dur="0.2"/> group one group two group three group four and group five <pause dur="0.6"/> okay <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> because we will be putting your answers on the board and using them <pause dur="0.4"/> for the rest of the lecture <pause dur="0.9"/> okay <pause dur="0.7"/> good any questions please <pause dur="2.3"/> no right just glazed looks sorry i'm making you work so early in the morning <vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" dur="1"/> right </u><event desc="doing task set" iterated="y" n="ss" dur="unknown"/><gap reason="break in recording" extent="uncertain"/><u who="nf1221" trans="pause"> if you've finished if you'd like to come and put your # <pause dur="1.4"/> sheets <pause dur="0.5"/> on the

okay but we'll discuss what you've put first and see how <pause dur="0.4"/> similar it is to what we've <pause dur="0.2"/> already prepared <pause dur="0.3"/> please now open your manuals because we're we're following the notes <pause dur="2.4"/> so the first question <pause dur="1.3"/> is <pause dur="1.1"/> can you define manufacturing strategy or what is your definition <pause dur="0.5"/> for manufacturing strategy <pause dur="0.8"/> and i'm sure we have a variety there on the board <pause dur="0.5"/> because you're all obviously in different groups and had your own ideas <pause dur="0.5"/> so from group one we've got <reading>a long term guideline <pause dur="1.2"/> move towards where the company wants to be from where they are now</reading> so <pause dur="0.4"/> somebody was listening yesterday which is refreshing <pause dur="0.4"/> so it's about how <pause dur="0.4"/> companies move <pause dur="0.3"/> from where they currently are <pause dur="0.2"/> the current situation <pause dur="0.4"/> to where they want to be <pause dur="1.0"/> and it's long term and it's it's a set of guidelines which is one way of putting it so yes <pause dur="0.5"/> i agree <pause dur="0.4"/> with that definition <pause dur="0.3"/> we have <pause dur="0.6"/> group two <pause dur="0.9"/> said it's <reading>the utilization of manufacturing techniques tools and methods</reading> so <pause dur="0.4"/> good we've got <pause dur="0.2"/> the word manufacturing 
in there which is # <pause dur="0.4"/> refreshing because we are trying to reflect manufacturing strategy <pause dur="0.5"/> and we're looking at the tools techniques and methods excellent <pause dur="0.6"/> <reading>used in an organization</reading> so i guess that's like the resources that we were talking about yesterday <pause dur="0.8"/> and we've got <reading>to gain competitive advantage</reading> so again very good because you're now <pause dur="0.7"/> thinking about how you <pause dur="0.3"/> get that distinctive <pause dur="1.0"/> # element to your business all right what distinguishes you from the competition <pause dur="0.4"/> okay so you need to <trunc>p</trunc> have that in place <pause dur="0.3"/> so very good to that one <pause dur="0.3"/> three </u><u who="nm1220" trans="overlap"> group three yes </u><pause dur="0.2"/> <u who="nf1221" trans="pause"> <reading>the long term guideline for a company to achieve its goals <pause dur="0.5"/> and objectives <pause dur="0.5"/> by considering the productivity and profitability</reading> so <pause dur="0.5"/> on the one hand we're looking at making lots of money <pause dur="0.9"/> and on the other hand we're <pause dur="0.2"/> looking at doing it very efficiently <pause dur="0.3"/> i assume that's where <pause dur="0.3"/> we're looking at here <pause dur="0.6"/> # <trunc>alo</trunc> achieving the goals and objectives which is 
excellent because you're aligning that back to corporate strategy which is something else we talked about yesterday <pause dur="0.4"/> and again long term <pause dur="0.8"/> guidelines excellent <pause dur="0.6"/> group four then are saying <pause dur="0.2"/> <reading>choosing the right drivers to make the decision <pause dur="0.4"/> about what to produce how to produce and who to produce it for <pause dur="0.5"/> within the capacity constraints of the company considering the uncertainty of</reading> wow <pause dur="0.2"/> <vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" n="sl" dur="1"/><pause dur="0.3"/>  very <vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" n="sl" dur="1"/><pause dur="0.4"/> # i've <trunc>d</trunc> <pause dur="0.3"/> thinking of a descriptor for that but i can't <vocal desc="laugh" iterated="n"/> <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.9"/> <trunc>ha</trunc> <pause dur="0.6"/> choosing the right drivers so i guess that's linking back to what we were talking about yesterday in terms of <pause dur="0.4"/> external drivers or <pause dur="0.2"/> perhaps other things within the business like <pause dur="0.4"/> what the <trunc>sis</trunc> <trunc>d</trunc> directors want </u><u who="sm1223" trans="latching"> strategic drivers </u><u who="nf1221" trans="pause"> yeah </u><u who="sm1223" trans="overlap"> depends on the business </u><u who="nf1221" trans="latching"> absolutely <pause dur="0.2"/> so it's not just what's happening outside it's what 
the actual people within the organization want to do <pause dur="0.3"/> so those </u><u who="sf1224" trans="overlap"> another thing from question four as well that all the stuff that all the areas that <pause dur="0.2"/> the decision <unclear>kind of</unclear> all of that stuff <pause dur="0.2"/> <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/></u><pause dur="0.6"/> <u who="nf1221" trans="pause"> yes <pause dur="0.6"/> yes good which is refreshing because normally they take no notice of that at all <pause dur="0.6"/> so looking about what to produce yes <pause dur="0.2"/> it's about what you produce but that's also the job of marketing too <pause dur="0.4"/> so there's there's two elements to that <pause dur="0.5"/> it's the manufacturing's definitely about how to produce it <pause dur="0.6"/> okay <pause dur="0.6"/> and who <pause dur="0.2"/> to produce it for again that's where the link with marketing would come in <pause dur="0.3"/> and sales i guess <pause dur="0.5"/> # looking at the constraints that you have <pause dur="0.4"/> but you may not let them be constraints any more but you you're looking at current situation <pause dur="0.7"/> and considering the uncertainty in the marketplace which is something we did look at yesterday </u><u who="sf1225" trans="overlap"> mm </u><u who="nf1221" trans="overlap"> with the Puttick grid didn't we </u><pause dur="0.2"/> <u who="sf1225" trans="pause"> yep </u><pause dur="0.2"/> <u who="nf1221" trans="pause"> okay <pause dur="0.3"/> so well done <pause dur="0.2"/> very good <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="1.4"/> group five <reading>a 
long term planning and operation guideline to achieve the goals of the organization</reading> yes that's group five here isn't it well done so we're looking again at long term <pause dur="0.5"/> # specifically at planning an operation because you have to plan in order to have your operations <pause dur="0.8"/> and to achieve the goals <pause dur="0.4"/> of the organization so you've got that alignment there <pause dur="0.4"/> okay </u><pause dur="0.3"/> <u who="nm1220" trans="pause"> right let's have a look at who's responsible for it <pause dur="0.8"/> group one <pause dur="0.9"/> the boss <pause dur="0.4"/> yes <pause dur="1.4"/> along with # the manufacturing manager <reading>along with talks with sales and purchase manager <pause dur="0.5"/> involving representatives from separate units on the shop floor</reading> <pause dur="0.9"/> interesting <pause dur="0.3"/> so we've got <pause dur="0.7"/> someone responsible manufacturing manager responsible <pause dur="0.4"/> but talking to other people including the shop floor <pause dur="1.1"/> that may well happen <pause dur="0.4"/> but the involvement there most definitely has to come <pause dur="0.4"/> when you are implementing the strategy <pause dur="0.7"/> realistically you've got ten-thousand people in the company you 
can't actually talk to every single one of them about your strategy <pause dur="0.6"/> but certainly once you get to implement it every single one of them's got to know and understand it <pause dur="1.3"/> group two <pause dur="1.8"/> manufacturing director R and D department yes <pause dur="0.2"/> new products coming through what's that going to do to us <pause dur="1.0"/> finance director chairman sales director <pause dur="0.5"/> so one group <pause dur="0.3"/> all very much at the top of the company there <pause dur="2.0"/> group three <pause dur="0.4"/> top manager production manager <pause dur="0.2"/> C-E-O finance manager et cetera <pause dur="0.4"/> again a grouping at the top of the company <pause dur="0.7"/> but a grouping taking in various views <pause dur="1.4"/> group four <pause dur="0.3"/> we've got a primary responsibility we've got it split down primary responsibility <pause dur="0.2"/> we've put on the production management <pause dur="0.6"/> yes in the end someone's got to be responsible someone's got to tie it together <pause dur="1.3"/> but yes we've got input drivers from just about everybody else <pause dur="0.3"/> so we've got <pause dur="0.7"/> primary responsibility there but again taking information and advice <pause dur="0.3"/> and comment from lots of other people <pause dur="1.3"/> group five <pause dur="0.6"/> simple 
top management <pause dur="0.2"/> i think <pause dur="0.7"/> perhaps a little bit vague term <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> but yes <pause dur="0.3"/> seen generally its strategy is a senior responsibility <pause dur="0.2"/> that's what they're paid for that's what they get their large salaries for </u><pause dur="1.7"/> <u who="nf1221" trans="pause"> okay let's look what # we prepared # <pause dur="0.4"/> before our definition <pause dur="0.4"/> we put up was <pause dur="0.2"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> this that <reading>the primary function <pause dur="1.2"/> of a manufacturing strategy is to guide the business in putting together the set of capabilities <pause dur="0.5"/> that will help it to pursue its chosen strategy competitive strategy over the long term</reading> <pause dur="0.5"/> so lots of words there that have been <pause dur="0.5"/> reflected in what you've put <pause dur="0.2"/> in your definitions <pause dur="0.4"/> so it's really looking at how it can deliver <pause dur="0.3"/> the competitive strategy of the business <pause dur="0.4"/> so how <pause dur="0.3"/> manufacturing can harness its resources <pause dur="0.4"/> to deliver that <pause dur="0.2"/> competitive strategy over the long term <pause dur="0.6"/> to supplement that <pause dur="0.5"/> we have this at the bottom which says it's a framework for planning <pause dur="1.8"/> it should adapt successfully to environmental changes and some 
of you put <trunc>i</trunc> uncertainty of the marketplace et cetera <pause dur="0.8"/> and it's a focus sometimes on what's needed for survival <pause dur="0.6"/> now that's not always true <pause dur="0.4"/> but in certain companies <pause dur="0.2"/> i'm sure you can think of examples at the moment United Airlines springs to mind which which <pause dur="0.6"/> from the news yesterday <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> they're very much into survival <pause dur="0.5"/> okay <pause dur="0.4"/> so it's about thinking about that when you're <trunc>t</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> you're looking at strategy <pause dur="0.3"/> and manufacturing can obviously support that or operations <pause dur="2.6"/> <kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> and then who should be responsible we've we've <pause dur="0.2"/> <trunc>d</trunc> we've used a survey here done in America looking <pause dur="0.5"/> at just at six firms but they did some detailed interviews with them <pause dur="0.7"/> they asked them <pause dur="2.5"/> who's responsible for developing manufacturing strategy <pause dur="0.5"/> five of them use corporate level multifunction teams <pause dur="0.4"/> so <pause dur="0.3"/> that would be what some of you represented here so we're looking at directors <pause dur="0.4"/> and from all the different functions within the business <pause dur="0.4"/> okay that's what i would expect <pause dur="0.6"/> 
one firm said the vice-president of production and engineering <pause dur="0.9"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> our argument with that is generally you would only use one person to develop the strategy if <pause dur="0.5"/> you had a particularly <shift feature="voice" new="laugh"/>strong <shift feature="voice" new="normal"/><pause dur="0.4"/> leader <pause dur="0.4"/> or <pause dur="0.2"/> if you had a relatively small business <pause dur="0.4"/> because then you don't have the <shift feature="voice" new="laugh"/>spare people <shift feature="voice" new="normal"/>to sit around making strategy you have to kind of run it <pause dur="0.2"/> by yourself <pause dur="0.4"/> but generally i would expect to see <pause dur="0.3"/> corporate level multifunction teams there <pause dur="1.2"/> okay <pause dur="1.6"/> so the third question <pause dur="1.1"/> was how often should it be reviewed <pause dur="1.4"/> and we have <pause dur="2.7"/> a variety of # answers we've got yearly <pause dur="0.6"/> we've got <pause dur="0.5"/> every <shift feature="voice" new="laugh"/>season according to the football shirts <shift feature="voice" new="normal"/>good <pause dur="0.3"/> or or maybe three times a season given what Manchester United do <pause dur="0.9"/> no fixed time depends on the situation again i'd like <pause dur="0.6"/> probably a little bit more detail with that <pause dur="0.4"/> in terms of <pause dur="0.4"/> what you mean <pause dur="0.3"/> you are absolutely right but # examples would be <pause dur="0.3"/> more helpful with that <pause dur="0.4"/> so <pause dur="0.4"/> for 
the mobile phone industry what what's the life cycle of a mobile phone <pause dur="1.3"/> product life cycle of a mobile phone do you think </u><pause dur="0.5"/> <u who="sf1226" trans="pause"> a few months </u><u who="sm1227" trans="overlap"> <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> <unclear>half a year</unclear></u><u who="sf1228" trans="latching"> mm </u><u who="nf1221" trans="overlap"> half a year </u><u who="sf1228" trans="overlap"> <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/></u><u who="nf1221" trans="overlap"> yeah it's about <pause dur="0.3"/> three months <pause dur="0.8"/> yeah some people say it's even less than that <pause dur="0.7"/> okay <pause dur="0.3"/> so <pause dur="0.3"/> if you've got that life cycle then obviously you're going to do this <pause dur="0.5"/><kinesic desc="indicates point on board" iterated="n"/>  much more frequently <pause dur="0.6"/> if you go back to our aero engine then we're looking maybe <pause dur="0.7"/> every year <pause dur="0.2"/> every two years <pause dur="0.7"/> every five years <pause dur="0.3"/> okay so it <pause dur="0.2"/> you're absolutely right but examples <pause dur="0.3"/> would have helped me understand what you meant <pause dur="0.6"/> # # # three oh wow <pause dur="0.4"/> review period is industry dependent so <pause dur="0.5"/><kinesic desc="indicates point on board" iterated="n"/> this is what i guess you've reflected in this graph yeah <pause dur="0.4"/> so <pause dur="0.4"/><kinesic desc="indicates point on board" iterated="n"/> rapidly changing trends here <pause dur="0.5"/> in terms of mobile phones <pause dur="0.4"/> you did the teenage market one yesterday didn't you </u><u who="sm1229" trans="overlap"> yeah </u><u who="sf1230" trans="overlap"> mm-hmm </u><u who="nf1221" trans="overlap"> so that would be more frequent <pause dur="0.5"/><kinesic desc="indicates point on board" iterated="n"/> here <pause dur="0.5"/> and slow changing trends here <pause dur="0.4"/><kinesic desc="indicates point on board" iterated="n"/> okay so that's a very useful diagram there well 
done <pause dur="0.2"/> first time i've seen that <pause dur="0.6"/> and group one whenever the need arises <pause dur="1.9"/> yes although <pause dur="0.4"/> you have to be careful with strategy that <pause dur="0.4"/> you do set something in stone we would say <pause dur="0.4"/> and you don't just respond to every single change in the environment because the environment will change <pause dur="0.5"/> okay <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> the thing about strategy is that you have a set of policies that you can actually fix <pause dur="0.3"/> that you may <pause dur="0.7"/> flex a little bit but the general <trunc>f</trunc> <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> path of the company is fixed <pause dur="0.3"/> unless something major happens obviously like September <pause dur="0.3"/> the eleventh <pause dur="0.4"/> but other than that <pause dur="0.2"/> you you fix a direction <pause dur="0.4"/> because that's what will give you the focus <pause dur="0.3"/> and enable you <pause dur="0.2"/> to make a profit and take everybody with you in the company <pause dur="0.2"/> so there is that trade-off there with not not too responsive <pause dur="0.9"/> predicting the changes in the environment yes good luck <vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" n="sl" dur="1"/> <pause dur="0.6"/> # keep on confirming alignment of manufacturing yes absolutely <pause dur="0.5"/> # i agree with that <pause dur="0.6"/> and i think <pause dur="0.2"/> i've covered <pause dur="0.2"/> yeah 
i've covered them all there <pause dur="0.4"/> we've put <pause dur="0.7"/> # we we use this these conference again with these firms <pause dur="1.7"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> one firm said continuously <pause dur="0.5"/> and # <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> and i <pause dur="0.3"/> think if you're going to monitor strategy continuously <pause dur="0.4"/> then you unless you've got a fantastic real time data monitoring system <pause dur="0.3"/> then you're not actually <pause dur="0.3"/> going to do what you say <pause dur="0.4"/> okay so unless you've got the fancy electronic <pause dur="0.5"/> data systems equipment to help you <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> you're probably wasting your time <pause dur="0.3"/> all right i would say continuously monitoring strategy <pause dur="0.2"/> isn't that helpful <pause dur="0.2"/> four said quarterly combined with a major review so four are saying they review it every three months and then they'd have a major review <pause dur="0.5"/> and the recommends <pause dur="0.2"/> recommendations for that major review <pause dur="0.5"/> range from <pause dur="1.2"/> yearly <pause dur="0.4"/> to three to five years okay <pause dur="0.3"/> so generally <pause dur="0.2"/> it's it's rolling <pause dur="0.3"/> the the firms that i deal with my food companies <pause dur="0.5"/> they <pause dur="0.4"/> consider strategy five years out but they have like a <trunc>th</trunc> rolling three year strategy <pause dur="0.5"/> so even big multinational blue-chip 
companies <pause dur="0.3"/> still only look <pause dur="0.2"/> just that far ahead <pause dur="0.3"/> to actually put things down <pause dur="0.2"/> set things in in stone <pause dur="0.9"/> okay <pause dur="0.2"/> well done <pause dur="0.7"/> and finally then <pause dur="0.3"/> we're looking at what goes into a manufacturing strategy so the elements of manufacturing strategy <pause dur="1.0"/> and we have <pause dur="0.8"/> things like capacity <pause dur="1.3"/> resources technology logistics demand <pause dur="1.9"/> yes demand in terms of what feeds into capacity <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> economy <pause dur="0.2"/> in terms </u><u who="sm1231" trans="overlap"> <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> the situation and </u><pause dur="0.5"/> <u who="nf1221" trans="pause"> okay </u><u who="sm1231" trans="overlap"> <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/></u><u who="nf1221" trans="overlap"> okay so yes i'd i'd take that at a higher level but yes it will indirectly influence <pause dur="0.5"/> # bill of materials and procurement yes costs <pause dur="0.2"/> good <pause dur="0.5"/> competition and then your scheduling systems M-P-S and # <pause dur="0.4"/> M-R-P and E-R-P <pause dur="0.3"/> do we know what they are you've all done logistics haven't you good <pause dur="0.5"/> excellent <pause dur="1.4"/> capacity <trunc>perce</trunc> # human resources good supply chain excellent whoever group five are well done <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> quality marketing and finance yes all of those things

the framework <pause dur="0.7"/> so the three frameworks that we'll be taking you through later <pause dur="0.4"/> will detail the process of making a manufacturing strategy <pause dur="0.3"/> so there are two elements to it <pause dur="0.4"/> we've asked you to brainstorm the content <pause dur="0.6"/> # we're going to now show you <pause dur="0.3"/> what the academics say should be in the content <pause dur="0.5"/> and then we'll take you after the break through <pause dur="0.4"/> three examples of how the process works <pause dur="0.5"/> and we'll have an <trunc>exe</trunc> exercise to do there too <pause dur="0.3"/> so that you can understand <pause dur="0.2"/> these particular frameworks <pause dur="0.7"/> do you understand that does that make sense yeah <kinesic desc="nod heads" iterated="n" n="ss"/> that's that's what we'll be doing <pause dur="2.6"/> okay <pause dur="0.6"/> so we're now looking at the content of manufacturing strategy and your response <pause dur="0.4"/> to <pause dur="0.2"/> question four <pause dur="1.2"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> we've taken these writers # Hayes and Wheelwright <pause dur="0.2"/> they work from America <pause dur="0.3"/> and they've been writing about manufacturing strategy from the nineteen-eighties <pause dur="0.4"/> so they've been around quite a long time <pause dur="0.6"/> the reason we go back that far <pause dur="0.4"/> is because this <pause dur="0.3"/> not only <pause dur="0.2"/> 
being one of the first <pause dur="0.4"/> texts on the subject <pause dur="0.6"/> it's also been used a number of times subsequently <pause dur="0.3"/> in various other frameworks <pause dur="0.3"/> okay <pause dur="0.4"/> so <pause dur="0.7"/> other academics have used this work <pause dur="0.3"/> further down the line <pause dur="0.3"/> and hopefully you'll see that reflected in the frameworks that we take you through <pause dur="1.8"/> so we've got <pause dur="0.2"/> manufacturing strategy there <pause dur="0.2"/> and around the outside of this circle we've got the eight elements of manufacturing strategy <pause dur="0.3"/> as proposed by Hayes and Wheelwright <pause dur="0.9"/> and i'm going to talk about four of them to you <pause dur="0.5"/> and then i shall hand over to <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> who's going to talk about the other four <pause dur="0.9"/> going up to the break <pause dur="1.7"/> the four that i'm going to talk about are the major decision areas the ones that set the boundaries of your business <pause dur="0.4"/> the ones that define <pause dur="0.3"/> the bricks and mortar <pause dur="0.3"/> if you like <pause dur="0.7"/> and you'll see that in your texts <pause dur="0.4"/> that you've got in front of you <pause dur="0.5"/> we divide it like this <pause dur="0.6"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> so i'm going to be talking about <pause dur="0.4"/> capacity issues <pause dur="0.2"/> facilities technology <pause dur="0.5"/> and vertical integration and i will explain 
what that is <pause dur="0.4"/> when we get there <pause dur="1.3"/> we call these the structural decisions okay so they define the boundaries of your business <pause dur="0.3"/> they are the big decisions the major capital investment that you will make as a company <pause dur="2.1"/> <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> will then talk about the infrastructural decisions <pause dur="0.3"/> which are about the supporting mechanisms <pause dur="2.7"/> in order to make the most effective use of the <pause dur="0.4"/> the structure that you've defined <pause dur="1.5"/> the analogy that we use for this <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="1.2"/> is one <pause dur="0.7"/> of computing <pause dur="1.3"/> i'm presuming you all have a computer <pause dur="0.4"/> given that you're on this course <pause dur="0.7"/> when you go out <pause dur="0.2"/> and buy a computer <pause dur="0.2"/> and you'll have to correct me if i'm wrong here having never gone out and bought one <shift feature="voice" new="laugh"/>myself <shift feature="voice" new="normal"/><pause dur="0.8"/> you go out and you decide <pause dur="0.6"/> what memory <pause dur="0.6"/> you can <shift feature="voice" new="laugh"/>afford <shift feature="voice" new="normal"/><pause dur="0.4"/> yeah and you buy a computer with <pause dur="0.4"/> the maximum memory you can afford <pause dur="0.3"/> because that <pause dur="0.3"/> sets doesn't it defines the boundary <pause dur="0.4"/> the limits <pause dur="0.3"/> of what your computer will do <pause dur="0.3"/> when you've got it <pause dur="0.4"/> okay so it's the memory <pause dur="0.4"/> that actually fixes <pause dur="0.3"/> the limits the boundary of your <pause dur="0.2"/> your

hairdresser's to a cinema <pause dur="0.5"/> to a finance company <pause dur="0.6"/> so yes we're talking manufacturing today <pause dur="0.4"/> but the same conditions apply to any <pause dur="0.3"/> operational organization that's doing anything at all <pause dur="0.4"/> they've got to <pause dur="0.2"/> make decisions under those same things <pause dur="0.3"/> sure the headings <pause dur="0.4"/> under each of those major headings might be slightly different to reflect the different business <pause dur="0.6"/> but they've got to still go through those same sort of decisions <pause dur="0.4"/> so that as i say is how you broaden this subject out <pause dur="0.4"/> from narrow manufacturing <pause dur="0.4"/> to the wider broader <pause dur="0.3"/> operations <pause dur="0.2"/> front <pause dur="1.0"/> so there we've dealt with content <pause dur="0.4"/> i think now is a very appropriate time to <pause dur="0.4"/> take a break <pause dur="0.8"/> and then after the break we'll spend the second session <pause dur="0.5"/> <unclear>we'll</unclear> just looking at some of the academic models and the things behind <pause dur="0.3"/> the actual process of getting there <pause dur="0.3"/> so see you <pause dur="0.2"/> about ten to
