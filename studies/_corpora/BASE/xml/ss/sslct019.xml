armed force <pause dur="0.4"/> might actually <trunc>achie</trunc> achieve that objective <pause dur="1.2"/> this is seen to be very important <pause dur="0.3"/> by neo-realists and also realists # because <pause dur="0.2"/> they assume that the international system <pause dur="0.3"/> is a monarchic system <pause dur="0.5"/> and essentially all <trunc>s</trunc> all states <pause dur="0.2"/> rely on self-help <pause dur="0.3"/> because there is no <pause dur="0.4"/> government or no form of governance <pause dur="0.4"/> above <pause dur="0.2"/> the state level <pause dur="1.9"/> now that entails <pause dur="0.2"/> in itself this conception for states <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.8"/> entails several problems <pause dur="0.2"/> because <pause dur="1.3"/> what if one state <pause dur="0.8"/> arms itself or begins to arm itself more <pause dur="0.5"/> than it has done previously <pause dur="1.0"/> its neighbours <pause dur="0.2"/> may start wondering <pause dur="1.4"/> what the intent is <pause dur="0.3"/> of that state <pause dur="1.0"/> it increases its capabilities and as you know <pause dur="0.3"/> realists see <pause dur="0.3"/> military or economic <pause dur="0.2"/> capabilities <pause dur="0.4"/> as a central defining element of state power <pause dur="1.3"/> now what does it want to do with these <pause dur="0.3"/> capabilities <pause dur="1.3"/> may it want to <pause dur="0.5"/> establish a superiority in armament levels so that it can use force <pause dur="0.5"/> in any sort of conflict with its neighbours <pause dur="0.2"/> or a state <pause dur="0.2"/> somewhat further afield if its military <pause dur="0.5"/> # machinery can reach it <pause dur="1.9"/> now <pause dur="0.2"/> in 
order to <pause dur="0.2"/> not let this escalate <pause dur="0.2"/> as you know from a previous lecture <pause dur="0.4"/> diplomats and politicians <pause dur="0.4"/> before the Second World War and before the First World War attempted <pause dur="0.4"/> to <trunc>estab</trunc> or to maintain <pause dur="0.4"/> what was known as a balance of power <pause dur="0.4"/> so that no state <pause dur="0.3"/> could really <pause dur="0.5"/> go beyond the point <pause dur="0.5"/> of arming itself and then using <pause dur="0.3"/> its armed force <pause dur="0.4"/> in a political conflict to settle that conflict militarily <pause dur="1.9"/> however <pause dur="0.4"/> if states felt that they were <pause dur="0.9"/> left <pause dur="0.4"/> alone <pause dur="0.7"/> or they couldn't possibly come up with the military <pause dur="0.3"/> # with the economic and resources in order to build up their military <pause dur="0.8"/> they would consider <pause dur="0.3"/> aligning themselves <pause dur="0.2"/> with other states <pause dur="1.1"/> in order to compensate for one state which might be <pause dur="0.5"/> superior in its military potential <pause dur="3.6"/> so the idea of alliance building <pause dur="2.0"/> was <pause dur="0.8"/> that they should alliances should enhance national security <pause dur="1.6"/> and <pause dur="0.4"/> seen from an economic perspective <pause dur="0.8"/> by forming alliances and joining forces <pause dur="0.6"/> you might be able you I-E a state might be able <pause dur="0.3"/> to maximize the cost-benefit equation <pause dur="0.2"/> of <pause dur="0.5"/> national 
defence spending <pause dur="0.2"/> I-E <pause dur="0.3"/> everyone spends <pause dur="0.2"/> as much as they possibly can <pause dur="0.3"/> but because they joined forces <pause dur="0.4"/> their economies aren't going to be <pause dur="0.3"/> burdened too much by military expenditure with in <pause dur="0.2"/> which <pause dur="0.2"/> with its <pause dur="0.5"/> essentially unproductive use of capital <pause dur="1.5"/> however because there is also there was also the risk or in short term alliances there was also the risk that <pause dur="1.2"/> a state which on one in one hand wants to be allied with you <pause dur="0.3"/> but then if its fortunes change <pause dur="0.6"/> it might decide no longer to want to be allied with you <pause dur="1.0"/> and in fact might become your enemy <pause dur="0.4"/> there was a preference for short term alliances another reason <pause dur="0.5"/> to to prefer short term alliances was of course <pause dur="0.4"/> that <pause dur="0.6"/> the idea that you wanted to protect your national security and <pause dur="0.2"/> and the secrets surrounding your national security policy <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="1.0"/> was was seen as rather paramount <pause dur="1.5"/> now the <pause dur="1.8"/> the related to these reasons <pause dur="0.8"/> # alliance formation could take place because <pause dur="0.4"/> a <pause dur="0.4"/> a threat should be <pause dur="0.2"/> deterred <pause dur="0.6"/> not necessarily to go to war but because <pause dur="0.6"/> a a threat should be 
deterred now i'm going to talk about deterrence at much greater length on Thursday <pause dur="0.4"/> so i'm just going to go over that very quickly <pause dur="0.8"/> either deterrence of a perceived military threat I-E a state as i explained earlier <pause dur="0.2"/> # or <trunc>hy</trunc> hypothesized earlier <pause dur="0.2"/> a state which starts increasing its military capabilities <pause dur="0.8"/> or <pause dur="1.0"/> # <pause dur="1.8"/> the <trunc>possibi</trunc> <pause dur="0.3"/> <trunc>beca</trunc> well <pause dur="0.6"/> either because it justs increases its # its # <pause dur="0.4"/> capabilities but hasn't really declared an aggressive intent <pause dur="0.4"/> or because there is actually <pause dur="0.3"/> an aggressive intent by a distinct adversary <pause dur="4.7"/><kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="9"/> now another characteristic of pre-forty-five alliances <pause dur="1.2"/> or some of them <pause dur="0.4"/> was that they would be formed <pause dur="0.8"/> for wars of aggression <pause dur="3.0"/> in that case they would also be <pause dur="0.6"/> or that those alliances would be particularly short-lived because there was a political objective which was to be achieved militarily <pause dur="0.7"/> and for that purpose the alliance would be formed <pause dur="0.3"/> once those <trunc>obj</trunc> objectives were <trunc>f</trunc> were # <pause dur="0.2"/> achieved <pause dur="0.9"/> the alliance would disintegrate <pause dur="1.8"/> the problem is <pause dur="0.2"/> that of course 
<trunc>inh</trunc> <pause dur="0.3"/> built into such short term alliances is a high degree of instability <pause dur="0.5"/> because at the time the alliance is formed <pause dur="0.6"/> the state which joined into the <trunc>allia</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> joined in the alliance <pause dur="0.5"/> might have <pause dur="0.2"/> shared objectives <pause dur="0.6"/> but what if the war <pause dur="0.2"/> doesn't go as they intended or as they have <pause dur="0.2"/> had anticipated <pause dur="0.5"/> if the war <pause dur="0.8"/> doesn't go in favour of <pause dur="0.2"/> some of the <trunc>al</trunc> allies objectives <pause dur="0.6"/> the alliance might might fall apart <pause dur="2.8"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> finally <pause dur="0.7"/> defence <pause dur="0.5"/> if one <pause dur="0.2"/> state is under serious threat it might look <pause dur="0.2"/> round for allies <pause dur="0.5"/> to <pause dur="0.3"/> increase its national security in a short term because it can't possibly build up its military potential <pause dur="0.4"/> and produce <pause dur="0.2"/> the weapons it might need <pause dur="0.4"/> in order to defend itself <pause dur="1.3"/> or <pause dur="0.2"/> in order to re-establish the balance of power <pause dur="3.8"/><kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="10"/> now problems of alliances <pause dur="4.6"/> are manyfold <pause dur="1.6"/> firstly <pause dur="1.7"/> for states that intend to join into an alliance <pause dur="0.8"/> it is necessary that they reconcile different expectations <pause dur="1.1"/> how do they define national security <pause dur="1.3"/> it depends on where you sit as a state <pause dur="0.2"/> where you are geographically located who your 
neighbours are <pause dur="0.3"/> what your <trunc>s</trunc> resources are <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.8"/> what your natural resources are <pause dur="0.9"/> that those those <pause dur="0.7"/> factors influence how you define national security <pause dur="0.9"/> what also defines your national <pause dur="0.2"/> security policy <pause dur="0.4"/> is what your outlook is do you want to be <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.8"/> just a state that exists and trades and and doesn't really have a very <pause dur="0.5"/> active international policy <pause dur="0.2"/> or foreign policy <pause dur="1.1"/> or do you want to be a state which wants to <pause dur="0.2"/> have further reach <pause dur="1.1"/> # including your neighbours or <pause dur="0.6"/> regional reach or maybe even global reach <pause dur="0.9"/> depending on what the outlook is of different alliance members <pause dur="0.7"/> that's going to <pause dur="0.2"/> define how they define their national security and therefore the utility <pause dur="0.6"/> of an alliance <pause dur="0.3"/> is likely to differ <pause dur="0.8"/> depending on <pause dur="0.4"/> how they define their national security objectives <pause dur="1.2"/> and that 
is also going to define as a consequence of course the defence requirements <pause dur="0.6"/> the amount of spending that <pause dur="0.2"/> that the state is prepared to put into <pause dur="0.2"/> procuring <pause dur="0.5"/> # armed forces <pause dur="0.5"/> and the kinds of capabilities the state might want to have <pause dur="0.8"/> if you take <pause dur="0.3"/> today <pause dur="0.6"/> if you compare the U-S <pause dur="0.3"/> with any European country <pause dur="0.6"/> the U-S military machinery is much much more <pause dur="0.4"/> wide-reaching much more capable <pause dur="0.4"/> much more differentiated <pause dur="0.5"/> than any of the European <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> militaries or <pause dur="0.2"/> armed forces are <pause dur="1.4"/> and so <pause dur="0.4"/> these different <pause dur="0.6"/> preconditions of course shape how an alliance is likely to <pause dur="0.5"/> develop <pause dur="1.3"/> a further issue in alliance formation even if its a <trunc>sh</trunc> a relatively short-lived alliance <pause dur="0.2"/> is <pause dur="0.5"/> the question of trust and reliability <pause dur="1.4"/> if you join forces with allies <pause dur="0.7"/> there are a few things which you want to <pause dur="0.4"/> avoid <pause dur="1.2"/> one is <pause dur="0.8"/> the states that are in the alliance want to avoid that some of them <pause dur="0.7"/> spend enormous amounts of military on military capability <pause dur="0.6"/> whereas others don't <pause dur="0.4"/> now <pause dur="0.2"/> those who don't spend <pause dur="0.4"/> # an equivalent <pause dur="0.6"/> proportion of their national <pause dur="0.4"/> budget <pause dur="0.7"/> on armed forces <pause dur="0.4"/> can 
use <pause dur="0.2"/> might use <pause dur="0.9"/> these <pause dur="1.0"/> this proportion of the budget <pause dur="0.4"/> for <pause dur="0.6"/> building up trade building up their economic infrastructure <pause dur="1.1"/> now some of the allies would then finance <pause dur="0.2"/> the military security <pause dur="0.2"/> of <pause dur="0.4"/> these allies that spend less <pause dur="0.8"/> so the question is how do you make sure <pause dur="0.3"/> within an alliance that everyone chips in <pause dur="0.8"/> evenly <pause dur="0.2"/> and that there aren't some <pause dur="0.4"/> who live at the expense of an ally <pause dur="0.4"/> this is called if that happens this is called <trunc>s</trunc> the free-rider syndrome <pause dur="1.1"/> what you also want to avoid in an alliance is the risk of entrapment <pause dur="0.5"/> entrapment means <pause dur="0.8"/> that one ally <pause dur="1.1"/> doesn't <pause dur="0.3"/> either doesn't necessarily say in advance when it approaches <pause dur="0.2"/> a future ally <pause dur="0.6"/> that there isn't a quarrel it has with another state or it develops a quarrel with another state <pause dur="0.4"/> and then drags the other alliance members <pause dur="0.4"/> into <pause dur="0.4"/> that conflict which is really only a conflict which is nationally motivated <pause dur="1.1"/> the allies may not have any interest in being involved in this conflict <pause dur="0.5"/> or they may actually see that as a huge problem because they have very 
good relations with that state which has a quibble with one of the allies <pause dur="0.9"/> so entrapment is another risk which alliance members have to <pause dur="0.3"/> be able to deal with <pause dur="1.1"/> the opposite of that is the risk of abandonment <pause dur="2.1"/> which is <pause dur="0.9"/> similar to defection but slightly less harsh <pause dur="0.2"/> # abandonment would <pause dur="0.4"/> happen if a state <pause dur="0.4"/> declares that it will assist <pause dur="0.4"/> in the defence <pause dur="0.4"/> of <pause dur="0.3"/> an alliance <pause dur="0.3"/> territory or interest <pause dur="0.8"/> and then doesn't come through <pause dur="0.3"/> with that commitment <pause dur="0.5"/> it abandons its allies <pause dur="0.2"/> # in their <pause dur="0.2"/> attempt of <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> fulfilling the <trunc>al</trunc> alliance objectives <pause dur="0.5"/> defection is if the ally leaves the alliance entirely <pause dur="0.7"/> which <pause dur="0.2"/> entails <pause dur="1.0"/> an added risk and that is that the ally which has defected <pause dur="0.3"/> might join <pause dur="0.4"/> a hostile alliance which may have formed <pause dur="0.3"/> in response to your own alliance formation <pause dur="0.7"/> which is of course also something that allies would want to <pause dur="0.2"/> avoid <pause dur="6.7"/><kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="6"/> from a systemic perspective <pause dur="2.1"/> if alliances form <pause dur="0.7"/> in response to inbalances in the balance of power <pause dur="2.0"/> then <pause dur="0.6"/> states which are outside the alliance <pause dur="0.2"/> might feel it 
necessary to form alliances themselves <pause dur="1.0"/> now that might <pause dur="0.5"/> recreate the security dilemma on a higher level <pause dur="0.7"/> now very briefly <pause dur="0.3"/> the to <pause dur="0.3"/> <trunc>rec</trunc> recall what the security dilemma is <pause dur="0.4"/> security dilemma is essentially if one state <pause dur="0.6"/> starts building up its arms the neighbouring state doesn't necessarily know what it intends to do but thinks it wise <pause dur="0.4"/> to build up its own arms <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> oh arsenal as well its its its armed forces <pause dur="0.8"/> then both start building up <pause dur="0.4"/> their armed forces <pause dur="0.4"/> in response to each other <pause dur="0.4"/> which means they spend <pause dur="0.2"/> quite a lot of money <pause dur="0.5"/> on <pause dur="0.7"/> procuring military equipment and maybe <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> getting getting more <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.8"/> people to join the armed forces <pause dur="0.9"/> and in the end will be no <pause dur="0.3"/> safer than they were before <pause dur="0.3"/> because they both <pause dur="0.3"/> have just pushed <pause dur="0.2"/> the balance of power <pause dur="0.4"/> <trunc>o</trunc> up to a higher level <pause dur="0.3"/> with the added risk <pause dur="0.5"/> that one of the states might say <pause dur="0.5"/> well if this continues <pause dur="0.5"/> then we may <pause dur="0.2"/> in the end be <pause dur="0.6"/> outarmed by the other side <pause dur="0.4"/> but at the moment we still have a possibility we we still might have <pause dur="0.5"/> # some chance

this situation in such a way that <pause dur="0.2"/> the survival of all of them <pause dur="0.5"/> is actually going to be guaranteed <pause dur="0.4"/> and the stronger member of an alliance <pause dur="0.2"/> doesn't go <pause dur="0.4"/> well <pause dur="0.4"/> this smaller state is dispensible in some way <pause dur="0.8"/> # it may <pause dur="0.3"/> it may be better for us all if we sacrifice one of the alliance members <pause dur="5.9"/><kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="5"/> now <pause dur="0.2"/> before World War Two <pause dur="0.2"/> as i mentioned before <pause dur="1.5"/> there was a stong belief in the offence <pause dur="0.5"/> because the idea that if you launch a surprise attack at a potential enemy <pause dur="1.6"/> then <pause dur="0.2"/> you have <pause dur="0.2"/> at least in that first initial # in that initial phase <pause dur="0.3"/> the upper hand <pause dur="1.6"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> so you would get tight alliances <pause dur="0.5"/> which <pause dur="0.7"/> because they wanted to <pause dur="0.2"/> go for a surprise attack <pause dur="0.5"/> would have very high arms procurement <pause dur="0.6"/> and <pause dur="0.7"/> launch <pause dur="0.2"/> a massive attack as quickly as possible <pause dur="1.8"/> needless to say this was of course <pause dur="0.4"/> quite an unstable way <pause dur="0.3"/> of relating <shift feature="voice" new="laugh"/> to one <shift feature="voice" new="normal"/> another <pause dur="0.6"/> in the interwar period <pause dur="0.7"/> the whole <pause dur="2.0"/> the whole <pause dur="0.3"/> philosophy sort of changed the other way round at least amongst <pause dur="0.3"/> those countries that had <pause dur="0.6"/> won the <trunc>seco</trunc> the First World War <pause dur="1.0"/> in

language <pause dur="0.7"/> they have to have planning procedures <pause dur="0.4"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> traces and and just operational procedures which are <pause dur="0.3"/> comparable <pause dur="1.0"/> and they need to be able needed to be able to <pause dur="0.7"/> share <pause dur="0.3"/> to a to a degree <pause dur="0.5"/> # their equipment <pause dur="0.3"/> especially equipment <pause dur="0.2"/> where <pause dur="0.6"/> the <pause dur="0.2"/> the <trunc>arm</trunc> the national armed forces tried to <pause dur="0.3"/> work together <pause dur="0.8"/> and that meant that on an on an institutional level <pause dur="1.1"/> other than alliances of the pre-World War Two kind <pause dur="0.9"/> a separate identity <pause dur="0.6"/> emerged <pause dur="0.5"/> where NATO became gradually over over decades not from the very beginning <pause dur="0.5"/> but over the <pause dur="0.2"/> over the over its history <pause dur="0.4"/> became <pause dur="0.3"/> a separate <pause dur="0.2"/> entity <pause dur="0.4"/> which had a separate <pause dur="0.5"/> language a separate way of <pause dur="0.2"/> of <pause dur="0.2"/> operation <pause dur="0.5"/> # the <trunc>wa</trunc> it had different <pause dur="0.2"/> standard operating procedures it had its own <pause dur="0.4"/> planning <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> procedures <pause dur="0.5"/> and <pause dur="0.4"/> these would then be handed down to the national <pause dur="0.6"/> military and political planners <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> which were or who were then tasked with implementing what NATO desired <pause dur="0.4"/> now <pause dur="0.4"/> there are many studies <pause dur="0.4"/> <trunc>ex</trunc> # exploring exactly that linkage between NATO level planning <pause dur="0.3"/> and

the guess that the issue will come up again <pause dur="1.5"/> the U-S <pause dur="0.6"/> especially the more <pause dur="1.2"/> the more conservative and the more <pause dur="0.4"/> western orientated <pause dur="0.5"/> proportion of the U-S Congress <pause dur="0.8"/> has <pause dur="0.4"/> especially since the nineteen-seventies very strongly lobbied <pause dur="0.3"/> against a permanent commitment <pause dur="0.4"/> of U-S troops in Europe <pause dur="0.9"/> because they argued that <pause dur="0.3"/> # Europe <pause dur="0.2"/> is <pause dur="0.5"/> from the seventies onwards Europe was doing economically well enough <pause dur="0.4"/> to defend itself <pause dur="0.4"/> and the U-S would still maintain its nuclear umbrella <pause dur="0.3"/> but there was no need <pause dur="0.3"/> for <pause dur="0.3"/> U-S troops to be based <pause dur="0.2"/> in Europe <pause dur="1.9"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> and if they were <pause dur="0.7"/> to <pause dur="0.3"/> remain in Europe <pause dur="0.3"/> then the Europeans should spend a lot more <pause dur="0.4"/> on their own defence <pause dur="0.5"/> now there was a lot of number crunching that can go on <pause dur="1.0"/> # over the issue of <pause dur="0.4"/> burden sharing because it depends on how you calculated defence expenditure <pause dur="0.5"/> # if you want to make the argument that <kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="5"/> no Americans and the Europeans are contributing <trunc>e</trunc> equally <pause dur="3.5"/> 
i'll get back to the problem of different perceptions <pause dur="0.3"/> U-S and Europe of NATO <pause dur="0.2"/> # in a minute <pause dur="1.9"/> problems with collective defence <pause dur="1.5"/> # <pause dur="1.2"/> one i have just mentioned <pause dur="0.4"/> because there is a long term perspective <pause dur="0.5"/> there is an enhanced risk of free-riding <pause dur="1.0"/> the long term perspective also requires that the alliance itself adapts <pause dur="1.2"/> because <pause dur="0.5"/> for for many different reasons <pause dur="0.9"/> # <pause dur="0.9"/> A <pause dur="0.8"/> the alliance's rationale under which the alliance may have been founded in the first place <pause dur="0.5"/> may no longer be there if the international system changes <pause dur="0.4"/> or if <pause dur="0.3"/> the relationship between <pause dur="0.4"/> those <pause dur="0.2"/> whom the alliance was meant to deter <pause dur="0.6"/> and the alliance itself <pause dur="0.6"/> improves <pause dur="2.4"/> if it does not improve <pause dur="0.2"/> or if there is no concensus that the # the relationship has improved <pause dur="0.2"/> the question is how high should the defensive <trunc>cap</trunc> <pause dur="0.9"/> of what nature should these defensive capabilities be <pause dur="1.8"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> how committed <pause dur="0.2"/> are the allies <pause dur="0.3"/> depending on how much they contribute to the 
defensive capabilities <pause dur="0.3"/> and how they stand <pause dur="0.2"/> politically <pause dur="0.7"/> when France left NATO in nineteen-sixty-six that was seen as a major crisis <pause dur="0.6"/> because it was <pause dur="0.2"/> seen as entailing <pause dur="0.3"/> <trunc>ha</trunc> have you finished <pause dur="0.8"/> oh i'm asking now <vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" dur="1"/><pause dur="1.7"/> <kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="5"/> # <pause dur="2.2"/> it was seen as entailing the possibility that the Soviet Union might see <pause dur="0.8"/> NATO as falling apart <pause dur="2.5"/> other changes that might happen <pause dur="0.3"/> are <pause dur="0.4"/> changes in the domestic environment of alliance members <pause dur="1.2"/> better or worse economic performance <pause dur="0.5"/> now the external threat <pause dur="0.2"/> which <pause dur="0.2"/> NATO as <pause dur="0.4"/> on the NATO level agreed on <pause dur="0.7"/> may have required <pause dur="0.3"/> very high defence expenditure from the perspective of NATO planners <pause dur="0.9"/> but in the early nineteen-seventies <pause dur="0.5"/> neither the U-S <pause dur="0.5"/> nor Britain <pause dur="0.4"/> nor any of the other European countries were really in the position to spend an awful lot of money on defence <pause dur="0.5"/> they still did <pause dur="0.6"/> but they were under serious eeconomic pressures <pause dur="0.4"/> A because of <pause dur="0.2"/> the oil prices <pause dur="0.5"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> the U-S <pause dur="0.2"/> because it had exhausted itself in the in the Vietnam War <pause dur="0.2"/> and had then <pause dur="0.4"/> deferred some of the costs it paid 
in the Vietnam War <pause dur="0.6"/> over to the Europeans through its economic policies <pause dur="0.2"/> and financial policies <pause dur="2.4"/> another possibility of change is that <pause dur="1.3"/> the alliance itself might change its role in the international system <pause dur="1.6"/> maybe some alliance members are interested <pause dur="0.2"/> or might be interested in <pause dur="0.4"/> increasing <pause dur="0.5"/> the operational area of the alliance <pause dur="0.4"/> some may not <pause dur="0.6"/> that's a debate you had in NATO in the early nineteen-eighties <pause dur="0.6"/> when the U-S and <pause dur="0.6"/> Britain to a <unclear>degree</unclear> <pause dur="0.4"/> argued that NATO should take on a lot more <pause dur="0.3"/> what was then called out of area responsibilities <pause dur="0.5"/> I-E that NATO should no longer just be responsible for <pause dur="0.4"/> the defence of western Europe <pause dur="0.9"/> but <pause dur="0.4"/> also take on <pause dur="0.5"/> the Soviet threat as it was perceived <pause dur="0.5"/> in other areas such as Africa <pause dur="0.2"/> the Middle East <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> south Asia <pause dur="1.1"/> or central Asia <pause dur="2.5"/> now all this can become rather aggravating because of course in an alliance you have <pause dur="0.4"/> in in a collective defence system such as NATO <pause dur="0.8"/> you have <pause dur="0.3"/> collective decision making <pause dur="0.9"/> now the policy formulation should <pause dur="0.5"/> in <pause dur="0.4"/> the

between the Europeans and the Americans <pause dur="0.4"/> or amongst the Europeans <pause dur="1.7"/> then NATO is going to be perceived as a weak alliance <pause dur="0.3"/> because then <pause dur="0.2"/> the Soviet Union is likely to <pause dur="0.4"/> exploit <pause dur="1.3"/> this this <pause dur="0.3"/> or and and the Soviet Union is likely to exploit this weakness <pause dur="0.3"/> that it sees in <pause dur="0.2"/> NATO cohesion <pause dur="2.9"/> finally from <pause dur="0.7"/> again a systemic perspective <pause dur="1.5"/> if a collective defence system persists <pause dur="0.6"/> the question is <pause dur="0.4"/> does this persistence <pause dur="0.7"/> maintain the status quo ante <pause dur="0.4"/> I-E before <pause dur="0.3"/> the system changed <pause dur="0.3"/> and the threat disappeared <pause dur="0.5"/> such as NATO post end of Cold War <pause dur="1.2"/> or might it need two new alliances <pause dur="0.5"/> or <pause dur="0.2"/> as NATO did <pause dur="0.4"/> might it <pause dur="0.5"/> survive find new roles <pause dur="0.4"/> and transform itself but then does that perception <pause dur="0.6"/> of NATO in its Cold War identity <pause dur="0.2"/> automatically go away <pause dur="1.6"/><kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="10"/> very very <pause dur="0.2"/> weighty questions which we still haven't solved entirely yet <pause dur="5.8"/> now <pause dur="1.5"/> NATO <pause dur="1.2"/> as i said before <pause dur="0.2"/> combines a political and a military mission <pause dur="2.1"/> in its <pause dur="0.5"/> founding treaty so the Washington Treaty you can <pause dur="0.3"/> see all these documents on the NATO website which is just W-W-W-dot-NATO-dot-org <pause dur="0.5"/> 
or in the library in the in the Politics department library <pause dur="0.3"/> there is a NATO handbook which has <pause dur="0.2"/> all the basic information from a NATO perspective obviously <pause dur="0.5"/> but it's a good start into <pause dur="0.2"/> the official <pause dur="0.3"/> presentation of NATO as an organization <pause dur="0.8"/> and that includes also the Washington Treaty <pause dur="2.4"/> the declared purpose <pause dur="0.3"/> of NATO was <pause dur="0.4"/> defensive <pause dur="0.7"/> and it subjected itself to the principle <pause dur="0.4"/> principles of the U-N <pause dur="0.4"/> it was as i said before <pause dur="0.7"/> a defensive <pause dur="0.9"/> a a collective defence system <pause dur="0.4"/> which saw itself as <pause dur="0.4"/> a subsystem to <pause dur="0.3"/> the collective security system <pause dur="0.3"/> established <pause dur="0.6"/> under or with the U-N <pause dur="2.4"/> it declares that it was <pause dur="1.2"/> the <pause dur="0.7"/> the founders declared that they <pause dur="0.2"/> founded NATO <pause dur="0.3"/> <reading>to safeguard the freedom the common heritage <pause dur="0.2"/> and civilization of their peoples <pause dur="0.5"/> founded on the principles of democracy individual liberty and the rule of law</reading> <pause dur="1.0"/> now if you look at <pause dur="0.4"/> NATO from that perspective <pause dur="1.1"/> you get <pause dur="0.6"/> immediately a host of areas which you can investigate <pause dur="0.4"/> in order to <pause dur="0.6"/> critically assess <pause dur="0.2"/> the functions of NATO <pause dur="0.9"/> to ask 
questions well what is the purpose of <pause dur="0.2"/> this alliance <pause dur="2.1"/> how far is this alliance compatible <pause dur="0.4"/> with <pause dur="0.6"/> the way in which <pause dur="0.7"/> international relations work now <pause dur="0.8"/> has it adapted itself <pause dur="0.8"/> if it is tied to the ideas that <pause dur="0.4"/> on which liberal democracies are are based <pause dur="0.7"/> is it justified for NATO <pause dur="0.2"/> to <pause dur="0.4"/> protect Albanians in Kosovo against Serb aggression <pause dur="0.5"/> or maybe it's not <pause dur="2.3"/> but <pause dur="0.6"/> although <pause dur="0.3"/> <trunc>al</trunc> military alliances are mostly not <pause dur="0.2"/> investigated from that perspective <pause dur="0.9"/> it is rather a rewarding <pause dur="0.4"/> idea to <pause dur="0.5"/> at least question the political and the <pause dur="0.2"/> ideological underpinnings <pause dur="0.5"/> of military alliances <pause dur="0.3"/><kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="5"/> because in the end <pause dur="0.5"/> armed force is used for political purposes <pause dur="1.8"/> now NATO also <pause dur="0.3"/> fulfilled the other requirement that it needed to defend # to define <pause dur="1.4"/> what an armed what what aggression is what is an incident of aggression <pause dur="1.2"/> now article five of the Washington Treaty does that <pause dur="2.2"/> A that <pause dur="0.2"/> an armed attack against one shall be considered <pause dur="0.3"/> # an armed attack against all <pause dur="1.0"/> but <pause dur="2.8"/> in response <pause dur="0.3"/> to <pause dur="0.2"/> such an act of aggression <pause dur="0.2"/> each of the parties in <reading>in 
exercise of their right to individual or collective self-defence recognized by article fifty-one of the U-N charter <pause dur="0.6"/> will assist those attacked by taking individually or in concert with the other parties such action as it deems necessary</reading> <pause dur="0.3"/> now this is an essential point <pause dur="0.7"/> such action as it deems necessary <pause dur="1.0"/> this is this is <pause dur="0.3"/> NATO founders bowing to <pause dur="0.7"/> sovereignty <pause dur="1.0"/> they do not say we predetermine how we are going to defend NATO territory <pause dur="0.3"/> or territory of an ally <pause dur="0.8"/> # against an act of aggression <pause dur="0.2"/> armed aggression <pause dur="1.0"/> they say <pause dur="0.4"/> in the event <pause dur="0.2"/> of an attack <pause dur="0.4"/> each of the NATO members <pause dur="0.5"/> can decide <pause dur="0.2"/> how much <pause dur="0.4"/> and in what way <pause dur="0.5"/> it wants them to contribute to <pause dur="0.5"/> a defensive act or to to defensive action <pause dur="2.8"/> of course in NATO planning especially in NATO planning <pause dur="0.3"/> # for a contingency in an <pause dur="0.2"/> in in <pause dur="0.2"/> well in a confrontation with the Soviet Union <pause dur="0.8"/> 
was based on <pause dur="0.2"/> on the assumption that all NATO members would <pause dur="0.2"/> throw in <pause dur="0.3"/> all they had in order to defend themselves <pause dur="0.9"/> but this is an issue which is now <pause dur="0.2"/> becoming much more relevant <pause dur="0.8"/> plus if it had been <pause dur="0.3"/> not the Soviet Union but someone else attacking a NATO member <pause dur="0.4"/> then the situation would have probably been rather different <pause dur="2.3"/> and they undertook the obligation to report an attack and countermeasures to the U-N Security Council <pause dur="1.8"/><kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="14"/> they did not say <pause dur="0.4"/> we are going to ask for permission by the <sic corr="U-N">U-S</sic> Security Council I-E a mandate <pause dur="0.9"/> for <pause dur="0.2"/> any <pause dur="2.0"/> # <pause dur="1.3"/> action <pause dur="5.0"/> you don't have to write down these things look them up in in i mean <pause dur="0.4"/> the the # <pause dur="0.9"/> the article bits which i had <pause dur="0.4"/> sort of quoted on this on this slide <pause dur="0.6"/> don't write them down just look them up on the web or <pause dur="0.2"/> in in the handbook it's much easier <pause dur="1.2"/> and it's not so salient unless <pause dur="0.4"/> unless you are interested in looking at NATO and and investigating something <pause dur="0.5"/> pertaining to NATO questions <pause dur="0.6"/> # then you go <pause dur="0.2"/> <trunc>co</trunc> go to <pause dur="0.2"/> # the NATO handbook or or its website but you don't <pause dur="0.5"/> it's not 
essential <pause dur="0.2"/> nobody's going to ask you that in your exams <pause dur="0.4"/> can you quote article five of the # of the Washington Treaty <pause dur="1.8"/> # <pause dur="2.3"/> during the Cold War <pause dur="0.4"/> as i said NATO's <pause dur="0.2"/> principle objective <pause dur="0.2"/> was to deter the Soviet Union <pause dur="0.8"/> everything <pause dur="0.2"/> that NATO did <pause dur="0.5"/> was subordinate to that and of course it had to do this <pause dur="0.3"/> A <pause dur="0.4"/> through <pause dur="0.2"/> nuclear deterrents well it didn't of course have to do this <pause dur="0.6"/> did eventually have to do it when the Soviet Union <pause dur="0.4"/> acquired nuclear weapons in nineteen-forty-nine <pause dur="0.3"/> and built up a nuclear arsenal <pause dur="2.1"/> that also meant it was utterly dependent on the U-S <pause dur="0.2"/> because nuclear deterrents only worked with U-S involvement <pause dur="0.8"/> and this is where i come back to why the Europeans were so keen on having <pause dur="0.5"/> U-S military personnel based in Europe <pause dur="1.8"/> the U-S soldiers based in Europe <pause dur="0.4"/> and pilots and <pause dur="0.5"/> sailors <pause dur="0.6"/> were essentially <pause dur="0.8"/> hostages <pause dur="0.4"/> in <pause dur="0.5"/> the game of nuclear deterrents <pause dur="1.1"/> because by having U-S <pause dur="0.2"/> military personnel based in Europe <pause dur="0.5"/> that military personnel could become <pause dur="0.3"/> a target <pause dur="0.6"/> for Soviet aggression <pause dur="0.9"/> which 
meant from a European perspective <pause dur="0.4"/> the U-S <pause dur="0.4"/> would have extended national security interests in Europe <pause dur="0.4"/> in the shape of soldiers <pause dur="0.3"/> based <pause dur="0.3"/> on European soil <pause dur="1.1"/> which meant again from a European perspective <pause dur="0.3"/> that the likelihood that the U-S <pause dur="0.3"/> would use nuclear weapons in response to an attack a nuclear attack by the Soviet Union <pause dur="0.9"/> was much higher <pause dur="0.9"/> than <pause dur="0.5"/> if <pause dur="0.2"/> no U-S personnel had been based <pause dur="0.4"/> on the European continent <pause dur="2.0"/> burden sharing debate and this issue <pause dur="0.2"/> were often <pause dur="0.2"/> very closely linked <pause dur="4.8"/> at the same time <trunc>milita</trunc> # <pause dur="2.4"/> NATO tried to <pause dur="1.2"/> underline its defensive <pause dur="0.3"/> attitude <pause dur="0.8"/> by declaring that military action was dependent on <trunc>unan</trunc> unanimous decisions <pause dur="0.4"/> if the smallest member of NATO did not want to <pause dur="0.9"/> take action <pause dur="0.5"/> NATO wouldn't have taken action <pause dur="0.5"/> well <pause dur="0.3"/> unless this member was had <pause dur="0.5"/> # its arms twisted massively by all the other members <pause dur="8.4"/><kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="10"/> on the issue of cohesion <pause dur="1.8"/> not only the burden sharing <pause dur="0.2"/> debate was an issue but also <pause dur="0.7"/> arms control <pause dur="0.8"/> and i'll talk about arms control <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="1.1"/> next in a week's time <pause dur="0.8"/> so just to sort of <pause dur="0.2"/> give you a 
pointer <pause dur="0.7"/> # the SALT negotiations in the late nineteen-sixties early nineteen-seventies from a European perspective <pause dur="0.5"/> were seen as <pause dur="0.6"/> entailing at least a risk <pause dur="0.6"/> of the Soviet Union and the U-S coming to <pause dur="1.0"/> a separate agreement <pause dur="0.6"/> which suited their national security interests <pause dur="0.3"/> but not necessarily <pause dur="0.5"/> the Europeans' national security interests <pause dur="0.5"/> which meant <pause dur="0.3"/> that they perceived the risk of being abandoned <pause dur="0.3"/> by <pause dur="0.2"/> the U-S <pause dur="0.6"/> as it turned out <pause dur="0.4"/> the U-S reiterated its commitment to European security and to NATO <pause dur="1.0"/> but <pause dur="0.3"/> in that period in the late sixties early seventies <pause dur="0.2"/> there was <pause dur="0.2"/> quite a lot of <pause dur="0.4"/> concern about <kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="10"/> the issue of abandonment <pause dur="4.0"/> now <pause dur="0.4"/> to finish very swiftly <pause dur="2.1"/> NATO in the post Cold War environment <pause dur="1.6"/> NATO <pause dur="0.2"/> didn't want to abolish itself as you all know <pause dur="2.2"/> NATO was also seen as still being a child of the Cold War and harbouring aggressive <trunc>aten</trunc> intent against Russia and the successive states of the Soviet <trunc>u</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> the other successive states of the Soviet Union <pause dur="2.3"/> so NATO spent <pause dur="0.2"/> the nineteen-nineties <pause dur="0.5"/> reinventing 
itself <pause dur="0.4"/> A <pause dur="0.8"/> as <pause dur="0.6"/> one <pause dur="0.9"/> little wheel <pause dur="0.2"/> well actually quite a dominant wheel <pause dur="0.7"/> in the European <pause dur="0.3"/> framework <pause dur="0.7"/> of institutions which <pause dur="0.3"/> were responsible or which which have remit <pause dur="0.5"/> for political economic and military security and development in Europe <pause dur="1.2"/> NATO enlargement was <pause dur="0.2"/> one <pause dur="0.6"/> major aspect of this <pause dur="1.0"/> which NATO <pause dur="0.7"/> couldn't <pause dur="0.4"/> which is <pause dur="0.2"/> it would be unjustified to see as <pause dur="0.4"/> just something that NATO pursued in order to find a new <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> rationale for itself <pause dur="0.7"/> those countries which had been previously Warsaw Pact members <pause dur="0.5"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> were very keen on <pause dur="0.2"/> establishing their links with western Europe <pause dur="0.7"/> were very keen also on becoming members of NATO not least because it became clear very soon <pause dur="0.3"/> that the E-U <pause dur="0.4"/> would <pause dur="0.4"/> drag its feet a lot longer <pause dur="0.2"/> in <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> admitting new members <pause dur="0.3"/> whereas NATO <pause dur="1.0"/> both from a NATO perspective and from from a U-S perspective was much more prepared <pause dur="0.5"/> to contemplate <pause dur="0.2"/> letting in new members <pause dur="0.5"/> so last year Hungary Poland and the Czech Republic became new members of NATO <pause dur="1.7"/> NATO also # established itself as one organization <pause dur="0.3"/> which had <pause dur="1.0"/> a cooperative role <pause dur="0.4"/> within <pause dur="0.7"/> the European <pause dur="0.4"/> the E-U system of <pause dur="0.6"/> # designing <pause dur="0.3"/> a 
common foreign and security policy <pause dur="1.0"/> but of course <pause dur="0.3"/> again there you have <pause dur="1.3"/> <trunc>p</trunc> potentially huge problems <pause dur="0.5"/> of transatlantic relations the different orientations of <pause dur="0.3"/> the European <pause dur="0.3"/> the E-U members <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> towards <pause dur="0.2"/> the the their different attitudes towards the U-S conflicting <pause dur="0.3"/> with the European idea <pause dur="1.1"/> finally <pause dur="0.4"/> NATO became <pause dur="1.0"/> well <pause dur="0.2"/> one could say a subcontractor at least for a while <pause dur="0.3"/> to the U-N and the O-S-C it offered <pause dur="0.7"/> it <pause dur="0.2"/> it made itself available <pause dur="0.2"/> as a military tool <pause dur="0.4"/> # for <pause dur="0.2"/> U-N authorized or O-S-C-E <pause dur="0.4"/> <trunc>os</trunc> # authorized <pause dur="1.2"/> # operations <pause dur="1.1"/> this meant also that NATO does no longer only have to <pause dur="0.8"/> respond under article five it <pause dur="0.3"/> can <pause dur="0.7"/> it has <pause dur="0.5"/> inscribed in in into its new strategic doctrine <pause dur="0.4"/> the possibility of legitimate action <pause dur="0.3"/> in peace enforcement and peace keeping operations <pause dur="0.5"/> so its mission its self-imposed mission <pause dur="0.3"/> has changed <pause dur="0.3"/> to <pause dur="0.4"/> quite a significant degree <pause dur="1.7"/> that was an extremely fast <shift feature="voice" new="laugh"/> rundown # <shift feature="voice" new="normal"/> <pause dur="0.3"/> <trunc>betw</trunc> from alliances of collective security to NATO <pause dur="0.7"/> i hope you remember some of it <pause dur="1.1"/> and i'll see you on Thursday <pause dur="0.7"/> for <pause dur="0.3"/> deterrence <pause dur="1.1"/> thank you
