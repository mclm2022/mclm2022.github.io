working in those businesses <pause dur="0.3"/> or advising on government policy <pause dur="0.4"/> in those areas <pause dur="0.2"/> so <pause dur="0.4"/> i'm not actually interested particularly <pause dur="0.3"/> in large companies <pause dur="0.5"/> i'm very very interested <pause dur="0.4"/> in high technology start-ups <pause dur="0.3"/> i'm interested in large companies where <pause dur="0.5"/> # we have say corporate venturing activity <pause dur="0.4"/> i mean <trunc>l</trunc> # <pause dur="0.2"/> couple of months ago <pause dur="0.4"/> # i chaired a session where we looked at # Daimler-Benz <pause dur="0.2"/> # Douwe <pause dur="0.4"/> # Siemens <pause dur="0.3"/> and we looked at where we could actually use <pause dur="1.4"/> structures that would generate <pause dur="0.2"/> innovative young companies both coming out <pause dur="0.4"/> of Siemens <pause dur="0.5"/> using Siemens technology which is non-core <pause dur="0.4"/> but also going into Siemens <pause dur="0.3"/> from other areas of activity <pause dur="0.3"/> where we had # <pause dur="0.3"/> companies which had interesting technologies for Siemens and <pause dur="0.4"/> # a classic sort of structure now i talked <pause dur="0.5"/> to # a Dane <pause dur="0.4"/> # a guy called <trunc>b</trunc> # Bjørn <pause dur="0.2"/> Andersson <pause dur="0.6"/> who is in charge of their telecommunications <pause dur="0.3"/> processes <pause dur="0.5"/> # Bjørn is a Dane <pause dur="0.7"/> working based in Stuttgart <pause dur="0.2"/> but actually working out of San Cupertino <pause dur="0.4"/> so it's the it's the internationalization and 
the linkages <pause dur="0.3"/> i'm particularly interested <pause dur="0.4"/> in that area so <pause dur="0.3"/> at the moment i'm doing some work looking at the internationalization of high-tech companies <pause dur="0.4"/> in Germany <pause dur="0.3"/> and in the U-K <pause dur="0.7"/> now whenever i <pause dur="0.2"/> talk in this area people say yeah but if you <pause dur="0.4"/> if you could do it you'll do it <pause dur="0.4"/> so <pause dur="0.3"/> i should also say <pause dur="0.4"/> # i'm a # a recently retired # director of a high-tech start-up which went from nought <pause dur="0.3"/> to thirty-million dollars <pause dur="0.2"/> # in three years and i was the first chairman of it <pause dur="0.4"/> it was a British company British ideas <pause dur="0.3"/> British brains <pause dur="0.3"/> British experience so the first thing we did of course <pause dur="0.4"/> was to become American <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> the second thing we did was to ignore the City of London as the most powerful <pause dur="0.4"/> financial # area in Europe <pause dur="0.4"/> and take money out of California <pause dur="0.6"/> and the third thing we did <pause dur="0.5"/> was to set up <pause dur="0.4"/> a small subsidiary <pause dur="0.6"/> # in London <pause dur="0.7"/> # our major base was in Boston <pause dur="0.4"/> and still is <pause dur="0.5"/> # the fourth thing was out of our control <pause dur="0.3"/> which was the I-R-A <pause dur="0.4"/> who actually blew <pause dur="0.2"/> our London subsidiary to smithereens 'cause we 
were in the South Quay <pause dur="0.3"/> in Docklands <pause dur="0.4"/> if you want to liquidate assets in nanoseconds <pause dur="0.3"/> # do that i mean it's it was <pause dur="0.5"/> luckily no one was killed <pause dur="0.4"/> techies work late at night but thank God <pause dur="0.2"/> they had actually left as it was a Friday night <pause dur="0.3"/> but it was # an interesting experience <pause dur="0.5"/> so i will look <pause dur="0.7"/> in terms of these set of lectures <pause dur="1.6"/> particularly at the environment <unclear>and</unclear> we'll talk about in detail later <pause dur="0.8"/> but i will tend to skew it to my area <pause dur="0.9"/> for two reasons one <pause dur="0.5"/> that interests me <pause dur="0.7"/> and if i am interested hopefully it will be more interesting to you <pause dur="1.1"/> and two <pause dur="0.7"/> if you're not interested in technology <pause dur="0.4"/> if you're not interested in in start-up companies <pause dur="0.3"/> if you're not interested in rapidly growing companies that are international at <pause dur="0.2"/> at conception <pause dur="0.4"/> then you bloody well should be <pause dur="0.4"/> so i will play <pause dur="0.3"/> to my strengths <pause dur="0.2"/> and to my prejudices you may challenge this <pause dur="0.6"/> at any time and i hope we will have a a debate <pause dur="0.4"/> on a whole range of areas and a whole range of sectors <pause dur="0.5"/> # i started off <pause dur="0.4"/> in the 
agribusiness sector <pause dur="0.4"/> so i have actually worked for large companies Unilever Imperial Group <pause dur="0.4"/> as well as working for small companies as well <pause dur="0.9"/> okay so that's my background and hopefully <pause dur="0.4"/> as we go through the course <pause dur="0.9"/> you will enjoy it more <pause dur="1.0"/> if you can actually contribute your <pause dur="0.5"/> unique experiences your skills <pause dur="0.3"/> your experiences <pause dur="0.2"/> i may not agree with you others may not agree with you <pause dur="0.3"/> but it will make the whole dialogue <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> much more interesting <pause dur="0.3"/> # because these type of lectures certainly by <pause dur="0.4"/> myself and my colleagues is not us talking to you <pause dur="0.3"/> it's much more # a debate # <pause dur="0.2"/> that we will engage in <pause dur="0.5"/> and hopefully for some of you you might be interested <pause dur="0.4"/> in say the the venture capital course <pause dur="0.2"/> # i run <pause dur="0.5"/> in the summer where we bring in the sort of great and good <pause dur="0.5"/> of the industry internationally for # a week <pause dur="0.4"/> just talking about the nature <pause dur="0.6"/> of <pause dur="0.3"/> innovation the nature of new businesses the nature of financing <pause dur="0.4"/> growing businesses <pause dur="0.4"/> and how the hell do you get a company like # Amazon which is now capitalized at 
twenty-five-billion dollars <pause dur="0.5"/> and hasn't yet made a profit <pause dur="0.4"/> so <pause dur="0.7"/> some <trunc>b</trunc> but last year what happened was a number of <pause dur="0.4"/> the the part-timers and indeed other <pause dur="0.2"/> programmes came <pause dur="0.3"/> onto the full-time course for # an intensive week <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> but talk to the guys who did it last last year <pause dur="0.3"/> # Phil i know is here <pause dur="0.6"/> # and he did that course <pause dur="0.8"/> okay <pause dur="1.0"/> let's just briefly go through some of the sort of <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> hygiene factors i suppose <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="1.0"/> what you will have from me <pause dur="0.6"/> is and from <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> is a timetable <pause dur="0.8"/> with <pause dur="0.2"/> # a set of readings <pause dur="0.5"/> # with a set of lecture notes <pause dur="0.4"/> with a set of case studies <pause dur="0.5"/> with the allocation of of case studies to individual groups <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> can i <pause dur="0.7"/> check that <pause dur="0.2"/> you're all in agreement with that <pause dur="0.5"/> okay <pause dur="0.6"/> so you will <pause dur="0.3"/> you will have everything from us except <pause dur="0.5"/> answers to case studies or an interpretation of case studies which we <pause dur="0.4"/> will give you after the lectures <pause dur="0.8"/> i have <pause dur="0.3"/> from <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> <pause dur="1.4"/> a set <pause dur="0.7"/> of <pause dur="0.8"/> economic models macroeconomic models <pause dur="1.0"/> # on a set of disks <pause dur="0.4"/> now <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> has prepared two disks <pause dur="0.6"/> for each <pause dur="0.2"/> syndicate group <pause dur="0.6"/> he said he was not 
prepared to sit there and knock out about <pause dur="0.2"/> eighty or <trunc>s</trunc> # sixty-odd disks <pause dur="0.3"/> so basically each group <pause dur="0.3"/> will get two disks <pause dur="0.3"/> and it will be up to you to <pause dur="0.3"/> share and interchange those <pause dur="0.2"/> # with the other <pause dur="0.2"/> members of the group <pause dur="0.4"/> i've also got # a single sheet of of observations from <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> <pause dur="0.7"/> on the model that's <trunc>i</trunc> contained in the disks <pause dur="0.4"/> now <pause dur="0.2"/> his <pause dur="0.2"/> comment to me was <pause dur="0.4"/> one apologize that he wasn't here <pause dur="0.5"/> today but also <pause dur="0.4"/> to suggest <pause dur="0.4"/> that you might look <pause dur="1.1"/> in addition to the primer which you've got <pause dur="0.5"/> you might look at the model <pause dur="1.2"/> prior to the week <pause dur="0.2"/> <trunc>b</trunc> week two <pause dur="0.7"/> because the model actually is an input-output analysis <pause dur="1.4"/> is based on a set of assumptions about relationships <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> and you may wish to look <pause dur="0.8"/> to test some of those assumptions by just playing with the model <pause dur="0.5"/> as a spreadsheet model <pause dur="0.3"/> and changing some of the variables to see what actually happens <pause dur="0.2"/> # and that will for particularly for those <pause dur="0.4"/> who have less experience or no experience in economics <pause dur="0.4"/> # that might be quite a good idea to to <pause dur="0.2"/> do with <pause dur="0.4"/> # reading 
# the primer <pause dur="0.8"/> okay <pause dur="1.3"/> any sort of <pause dur="0.2"/> questions or issues or uncertainties at this stage <pause dur="0.9"/> they will probably come thick and fast later <pause dur="2.3"/> right let me just mention # assessments <pause dur="1.2"/> now <pause dur="0.7"/> the assessment is based <pause dur="0.6"/> on <pause dur="0.7"/> a term paper <pause dur="0.8"/> that's eighty per cent <pause dur="0.2"/> of the assessment <pause dur="1.1"/> now i will talk in detail about that next week 'cause i don't want to spend <pause dur="0.4"/> the whole of this sort of introduction talking about just the the <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.9"/> the admin <pause dur="0.3"/> but <pause dur="0.3"/> essentially <pause dur="0.3"/> you <pause dur="0.4"/> have been given <pause dur="0.7"/> in groups <pause dur="0.6"/> # an industry sector <pause dur="1.1"/> # it maybe pharmaceuticals <pause dur="1.1"/> within that sector and within the group i have allocated individually <pause dur="0.7"/> a company <pause dur="0.5"/> to each one of you <pause dur="1.3"/> and what you are asked to do <pause dur="0.8"/> is to look <pause dur="0.4"/> at the nature of <pause dur="0.2"/> the past <pause dur="0.2"/> present and future environment <pause dur="0.6"/> you needn't write this down because it's all in the the the <pause dur="0.2"/> the document i've given you <pause dur="0.8"/> and look at how it has changed <pause dur="0.5"/> what are the key changes in that environment what are the key drivers <pause dur="0.7"/> and then to take a view on how well or badly <pause dur="0.8"/> the company <pause dur="0.5"/> has 
recognized <pause dur="0.2"/> adapted and responded <pause dur="0.4"/> to those environmental changes <pause dur="1.2"/> now what i have said <pause dur="0.7"/> is that <pause dur="0.4"/> as a group <pause dur="1.5"/> we would like you to analyse <pause dur="0.5"/> the nature of that industry <pause dur="0.2"/> that sector <pause dur="0.9"/> i don't i think it's stupid for me particularly <trunc>gi</trunc> given that you have <pause dur="0.2"/> limited time <pause dur="0.4"/> and i i did a a three year part-time degree at London Business School <pause dur="0.4"/> so i know how difficult it is to sort of match the trinity of life <pause dur="0.7"/> you know and everything else <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> and also to sort of switch out of M-B-A <pause dur="0.3"/> mode when you go back and meet <pause dur="0.2"/> human beings <pause dur="0.4"/> so i have some considerable sympathy to that <pause dur="0.5"/> but that sympathy doesn't extend <pause dur="0.4"/> to the <pause dur="0.3"/> the the extent of saying well <pause dur="0.7"/> i don't expect them to exercise intelligence effort <pause dur="0.2"/> or creativity <pause dur="0.4"/> so <pause dur="0.3"/> i have some leeway but only just <pause dur="0.5"/> but in that case what i have said <pause dur="0.6"/> is <pause dur="0.3"/> that <pause dur="0.6"/> it is just stupid <pause dur="0.6"/> for a group <pause dur="0.5"/> each <pause dur="0.2"/> to go and use exactly the same resources <pause dur="0.9"/> so <pause dur="0.3"/> as a group <pause dur="0.6"/> you may wish <pause dur="0.2"/> to share <pause dur="1.5"/> the analysis of the industry <pause dur="0.9"/> someone <trunc>el</trunc> may get the keynote # reports <pause dur="0.4"/> someone else 
may look at data stream <pause dur="0.4"/> someone else may do a literature view you come together you share the data say we think this is material <pause dur="0.4"/> and work that way i survived an M-B-A <pause dur="0.3"/> a family and a job <pause dur="0.2"/> purely by by working with # a group of mates <pause dur="0.3"/> where we sorted out <pause dur="0.4"/> # the competences of each of us the time of each of us and sort of divvied up the work <pause dur="0.7"/> in terms of the presentation of the final paper that <pause dur="0.2"/> is an individual <pause dur="0.6"/> piece of work <pause dur="0.3"/> and must be handed in <pause dur="0.3"/> as such <pause dur="0.7"/> so and that you know you <pause dur="0.8"/> you can commit serial murder at Warwick <pause dur="0.5"/> but plagiarism <pause dur="0.5"/> is beyond limits <pause dur="0.6"/> so <pause dur="0.3"/> in terms of the final piece of work it's your own <pause dur="0.2"/> okay <pause dur="0.7"/> twenty per cent <pause dur="0.5"/> of the marks <pause dur="1.0"/> is allocated <pause dur="0.4"/> to group performance <pause dur="1.5"/> now <pause dur="0.7"/> i hate that because what the hell do you mean by group performance some of you <pause dur="0.3"/> will give stunning presentations <pause dur="1.3"/> completely content free <pause dur="1.1"/> other people will stutter through <pause dur="0.3"/> an inarticulate <pause dur="0.2"/> but well thought out <pause dur="0.4"/> analysis <pause dur="0.3"/> and most of you will be in the middle <pause dur="1.2"/> the only reason <pause dur="0.7"/> we allocate that twenty 
per cent <pause dur="0.9"/> is <pause dur="0.2"/> so that you don't take a game theory response and say <pause dur="0.3"/> if it isn't marked then we won't do it <pause dur="0.5"/> or <pause dur="0.3"/> we'll do it but we'll only do it sufficiently to say well you know we did look at the case study <pause dur="0.4"/> like three minutes in the car park before we came in <pause dur="0.6"/> now that's horrendously boring for me and no one else learns from that either <pause dur="0.3"/> so we give you twenty per cent of the marks <pause dur="0.2"/> so there is a weighting <pause dur="0.7"/> # on that but the major weighting is is the term paper <pause dur="0.3"/> okay <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> now if there are any queries on that i i'd rather <pause dur="0.5"/> deal with them next week particularly as # half of you have been to the library and half have still to go is that right <pause dur="1.1"/> is that <pause dur="0.3"/> yeah <pause dur="0.5"/> so <pause dur="0.4"/> i think it'd be better once you've actually all <pause dur="0.2"/> # been through the library system <pause dur="1.1"/> okay <pause dur="0.5"/> in terms of readings <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> has given you <pause dur="0.2"/> a reading Nellis and Parker <pause dur="0.6"/> he has also given you # # # a standard # economics book <pause dur="0.5"/> if you wish to delve into it <pause dur="1.4"/> but it's not # a core book <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> i've used # this <pause dur="2.2"/> document here Grant <pause dur="1.1"/><kinesic desc="holds up book" iterated="n"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> Grant <pause dur="0.2"/> is <pause dur="0.2"/>

we we were having a very sort of interesting discussion about <pause dur="0.4"/> how technology <pause dur="0.6"/> will actually change <pause dur="0.6"/> his business and his job because the <unclear>outcome of the thing</unclear> of course is Amazon <pause dur="0.5"/> is going into # <pause dur="0.8"/> records in a much bigger way than it has in the past and C-D Now <pause dur="0.5"/> # is one of the biggest record stores in the world and is again is a virtual record <pause dur="0.3"/> store but <pause dur="0.3"/> it's it's one of the areas we'll be talking in i think in week four about the the disruptive nature <pause dur="0.3"/> of technology but it's nice to actually <pause dur="0.3"/> teach it to one group <pause dur="0.4"/> and then actually have one of your your past students coming back and <pause dur="0.3"/> then at the end with a sort of quivering lip say <pause dur="0.4"/> but what the hell do we do <vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" dur="1"/><pause dur="0.6"/> anyway <pause dur="0.5"/> that's a complete aside <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="1.2"/> on to the real world <pause dur="0.9"/> i thought i would start <pause dur="0.5"/> the <pause dur="0.4"/> the <pause dur="0.4"/> session by <pause dur="1.1"/> a quote by by Charles Handy because what we're we're looking at here <pause dur="0.9"/> as Grant says we're looking at that link <pause dur="0.8"/> between <pause dur="0.4"/> the environment <pause dur="0.8"/> and the firm <pause dur="1.1"/> and that link <pause dur="0.7"/> in Grant's terms <pause dur="0.3"/> is 
what he calls strategy now there's hundreds of definitions <pause dur="0.6"/> but <pause dur="0.2"/> what <pause dur="1.6"/> Charles said was essentially <pause dur="2.2"/> what <pause dur="0.2"/> people don't look at <pause dur="0.5"/> is the nature <pause dur="0.2"/> of the prevailing <pause dur="0.5"/> environment the outside of the organization <pause dur="0.5"/> now i've seen this <trunc>ce</trunc> certainly talking to <pause dur="0.4"/> a number of organizations <pause dur="0.4"/> and you would ask them to explain what they're doing <pause dur="1.0"/> and you will get <pause dur="0.4"/> you will get the politics you will get the internal rivalries you'll get the <pause dur="0.4"/> the products sometimes you get customers you will rarely get an analysis <pause dur="0.4"/> of the <sic corr="context">constext</sic> of the competitive <pause dur="0.3"/> environment <pause dur="0.4"/> in which they operate <pause dur="0.4"/> and it seems to me in many cases that is the first thing that you actually talk about <pause dur="0.4"/> before you talk about the firm <pause dur="0.7"/> now it's interesting i mean <pause dur="0.2"/> this <trunc>i</trunc> this is Charles Handy talking about this <pause dur="0.5"/> this is a guy <pause dur="0.8"/> who is an O-B man <pause dur="1.3"/> you know he's he the the whole stuff of Charles' reputation <pause dur="0.8"/> is that he looks at the sort of <pause dur="0.3"/> the dynamics of firms how people relate within those 
firms <pause dur="0.4"/> the natures of tensions the nature of resolutions <pause dur="0.5"/> but what he's saying is that <pause dur="0.3"/> that may be my professional métier <pause dur="0.8"/> but what is really really important <pause dur="0.3"/> is how the outside <pause dur="0.4"/> how the the environment is changing <pause dur="0.3"/> now <pause dur="0.2"/> this <trunc>i</trunc> this is this is <pause dur="0.3"/> Charles on the road to Damascus i mean <pause dur="0.4"/> this guy <pause dur="0.7"/> i always think has a enormous advantage because if you listen to Thought for the Day <pause dur="0.7"/> he sounds like God <pause dur="1.1"/> and then when you meet him <pause dur="0.2"/> you know <pause dur="0.4"/> elderly white hair <pause dur="0.3"/> white Anglo-Saxon WASP <pause dur="0.4"/> he looks like God so at least in Michelangelo's sense so he's got a lot going for him <pause dur="0.4"/> you can see from the charge up rates <pause dur="3.3"/><kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="2"/> what i'm going to be looking at <pause dur="1.1"/> in the simplest form <pause dur="0.8"/> is <pause dur="0.7"/> really <pause dur="1.0"/> the levels of the environment <pause dur="1.3"/> that we need to understand that we need to analyse <pause dur="0.4"/> because it's rather like <pause dur="0.4"/> like an onion you know you <pause dur="0.3"/> you sort of peel this thing through various layers <pause dur="0.4"/> in order to understand the macroenvironment <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> the why the the operating environment and in the internal 
environment so we'll talk about those in a in a wee while <pause dur="0.3"/> we'll look at competitive forces and i presume you've done this in the the marketing courses looked at things like # <pause dur="0.4"/> Porter's five forces is that right </u><u who="ss" trans="latching"> mm </u><u who="nm1127" trans="latching"> who did you do it with </u><pause dur="0.6"/> <u who="sm1135" trans="pause"> with <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/></u><u who="nm1127" trans="overlap"> <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> right <pause dur="0.2"/> okay <pause dur="0.6"/> i might put a spin on that and see how we go 'cause <pause dur="0.2"/> as a strategist i tend to see it differently from from the marketing guys <pause dur="0.3"/> in some cases but if i don't then i won't waste your time <pause dur="0.3"/> or my my my time <pause dur="0.3"/> reiterating <pause dur="1.0"/> we'll look briefly at value chains <pause dur="0.4"/> and then finally # <pause dur="0.3"/> at what i call a sort of an anti-panic <pause dur="0.2"/> acronym <pause dur="0.6"/> # <unclear>MACOCOTREES</unclear> and <unclear>MACOCOTREES</unclear> was something that <pause dur="0.4"/> # my group # at London Business School developed <pause dur="0.7"/> in order to survive this damned thing we called an M-B-A <pause dur="0.2"/> so it was <pause dur="0.3"/> it was a heuristic to try and actually <pause dur="0.4"/> encapsulate <pause dur="0.4"/> some of the issues we needed to look at when we were looking at a case study so i'll i'll explore that <pause dur="0.4"/> and we we might well use that in some of 
the case studies <pause dur="3.5"/><kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="5"/> i think one of the <pause dur="0.2"/> the <pause dur="0.6"/> the <pause dur="0.2"/> things i most enjoy <pause dur="1.7"/> when <pause dur="1.4"/> looking at companies <pause dur="1.8"/> is when things go wrong <pause dur="0.2"/> now it's not enjoyable for you if you're in the company <pause dur="0.5"/> but as a researcher <pause dur="0.5"/> it is much more interesting looking at failure <pause dur="0.9"/> than it is at success <pause dur="0.6"/> and there is also a rather pleasant schadenfreude <pause dur="0.3"/> at looking at the sort of pillars of industry <pause dur="0.3"/> when they fall flat on their faces <pause dur="0.3"/> and so i've put up # a number <pause dur="0.6"/> of <pause dur="0.5"/> areas <pause dur="1.3"/> where <pause dur="1.0"/> there have been concerns discontinuities <pause dur="0.3"/> cock-ups whatever you want to call them <pause dur="0.6"/> i mean in terms of health and safety issues <pause dur="0.3"/> the agrifood industry <pause dur="0.5"/> the the B-S-E crisis <pause dur="0.4"/> was abysmally <pause dur="0.4"/> handled <pause dur="0.8"/> as a crisis <pause dur="0.6"/> it was abysmally handled in terms of <pause dur="0.7"/> an understanding of the outcome <pause dur="0.5"/> and implications <pause dur="0.9"/> of <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> having basically an adulteration in the in the food chain i mean i i started my life as a food scientist so i'm <pause dur="0.4"/> quite interested in this area <pause dur="0.3"/> and it's not fair to say well we didn't know how <pause dur="0.4"/> important it was <pause dur="0.7"/> at that stage <pause dur="0.2"/> any understanding any 
stepping back <pause dur="0.7"/> and looking at the probabilities and the outcomes <pause dur="0.7"/> and the <pause dur="0.2"/> <trunc>politi</trunc> the <trunc>prow</trunc> profound political costs of say an outlier <pause dur="0.2"/> that this thing could be <pause dur="0.4"/> # contaminate the food chain <pause dur="0.7"/> might have taken <pause dur="0.5"/> you to to take a very different view to that taken by <pause dur="0.4"/> # the Conservative government at that particular time <pause dur="1.1"/> an area which perhaps is is more near to home in <pause dur="0.2"/> in terms of <pause dur="1.1"/> ethical issues but also <pause dur="0.4"/> within the food industry <pause dur="0.4"/> is someone like <trunc>monsan</trunc> Monsanto <pause dur="1.3"/> now <pause dur="0.5"/> Monsanto is a company that's sort of <pause dur="0.4"/> from a # an American tradition <pause dur="0.6"/> there is not the hassle in America about genetically modified food <pause dur="1.5"/> but there is a profound concern <pause dur="0.9"/> within Europe <pause dur="0.8"/> and <vocal desc="laugh" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.6"/> unlike <pause dur="0.2"/> either Labour or the Conservative Party i do consider <pause dur="0.6"/> Britain to be part of Europe <pause dur="0.3"/> most of the time <pause dur="1.2"/> and you have a situation there <pause dur="1.2"/> where <pause dur="1.6"/> quite literally <pause dur="1.6"/> a major <pause dur="0.3"/> pharmaceutical company <pause dur="1.6"/> and the distributing food chain <pause dur="1.1"/> # through the multiples <pause dur="0.2"/> said <pause dur="0.5"/> we are putting <pause dur="1.1"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> modified soya <pause dur="0.9"/> within food products <pause dur="1.4"/> and it is 
not <pause dur="0.5"/> possible <pause dur="0.6"/> to determine <pause dur="0.5"/> which products have it in <pause dur="0.5"/> so basically <pause dur="0.3"/> that's it lads <pause dur="0.3"/> that's you know it's there <pause dur="0.4"/> and you've got it <pause dur="1.0"/> now <pause dur="0.6"/> while that may have been accepted in America <pause dur="0.6"/> if you look at that and then become surprised <pause dur="0.6"/> that there was <pause dur="0.4"/> a campaign of almost sort of hate <pause dur="0.3"/> against Monsanto <pause dur="0.9"/> i mean i'm not at all surprised and i was all i found <pause dur="0.3"/> was at that time the stunning <pause dur="0.7"/> the absolutely stunning arrogance <pause dur="0.4"/> for someone to say we can adulterate your food <pause dur="0.5"/> # but no we can't tell you <pause dur="0.7"/> where or how <pause dur="0.6"/> and so don't be surprised <pause dur="0.3"/> when Monsanto has to publicly and very visibly <pause dur="0.5"/> retract <pause dur="0.5"/> from an untenable position <pause dur="0.5"/> now again the question is <pause dur="0.4"/> was that completely out of the blue <pause dur="0.8"/> could no one have actually envisaged <pause dur="0.4"/> anything like that outcome <pause dur="0.3"/> happening were they just <pause dur="0.2"/> jolly unlucky <pause dur="0.4"/> or was this some kind of hubris <pause dur="0.5"/> built <trunc>i</trunc> brought on because <pause dur="0.3"/> basically we're technologists technocrats <pause dur="0.3"/> and we know what's better for you guys <pause dur="0.5"/> you know the Americans enjoy it <pause dur="0.3"/> so why don't you <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> i mean <pause dur="0.6"/> i'm not 
trying to make sort of cheap political points but it's it's really very <pause dur="0.5"/> interesting <pause dur="0.6"/> that they got to that stage i mean <pause dur="1.5"/> we had # a friend of mine <pause dur="1.3"/> # is the the head of Greenpeace <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> and Peter Melchett has come here on two or three occasions <pause dur="0.4"/> to actually talk to to the students <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> <shift feature="voice" new="laugh"/>that's <shift feature="voice" new="normal"/> <pause dur="0.4"/> it's quite an interesting reaction when you say he's a mate because <pause dur="0.4"/> i was in Iceland # advising <pause dur="0.2"/> # the government <pause dur="0.3"/> small but perfectly formed country and it's got some great glaciers <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> and i said you know i Peter's a friend of mine and and <pause dur="0.5"/> they didn't say anything they just <pause dur="0.6"/> we were in a restaurant and someone said something in Icelandic <pause dur="0.2"/> which is <pause dur="0.5"/> you know <pause dur="0.2"/> a language shared by two-hundred-and-seventy-thousand people <pause dur="0.3"/> and the next thing i had # a plate of raw whale meat <pause dur="0.5"/> # in <shift feature="voice" new="laugh"/>front of me <shift feature="voice" new="normal"/><vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" n="ss" dur="1"/><pause dur="0.6"/> which i thought was a fairly loaded response to to that # <pause dur="0.3"/> <trunc>beha</trunc> to my comment <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="1.8"/> the <trunc>li</trunc> in this actual room two two Norwegians and said the wonderful classic phrase <pause dur="0.4"/> what is so wrong about

say that <pause dur="0.3"/> the environment <pause dur="1.1"/> can be monitored <pause dur="0.6"/> it can be appraised <pause dur="0.4"/> however imperfectly <pause dur="0.8"/> that there are signs there are straws in the wind <pause dur="0.4"/> and one of the situations is <pause dur="0.2"/> how do we structure our environment <pause dur="1.0"/> so that we are open <pause dur="0.6"/> to those stimuli that we are open <pause dur="0.3"/> to those signals <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> i was with # <pause dur="1.0"/> the board of Volvo a couple of years ago <pause dur="1.0"/> and we're talking about corporate venturing <pause dur="0.4"/> and how they actually utilized <pause dur="0.4"/> very interesting innovations that weren't core to the business couldn't be used in a car or a truck <pause dur="0.4"/> but still had been created by their research departments and <pause dur="0.3"/> we talked about the the nature of entrepreneurs <pause dur="0.4"/> where entrepreneurs come and they they said well how do we find <pause dur="0.2"/> our entrepreneurs <pause dur="0.8"/> and i said well it <pause dur="0.3"/> it's actually quite simple <pause dur="0.4"/> they're almost invariably the guys who are troublemakers <pause dur="0.6"/> within your organization <pause dur="0.3"/> and your organization <pause dur="0.4"/> will spend most of its life <pause dur="0.2"/> trying to get rid of them in one form of castrating them gagging them <pause dur="0.4"/> sending them off to you 
know Reykjavik # as their key respondent or whatever <pause dur="0.9"/> but ironically it is those guys that are most likely <pause dur="0.6"/> to <pause dur="0.8"/> be aware <pause dur="1.0"/> of fundamental changes within the organization <pause dur="0.7"/> because there's a whole literature <pause dur="0.7"/> on industry recipes <pause dur="0.7"/> # it comes out of Gerry Johnson or it's now called <pause dur="0.3"/> industry paradigms he's got more posh <pause dur="0.9"/> and what that says is that <pause dur="0.4"/> very often <pause dur="0.8"/> the nature <pause dur="0.2"/> of threat <pause dur="0.7"/> the nature of external environmental change <pause dur="0.5"/> is actually recognized <pause dur="0.3"/> within the organization <pause dur="1.1"/> the problem is that there are not systems <pause dur="1.1"/> that actually can incorporate that <pause dur="0.6"/> and work on it <pause dur="0.8"/> 'cause what you tend to have <pause dur="0.2"/> is <pause dur="0.9"/> say for example <pause dur="1.9"/> your your model <pause dur="0.3"/> has worked for several years <pause dur="2.0"/> and then <pause dur="0.5"/> starts <pause dur="0.2"/> not to work <pause dur="1.2"/> what do you do <pause dur="2.0"/> so what do you do </u><pause dur="2.7"/> <u who="sm1136" trans="pause"> change the model </u><pause dur="0.6"/> <u who="nm1127" trans="pause"> change the model <pause dur="0.8"/> is that what most of you would do </u><pause dur="0.6"/> <u who="sm1137" trans="pause"> find out why the <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> why the model's wrong </u><pause dur="1.3"/> <u who="nm1127" trans="pause"> find out why the model's wrong <pause dur="1.6"/> or what you might do <pause dur="1.2"/> i mean both are right <pause dur="0.6"/> but probably the first reaction <pause dur="0.8"/> remember that

who they can't afford to pay their going rate <pause dur="0.3"/> you know <pause dur="0.2"/> i'm only going to pay you sixty-thousand dollars <pause dur="0.4"/> but you're going to have a hundred-thousand options and i've sat in board meetings where we have gone through <pause dur="0.2"/> every member <pause dur="0.4"/> of staff down to the receptionists <pause dur="0.4"/> # not down but you know <pause dur="0.2"/> every grade of staff <pause dur="0.5"/> # from the the founders downwards <pause dur="0.4"/> and allocated options <pause dur="0.3"/> according to the subjective value <pause dur="0.6"/> of them to the business <pause dur="0.4"/> or a value of them <trunc>m</trunc> not being in the business <pause dur="0.5"/> and that seems to be an entirely <trunc>legit</trunc> legitimate <pause dur="0.4"/> and valuable way of rewarding <pause dur="0.3"/> people who are taking risk <pause dur="0.4"/> and it's a way that has been completely adulterated within the U-K now there's quite a lot of <pause dur="0.4"/> # work being done by # the Treasury <pause dur="0.5"/> to actually <pause dur="0.5"/> retrench from that position <pause dur="0.6"/> so <pause dur="0.3"/> if you're actually understanding how say <pause dur="0.3"/> high-tech young firms are working <pause dur="0.4"/> that's actually quite important to know <pause dur="0.4"/> so what i'm saying is <pause dur="0.9"/> look at the general environment <pause dur="0.5"/> then the <trunc>operate</trunc> the general environment is
