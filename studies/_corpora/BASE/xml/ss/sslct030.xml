<u who="nm1222"> maybe i said it at the very beginning # <pause dur="0.2"/> but maybe i didn't <pause dur="0.3"/> so <trunc>f</trunc> # while i talk feel free sort of to interrupt me if you have any questions directly as i'm going on <pause dur="0.3"/> because as you will have noticed # <pause dur="0.5"/> # i and i guess <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> as well we have a tendency just just just to talk to the very end of the lecture <pause dur="0.2"/> so there is not really any time <pause dur="0.4"/> to ask questions directly at the end only then in the seminar <pause dur="0.3"/> but if you want to raise points directly related to <pause dur="0.2"/> what we are doing <pause dur="0.4"/> # just feel free to do so <pause dur="0.2"/> then we <pause dur="0.3"/> we can interrupt and and answer questions or give more detail <pause dur="2.3"/> # otherwise <pause dur="0.3"/> # we will with this with this lecture now move to # the <pause dur="0.2"/> the whole set of lecture really the <pause dur="0.2"/> the core or the middle part of this course <pause dur="0.4"/> where the # we will talk about <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> tendencies of change in <pause dur="0.3"/> contemporary Western societies <pause dur="0.6"/> over <pause dur="0.2"/> well roughly <pause dur="0.2"/> the past three decades or the post-World War Two period <pause dur="0.6"/> so the main <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.8"/> time span at which we'll be looking will always be a comparison between <pause dur="0.2"/> well roughly the 
nineteen-fifties and nineteen-sixties on the one hand <pause dur="0.5"/> and the nineteen-nineties on the other <pause dur="0.6"/> and the guiding question will always be <pause dur="0.3"/> whether there <pause dur="0.2"/> is an important social transformation going on <pause dur="0.4"/> # in the various fields of of social action <pause dur="0.4"/> in society <pause dur="1.0"/> now <pause dur="0.2"/> # we'll start with really with <pause dur="0.2"/> sort of more economic topics so the theme of this lecture is in <pause dur="0.2"/> well economic sociology if you want to call it like that <pause dur="0.5"/> or also some elements of <pause dur="0.3"/> the sociology of labour and sociology of the welfare state <pause dur="2.0"/> and # <pause dur="0.3"/> you may remember from <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> a couple weeks ago <pause dur="0.4"/> # that # i already gave an outline of the major areas we'll be looking at of the dimensions of social change <pause dur="0.6"/> # so i will <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> in the first few minutes come back to that <pause dur="0.4"/> # talk about <pause dur="0.2"/> how we can discuss the major economic changes <pause dur="0.4"/> and then go into <pause dur="0.2"/> much more detail than i did in the short summary <pause dur="0.5"/> which i did a couple weeks ago <pause dur="2.9"/> now <pause dur="0.2"/> the <pause dur="0.2"/> question which i already posed a couple of weeks ago was <pause dur="0.3"/> well why at all look at the post-war 
period <pause dur="0.4"/> if <pause dur="0.4"/> # one could say that i mean for <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> most Western countries <pause dur="0.3"/> there wasn't really any major institutional change <pause dur="0.4"/> i mean most Western countries <pause dur="0.2"/> at least from after the Second World War onwards from the <trunc>ni</trunc> late nineteen-forties <pause dur="0.6"/> # were <pause dur="0.2"/> basically <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> democratically organized in political terms <pause dur="0.4"/> they were capitalist market societies in economic terms <pause dur="0.4"/> they were # societies <pause dur="0.2"/> broadly committed to a plural understanding of # <pause dur="0.2"/> social lives <pause dur="0.4"/> so nothing really happened in all those sort of most fundamental terms one could say <pause dur="1.1"/> nevertheless <pause dur="0.3"/> we will try to make an argument that there was a major change <pause dur="0.4"/> # so that must have been then on a slightly <pause dur="0.3"/> sort of <pause dur="0.2"/> more <pause dur="0.4"/> # more detailed levels of a more differentiated level <pause dur="1.0"/> # and that is what we will try to do so we have to describe <pause dur="1.0"/> in this lecture economic but then also political and social changes <pause dur="0.4"/> in a bit more detail at a <pause dur="0.2"/> at a lower level of differentiation so to say <pause dur="1.9"/> once we do that <pause dur="0.3"/> then <pause dur="0.3"/> # we can see that indeed there were some <pause dur="0.3"/> 
some important changes <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> and so what i will do now is i will try to describe <pause dur="0.5"/> # or give an idea as to how one could describe <pause dur="0.2"/> as indeed how sociology has described <pause dur="0.5"/> # over a <pause dur="0.6"/> a couple of decades within the framework of industrial society theory <pause dur="0.6"/> has described the societies of the nineteen-fifties nineteen-sixties <pause dur="0.8"/> # and then i will sort of <pause dur="0.3"/> # try to show <pause dur="0.4"/> how these descriptions have changed and how we should really <pause dur="0.3"/> # see <pause dur="0.3"/> Western societies in a slightly different light nowadays <pause dur="1.8"/> in economic terms <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> i say this <pause dur="0.3"/> briefly as a summary at the beginning <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> the <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> theory of industrial society <pause dur="0.4"/> # was really based on the idea <pause dur="0.3"/> that # <pause dur="0.4"/> the dominant model of industrial production <pause dur="0.4"/> is # standardized mass production <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> large production runs of a rather limited number of goods <pause dur="0.4"/> # in large-scale factories # large-scale organizations <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> and those <pause dur="0.2"/> the goods produced <pause dur="0.3"/> the under those conditions of mass production <pause dur="0.3"/> being consumed in a similarly standardized way so that's <pause dur="0.3"/> 
standardized mass <trunc>cos</trunc> mass consumption as some people have said <pause dur="1.6"/> this <pause dur="0.4"/> model of economic organization then went with <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> sort of say a model of economic policy making <pause dur="0.7"/> # which seemed adapted and adequate to this model of economic organization <pause dur="0.5"/> namely <pause dur="0.3"/> on the one hand <pause dur="0.4"/> large-scale organization of both employers and workers sort of in unions and of employers' associations <pause dur="0.6"/> # direct negotiation between <pause dur="0.2"/> the top <pause dur="0.2"/> level of these large-scale organizations <pause dur="0.5"/> with very often <pause dur="0.3"/> the involvement of the state as a moderator and mediator <pause dur="0.4"/> between sort of the two <pause dur="0.4"/> conflicting organizations <pause dur="1.1"/> the state in addition <pause dur="0.4"/> intervening into the economy <pause dur="0.4"/> # by means of <pause dur="0.3"/> what was technically known as demand management <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> economic policy based on the Keynesian idea <pause dur="0.4"/> that # by increasing or diminishing government spending <pause dur="0.3"/> # you could indeed <pause dur="0.3"/> keep the economy on a basically stable growth path <pause dur="1.5"/> that then in consequence it's a third element <pause dur="0.3"/> the so it's the the economy policy 
objective we can call it <pause dur="0.4"/> or also a link between <pause dur="0.3"/> economic policy and social policy really <pause dur="0.6"/> namely that once you think that you can't keep the economy on a stable growth path <pause dur="0.5"/> then you can also <pause dur="0.2"/> argue that <pause dur="0.4"/> full employment is <pause dur="0.4"/> an objective of government action <pause dur="0.4"/> which can indeed be achieved <pause dur="0.4"/> there is no major problem in achieving it because on the basis of Keynesianism <pause dur="0.5"/> # you know how you're going to do it <pause dur="0.3"/> namely <pause dur="0.4"/> should employment fall below a certain level <pause dur="0.4"/> then <pause dur="0.2"/> you # have to increase government spending <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> the production will increase and employment will increase <pause dur="0.2"/> and accordingly sort of the move back to the growth path <pause dur="0.4"/> has been achieved <pause dur="1.5"/> so that is <pause dur="0.3"/> basically # we can call that a sort of full employment convention as it has been called recently <pause dur="0.3"/> and the basic agreement # <pause dur="0.5"/> even sort of among the major parties sort of the more conservative Christian parties on the one hand <pause dur="0.4"/> the Tories in Britain <pause dur="0.4"/> and the the more <pause dur="0.4"/> sort of left wing Social Democratic or Labour parties on the 
other hand <pause dur="0.5"/> during the fifties and sixties <pause dur="0.2"/> they basically agreed that that is the <pause dur="0.3"/> the way to do it <pause dur="0.2"/> # and that <pause dur="0.2"/> one indeed could achieve that <pause dur="1.8"/> so this is <pause dur="0.2"/> <trunc>i</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> in summary really something which i said already earlier a couple of weeks ago <pause dur="0.6"/> is # <pause dur="0.2"/> the idea that there is a typical <pause dur="0.5"/> # sort of organization of production <pause dur="0.5"/> linked to <pause dur="0.6"/> a typical economic policy mechanism <pause dur="0.3"/> # and economic policy objectives <pause dur="0.5"/> which in sum really describe what <pause dur="0.5"/> # the economy of <trunc>in</trunc> advanced industrial society is about <pause dur="1.3"/> that's the image of the <pause dur="0.2"/> nineteen-sixties so to say <pause dur="0.9"/> and now we'll i'll run through that <pause dur="0.4"/> and # we'll try to discuss <pause dur="0.3"/> if that has changed and how that has changed over the more recent period <pause dur="0.7"/> let me for that purpose also <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> draw sort of a <pause dur="0.8"/> a a kind of picture which you will <pause dur="0.2"/> # be used to already by now <pause dur="0.3"/> sort of this distinction between the sixties and the nineties <pause dur="0.4"/> long <pause dur="0.2"/> well always slightly schematic terms but i think useful terms <pause dur="0.4"/> to # <pause dur="0.3"/> carve out the main elements of those pictures <pause dur="0.6"/> so we'll <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="6"/><pause dur="2.4"/>  
compare the nineteen-sixties <pause dur="2.5"/> to the nineteen-nineties <pause dur="0.6"/> along those # three dimensions which i <pause dur="0.2"/> i outlined just now <pause dur="0.5"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="10"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> the one we can call <pause dur="0.9"/> something like the <pause dur="0.6"/> organization of production <pause dur="5.7"/> this is <pause dur="0.6"/> standardized mass production <pause dur="9.9"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="10"/> and associated with that the large-scale organization <pause dur="10.5"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="7"/> combined and linked to # <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> what i call here now the economic policy <pause dur="0.6"/> arrangement or mechanism <pause dur="12.3"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="9"/> this is # <pause dur="0.4"/> Keynesianism <pause dur="0.3"/> on the one hand <pause dur="6.4"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="4"/> and very often <pause dur="0.4"/> indeed to varying degrees but i will come back to that <pause dur="0.5"/> linked to what one can call corporatism <pause dur="0.5"/> corporatism in the sense namely that <pause dur="0.2"/> both employers and workers <pause dur="0.4"/> get organized also in large-scale organizations that's where there is some <pause dur="0.2"/><kinesic desc="indicates point on board" iterated="n"/> mapping here to the form of production <pause dur="0.6"/> # and that they <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> talk about # the development of the economy <pause dur="0.3"/> often <pause dur="0.2"/> # together with the state governments of the economic ministry or <pause dur="0.3"/> whatever the exact title is in various countries <pause dur="1.8"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="2"/> this is indeed a term with which you may be less familiar <pause dur="0.4"/> it's more 
typical really of continental European arrangements than of <pause dur="0.6"/> English or British arrangements <pause dur="0.2"/> but we come back to that <pause dur="5.8"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="3"/> and finally we have an economic policy objective as i just <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="8"/> said <pause dur="9.0"/> and that is # the full employment convention <pause dur="13.2"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="10"/> now if we look at that <pause dur="0.6"/> you can almost immediately say that <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> this <pause dur="0.2"/> is no longer <pause dur="0.5"/> sort of really in the strong sense valid <pause dur="0.5"/> # in the sense namely that <pause dur="0.3"/> # <kinesic desc="indicates point on board" iterated="n"/> this is the the one dominant or typical model <pause dur="0.2"/> of economic organization and economic policy <pause dur="0.8"/> but on the other hand you could also argue <pause dur="0.4"/> well <pause dur="0.3"/> we still have elements of all that <pause dur="0.4"/> and certainly there is standardized mass production still <pause dur="0.6"/> # there may not be exactly Keynesianism but # there are government interventions into the economy <pause dur="0.6"/> and there are these large-scale organizations and at least in some cases also <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="1.0"/> ideas of communication coordination of <pause dur="0.2"/> economic policy <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> in <pause dur="0.5"/> in <trunc>wi</trunc> # between these organizations <pause dur="0.5"/> and there is at least <pause dur="0.2"/> a lot of <pause dur="0.3"/> talk about full employment and how one gets back to 
full employment <pause dur="0.8"/> # so there is sort of <pause dur="0.3"/> a bit a mixed picture <pause dur="0.2"/> # the on the one hand <pause dur="0.3"/> these elements are still there <pause dur="0.5"/> on the other <trunc>eleme</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> hand <pause dur="0.5"/> we can also say that <kinesic desc="indicates point on board" iterated="n"/> # many of these things have changed we <pause dur="0.2"/> haven't had full employment for <pause dur="0.5"/> # more than fifteen or twenty years depending on the country <pause dur="0.6"/> now <pause dur="0.4"/> governments may keep talking about it but <pause dur="0.2"/> we may have doubts about their commitment to it really <pause dur="0.8"/> # coordination between the economic policy actors <pause dur="0.4"/> has in has in many instances broken down it has been difficult to re-establish it <pause dur="0.5"/> various countries one talks about the need to re-establish it but it doesn't <pause dur="0.2"/> work <pause dur="0.5"/> any longer as effectively as it once did <pause dur="0.9"/> and there <pause dur="0.3"/> is a lot of talk about small and medium-sized entreprise that innovation in the economy comes really from them and rather <pause dur="0.3"/> not from the large-scale companies <pause dur="0.4"/> so you see there <pause dur="0.2"/> this kind of mixed picture <pause dur="0.2"/> which # <pause dur="0.4"/> really has <pause dur="0.4"/> has these elements still but also has lots of complications <pause dur="0.8"/> now # <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="1.0"/> i will try it from 
that basis then <pause dur="0.4"/> try to say something about <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="1.1"/> rather analytical possibilities as we can try to describe <pause dur="0.5"/> what the current situation is i mean if we try to <pause dur="1.3"/> go beyond at least # <pause dur="0.3"/> one or two steps beyond just saying <pause dur="0.4"/> well we have it but we also have new elements <pause dur="0.4"/> # try to # <pause dur="0.2"/> to analytically describe what the <pause dur="0.4"/> the possibilities of sociological analysis of the economy <pause dur="0.3"/> # are nowadays <pause dur="1.5"/> and in that context i will then refer to the various <pause dur="0.5"/> # texts which are in the course outline and <pause dur="0.3"/> well <pause dur="0.4"/> the particular one you <pause dur="0.2"/> you read for <pause dur="0.8"/> the seminar later on <pause dur="1.7"/> now you will have seen in the reading for today <pause dur="0.4"/> that # some people argue <pause dur="0.3"/> that standardized mass production is really <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> or went through # a major crisis of that <pause dur="0.4"/> # there was a massive decline if not a collapse of the <pause dur="0.4"/> model of standardized mass production <pause dur="0.7"/> the key text for that <pause dur="0.5"/> is # the one which we also listed under the additional readings <pause dur="0.4"/> the book by <pause dur="0.2"/> Charles Sable and Michael Piore <pause dur="0.6"/> # on the second industrial divide <pause dur="0.7"/> where they 
argue that indeed standardized mass production was a historical phenomenon <pause dur="0.5"/> which # slowly <pause dur="0.4"/> which is not at all related to the industrial revolution <pause dur="0.2"/> but that was really rather small-scale production <pause dur="0.7"/> but is a phenomenon of the late nineteenth century <pause dur="0.5"/> # when gradually <pause dur="0.4"/> # these longer production runs <pause dur="0.4"/> # Taylorist organization of work you know the <pause dur="0.6"/> # which i briefly mentioned earlier <pause dur="0.5"/> the <trunc>m</trunc> <pause dur="0.4"/> the minute and detailed <pause dur="0.4"/> # cutting up of the elements this <trunc>i</trunc> the the work process <pause dur="0.4"/> # to control and steer <pause dur="0.3"/> the labour power more effectively <pause dur="0.5"/> # in the factory <pause dur="0.5"/> and in the next step then the conveyor belt <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> and this # <pause dur="0.2"/> model together <pause dur="0.2"/> sort of <pause dur="0.4"/> Taylorist <pause dur="0.4"/> Taylorist scientific organization <trunc>a</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> of work as <pause dur="0.4"/> Taylor called it in the U-S at the beginning of this century <pause dur="0.7"/> and <pause dur="0.4"/> the <pause dur="0.4"/> conveyor belt driven <pause dur="0.6"/> # production of standardized good <pause dur="0.4"/> has really become known as the <pause dur="0.2"/> Fordist model of production <pause dur="1.0"/> on the basis of <pause dur="0.6"/> # works of some French economists in the <pause dur="0.7"/> # late nineteen-sixties early 
nineteen-seventies <pause dur="0.4"/> that has become known # this <kinesic desc="indicates point on board" iterated="n"/> this model here as <pause dur="0.3"/> as Fordism <pause dur="0.5"/> but as a historical model of <pause dur="0.4"/> # the organization of the capitalist economy <pause dur="0.6"/> but it's not really typical for <pause dur="0.2"/> capitalism as such <pause dur="0.5"/> but rather typical for <pause dur="1.1"/> a historical development within capitalism <pause dur="0.6"/> so that means <pause dur="0.2"/> # it may as well change and may as well <pause dur="0.4"/> sort of decay and be transformed <pause dur="0.6"/> and that then is really <pause dur="0.4"/> the argument which Piore and Sable have come up with <pause dur="0.4"/> namely that <pause dur="0.2"/> if there was one industrial divide <pause dur="0.5"/> in the nineteenth century late in the nineteenth century <pause dur="0.5"/> towards <pause dur="0.3"/> standardized mass production and towards Fordism <pause dur="0.8"/> we may now be they wrote that in the early nineteen-eighties <pause dur="0.6"/> undergoing or going through a second industrial divide <pause dur="0.7"/> away from standardized mass production <pause dur="0.4"/> towards what they called flexible specialization <pause dur="0.6"/> that's the term which you found in the in the reading <pause dur="9.9"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="8"/> flexible specialization means <pause dur="0.2"/> that <pause dur="0.3"/> due to new production technologies <pause dur="0.4"/> basically related to # <pause dur="0.3"/> electronics 
and information technology <pause dur="0.7"/> # you can indeed <pause dur="0.2"/> what you couldn't do <pause dur="0.4"/> under Taylorism and Fordism <pause dur="0.5"/> # change the production runs rather quickly <pause dur="0.6"/> # so that you <pause dur="0.2"/> were not dependent any longer on <pause dur="1.0"/> mass production of goods and mass consumption of these <pause dur="0.4"/> identical goods <pause dur="0.5"/> but that you could <pause dur="0.8"/> take the example of the car industry could change models <trunc>rath</trunc> rather quickly <pause dur="0.4"/> or take <trunc>con</trunc> consumer electronics <pause dur="0.6"/> # that you could have short production runs and then just change the computer <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> assisted <pause dur="0.2"/> design and production <pause dur="0.4"/> # and produce something else <pause dur="0.3"/> rather flexibly <pause dur="0.2"/> but you can specialize <pause dur="0.5"/> # at short notice and <pause dur="0.2"/> during <pause dur="0.4"/> over short time periods <pause dur="0.5"/> # and that indeed <pause dur="0.5"/> where <pause dur="0.6"/> Taylorists and Fordists thought thought <pause dur="0.4"/> that the # <pause dur="0.6"/> # big organization hierarchically organized centrally planned so to say within the <trunc>govern</trunc> within the company <pause dur="0.6"/> that this <pause dur="0.5"/> necessarily has to be the most efficient model of production <pause dur="0.8"/> theorists of specialization argue instead that <pause dur="0.5"/> at least and in <pause dur="0.6"/> with the help

of <trunc>id</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> identities and social life <pause dur="0.4"/> that indeed <pause dur="0.3"/> # there was a demand for a greater variety and diversity of products <pause dur="0.6"/> so that flexible specialization is also a response to this kind of social change or social and cultural change <pause dur="0.4"/> namely <pause dur="0.4"/> different demand patterns towards greater <pause dur="0.2"/> variety and diversity <pause dur="2.6"/> now Piore and Sable also argue that <pause dur="0.2"/> once you do that <pause dur="0.4"/> # once you # # try to develop a <pause dur="0.3"/> production organization <pause dur="0.3"/> # in direction of flexible specialization <pause dur="0.5"/> then you also need a different kind of of company <pause dur="0.6"/> that the large-scale centralized hierarchical company <pause dur="0.2"/> like <pause dur="0.3"/> General Motors or Ford or so <pause dur="0.7"/> is no longer the most efficient model <pause dur="0.5"/> and they looked indeed <pause dur="0.3"/> at research done # on <pause dur="0.2"/> # central Italy <pause dur="0.5"/> and on south-west Germany <pause dur="0.5"/> # where <pause dur="0.5"/> sort of highly <pause dur="0.2"/> and sort of the <pause dur="0.4"/> highly affluent regions # with # world market competitive production <pause dur="0.5"/> but rather on the basis of many small companies <pause dur="0.4"/> rather than a few big ones <pause dur="0.7"/> this has become known as the theory of industrial districts <pause dur="0.6"/> but you don't have <pause dur="0.8"/> 
if you take the <trunc>ex</trunc> Italian example <pause dur="0.3"/> but you don't have like with # Fiat in Turin <pause dur="0.6"/> # one big company which really dominates the economy of a city <pause dur="0.7"/> they have a city of a million inhabitants or more <pause dur="0.5"/> where virtually everything is dependent from the well-being of the Fiat company was <pause dur="0.2"/> it is no longer the case <pause dur="0.8"/> but when you look at central Italy <pause dur="0.4"/> # then you have <pause dur="0.6"/> no big company at all but a region which was not only at least as affluent <pause dur="0.3"/> or maybe more affluent and more <pause dur="0.2"/> prosperous than northern Italy <pause dur="0.6"/> with the more <pause dur="0.5"/> sort of industrial <pause dur="0.7"/> mass production kind of economy <pause dur="0.7"/> # but even an economy <pause dur="0.3"/> which watered the crisis of the nineteen-seventies <pause dur="0.3"/> the world recession <pause dur="0.2"/> recession in seventy-four seventy-five <pause dur="0.5"/> # and demand changes <pause dur="0.3"/> # much better at <pause dur="0.2"/> than the <pause dur="0.4"/> # standardized production economy did <pause dur="0.7"/> so Piore and Sable and other <pause dur="0.2"/> economic sociologists really concluded from that <pause dur="0.6"/> that <pause dur="0.2"/> there is <pause dur="0.4"/> a <pause dur="0.5"/> # a more efficient a <trunc>f</trunc> more flexible model of industrial organization <pause dur="0.3"/> also on the 
level of of company organization <pause dur="2.3"/> and that is # <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="7"/> as i said <pause dur="1.1"/> really a model of industrial districts <pause dur="4.0"/> nowadays also sometimes discussed as a sort of network organization <pause dur="0.4"/> # not <pause dur="0.3"/> one big company <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="3"/> but <pause dur="2.6"/> a network of smaller companies <pause dur="0.8"/> about which it is also important to say that the idea there is <pause dur="0.5"/> # not just <pause dur="0.7"/> # the idea of <pause dur="0.5"/> the innovative capacity of small and medium-sized entreprises as # <pause dur="0.4"/> to here in economics <pause dur="0.5"/> but also the idea that these companies are not really in full competition <pause dur="0.8"/> but that they so say share common resources like <pause dur="0.5"/> # certain kinds of education and training in a region # historical <pause dur="0.4"/> # backgrounds of # <trunc>produc</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> production specialisms <pause dur="0.4"/> # that they also have <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> cooperative relations rather with # <pause dur="0.3"/> local or regional Chambers of Commerce <pause dur="0.3"/> with local or regional banks to finance their arrangements <pause dur="0.7"/> so indeed there's not just a question of <trunc>t</trunc> of size <pause dur="0.4"/> it's also the idea <pause dur="0.2"/> that there is not <pause dur="0.5"/> sort of full market competition <pause dur="0.3"/> as economists 
would like to tell us <pause dur="0.5"/> but rather a kind of <pause dur="0.3"/> social economic arrangement <pause dur="0.3"/> based on <pause dur="0.4"/> a mixture of cooperation and competition <pause dur="0.5"/> # where companies also work together while they're may at the same time be compete in several respects <pause dur="2.6"/> now <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="1.6"/> this is sort of one argument <pause dur="0.2"/> and if you looked at Piore and Sable <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> The Second Industrial Divide you will have seen that that they make that argument sort of very strongly <pause dur="0.5"/> that there is a <pause dur="0.2"/> a big change <pause dur="0.3"/> from <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="1"/><kinesic desc="indicates point on board" iterated="n"/> this kind of organization <pause dur="0.5"/> to <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="1"/><kinesic desc="indicates point on board" iterated="n"/> this kind of organization <pause dur="2.5"/> now as i said earlier <pause dur="0.3"/> # we may <pause dur="0.7"/> see that something like that happens that also  maybe that we <pause dur="0.5"/> # sociologists and economists didn't pay enough attention <pause dur="0.4"/> to these other kinds of production <pause dur="0.4"/> # which # were <pause dur="0.4"/> more sort of in the shadow so to say of <pause dur="0.4"/> # the dominant mass production mentioned earlier because they existed and these industrial <trunc>ic</trunc> <pause dur="0.3"/> districts existed in the fifties and sixties <pause dur="0.5"/> they're not really new <pause dur="0.5"/> # but not much attention was 
paid to them <pause dur="1.2"/> but we may also argue <pause dur="0.6"/> standardized mass production also persists <pause dur="0.4"/> so that we cannot <pause dur="0.5"/> that Piore and Sable really overdraw their argument by saying that <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> the whole economy <pause dur="0.4"/> moves from one model <pause dur="0.3"/> standardized mass production <pause dur="0.5"/> to a different model flexible specialization <pause dur="1.1"/> any empirical study will show that that is not really true <pause dur="0.2"/> # that there there may be <pause dur="0.9"/> some change into that direction but there may as well be just a shift in attention on the part of observers # also journalistic observers <pause dur="1.1"/> now <pause dur="0.5"/> that is where i come to the <pause dur="0.2"/> diagram which is the i will not <pause dur="0.2"/> say much in detail about that <pause dur="0.5"/> because of lack of time <pause dur="0.5"/> there have then been # been some economists and sociologists <pause dur="0.4"/> # who have tried to go a step further <pause dur="0.7"/> and the <pause dur="0.2"/> main idea of this diagram is quite simple <pause dur="0.3"/> mainly to say that <pause dur="0.2"/><event desc="looks through notes" iterated="y" dur="3"/> there is not any overall shift <pause dur="0.5"/> just look at it myself <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> but we really have to <pause dur="0.4"/> recognize that what exists <pause dur="0.8"/> is <pause dur="0.5"/> something like a plurality of worlds of production <pause dur="0.3"/> as # Salais and Storper call that <pause dur="0.4"/> this is the <pause dur="0.3"/> text <pause dur="0.5"/> # which is also on the course outline <pause dur="0.5"/> # The Four

other countries <pause dur="0.4"/> so <shift feature="voice" new="laugh"/>they don't <shift feature="voice" new="normal"/>really compete on the world market <pause dur="0.7"/> by price <pause dur="0.2"/> but they compete by quality <pause dur="0.5"/> and that's a quite different kind of economic arrangement <pause dur="0.2"/> than <pause dur="0.2"/> a competition by price <pause dur="0.2"/> i'll come back to that # in a minute <pause dur="1.3"/> whereas # <pause dur="0.3"/> then the network market world <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> that they say that price plays a role but quality comes in so that's a mixed criterion <pause dur="0.7"/> according to their view <pause dur="0.4"/> one can have <pause dur="0.2"/> and as i say i will say a bit more in a minute <pause dur="0.4"/> can have long <pause dur="0.2"/> discussions one can try what they have tried to do really <pause dur="0.4"/> look at <pause dur="0.5"/> in their case the French Italian and American economy <pause dur="0.6"/> is say <pause dur="0.6"/> what the dominant fields are where these economies specialize <pause dur="0.5"/> # so then for instance you find that the American economy is rather in the two bottom <pause dur="0.3"/> segments # it's still strong on in standardized mass production <pause dur="0.3"/> but it's also strong in the innovative world <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> whereas <pause dur="0.5"/> other economies have different specializations <pause dur="1.3"/> so that you have a you have a choice really <pause dur="0.4"/> there is not one change from <pause dur="0.3"/> 
<kinesic desc="indicates point on board" iterated="n"/> this model to <kinesic desc="indicates point on board" iterated="n"/> this model <pause dur="0.5"/> but <pause dur="0.3"/> there is <pause dur="0.3"/> what they call <pause dur="1.7"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="6"/> worlds in plural <pause dur="0.5"/> of production <pause dur="3.9"/> so this is <pause dur="0.5"/> # and this is the important <unclear>to say the</unclear> <pause dur="0.4"/> important conceptual conclusion <pause dur="0.4"/> from these observations <pause dur="0.5"/> there is <pause dur="1.6"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="1"/> not <pause dur="0.4"/> a clear line to be drawn from <kinesic desc="indicates point on board" iterated="n"/> one dominant model to <kinesic desc="indicates point on board" iterated="n"/> another <pause dur="0.7"/> but we have <pause dur="0.5"/> it's more complicated but we have an alternative tool to understand these developments <pause dur="0.4"/> by <pause dur="0.6"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="1"/> looking at <pause dur="0.6"/> this diversity or plurality <pause dur="0.2"/> of production <pause dur="1.3"/> not a a simple historical change from one model to the other <pause dur="0.6"/> but <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> a more complex change <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> including # <pause dur="0.2"/> a diversity of different arrangements <pause dur="0.4"/> in the in the present <pause dur="2.4"/> now <pause dur="0.6"/> really <pause dur="0.5"/> on the <kinesic desc="indicates point on board" iterated="n"/> other two major points i'll be discussing <pause dur="0.7"/> i will basically show that <pause dur="0.3"/> # that is essentially the same <pause dur="0.3"/> # that again <pause dur="0.3"/> we have # <pause dur="1.1"/> among <pause dur="0.2"/> well social scientists sociologists and certainly among journalists <pause dur="0.4"/> often <pause dur="0.3"/> a view that things have changed in one 
direction <pause dur="0.4"/> that <pause dur="0.3"/><kinesic desc="indicates point on board" iterated="n"/> this model <pause dur="0.8"/> just didn't hold any longer <pause dur="0.2"/> so that a new model had to be developed <pause dur="1.0"/> whereas <pause dur="0.2"/> in each case one can make an argument that <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> it's not as simple as <unclear>that</unclear> <pause dur="0.4"/> # basic conditions have changed but that means <pause dur="0.3"/> that we are in a situation where <pause dur="0.3"/> as i say <pause dur="0.2"/> new models or indeed <pause dur="0.4"/> models based on some diversity of conditions <pause dur="0.3"/> are still in need of development <pause dur="1.3"/> if we do that here <pause dur="0.3"/> for # <pause dur="0.8"/> # the economic policy mechanism <pause dur="0.9"/> then it is quite clear <pause dur="0.3"/> that <pause dur="0.5"/> as many people have it <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> the argument is that Keynesianism and corporatism <pause dur="0.4"/> don't work any longer because of globalization <pause dur="0.8"/> that indeed both rely on <pause dur="0.4"/> a nationally organized economy <pause dur="0.2"/> a nationally contained economy <pause dur="0.9"/> Keynesanism does it <pause dur="0.3"/> because you have a government role <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> the government determination of # <pause dur="0.5"/> expenditure and and thus <pause dur="0.3"/> sort of the level of economic <trunc>aki</trunc> activity the steering of that level <pause dur="0.5"/> on the basis of <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> of government spending <pause dur="1.1"/> where that only works is if the government can really 
control the economy <pause dur="0.7"/> these are things which really happened <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> for instance in <pause dur="0.4"/> France in the early nineteen-eighties <pause dur="0.5"/> # when <pause dur="0.2"/> the <pause dur="0.7"/> well that was the first time that France had a socialist government <pause dur="0.5"/> in the post-World War <pause dur="0.3"/> Two period <pause dur="0.6"/> and that government <pause dur="0.2"/> # the first government under <pause dur="0.2"/> President Mitterand <pause dur="0.6"/> had a commitment to Keynesianism <pause dur="0.5"/> and there was high unemployment <pause dur="0.3"/> so well what they wanted to do <pause dur="0.2"/> according to old Keynesian recipes <pause dur="0.5"/> they wanted to increase government spending <pause dur="0.2"/> to <pause dur="0.4"/> push the economy <pause dur="0.3"/> to higher employment levels <pause dur="0.4"/> well they did that they spent a lot of money <pause dur="0.8"/> and # the economy went upwards <pause dur="0.2"/> to some extent <pause dur="0.8"/> but as it happened at that point of time the French economy was already <pause dur="0.4"/> # tightly linked to other European economies and <pause dur="0.6"/> globally linked to <pause dur="0.2"/> other economies across the world <pause dur="0.7"/> so the fact that the French government pumped money into <pause dur="0.3"/> the economy <pause dur="0.5"/> meant that many French consumers but also producers companies <pause dur="0.4"/> bought products abroad imported

again <pause dur="0.4"/> if you come to the conviction that <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> indeed <pause dur="0.2"/> <trunc>i</trunc> if you try to do that <pause dur="0.3"/> you may just # arrive at conclusions # which the economy cannot sustain <pause dur="0.4"/> # because it competes on the global level <pause dur="0.8"/> then what will happen is that <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="1.0"/> people will defect from these national organizations you have that that <pause dur="0.6"/> employers indeed say <pause dur="0.4"/> # said sort of in the nineteen-seventies <pause dur="0.6"/> well if you're going to <pause dur="0.2"/> agree sort of the national organization on that level of wages <pause dur="0.5"/> then i just # exit from the organization <pause dur="0.4"/> # i cannot pay those wages so # <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> the <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> # i will pay different wages so the the model of bargaining breaks down <pause dur="0.7"/> the same actually also <pause dur="0.2"/> not to put the blame one-sidedly on the employers <pause dur="0.4"/> also for workers sort of with the <pause dur="0.6"/> # not least sort of <trunc>s</trunc> the so-called knowledge based upper middle classes <pause dur="0.4"/> # were <pause dur="0.2"/> # increasingly then <pause dur="0.2"/> also employees <pause dur="0.4"/> # hoped to get a better bargain by individually negotiating with their employers rather than agreeing to wage conventions <pause dur="0.6"/> # then the model also

have just opened to <pause dur="0.4"/> # the world market <pause dur="0.8"/> # we can still see on the one hand <pause dur="0.6"/> that there is what <pause dur="0.3"/> David Soskice calls varieties of capitalism <pause dur="0.6"/> this is the paper which we also mention on the course outline <pause dur="0.5"/> which is # unpublished # but is in the <pause dur="0.3"/> the copy of it or several copies are in the <pause dur="0.3"/> S-R-C collections <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> where he argues that <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> indeed <pause dur="0.3"/> # there are <pause dur="0.4"/> different ways of coordinating economies <pause dur="0.5"/> and <pause dur="0.5"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> they indeed persist # the level of coordination does not go away <pause dur="0.6"/> # that may <pause dur="0.2"/> change that may adapt to new conditions <pause dur="0.4"/> # but there are sort of traditions of institutional arrangements <pause dur="0.4"/> which indeed <pause dur="0.2"/> are quite persistent of those changes <pause dur="1.0"/> he makes there a major distinction between what he calls <pause dur="0.3"/> coordinated market economies and <pause dur="0.4"/> uncoordinated market economies <pause dur="0.8"/> # the uncoordinated ones or rather <pause dur="0.4"/> the <pause dur="0.2"/> British and the American one <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> that is why the term corporatism is less well known in this country <pause dur="0.4"/> because there is a much lower degree of coordination <pause dur="0.5"/> than for instance in <pause dur="0.5"/> # 
Germany or Japan <pause dur="0.3"/> these are his counter-examples his examples for <pause dur="0.4"/> coordinated economies <pause dur="0.9"/> now this was written before the Japanese crisis <pause dur="0.4"/> but # <pause dur="0.3"/> <trunc>i</trunc> it still holds <pause dur="0.3"/> that <pause dur="0.5"/> the the argument namely that <pause dur="0.3"/> there are <pause dur="0.2"/> sort of quite entrenched <pause dur="0.3"/> institutional arrangements <pause dur="0.4"/> which don't just disappear because of deregulation and neoliberalism <pause dur="0.4"/> # but which adapt to new situations <pause dur="0.9"/> the <pause dur="0.2"/> point there is that these are indeed complex institutional arrangements <pause dur="0.4"/> where <pause dur="0.3"/> # the organization of <pause dur="0.3"/> # training and education is involved <pause dur="0.3"/> as you may know <pause dur="0.5"/> that there is # <pause dur="0.2"/> a much more organized <pause dur="0.2"/> professional training system <pause dur="0.5"/> # a company based one or a or a mixed system between <pause dur="0.6"/> a dual system between companies and public institutions in Germany <pause dur="0.5"/> where apprentices are <pause dur="0.2"/> are trained <pause dur="0.4"/> a much more formalized system than in this country <pause dur="0.8"/> there is # a relation between companies and banks <pause dur="0.4"/> which is much tighter <pause dur="0.3"/> in both Germany and Japan <pause dur="0.6"/> # where <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> there is the higher degree of coordination Soskice talks about <pause dur="0.6"/> 
where banks don't just let <pause dur="0.4"/> companies drop because they <pause dur="0.2"/> the profits decline or <pause dur="0.2"/> <trunc>b</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> because they go into deficit <pause dur="0.4"/> but they try to organize restructurings <pause dur="0.5"/> # so really coordination between banks and <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> and companies and producers <pause dur="0.9"/> thirdly there is in some cases <pause dur="0.4"/> # coordinated <pause dur="0.2"/> work <pause dur="0.3"/> across <pause dur="0.3"/> # companies in the same sector <pause dur="0.9"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> that is <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> are things which are now <pause dur="0.3"/> sort of discussed under the level of sort of competition policy <pause dur="0.6"/> where it's often argued that competition needs to be increased that the German or Japanese economy <pause dur="0.4"/> don't really know the necessary <pause dur="0.2"/> levels of competition <pause dur="0.8"/> but it can also be taken to be an advantage of coordination <pause dur="1.1"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> as Soskice argues <pause dur="0.7"/> and finally there may be a kind of <pause dur="0.4"/> company organization that's more the Japanese model <pause dur="0.5"/> where you have large-scale <trunc>con</trunc> conglomerates <pause dur="0.3"/> which don't <pause dur="0.6"/> # dominate one sector <pause dur="0.2"/> but # <pause dur="0.6"/> # operate in various sectors so that they sustain themselves <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> through <pause dur="0.5"/> boom and bust because they never occul in all occur in all sectors at the 
same time <pause dur="1.6"/> to <pause dur="0.4"/> say that briefly <pause dur="0.4"/> the argument here is <pause dur="0.3"/> there is not just <pause dur="0.5"/> global <trunc>neoriler</trunc> neoliberalism <pause dur="0.2"/> but there are <pause dur="0.3"/> varieties of capitalism <pause dur="0.2"/> that's indeed the title of his paper <pause dur="11.5"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="9"/> and you recognize the same structure of argument <pause dur="0.3"/> is not a change to one new model <pause dur="0.4"/> but there is <pause dur="0.4"/> a transformation towards <pause dur="0.4"/> # a more complex institutional <pause dur="0.2"/> situation overall <pause dur="3.1"/> then # <pause dur="0.5"/> finally <pause dur="0.6"/> let's say something about <pause dur="0.4"/> the economic policy objective <pause dur="0.8"/> where there was an agreement <pause dur="0.2"/> that <pause dur="0.2"/> it should be sort of growth and full employment and full employment through growth <pause dur="0.7"/> that is the <pause dur="0.4"/> the Keynesian full employment convention as some people call it <pause dur="0.7"/> # and the idea that it was reachable <pause dur="0.6"/> # that it was indeed achievable with some standard tools <pause dur="0.8"/> now as i said earlier <pause dur="0.2"/> there is an agreement that these tools don't work in the same way than they used to work <pause dur="0.9"/> but if we conclude from what i said earlier <pause dur="0.5"/> there's also probably not necessarily <pause dur="0.2"/> the idea that one has to abandon that entirely <pause dur="1.3"/> now 
some people argue that and # <pause dur="0.4"/> that's again one of those fashionable terms of the time <pause dur="0.5"/> where some people say we have to <pause dur="0.2"/> get away from any such commitment of full employment <pause dur="0.5"/> what we have to do is to change the <pause dur="0.3"/> supply situation on the labour market <pause dur="0.3"/> people have to be flexible <pause dur="0.5"/> we have to deregulate the labour market <pause dur="0.4"/> we have to <pause dur="0.4"/> allow hiring <pause dur="0.2"/> hiring and firing on more easy conditions we have to allow <pause dur="0.5"/> variety of work situations <pause dur="0.4"/> # sort of temporary contracts part-time contracts <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> temping in general <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> no minimum wage <pause dur="0.5"/> all that only <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> hampers the development of the economy and the creation of jobs <pause dur="0.4"/> # what one has to have is a maximum flexibility <pause dur="0.6"/> that's the one idea <pause dur="7.0"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="5"/> now <pause dur="0.3"/> this idea obviously goes along well with an idea of global <trunc>neol</trunc> neoliberalism <pause dur="0.2"/> that you should have markets and competition wherever you can get them <pause dur="1.2"/> what it does not do though <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> is it does not have a link between economic policy and social policy any longer <pause dur="0.4"/> in the same way <pause dur="0.4"/> in which the full 
employment convention had it <pause dur="1.2"/> there <pause dur="0.3"/> this <pause dur="0.2"/> full employment convention really meant <pause dur="0.3"/> that within a society within a nation <pause dur="0.5"/> there was an understanding that <pause dur="0.4"/> there is something like a common responsibility <pause dur="0.6"/> to get <pause dur="0.5"/> everybody employed <pause dur="0.4"/> and those who temporarily could not be employed <pause dur="0.4"/> # should get unemployment benefits on such a level that # <pause dur="0.2"/> they could lead a decent life <pause dur="1.1"/> # that is what i call a linkage between economic policy and social policy <pause dur="0.8"/> so that there is well the government could even say a societal commitment and consensus along that <pause dur="1.2"/> what the idea of flexibility means really is giving that idea up <pause dur="0.3"/> it basically shifts responsibility from the society to the individual <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> the overall conditions are changed in such a way that <pause dur="0.5"/> there are really almost no impediments or barriers to get a job <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> no union involvement <pause dur="0.2"/> no restrictions <pause dur="0.3"/> nothing like that <pause dur="0.6"/> but that that also means that <pause dur="0.5"/> everybody should see how <pause dur="0.2"/> he or she could <pause dur="0.4"/> sell <pause dur="0.5"/> her or his labour power <pause dur="0.4"/> # 
under whatever conditions are possible <pause dur="0.9"/> now the <pause dur="0.4"/> here there is not really <pause dur="0.2"/> a new <pause dur="0.9"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="1"/> model <pause dur="0.6"/> but it is also clear that at least in European societies <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> the flexibility regime is not just accepted <pause dur="0.8"/> i mean there are some people who talk about <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.9"/> offensive <pause dur="0.2"/> flexibility or constructive flexibility <pause dur="0.4"/> where they see a role for the unions <trunc>n</trunc> new role for the unions a new role for the regions <pause dur="0.4"/> # to develop the regime <pause dur="0.3"/> which # <pause dur="0.3"/> keeps up this linkage of <pause dur="0.4"/> as i will call it <pause dur="0.4"/> of economic and social policy <pause dur="1.9"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="1"/> i put that into <pause dur="0.2"/> brackets because there isn't really yet a model <pause dur="2.9"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="13"/> but the idea is that some such linkage needs to be maintained <pause dur="9.0"/> and that there is indeed no reason to assume <pause dur="0.5"/> it may have become more difficult than it was in the nineteen-sixties <pause dur="0.5"/> when <pause dur="0.2"/> this could be organized around a national society <pause dur="0.6"/> the national government committed to that <pause dur="0.5"/> that may no longer be possible <pause dur="0.8"/> however <pause dur="0.5"/> # this does not entail that there are no <pause dur="0.3"/> means and 
resources and actors <pause dur="0.4"/> to try to develop such a new model <pause dur="0.5"/> there are unions there are <pause dur="0.3"/> regional or <pause dur="0.2"/> city governments who could <pause dur="0.3"/> have a stronger role <pause dur="0.6"/> again partly because historically they had a role <pause dur="0.6"/> there is now not least # a stronger role of the European Union <pause dur="0.5"/> so if Keynesianism doesn't work any longer on the national level <pause dur="0.2"/> maybe it still works on the European level <pause dur="0.6"/> because Europe is less overall less import dependent <pause dur="0.3"/> than each individual member state of the European Union <pause dur="0.8"/> so there are discussions around <pause dur="0.5"/> how to design really this <pause dur="0.4"/><kinesic desc="indicates point on board" iterated="n"/> this model <pause dur="0.6"/> which are open sort of which are <pause dur="0.5"/> open-ended there is no solution for it yet <pause dur="0.2"/> but <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> there is also the view <pause dur="0.2"/> that <pause dur="0.3"/> there is no need to <pause dur="0.2"/> embark fully on a model of flexibility <pause dur="3.2"/> to conclude <pause dur="0.5"/> # what you have seen and the way in which i <pause dur="0.2"/> introduced <kinesic desc="indicates point on board" iterated="n"/> this model at the very beginning <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> and that is one of the important questions here <pause dur="0.2"/> in <kinesic desc="indicates point on board" iterated="n"/> this model there is a linkage between <pause dur="0.4"/> organization of production <pause dur="0.3"/> economic policy mechanism <pause dur="0.5"/> and economic 
policy objective <pause dur="0.4"/> one follows from the other <pause dur="0.7"/> if you have standardized mass production you have standardized work situations <pause dur="0.4"/> you have # <pause dur="0.6"/> a likelihood of the common workers' consciousness and <pause dur="0.2"/> trade union development <pause dur="0.7"/> # who can operate in large-scale organizations who can get organized and <pause dur="0.4"/> <trunc>o</trunc> are organizable because they <pause dur="0.2"/> are in these large-scale organizations <pause dur="0.7"/> you have <pause dur="0.4"/> # a national government <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> or in a national level <pause dur="0.3"/> towards they relate <pause dur="0.2"/> both the unions and the employers <pause dur="0.8"/> and <pause dur="0.3"/> thus you can construct <pause dur="0.4"/> sort of a socially responsible community <pause dur="0.3"/> # to arrive at <pause dur="1.1"/> a linkage of economic and social policy <pause dur="0.6"/> so this <pause dur="0.4"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="2"/> this works the one relates to the other <pause dur="0.2"/> or rather it worked <pause dur="0.5"/> it was the model of the fifties and sixties <pause dur="0.7"/> it doesn't work any longer in the same way <pause dur="0.3"/> and one possibility here is <pause dur="0.7"/> to argue <pause dur="1.5"/> in favour of a model which combines <pause dur="0.4"/> flexible specialization and global <trunc>neoliber</trunc> neoliberalism and flexibility <pause dur="0.8"/> which does away with all the institutions and 
boundaries which there were <pause dur="0.4"/> and just hopes that <pause dur="0.8"/> by flexibilizing <pause dur="0.2"/> this you can <pause dur="0.5"/> create a new kind of viable <pause dur="0.2"/> economic regime <pause dur="1.3"/> now as i've tried to say briefly there are reasons <pause dur="0.4"/> to assume that that <pause dur="0.3"/> while it is a coherent model <pause dur="0.6"/> but that it just wouldn't <pause dur="0.7"/> # be socially viable <pause dur="0.2"/> that it would <pause dur="0.5"/> # create # high inequalities <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> of a level in kind which one tried to abolish over much of the <pause dur="0.6"/> social and economic <pause dur="0.2"/> policy developments of the <pause dur="0.4"/> earlier Second World War period <pause dur="0.7"/> so that is why one has to search for <pause dur="0.6"/> a model to relate the variety of worlds of production <pause dur="0.7"/> in the different <pause dur="0.7"/> sort of historically developed settings which have varieties of coordination between economies varieties 
of capitalism <pause dur="0.9"/> to develop that into a new linkage of economic and social policy <pause dur="0.8"/> but this is obviously <pause dur="0.7"/> less clear-cut <pause dur="0.2"/> # we can less take it for granted <pause dur="0.4"/> than the old model <pause dur="0.3"/> the old model was quite stable <pause dur="0.4"/> it was <pause dur="0.3"/> conventionalized indeed it developed over a <pause dur="0.5"/> a long time sort of from the eighteen-eighties eighteen-nineties to the nineteen-sixties <pause dur="0.3"/> and through many struggles obviously workers' struggles not least <pause dur="0.9"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> we don't have that now there is not such a stability <pause dur="0.4"/> there are not these conventions which <pause dur="0.6"/> hold each other <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> but there <pause dur="0.2"/> that does not mean that <pause dur="0.2"/> they couldn't be developed in principle <pause dur="0.8"/> and that is what many <pause dur="0.2"/> sort of <pause dur="0.5"/> social and economic actors are really working on <pause dur="0.6"/> at this point <pause dur="2.1"/> okay <pause dur="0.3"/> thank you
