i in <pause dur="0.6"/> i <trunc>s</trunc> <pause dur="0.4"/> think i saw much point <pause dur="0.2"/> intuitively <pause dur="0.2"/> when Krashen says that consciousness # conscious <pause dur="0.2"/> <trunc>lear</trunc> conscious learning doesn't lead to acquisition or language use <pause dur="0.6"/> i saw much point <pause dur="0.3"/> and what i wanted to do was that <pause dur="0.2"/> to just see <pause dur="0.2"/> i mean to to rationalize <pause dur="0.2"/> his argument <pause dur="0.9"/> i mean <pause dur="0.3"/> just saying that well look i mean this this must be the truth <trunc>b</trunc> because we intuitively knows <pause dur="0.7"/> this is a truth is doesn't convince other people <pause dur="0.4"/> so <pause dur="0.4"/> # by <pause dur="0.3"/> # introducing Wittgenstein's philosophy of rule forming i tried to reconstruct # Krashen's Monitor Hypothesis <pause dur="0.5"/> but the paper is was <shift feature="voice" new="laugh"/>written <shift feature="voice" new="normal"/>in Japanese and i mean the most papers if i mean <pause dur="0.2"/> in these <kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> days i used to write in English but i mean <pause dur="0.3"/> as i began philosophy i began to write in Japanese which is my native language <pause dur="0.5"/> or <pause dur="0.3"/><kinesic desc="reveals covered part of transparency" iterated="n"/> i did <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="2.4"/> i thought about # grammar teaching <pause dur="0.2"/> because after all <pause dur="0.2"/> i mean <pause dur="0.2"/> if you think simply <pause dur="0.2"/> if you <pause dur="0.2"/> teach rules <pause dur="0.4"/> and teach vocabulary <pause dur="0.2"/> students should produce a language i mean <trunc>s</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> students should be able to use the language <pause dur="0.4"/> but <pause dur="0.2"/> as we all <trunc>a</trunc> as we know this is 
not the case <pause dur="0.3"/> usually <pause dur="0.3"/> and i began to see <pause dur="0.2"/> why and i began to reconstruct again <pause dur="0.6"/> # why this that is so <pause dur="1.6"/><kinesic desc="reveals covered part of transparency" iterated="n"/> or <pause dur="0.5"/> i mean the more i hear <pause dur="0.4"/> about the <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="1.1"/> learner's experience in Japan or on the outside Japan <pause dur="0.6"/> well almost <pause dur="0.3"/> all <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> almost all <pause dur="0.4"/> learners say that imitation <pause dur="0.2"/> played a major role in their <pause dur="0.2"/> learning experience <pause dur="0.5"/> but <pause dur="0.2"/> what we often see in the <pause dur="0.8"/> textbook for # language # acquisition is that no <pause dur="0.2"/> i mean <pause dur="0.2"/> <trunc>w</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> imitation doesn't work <pause dur="0.9"/> # one famous example is that nobody doesn't like me <pause dur="0.4"/> and the correction comes nobody likes me ten times and <shift feature="voice" new="laugh"/>then <pause dur="0.6"/><shift feature="voice" new="normal"/> # you produce i mean <pause dur="0.2"/> # a learner produce the same result <pause dur="0.4"/> and obviously <trunc>y</trunc> we have Chomsky which is <pause dur="0.8"/> critical so critical about the imitation <pause dur="0.6"/> and but i mean it is like the throwing a baby with the hot <pause dur="0.2"/> i mean with the water <pause dur="0.2"/> so i began to <pause dur="0.3"/> # see some point <pause dur="0.5"/> in the imitation <pause dur="0.2"/> by Heidegger's epistemology <pause dur="1.6"/><kinesic desc="reveals covered part of transparency" iterated="n"/> or recently <pause dur="0.3"/> # i am involved in the <pause dur="0.2"/> # sort of the informal seminar called <unclear>passagen</unclear> seminar in Japan <pause dur="0.3"/> this is <pause dur="0.3"/> an informal # informal # association in Japan <pause dur="0.9"/> # teachers just gather <pause dur="0.5"/> 
because the <trunc>mo</trunc> their motivation is that they are not particularly happy <pause dur="0.9"/> with the academic <trunc>preten</trunc> presentations in their <unclear>academic</unclear><pause dur="0.2"/> conferences <pause dur="0.4"/> nor <pause dur="0.3"/> they are particularly happy with the say # the the seminars <pause dur="0.5"/> are sponsored by the Ministry of Education <pause dur="0.2"/> because <shift feature="voice" new="laugh"/>everything is <pause dur="0.4"/> <shift feature="voice" new="normal"/>can be very formal in there so i mean they just want # <pause dur="0.3"/> informal exchange of views <pause dur="0.9"/> and every time i attend there <pause dur="0.2"/> i see <pause dur="0.2"/> i mean <pause dur="0.2"/> i see <pause dur="0.4"/> a lot of wisdom <pause dur="0.7"/> produced by the experienced teachers <pause dur="0.2"/> they are not they may not be theoretical <pause dur="0.4"/> particularly <pause dur="0.3"/> but they <pause dur="0.2"/> i see much point when they <trunc>someth</trunc> they say something <pause dur="0.3"/> and # <pause dur="0.6"/> i began to see <pause dur="0.3"/> i <pause dur="0.2"/> i began to think that <pause dur="0.2"/> the my role <pause dur="0.2"/> as a <pause dur="0.2"/> sort of researcher <pause dur="0.3"/> is that to try to <pause dur="0.2"/> see <pause dur="0.6"/> # try to give theoretical framework <pause dur="0.2"/> to them <pause dur="0.5"/> and then we can cooperate <pause dur="0.5"/> as <pause dur="0.6"/> i mean together <pause dur="0.2"/> to for i mean <pause dur="0.7"/> to improve our <pause dur="0.2"/> our English education <pause dur="0.8"/><kinesic desc="reveals covered part of transparency" iterated="n"/> and also i am recently involved with a joint work called re-engineering <shift feature="voice" new="laugh"/>and this is the <shift feature="voice" new="normal"/><pause dur="0.3"/> another work i mean if you read comics of Dilbert or something like 
that <shift feature="voice" new="laugh"/>i mean <pause dur="0.2"/> you should know <vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" n="sl" dur="1"/> these sort of thing this is # sort of the <pause dur="0.3"/> well new <pause dur="0.2"/> i mean <pause dur="0.2"/> catchy word but <pause dur="0.2"/> i mean what i mean is that the <pause dur="0.9"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> my point here is that if you try to be too scientific <pause dur="0.5"/> then <pause dur="0.8"/> you will get lost <pause dur="0.7"/> and for some people <pause dur="0.2"/> it is i mean <pause dur="0.3"/> i mean it is sometimes so hard to convince <pause dur="0.3"/> scientific oriented people <vocal desc="laugh" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.4"/> to sort of to convert their beliefs about that so i see my role as a sort of the <pause dur="1.1"/> # say <pause dur="1.1"/> # directing ourselves <pause dur="0.6"/> this is again too ambitious but again <vocal desc="laugh" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.4"/> since i am young and stupid <pause dur="0.2"/> so <vocal desc="laugh" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.2"/> maybe i have that # privilege <pause dur="0.5"/><kinesic desc="reveals covered part of transparency" iterated="n"/> so # <pause dur="0.8"/> # so what i am doing # my argument is <pause dur="0.4"/> mainly # normative by which i mean <pause dur="0.3"/> philosophical or theoretical <pause dur="0.3"/> and methodological <pause dur="0.7"/> so <pause dur="0.2"/> # <kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> here i have # <kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> this is the # home page that i have but unfortunately <pause dur="0.2"/><kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> well <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> everything is done in i mean it's written in Japanese <pause dur="0.6"/> and # <pause dur="0.2"/> one thing # <pause dur="1.0"/> one <pause dur="0.2"/> # thing that i <pause dur="0.6"/> say to myself these days is that i mean now that i have <pause dur="0.2"/> yes this privilege of staying in a
