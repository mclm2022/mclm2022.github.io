seem to assume that there's <pause dur="0.2"/> someone <pause dur="0.2"/> or some group of people <pause dur="0.9"/> <trunc>h</trunc> who have the responsibility deciding which words are good enough <pause dur="0.3"/> to go in the dictionary <pause dur="0.3"/> and which words <pause dur="0.2"/> are not <pause dur="0.9"/> # <pause dur="1.2"/> well that's that's a completely wrong idea <pause dur="0.2"/> really isn't it you've only got to go <pause dur="0.2"/> to a bookshop <pause dur="0.4"/> to see <pause dur="0.4"/> that there's many more than <pause dur="0.2"/> one dictionary <pause dur="0.6"/> there isn't really any such thing as <pause dur="0.2"/> the <pause dur="0.2"/> dictionary <pause dur="0.7"/> is there <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.8"/> if you go along to the bookshop here for instance <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="5.4"/> <event desc="turns on overhead projector, bulb blows" iterated="n"/> huh </u><pause dur="0.7"/> <u who="sm1272" trans="pause"> <unclear>look at</unclear> the screen <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/></u><pause dur="0.3"/> <u who="sf1273" trans="pause"> now </u><pause dur="0.2"/> <u who="nf1271" trans="pause"> oh yes suddenly the screen and the bulb's gone </u><gap reason="break in recording" extent="uncertain"/> <u who="nf1271" trans="pause"> <kinesic desc="overhead projector is on showing transparency" iterated="n"/> # this is just a a very <pause dur="0.4"/> rough <pause dur="0.7"/> summary of the kind of dictionaries that we have <pause dur="0.4"/> in English <pause dur="0.5"/> we have the <pause dur="0.5"/> the Oxford English Dictionary <pause dur="0.4"/> and that's the largest dictionary <pause dur="0.5"/> in <trunc>en</trunc> in the English language <pause dur="0.3"/> it's in twenty volumes <pause dur="0.2"/> with supplements <pause dur="0.5"/> # you'd think that that's what people would be referring to 
when they say is it in the dictionary <pause dur="0.2"/> but of course they're not <pause dur="0.6"/> # very few people possess a copy of the Oxford English Dictionary <pause dur="0.2"/> it's really only for linguists and people who <pause dur="0.4"/> are <pause dur="1.0"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> work <pause dur="0.4"/> people who work <pause dur="0.4"/> with the English language in some way <pause dur="0.8"/> # <trunc>y</trunc> <trunc>y</trunc> you can get it on C-D-ROM <pause dur="0.2"/> which is much easier but if you <pause dur="0.2"/> all twenty volumes take up a lot of <trunc>spa</trunc> # shelf space and they're very expensive <pause dur="0.5"/> so that's not usually the dictionary that people refer to when they when they play <shift feature="voice" new="laugh"/>Scrabble for instance <shift feature="voice" new="normal"/><pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> then we've got the Shorter Oxford Dictionary the New Oxford Dictionary of English <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="1.5"/> those are <pause dur="0.9"/> pretty big <pause dur="0.2"/> dictionaries i've got a C-D-ROM version of the New Oxford Dictionary in English here <pause dur="0.4"/> three-hundred-and-fifty-thousand words <pause dur="0.5"/><kinesic desc="holds up disk" iterated="n"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> by the way we have names for these we call # <pause dur="0.6"/> we call the Shorter Oxford Dictionary SOD <pause dur="0.7"/><vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" n="ss" dur="1"/> and the New Oxford Dictionary of English NODDY <pause dur="0.2"/><vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" n="sl" dur="1"/> that's your if you write about 
dictionaries you use these # acronyms but # <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> then we've got dictionaries for learners of English <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="0.9"/> you'll be familiar with some of these Oxford Advanced Learners' Dictionary Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English Cambridge <sic corr="International">internitinational</sic> Dictionary of English Cobuild <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="1.9"/> i see people coming into the bookshop and not knowing which dictionary to buy <pause dur="0.4"/> because in fact the titles don't really tell you do they they <pause dur="0.5"/> those <pause dur="0.3"/> those four <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> that are listed there <pause dur="0.7"/> are <pause dur="0.7"/> not for native they're not intended for native speakers of English they're <trunc>in</trunc> intended for learners <pause dur="0.2"/> but there's nothing in the title to tell you that <pause dur="0.4"/> and so i see people who are not native speakers of English <pause dur="0.2"/> hovering around in the bookshop <pause dur="0.2"/> not knowing <pause dur="0.3"/> which dictionary to choose because <pause dur="0.4"/> there's no real indication on the cover <pause dur="0.7"/> who is <pause dur="0.7"/> who is it who they're intended for <pause dur="0.5"/> and then of course we've got <pause dur="0.3"/> hundreds of thousands of other kinds of dictionaries we've got <pause dur="0.2"/> shorter versions of those <kinesic desc="indicates point on board" iterated="n"/> 
dictionaries for learners <pause dur="0.2"/> shorter versions of <kinesic desc="indicates point on board" iterated="n"/> the big dictionaries at the top <pause dur="0.5"/> and then we've got dictionaries for children and picture dictionaries and school dictionaries and visual dictionaries <pause dur="0.4"/> study dictionaries <pause dur="0.3"/> and something <pause dur="0.5"/><kinesic desc="indicates point on board" iterated="n"/> right at the bottom of the transparency <pause dur="2.4"/><vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" n="ss" dur="1"/> # <vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" n="sl" dur="1"/> <pause dur="0.5"/> right at the bottom of the transparency # <pause dur="0.4"/> we've got something that we call they're called dictionaries you might have seen them you may have <pause dur="0.3"/> a dictionary like this <pause dur="0.3"/> dictionary of <pause dur="0.2"/> engineering terms <pause dur="0.3"/> something like that <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> they're called dictionaries but really they're not <pause dur="0.3"/> dictionaries <pause dur="0.2"/> they're more like encyclopedias because a dictionary is concerned with <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.8"/> the way <pause dur="1.7"/> the word is used in the language a dictionary is concerned with <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> <trunc>l</trunc> <pause dur="0.3"/> linguistic aspects of the word like its pronunciation its grammar which words it goes with <pause dur="0.6"/> and <pause dur="0.6"/><kinesic desc="indicates point on board" iterated="n"/> these dictionaries of <pause dur="0.3"/> medicine and engineering and computing computer 
science applied linguistics <pause dur="0.3"/> they don't tell you anything about the behaviour <pause dur="0.2"/> of that word <pause dur="0.2"/> or how it's pronounced or <pause dur="0.4"/> what the grammar is <pause dur="0.2"/> they just tell you about <pause dur="0.2"/> the concepts <pause dur="0.4"/> that the words expresses <pause dur="0.2"/> so they're really much more like <pause dur="0.4"/> encyclopedias or little textbooks they're not strictly speaking <pause dur="0.4"/> dictionaries <pause dur="1.2"/> so <pause dur="0.2"/><kinesic desc="indicates point on board" iterated="n"/> that alone should show you should prove to you that <pause dur="0.3"/> the radio interviewer had completely the wrong idea <pause dur="0.6"/> # there isn't a single <pause dur="0.3"/> dictionary <pause dur="0.7"/> there isn't we can't say is it in <pause dur="0.3"/> the <pause dur="0.3"/> dictionary <pause dur="0.5"/> there is no such thing as <pause dur="0.4"/> the <pause dur="0.2"/> dictionary <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> you know i often hear it said people say is <pause dur="0.4"/> oh look in the dictionary i say which dictionary <pause dur="0.3"/> there are hundreds thousands <pause dur="0.5"/> of dictionaries to choose from and they're all different they all have different <pause dur="0.2"/> selections of words in <pause dur="0.2"/> and they all give <pause dur="0.2"/> different slightly different definitions for each of those words so there isn't a single authority on the other hand <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.8"/> the radio interviewer was right he had got sort of the right idea <pause dur="0.5"/> 
because <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> there <pause dur="1.1"/> people who <pause dur="0.2"/> compile dictionaries <pause dur="0.2"/> do have to select <pause dur="0.9"/> there are <pause dur="0.2"/> there really is a group of people <pause dur="0.3"/> who select <pause dur="0.3"/> which words <pause dur="0.2"/> go into each dictionary <pause dur="0.4"/> and which words <pause dur="0.2"/> don't go in <pause dur="1.8"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> and the reason <pause dur="0.5"/> for this is that there are actually <pause dur="0.3"/> far far too many words <pause dur="0.3"/> in English <pause dur="0.3"/> to put into <pause dur="0.3"/> any dictionary <pause dur="0.2"/> even a really big one <pause dur="0.8"/> so <pause dur="0.4"/> they've got to make a selection they've got to decide <pause dur="0.2"/> which words go in <pause dur="0.3"/> and which words stay out <pause dur="1.1"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> i think it was last year i was looking on an Internet mailing list <pause dur="0.4"/> # you know they have these <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> chats <pause dur="0.6"/> and somebody had written in and said i i'm having an argument with my German girlfriend <pause dur="0.6"/> think he was American <pause dur="0.2"/> he said <pause dur="0.4"/> # i say there are more words in the English language <pause dur="0.2"/> and my girlfriend says there are more words in the German language <pause dur="0.3"/> which of us is right <pause dur="0.6"/> right <vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" n="sl" dur="1"/> well it's impossible question really isn't it but <pause dur="0.3"/> # somebody else wrote in to the mailing list and said <pause dur="0.3"/> i know how you can solve that problem <pause dur="0.4"/> just get an English
