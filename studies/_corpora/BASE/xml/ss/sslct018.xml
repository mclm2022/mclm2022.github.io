<u who="nm1160"> good afternoon ladies and gentlemen perhaps we could make a start <pause dur="3.8"/> thank you very much # <pause dur="1.3"/> a couple of quick announcements <pause dur="0.5"/> before we start # <pause dur="0.6"/> would the <pause dur="0.2"/> group of students who are due to meet <pause dur="0.7"/> <gap reason="name" extent="2 words"/> that's not the one that's already <pause dur="0.4"/> had the first class but the other group <pause dur="0.6"/> he's asked me if you could meet him at three o'clock on Friday <pause dur="0.5"/> this week <pause dur="0.5"/> in room two-five-seven <pause dur="1.2"/> so if you could <pause dur="1.9"/> meet him in room two-five-seven at three o'clock <pause dur="0.7"/> this Friday afternoon <pause dur="2.9"/> the second is to announce that the last four lectures which are <pause dur="0.4"/> on your # sheet as to be announced <pause dur="0.5"/> will be given by # <gap reason="name" extent="2 words"/> <pause dur="0.9"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> and <pause dur="0.9"/> # she's asked me also to point out that she intends to <pause dur="0.5"/> # reinstate the human rights lecture <pause dur="0.4"/> and we're going to delete the one on <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> domestic sources of foreign policy <pause dur="2.9"/> today i'm going to <pause dur="0.3"/> turn my attention to probably one of the <pause dur="0.5"/> longest lasting theories of international <pause dur="0.5"/> relations <pause dur="1.3"/> # and that is the theory of realism <pause dur="1.2"/> in international relations <pause dur="2.5"/> for many years <pause dur="0.3"/> the <pause dur="1.1"/> key textbook on 
international politics <pause dur="0.5"/> was a book by a man called Hans J Morgenthau <pause dur="0.7"/> an American academic <pause dur="0.3"/> who wrote <pause dur="0.3"/> various editions <pause dur="0.3"/> of his <pause dur="0.7"/> major work <pause dur="0.2"/> Politics Among Nations <pause dur="1.8"/> in this book <pause dur="0.5"/> Morgenthau outlines the theory of realism as it applies <pause dur="0.4"/> to international politics <pause dur="0.7"/> and he begins with a very <pause dur="0.2"/> famous <pause dur="0.6"/> # sentence in his book <pause dur="0.6"/> <reading>international politics</reading> he says <pause dur="0.4"/> <reading>like all politics <pause dur="0.3"/> is the struggle for power</reading> <pause dur="2.3"/> he then <pause dur="0.2"/> proceeds to define <pause dur="1.0"/> international relations <pause dur="0.3"/> in terms of power <pause dur="0.4"/> and how states acquire retain <pause dur="0.7"/> and # <pause dur="0.3"/> sustain <pause dur="0.2"/> themselves <pause dur="0.8"/> as power # in power <pause dur="2.9"/> for the realist <pause dur="0.6"/> power is the <pause dur="0.2"/> currency of international politics <pause dur="0.3"/> it's the way in which you get on <pause dur="0.2"/> it's the way in which you <pause dur="0.3"/> achieve your objectives <pause dur="1.6"/> power is therefore <pause dur="0.4"/> crucial <pause dur="0.5"/> if you are <pause dur="0.2"/> to be <pause dur="0.2"/> successful <pause dur="3.3"/> there is no other criteria <pause dur="2.1"/> you don't act <pause dur="1.0"/> in a way which is right <pause dur="1.0"/> morally or <pause dur="0.4"/> in any other way <pause dur="0.8"/> you simply <pause dur="0.2"/> do what is necessary <pause dur="2.6"/> morality plays no part <pause dur="1.7"/> power is everything <pause dur="1.2"/> and the world according to 
the realist analysis is divided into two <pause dur="0.5"/> broad <pause dur="0.2"/> groups <pause dur="0.2"/> of states <pause dur="0.8"/> those who are satisfied <pause dur="0.7"/> with the status quo and therefore will <pause dur="0.3"/> seek to sustain it <pause dur="0.8"/> and those who are dissatisfied <pause dur="0.4"/> with the status quo who have <pause dur="0.3"/> one of two choices they can either change the status quo <pause dur="0.6"/> or <pause dur="0.2"/> they have to accept it <pause dur="1.3"/> so you have dissatisfied powers or revolutionary powers <pause dur="0.4"/> at one end <pause dur="0.3"/> and satisifed <pause dur="0.2"/> status quo powers <pause dur="0.6"/> at the other <pause dur="1.1"/> the world is seen as a hierarchy <pause dur="1.5"/> with the most satisfied and powerful states at the top <pause dur="0.6"/> and the least satisfied <pause dur="0.3"/> and least powerful states <pause dur="0.3"/> at the bottom <pause dur="1.2"/> realists therefore <pause dur="0.7"/> define international politics as the struggle for power <pause dur="1.3"/> the struggle for <pause dur="0.8"/> supremacy <pause dur="1.6"/> they are in many respects rather like Hobbes' <pause dur="0.8"/> analysis of man and the state of nature <pause dur="1.5"/> they see human nature <pause dur="0.5"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> the nature of states as being <pause dur="0.4"/> much the same <pause dur="1.0"/> states are <pause dur="0.5"/> like Hobbes' man <pause dur="1.0"/> motivated by greed and fear <pause dur="1.6"/> according to Morgenthau no state will <pause dur="0.2"/> willingly lose power or give up power <pause dur="0.5"/> or indeed threaten <pause dur="0.9"/> itself or its position <pause dur="0.4"/> by 
taking actions which it # cannot achieve <pause dur="1.9"/> so for the realist <pause dur="1.0"/> the analysis is very simple <pause dur="2.2"/> but it becomes a circular argument <pause dur="2.6"/> power is defined in terms of the national interest <pause dur="0.4"/> all states pursue <pause dur="0.3"/> the national interest <pause dur="1.2"/> but in a sense <pause dur="0.3"/> that creates a real problem because <pause dur="1.5"/> it <pause dur="0.2"/> follows that everything that states do is always in the national interest <pause dur="0.4"/> and what <pause dur="0.7"/> the national interest is in is <pause dur="0.3"/> is always what states do in other words you can't <pause dur="0.3"/> get below that # level of analysis <pause dur="0.7"/> because no state will act <pause dur="1.0"/> out of the <pause dur="0.2"/> interests <pause dur="0.5"/> of its national <pause dur="0.4"/> concerns <pause dur="4.2"/> now <pause dur="0.8"/> Morgenthau may have some <pause dur="0.8"/> relevance because of course he was arguing against the ideas <pause dur="0.4"/> of the nineteen-twenties and the nineteeen-thirties <pause dur="0.4"/> which had seen <pause dur="0.3"/> a view that international politics should be more cooperative <pause dur="0.9"/> as initially it had seen the idea of internationalism <pause dur="0.7"/> as being crucial and essential <pause dur="0.8"/> if progress was to be made <pause dur="1.9"/> the future of the world as seen after the end of the First World War <pause dur="0.3"/> as lain <pause dur="0.2"/> with international cooperation <pause dur="1.6"/> in <pause dur="0.2"/> 
establishing new forms of international morality <pause dur="0.8"/> in establishing <pause dur="0.3"/> some forms of cooperative behaviour <pause dur="0.3"/> between states <pause dur="0.5"/> a collective agreement as to what was right <pause dur="0.4"/> and what was wrong <pause dur="1.9"/> Morgenthau argues strongly against this <pause dur="2.6"/> his view <pause dur="0.3"/> was such a <pause dur="0.3"/> # the the liberal <pause dur="0.7"/> idealist view of the world <pause dur="0.7"/> that in fact you could create a <pause dur="0.4"/> a a <pause dur="0.3"/> cooperative world was simply <pause dur="0.9"/> not <pause dur="0.5"/> related <pause dur="0.3"/> to the realities of politics <pause dur="0.7"/> but what in fact happened then was that you simply threatened <pause dur="0.2"/> your own existence <pause dur="1.1"/> by being nice to people <pause dur="0.2"/> you ended up <pause dur="0.2"/> in more trouble <pause dur="0.2"/> than being nasty to them <pause dur="1.1"/> states who didn't <pause dur="0.2"/> seek to defend <pause dur="0.4"/> their power position <pause dur="0.3"/> simply <pause dur="0.2"/> would <pause dur="0.2"/> not <pause dur="0.4"/> be able <pause dur="0.7"/> to survive <pause dur="1.2"/> so that was the problem <pause dur="1.0"/> the problem as far as Morgenthau was concerned was if you acted morally <pause dur="0.3"/> you put at risk <pause dur="0.7"/> the interests of your state <pause dur="3.3"/> and therefore <pause dur="0.2"/> states should simply ignore morality <pause dur="0.7"/> he wrote a famous article called The Twilight of International Morality <pause dur="0.6"/> in which he argued very strongly that the purpose of morality <pause dur="0.4"/> 
purpose of ideology as well <pause dur="0.4"/> was simply <pause dur="0.2"/> to provide a gloss <pause dur="0.2"/> for what you would do <pause dur="0.2"/> anyway <pause dur="2.1"/> in other words nobody goes out and says <pause dur="0.2"/> i'm going to war against this country because it's smaller <pause dur="0.3"/> and i can beat the hell out of it <pause dur="0.5"/> you go to war because of <pause dur="0.2"/> international principles <pause dur="0.6"/> but the reality is <pause dur="0.2"/> that you choose war <pause dur="0.2"/> because you think you can win it <pause dur="1.4"/> and then you find some reason <pause dur="0.3"/> for doing <pause dur="0.4"/> for for taking <pause dur="0.2"/> # the military <pause dur="0.2"/> action <pause dur="0.4"/> you don't <pause dur="0.3"/> in other words <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> make moral judgements <pause dur="0.2"/> about <pause dur="0.2"/> the use of force <pause dur="3.4"/> so Morgenthau presents a very <trunc>s</trunc> extreme view of realism <pause dur="1.1"/> that the only thing that matters is power <pause dur="0.4"/> that the only way in which states will <pause dur="0.5"/> will respond to each other <pause dur="0.3"/> is <pause dur="0.3"/> in their perception <pause dur="0.3"/> of other states' power <pause dur="1.3"/> and that <pause dur="0.5"/> essentially <pause dur="0.4"/> international politics is an anarchic system <pause dur="0.4"/> in which only the powerful will succeed <pause dur="3.7"/> the problem however <pause dur="0.3"/> with Morgenthau's analysis and with the realist analysis <pause dur="0.6"/> lies in the number of directions <pause dur="1.5"/> the first is <pause dur="0.9"/> that <pause dur="1.9"/> they're not united in what <pause dur="0.4"/> they 
believe <pause dur="0.7"/> should be <pause dur="0.4"/> the role of states <pause dur="0.2"/> even Morgenthau <pause dur="0.5"/> who in his book <pause dur="0.2"/> claims that <pause dur="0.5"/> his analysis of international politics <pause dur="0.2"/> simply reflects <pause dur="0.2"/> what actually happens <pause dur="0.5"/> complains <pause dur="0.4"/> # halfway through the book that America isn't actually <pause dur="0.4"/> conforming <pause dur="0.2"/> to the rules which he's actually laid down <pause dur="0.6"/> and has asserted that all states <pause dur="0.2"/> always follow <pause dur="0.4"/> so in other words he's actually saying <pause dur="0.4"/> here's the theory <pause dur="0.2"/> but in fact unfortunately <pause dur="0.4"/> # states <shift feature="voice" new="laugh"/>don't <vocal desc="laugh" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.3"/> abide <shift feature="voice" new="normal"/>by my theory <pause dur="0.4"/> which of course <pause dur="0.2"/> is nevertheless <pause dur="0.2"/> an accurate description <pause dur="0.3"/> of how states always behave <pause dur="2.9"/> so <pause dur="0.8"/> in reality states don't always act as the realists <pause dur="0.4"/> would wish <pause dur="0.9"/> nevertheless the realists did have a genuine point <pause dur="0.5"/> in the sense that they were arguing against those <pause dur="0.4"/> who believed that <pause dur="0.4"/> policy should be motivated by <pause dur="0.4"/> idealistic <pause dur="0.3"/> and <trunc>morali</trunc> # moralistic <pause dur="0.3"/> views <pause dur="0.7"/> to take one example <pause dur="1.0"/> in the post-nineteen-forty-five period <pause dur="0.5"/> there were those in the United States who sincerely believed <pause dur="0.5"/> that because democracy <pause dur="0.3"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> <trunc>ec</trunc> and the market economy <pause dur="0.2"/> was so 
morally superior <pause dur="0.4"/> it was the duty of the United States <pause dur="0.4"/> to roll back the frontiers of communism <pause dur="0.3"/> to liberate Eastern Europe <pause dur="0.4"/> by military means <pause dur="0.2"/> if necessary <pause dur="1.5"/> whilst the realists might agree <pause dur="0.2"/> that that would be a laudable objective <pause dur="0.5"/> they equally firmly argued <pause dur="0.2"/> that that was not <pause dur="0.3"/> a real <pause dur="0.4"/> possibility <pause dur="0.5"/> that you could not roll back frontiers of communism <pause dur="0.3"/> because such <pause dur="0.6"/> to try to do so <pause dur="0.2"/> would simply put at risk <pause dur="0.3"/> all <pause dur="0.2"/> that the United States stood for <pause dur="2.0"/> 
and <pause dur="0.2"/> particularly in the age of nuclear weapons and once <pause dur="0.4"/> the Soviet Union could respond in nuclear kind <pause dur="0.3"/> it was the there was little point <pause dur="0.6"/> in doing so <pause dur="0.9"/> there was no point in being right <pause dur="0.4"/> but very <pause dur="0.2"/> very <pause dur="0.2"/> dead <pause dur="1.5"/> so for the realists the argument is very much a practical one <pause dur="0.3"/> as well <pause dur="0.4"/> as a theoretical one <pause dur="1.1"/> now that doesn't mean to say that realists and idealists don't always agree <pause dur="0.8"/> indeed in Korea <pause dur="0.9"/> during the Korean War <pause dur="0.4"/> or perhaps more recently during the Gulf War <pause dur="0.6"/> you could get both realists and idealists agreeing <pause dur="0.5"/> on the outcome even though they actually <pause dur="0.2"/> 
came to it <pause dur="0.2"/> from two entirely different viewpoints <pause dur="0.6"/> on the one side the realists <pause dur="0.2"/> would argue <pause dur="0.3"/> the key issue in the Gulf is oil <pause dur="0.2"/> and therefore it's in <pause dur="0.3"/> the United States' interests <pause dur="0.4"/> to secure <trunc>oi</trunc> oil supplies <pause dur="0.2"/> prevent <pause dur="0.4"/> Saddam Hussein from controlling a large <pause dur="0.6"/> # section of the world's oil supplies <pause dur="1.8"/> so the United States should take military action <pause dur="0.3"/> and on the other side there would be the idealists who said this was poor little country <pause dur="0.3"/> invaded by a rather larger country <pause dur="0.2"/> it was the duty of the international community <pause dur="0.3"/> to defend <pause dur="0.4"/> the right of Kuwait <pause dur="0.4"/> to sovereign <pause dur="0.3"/> independence <pause dur="0.3"/> and existence <pause dur="1.4"/> so both agree <pause dur="0.2"/> on military action <pause dur="0.3"/> but from entirely different perspective <pause dur="0.3"/> one saying it's our moral duty <pause dur="0.3"/> the other saying it's the interests <pause dur="0.2"/> of the state <pause dur="0.8"/> which is important <pause dur="4.9"/> there however <pause dur="0.2"/> remain significant problems <pause dur="0.2"/> with the analysis which # <pause dur="0.3"/> Morgenthau and others <pause dur="0.5"/> bring forward <pause dur="0.8"/> first of all in defining what is the national interest <pause dur="1.2"/> whose interests <pause dur="0.4"/> are to be defined as the national interest <pause dur="1.5"/> here we 
have the same sort of problem as you get in <pause dur="0.3"/> political philosophy in relation to Rousseau <pause dur="2.9"/> in relation to the will of all <pause dur="0.5"/> and the general will <pause dur="3.7"/> Morgenthau's answer to that is that in the sense the national interest <pause dur="0.3"/> is so self-evident <pause dur="0.6"/> that in fact you don't need to define it <pause dur="2.1"/> but that's a bit of a cop out really because you do need to actually know <pause dur="0.3"/> what the national interest is <pause dur="0.4"/> if you're going to pursue it <pause dur="0.6"/> and simply to assert <pause dur="0.3"/> that to retain your power is in the national interest <pause dur="0.3"/> seems to me to be <pause dur="0.2"/> an inadequate explanation <pause dur="0.8"/> it's also very much related to time constraints <pause dur="1.7"/> how much time has to expire before you know whether something is in the national interest <pause dur="1.2"/> let's take the case of Germany <pause dur="1.4"/> Germany between nineteen-thirty-six and <pause dur="0.4"/> nineteen-forty-two or thereabouts <pause dur="0.3"/> could be said to have <pause dur="0.5"/> gained as a result of the Nazi <pause dur="0.3"/> government they had expanded <pause dur="0.3"/> Germany they had occupied most of Europe <pause dur="0.5"/> they were being highly <trunc>su</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> successful <pause dur="1.0"/> in military terms <pause dur="0.8"/> between nineteen-forty-three 
and nineteen-forty-five <pause dur="0.6"/> Germany lost everything so perhaps the Second World War wasn't quite so <pause dur="0.3"/> in America # sorry in in Germany's <pause dur="0.3"/> # national interest <pause dur="0.9"/> but view that from the year two-thousand you could certainly argue that <pause dur="0.5"/> not only was it in the national interests of Germany to fight the Second World War <pause dur="0.3"/> it was in the national interests of Germany to lose the Second World War <pause dur="0.3"/> because Germany has become by far and away the strongest state <pause dur="0.5"/> in Europe <pause dur="1.4"/> so in a sense <pause dur="1.1"/> it depends on how you define <pause dur="0.2"/> success <pause dur="0.4"/> and what kind of time scale <pause dur="0.4"/> you're looking at as to whether or not <pause dur="0.3"/> a particular policy or a particular approach <pause dur="0.6"/> is <pause dur="0.3"/> in the national interest <pause dur="2.7"/> the third problem is the problem of power <pause dur="0.5"/> what constitutes power <pause dur="2.2"/> now we all have a fairly <pause dur="0.8"/> broad view <pause dur="0.3"/> of what we mean by power <pause dur="0.8"/> but really the realists are only concerned <pause dur="1.0"/> in their analysis with military power <pause dur="1.7"/> military power is the tangible power that you can see <pause dur="0.8"/> that states <pause dur="0.2"/> actually have <pause dur="1.1"/> but power is much more significant than that <pause dur="1.2"/> power <pause dur="1.3"/> 
may be the currency of international relations but some of it is not easily measurable <pause dur="1.6"/> the bits that are <pause dur="0.5"/> we can look at and compare <pause dur="1.1"/> so for example <pause dur="1.2"/> we can <pause dur="0.4"/> look at the size of a country's <pause dur="0.2"/> military capabilities <pause dur="3.4"/> tells us very little how about the quality <pause dur="0.4"/> of those <pause dur="0.2"/> capabilities <pause dur="0.4"/> and there are some states who genuinely believe <pause dur="0.3"/> that quantity <pause dur="0.2"/> will always overcome quality <pause dur="1.0"/> but nevertheless it is an important factor <pause dur="0.2"/> which needs to be considered <pause dur="1.9"/> how good <pause dur="0.3"/> are the weapons <pause dur="1.8"/> how accurate are they <pause dur="0.2"/> how effective <pause dur="3.8"/> what about the size of the population <pause dur="1.0"/> that again gives you some clue <pause dur="0.3"/> as to <pause dur="0.4"/> how <pause dur="0.2"/> large an army <pause dur="0.2"/> a country <pause dur="0.2"/> might be able <pause dur="0.5"/> to <pause dur="0.3"/> # deploy <pause dur="0.5"/> in times of emergency <pause dur="1.2"/> what is the strength of the economy <pause dur="0.9"/> is it a modern economy is it <pause dur="0.3"/> is it <pause dur="0.3"/> # is there a well educated population <pause dur="0.6"/> we can measure most of these factors <pause dur="0.5"/> in terms of almost every state and every year <pause dur="0.3"/> for example the International Institute <pause dur="0.2"/> for Strategic Studies <pause dur="0.3"/> produces a list <pause dur="0.3"/> of the military capability <pause dur="0.3"/> of almost every state <pause dur="1.6"/> so anybody 
who wants to look up how strong a particular country is <pause dur="0.4"/> you can look up <pause dur="0.3"/> and find out <pause dur="1.1"/> but that doesn't really tell you <pause dur="0.4"/> very much <pause dur="1.8"/> there are also immeasurable elements <pause dur="0.6"/> of power <pause dur="1.3"/> power is relative <pause dur="0.5"/> and it is psychological <pause dur="1.4"/> power is relative in the sense <pause dur="0.4"/> that whilst we may have a general hierarchy <pause dur="0.2"/> of states <pause dur="0.5"/> you can still have regional great powers <pause dur="0.4"/> who may not <pause dur="0.2"/> necessarily meet <pause dur="0.2"/> the reach the top ten <pause dur="0.3"/> internationally <pause dur="0.4"/> but who are still great powers <pause dur="0.4"/> in their locality <pause dur="0.2"/> and who can influence <pause dur="0.2"/> and effectively <pause dur="0.3"/> manipulate <pause dur="0.3"/> states <pause dur="0.2"/> around them <pause dur="3.6"/> secondly people may perceive one state as being more powerful than it actually is or less powerful <pause dur="1.4"/> Britain is a very good example of a state <pause dur="0.4"/> that <pause dur="0.2"/> after nineteen-forty-five <pause dur="0.5"/> proclaimed itself to be a great power <pause dur="0.4"/> and possibly for about a decade after the end of the Second World War <pause dur="0.3"/> was regarded by almost everybody <pause dur="0.3"/> as a great power <pause dur="1.1"/> so in order to be <pause dur="0.5"/> to have your power acknowledged <pause dur="0.3"/> is a very important factor in terms <pause dur="0.3"/> of <pause dur="0.6"/> public assessment <pause dur="0.4"/> of your power 
capabilities <pause dur="1.2"/> states simply can't assert that they are powerful <pause dur="0.5"/> other people have to recognize it as such <pause dur="4.4"/> states may <pause dur="0.7"/> not be powerful if they are divided amongst themselves <pause dur="1.3"/> however much <pause dur="0.2"/> your military capability <pause dur="0.3"/> may be it may be ineffectual <pause dur="0.4"/> if in fact <pause dur="0.3"/> you are <pause dur="0.3"/> have a weak government <pause dur="0.7"/> a divided country <pause dur="1.3"/> a country which is simply <pause dur="0.4"/> unable <pause dur="0.2"/> to <pause dur="0.2"/> get its act <pause dur="0.2"/> together <pause dur="0.7"/> to use one example <pause dur="0.4"/> the example of Laos <pause dur="0.3"/> or Cambodia during the <pause dur="0.3"/> nineteen-fifties and sixties <pause dur="0.2"/> had a neutralist government <pause dur="1.0"/> to the north <pause dur="0.4"/> # of the sort of # in northern <pause dur="0.4"/> Laos and northern Cambodia you had communists <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> dominance to the south you had western <pause dur="0.2"/> capitalist dominance <pause dur="0.3"/> and so you had compromised on a government <pause dur="0.2"/> that was a neutral government neither capitalist nor communist <pause dur="0.4"/> but virtually incapable of doing anything <pause dur="4.8"/> or France in nineteen-forty which collapsed <pause dur="1.7"/> as a result of <trunc>inter</trunc> in part at least as a result of internal divisions <pause dur="0.3"/> within France <pause dur="0.8"/> and the effectiveness <pause dur="0.4"/> of German propaganda <pause dur="1.1"/> we cannot measure <pause dur="0.4"/> people's 
determination to fight <pause dur="1.4"/> and a classic example <pause dur="0.5"/> of this <pause dur="0.6"/> # would be <pause dur="0.4"/> Israel in the modern <pause dur="0.3"/> day <pause dur="0.2"/> we can take Israel today <pause dur="0.7"/> Israel <pause dur="0.6"/> is <pause dur="0.9"/> a very small country with a <trunc>ve</trunc> relatively small <pause dur="0.3"/> population and certainly <pause dur="0.5"/> if you simply add up the population <pause dur="0.4"/> significantly weaker <pause dur="0.3"/> than its Arab neighbours <pause dur="1.0"/> and yet Israel has fought <pause dur="0.3"/> a number of wars <pause dur="0.2"/> in the past <pause dur="0.5"/> and survived and been successful <pause dur="0.9"/> why <pause dur="0.6"/> because it is more determined to do so <pause dur="0.9"/> it is more determined <pause dur="0.9"/> because for Israel <pause dur="0.7"/> one loss is one loss <pause dur="0.2"/> too many <pause dur="1.1"/> it simply would not survive <pause dur="1.4"/> and therefore <pause dur="0.4"/> however small you are you may be very determined <pause dur="0.5"/> to be successful <pause dur="0.3"/> and to survive <pause dur="0.5"/> i'm not arguing that this will always be <trunc>s</trunc> <pause dur="0.4"/> <vocal desc="laugh" iterated="n"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> mean that you can <pause dur="0.5"/> be successful <pause dur="0.7"/> but the motivation is a very powerful element <pause dur="0.4"/> in getting people <pause dur="0.3"/> to fight <pause dur="0.6"/> and to sustain their position <pause dur="4.7"/> so <pause dur="0.2"/> when we look at power <pause dur="0.9"/> we can't always <pause dur="0.2"/> add up <pause dur="0.5"/> the numbers <pause dur="1.0"/> and be certain <pause dur="0.3"/> that one state is more powerful <pause dur="0.4"/> than another <pause dur="2.7"/> in the last analysis <pause dur="0.7"/> power exists at three 
different levels <pause dur="1.0"/> it exists at the level of influence how people <pause dur="0.2"/> influence other states <pause dur="0.7"/> well you can do that <pause dur="0.3"/> physically by sending a gunboat <pause dur="0.5"/> harassing people threatening people <pause dur="2.1"/> but occasionally and quite often <pause dur="0.4"/> influence can far exceed <pause dur="0.7"/> your physical capacity <pause dur="0.4"/> # to force an action <pause dur="0.6"/> that is to say <pause dur="1.1"/> organizations like <pause dur="0.3"/> the Vatican <pause dur="0.3"/> have enormous influence around the world <pause dur="0.5"/> but have very little power <pause dur="1.4"/> a country like Britain has got enormous influence <pause dur="0.5"/> but <pause dur="0.2"/> comparatively <pause dur="0.3"/> declining power <pause dur="4.7"/> you can also have <pause dur="1.1"/> mobilized power <pause dur="0.4"/> let's say <pause dur="0.5"/> how much power you actually have available to you <pause dur="0.2"/> at any given moment <pause dur="0.8"/> mobilized power <pause dur="0.2"/> is the amount of power <pause dur="0.2"/> which you can normally deploy <pause dur="0.3"/> in <pause dur="0.6"/> peacetime <pause dur="0.4"/> conditions <pause dur="1.0"/> and then you've got total power <pause dur="0.3"/> which is what you can achieve <pause dur="0.3"/> when you mobilize fully and completely <pause dur="0.3"/> onto a war footing <pause dur="1.3"/> and how quickly you can do that <pause dur="0.3"/> how effectively you can do that <pause dur="0.4"/> is a further factor <pause dur="0.5"/> in determining how powerful <pause dur="0.3"/> you may be <pause dur="0.9"/> many states <pause dur="0.3"/> have often been frightened <pause dur="0.4"/> of a 
surprise attack <pause dur="1.1"/> and however powerful you may be <pause dur="0.3"/> you can sometimes be the victim <pause dur="0.3"/> of such attacks <pause dur="1.1"/> furthermore <pause dur="1.8"/> it's become increasingly clear in the modern world <pause dur="0.4"/> that <pause dur="0.9"/> the kind of military capability that states have <pause dur="0.3"/> may not always be <pause dur="0.4"/> relevant <pause dur="0.2"/> to the particular operations <pause dur="0.4"/> which they wish to undertake <pause dur="1.4"/> nobody would suggest that because the United States failed in Vietnam <pause dur="0.5"/> Vietnam was more in powerful <pause dur="0.4"/> than the United States <pause dur="0.6"/> all one can say <pause dur="0.4"/> is that the <trunc>f</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> power that was available to the United States <pause dur="0.2"/> was inappropriate for use <pause dur="0.3"/> in Vietnam <pause dur="1.0"/> and therefore <pause dur="0.7"/> no state <pause dur="0.4"/> in a sense has absolute power <pause dur="0.4"/> in the international <pause dur="0.3"/> community <pause dur="2.5"/> a second and perhaps more interesting point is that economic power <pause dur="0.9"/> is <pause dur="0.7"/> equally significant <pause dur="1.1"/> and something which in a sense the realists <pause dur="0.3"/> have paid very little attention to <pause dur="2.9"/> economic power <pause dur="0.9"/> may be <pause dur="0.2"/> differently distributed <pause dur="0.5"/> from <pause dur="1.6"/> military power <pause dur="1.0"/> indeed if you go <pause dur="1.6"/> back in history <pause dur="1.2"/> when you look back to the nineteenth century and the eighteenth century <pause dur="0.9"/> most of the 
knowledge great powers of that era <pause dur="1.4"/> were in fact also the economic giants <pause dur="1.2"/> but in the twentieth century <pause dur="0.7"/> we find that that has not always been the case <pause dur="1.0"/> if we look at the <pause dur="0.3"/> period after nineteen-forty-five for example <pause dur="0.3"/> nobody would really argue that the Soviet Union <pause dur="0.3"/> was ever <pause dur="0.2"/> an economic great power <pause dur="1.0"/> but militarily <pause dur="0.3"/> it was second <pause dur="0.8"/> in the world to the United States in terms of its military capability <pause dur="2.3"/> so <pause dur="1.0"/> there has become a growing mismatch between economic power <pause dur="0.4"/> and military power <pause dur="0.9"/> and some states have used economic power <pause dur="0.5"/> very sucessfully <pause dur="0.2"/> to achieve their objectives <pause dur="0.3"/> in the international community <pause dur="1.6"/> so that economic power has become a new reality <pause dur="0.8"/> which in a sense the realists <pause dur="0.2"/> have failed to take into account <pause dur="0.5"/> neo-realists <pause dur="0.4"/> people like Kenneth Waltz and others <pause dur="0.3"/> in more recent times <pause dur="0.3"/> have however <pause dur="0.3"/> taken that <pause dur="0.5"/> into account in their analysis <pause dur="0.5"/> of international politics <pause dur="4.1"/> is it true <pause dur="0.2"/> <trunc>howe</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> also that in fact states do not behave according to some <pause dur="0.6"/> basic <pause dur="0.2"/> feelings <pause dur="0.2"/> of morality <pause dur="0.8"/> i think here again 
the realist analysis <pause dur="0.3"/> is simply inaccurate <pause dur="1.5"/> of course it's true that states will not <pause dur="0.4"/> act simply out of <pause dur="0.6"/> # a feeling that <pause dur="0.2"/> what they should ought to do <pause dur="0.5"/> should be moral <pause dur="1.0"/> and states will of course choose to do <pause dur="0.2"/> a series of immoral <pause dur="0.5"/> actions <pause dur="1.7"/> but as <pause dur="0.2"/> Arnold Wolfers one of the early realists argued <pause dur="0.8"/> in a famous # article <pause dur="0.2"/> called Statesmanship and Moral Choice <pause dur="0.8"/> states do make choices <pause dur="0.8"/> and they do make them on the basis of some moral values <pause dur="1.6"/> given the fact that you may have objective which can be achieved by more than one means <pause dur="0.7"/> then you can choose the least immoral <pause dur="0.4"/> of a range of immoral actions <pause dur="0.9"/> that's not saying you're going to act morally <pause dur="0.3"/> but there is a degree of moral choice <pause dur="0.3"/> between sort of bombing somebody <pause dur="0.2"/> and maybe <pause dur="0.2"/> using less intrusive means <pause dur="4.0"/> now the analysis which the realists have offered <pause dur="2.0"/> adds <pause dur="0.2"/> one further <pause dur="0.6"/> element and <shift feature="voice" new="laugh"/>rather interestingly <shift feature="voice" new="normal"/><pause dur="0.3"/> it becomes a moral imparity <pause dur="1.7"/> the realist analysis <pause dur="2.4"/> is that order <pause dur="0.4"/> is more important than justice <pause dur="0.3"/> in the international community <pause dur="2.6"/> to the realist <pause dur="0.5"/> 
what is important <pause dur="0.8"/> is that peace is preserved <pause dur="3.3"/> not because it is <pause dur="0.2"/> morally good <pause dur="0.6"/> but because it benefits <pause dur="0.4"/> those that are at the top of the international <pause dur="0.6"/> system <pause dur="2.4"/> when you're at the top <pause dur="0.5"/> you don't want to risk anything <pause dur="0.4"/> you become more conservative with a small C <pause dur="0.7"/> you want to have <pause dur="0.2"/> a conservative view <pause dur="0.3"/> you don't risk anything <pause dur="0.4"/> you don't put your head above the parapet <pause dur="0.3"/> you want order <pause dur="0.2"/> in order that your trade will continue <pause dur="0.2"/> that your economic prosperity will continue <pause dur="0.3"/> that your interests will be safeguarded <pause dur="0.5"/> and you don't risk anything <pause dur="1.1"/> of course <pause dur="0.5"/> if anybody threatens you <pause dur="0.2"/> you will fight them <pause dur="0.6"/> and <pause dur="0.5"/> presuming you're <pause dur="0.6"/> as powerful as you think you are <pause dur="0.5"/> you will defeat them <pause dur="1.1"/> but the reality is <pause dur="0.5"/> you want order <pause dur="0.6"/> order is by far and away the most important value <pause dur="0.3"/> as far as the realist is concerned <pause dur="5.8"/> other people would argue that justice is more important <pause dur="3.0"/> that you cannot have <pause dur="0.2"/> a real <pause dur="0.6"/> just <pause dur="0.2"/> world <pause dur="0.6"/> a peaceful world <pause dur="0.2"/> unless there is proper justice <pause dur="1.1"/> people will always be dissatisfied <pause dur="0.6"/> if they cannot see <pause dur="0.3"/> that their legitimate complaints <pause dur="0.3"/> will be dealt with <pause dur="0.4"/> and if at all possible remedied <pause dur="2.1"/> 
the reality is that for those who are dissatisfied <pause dur="0.3"/> with the status quo <pause dur="0.9"/> which is essentially what the realists support <pause dur="1.9"/> have <pause dur="0.5"/> to change that status quo <pause dur="0.4"/> by military means <pause dur="0.9"/> the only way <pause dur="0.6"/> in which a <pause dur="0.6"/> status quo can be changed <pause dur="0.5"/> is by <pause dur="0.5"/> replacing those at the top <pause dur="0.5"/> with a new <pause dur="0.3"/> international order <pause dur="2.3"/> and the general belief is that that can only be achieved by military means <pause dur="3.2"/> now in reality of course <pause dur="1.1"/> that may not be true <pause dur="1.3"/> some states can achieve objectives using economic means <pause dur="1.4"/> and provide tremendous impact on <pause dur="0.5"/> the international economy <pause dur="0.5"/> such as raising the price of oil <pause dur="2.0"/> but in <pause dur="0.2"/> but in the realists' analysis <pause dur="0.6"/> you are faced with a very stark choice <pause dur="0.5"/> there is order <pause dur="0.8"/> in which <pause dur="0.2"/> states <pause dur="0.2"/> at the top <pause dur="0.4"/> dispense <pause dur="0.9"/> what they regard as justice <pause dur="1.7"/> # or there is anarchy <pause dur="2.7"/> others on the other hand would <pause dur="0.2"/> would argue that in <pause dur="0.2"/> it is an anarchy because there is no justice <pause dur="1.5"/> why is it that two-thirds of the world <pause dur="0.2"/> consume <pause dur="0.5"/> less than a third of the world's resources <pause dur="1.3"/> is this not an unfair <pause dur="0.4"/> and unreasonable distribution <pause dur="0.6"/> both of <pause dur="0.3"/> 
the resources of the world <pause dur="0.2"/> and of power <pause dur="1.7"/> that more equal division of power <pause dur="0.4"/> will lead to more peaceful <pause dur="1.8"/> relations <pause dur="1.1"/> particularly <pause dur="0.4"/> given the fact that more people will be satisfied <pause dur="0.6"/> than dissatisfied <pause dur="4.3"/> now <pause dur="0.7"/> one way in which states can increase their power <pause dur="0.3"/> is through alliances <pause dur="0.9"/> they can achieve <pause dur="1.2"/> what they cannot achieve alone <pause dur="0.8"/> by joining with others <pause dur="1.4"/> and alliances can be created <pause dur="0.6"/> in the short term <pause dur="0.3"/> for short term gains <pause dur="0.4"/> they can be economic alliances they can be diplomatic alliances <pause dur="0.4"/> they can be military alliances <pause dur="0.7"/> alliances enable you <pause dur="0.2"/> to change the power relationship <pause dur="2.6"/> and to achieve far more collectively <pause dur="0.7"/> than individually <pause dur="2.4"/> but the difference between that kind of collectivism <pause dur="0.5"/> which realists would approve of <pause dur="0.8"/> and the collectivism <pause dur="0.4"/> of <pause dur="0.3"/> the idealists <pause dur="1.0"/> is that <pause dur="0.9"/> under alliances <pause dur="0.3"/> you choose your partners <pause dur="0.5"/> and you choose the purposes <pause dur="0.4"/> for which <pause dur="0.3"/> you form <pause dur="0.2"/> an alliance <pause dur="5.4"/> the <pause dur="0.6"/> realists would argue that <pause dur="0.7"/> it is only makes sense <pause dur="0.3"/> if you have common objectives <pause dur="0.3"/> to join together <pause dur="0.2"/> to achieve them <pause dur="1.3"/> as happened 
during the Second World War <pause dur="0.2"/> it doesn't require ideological <pause dur="0.5"/> considerations <pause dur="0.5"/> if you have a common enemy <pause dur="0.3"/> you'll join together <pause dur="0.2"/> to fight <pause dur="0.2"/> against that common enemy <pause dur="0.9"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> that's as really as we'd have predicted all that as quickly <pause dur="0.4"/> as you came together <pause dur="0.3"/> you disintegrated because you always fall out <pause dur="0.3"/> over who's going to get <pause dur="0.3"/> the biggest spoils <pause dur="0.2"/> at the end <pause dur="0.2"/> of that conflict <pause dur="1.5"/> but alliances <pause dur="0.3"/> are ways of increasing power <pause dur="0.2"/> in the short term <pause dur="1.3"/> very few alliances <pause dur="0.4"/> last longer <pause dur="0.4"/> than the existence <pause dur="0.3"/> of the threat <pause dur="0.3"/> that created them <pause dur="6.3"/> so that realists have a view of the world which is very simple <pause dur="3.1"/> the world is divided to some extent into good guys and bad guys <pause dur="1.4"/> the good guys are the people you agree with the bad guys are the people who are trying to upset you <pause dur="1.4"/> they have a simplistic view <pause dur="0.6"/> of how states interreact <pause dur="0.7"/> they see it in terms of power <pause dur="1.5"/> the only thing that matters <pause dur="0.3"/> is whether i am more powerful <pause dur="0.4"/> than another state <pause dur="0.3"/> or that state is more powerful <pause dur="0.3"/> than i am <pause dur="1.9"/> and it's a very simplistic <pause dur="0.2"/> 
analysis of power because it simply <pause dur="0.3"/> seeks to identify <pause dur="0.2"/> military power <pause dur="0.5"/> of the main means by which states <pause dur="0.5"/> interreact <pause dur="2.5"/> it excludes morality <pause dur="0.3"/> there's no moral <pause dur="0.5"/> considerations at all <pause dur="1.5"/> except in so far as you might choose <pause dur="0.7"/> not so bad <pause dur="0.8"/> a means <pause dur="0.4"/> of achieving your objective <pause dur="1.1"/> and the example which Wolfers uses <pause dur="0.3"/> is the example <pause dur="0.2"/> of the Cuban missile crisis <pause dur="1.7"/> where he says look <pause dur="1.9"/> let's consider what the options of the United States were <pause dur="1.0"/> they could have written a nice letter to Mr Gorbachev <pause dur="0.2"/> sorry to Mr <trunc>gru</trunc> Khrushchev <pause dur="0.4"/> and say <pause dur="0.2"/> # please take your missiles away <pause dur="0.5"/> doesn't seem very likely that would be happen <pause dur="1.2"/> they could ignore it they can simply say it's none of our business <pause dur="1.8"/> they could bomb the missile sites <pause dur="1.5"/> they could invade <pause dur="1.0"/> or they could <pause dur="1.0"/> set up <pause dur="0.2"/> some kind of quarantine <pause dur="0.4"/> to stop the military <pause dur="0.5"/> capability <pause dur="0.2"/> getting through <pause dur="2.2"/> Wolfers' argument is that Kennedy chose <pause dur="0.4"/> the least worst of those options that were available to him <pause dur="0.2"/> he dismissed the idea of writing to Khrushchev <pause dur="0.6"/> or ignoring it completely <pause dur="2.2"/> 
and that was to set up a quarantine <pause dur="1.1"/> because that was the least worst option because it threatened nobody <pause dur="0.5"/> except those who wished to either <pause dur="0.3"/> run <pause dur="0.2"/> the quarantine <pause dur="0.6"/> or attempt <pause dur="0.2"/> to # <pause dur="0.3"/> # force their way through it <pause dur="2.6"/> it threatened no Cubans it threatened no Russians <pause dur="0.9"/> but it demonstrated America's commitment <pause dur="0.3"/> to do something <pause dur="0.2"/> positive <pause dur="0.2"/> about getting rid <pause dur="0.5"/> of the missiles it achieved its objectives <pause dur="3.8"/> so there is an element of morality but it's not very <pause dur="0.2"/> strong <pause dur="1.6"/> where i think there <pause dur="0.2"/> there is a weakness however <pause dur="0.2"/> is that most states seek to defend their actions in moral terms <pause dur="0.5"/> very few states <pause dur="0.3"/> seek to actually <pause dur="0.6"/> announce that they're doing something <pause dur="0.4"/> just because they can do it <pause dur="0.9"/> they always find some reason <pause dur="0.8"/> ideological <pause dur="2.1"/> or moral <pause dur="0.7"/> to justify the actions <pause dur="0.3"/> which they have taken <pause dur="3.0"/> and you have to ask yourself why <pause dur="0.9"/> why do states do this if in fact <pause dur="0.4"/> everybody knows that states are simply out for themselves <pause dur="0.5"/> if everybody knows that the only thing that really matters <pause dur="0.3"/> is power <pause dur="0.8"/> why do you feel the 
necessity to defend yourself <pause dur="1.0"/> against <pause dur="0.3"/> world opinion <pause dur="1.6"/> and i suppose the answer to that is <pause dur="0.4"/> that in fact states like to be liked <pause dur="2.0"/> they don't like to be seen <pause dur="0.2"/> as bullies <pause dur="0.6"/> they don't like to be seen <pause dur="0.4"/> as people who ignore the rights of others <pause dur="2.4"/> and so states do feel a certain degree of obligation <pause dur="0.8"/> to <pause dur="0.3"/> justify their actions <pause dur="1.7"/> furthermore i think <pause dur="1.2"/> realism <pause dur="0.2"/> excludes the possibility <pause dur="1.5"/> and it's a growing one <pause dur="0.9"/> that <pause dur="2.0"/> states can simply <pause dur="0.3"/> isolate themselves <pause dur="0.5"/> from the ouside world <pause dur="1.2"/> the growth of television the growth of <pause dur="0.2"/> mass communications <pause dur="0.5"/> have meant it's virtually impossible <pause dur="0.6"/> for states to ignore <pause dur="0.4"/> what is going on <pause dur="0.2"/> around them <pause dur="1.3"/> and public opinion <pause dur="0.4"/> has become more important in some respects within states <pause dur="0.8"/> forcing states to do things which they might not otherwise <pause dur="0.6"/> do <pause dur="2.5"/> so the strict application of power <pause dur="0.3"/> in terms of <pause dur="0.5"/> maintaining the hierarchy <pause dur="0.8"/> of ignoring the interests of others is simply <pause dur="0.3"/> being slowly <pause dur="0.5"/> withered <pause dur="0.2"/> away <pause dur="1.0"/> i'm not suggesting that there's <pause dur="0.4"/> a tremendous amount of <pause dur="0.4"/> international compassion <pause dur="0.3"/> and so forth <pause dur="0.3"/> 
but there is certainly a view <pause dur="0.4"/> that today's states cannot get away <pause dur="0.5"/> as often <pause dur="0.4"/> as they did <pause dur="0.4"/> with simply <pause dur="0.2"/> doing things because it's in their interests <pause dur="0.4"/> to do so <pause dur="3.8"/> furthermore <pause dur="1.1"/> there has been a second line of <pause dur="0.4"/> criticism of <trunc>rea</trunc> of realism <pause dur="0.8"/> not this time from the idealists <pause dur="1.0"/> who simply <pause dur="0.2"/> throw up their hands in despair at the idea <pause dur="0.2"/> that states should simply behave <pause dur="0.3"/> in such a a <pause dur="0.2"/> cavalier way <pause dur="0.9"/> but from those <pause dur="0.2"/> who wish to see <pause dur="0.4"/> a more clearer analysis <pause dur="0.5"/> of international relations <pause dur="0.5"/> based on a more scientific <pause dur="1.0"/> method <pause dur="0.5"/> of <pause dur="0.5"/> # study <pause dur="2.5"/> into the <pause dur="0.6"/> debate if that is the right way of <pause dur="0.3"/> putting it <pause dur="0.7"/> came a group of <pause dur="0.7"/> scientists mainly <pause dur="0.9"/> who sought <pause dur="0.5"/> to criticize <pause dur="0.4"/> Morgenthau's view <pause dur="0.5"/> that what he had put forward was a scientific <pause dur="0.3"/> theory <pause dur="0.3"/> of international relations <pause dur="0.5"/> by pointing out first of all <pause dur="0.2"/> that Morgenthau did not set out any <pause dur="0.4"/> <trunc>preconc</trunc> # <pause dur="0.6"/> did not set out any propositions <pause dur="0.3"/> that he sought to test <pause dur="0.4"/> but merely <pause dur="0.2"/> asserting <pause dur="0.3"/> that the behaviour of states was as he described it <pause dur="0.5"/> and therefore <pause dur="0.6"/> was able to fit everything into his theory <pause dur="2.0"/> but he 
also failed to <pause dur="1.6"/> discard <pause dur="0.4"/> his own ideological views <pause dur="2.7"/> and that what was needed was a more scientific <pause dur="0.5"/> and rigorous approach to the study of international politics <pause dur="1.3"/> that yes states behaved <pause dur="0.8"/> in certain ways but they could be seen as behaving <pause dur="0.2"/> in certain ways <pause dur="0.3"/> because of certain <pause dur="0.2"/> variables <pause dur="0.2"/> which operated <pause dur="0.3"/> across all states <pause dur="0.4"/> and in the same way <pause dur="0.3"/> across all states <pause dur="1.1"/> so the scientific analysis of international politics <pause dur="0.8"/> would analyse <pause dur="0.5"/> the ways in which states behave <pause dur="0.7"/> not by <pause dur="0.3"/> asserting beforehand <pause dur="0.4"/> what they would do <pause dur="0.5"/> but by looking at what they did <pause dur="0.3"/> and then trying to understand <pause dur="0.3"/> why it was they behave <pause dur="0.4"/> in the way in which they did <pause dur="2.0"/> Morton Kaplan in his <pause dur="0.4"/> book System and Process in International Politics <pause dur="0.3"/> introduced this new <pause dur="0.7"/> idea of systems analysis <pause dur="1.0"/> that there was such a thing as an international system <pause dur="0.3"/> and the international system <pause dur="0.3"/> simply had to be analysed <pause dur="0.3"/> in terms of the way in which <pause dur="0.2"/> it was structured <pause dur="0.2"/> and how <pause dur="0.3"/> the <pause dur="0.2"/> subsystems within that system <pause dur="0.5"/> interreacted <pause dur="3.9"/> traditionalists like Morgenthau and others <pause dur="0.7"/> 
simply found this <pause dur="0.9"/> beyond comprehension <pause dur="0.8"/> they argued strongly <pause dur="0.3"/> that you couldn't have a scientific study <pause dur="0.3"/> in that sense <pause dur="1.8"/> you couldn't have <pause dur="0.4"/> a study of politics <pause dur="0.6"/> which discounted the human <pause dur="0.2"/> element <pause dur="0.5"/> within it <pause dur="2.9"/> they argued that their analysis of international politics the realist analysis of international politics <pause dur="0.5"/> reflected <pause dur="0.3"/> a broad philosophical <pause dur="0.6"/> tradition <pause dur="0.2"/> about <pause dur="0.3"/> the nature <pause dur="0.3"/> of human beings <pause dur="1.5"/> human beings <pause dur="0.6"/> behaved <pause dur="2.4"/> selfishly <pause dur="1.5"/> that the nature <pause dur="0.4"/> of <pause dur="0.4"/> individuals <pause dur="0.5"/> was such <pause dur="0.4"/> that they <pause dur="0.2"/> behaved in the way in which <pause dur="0.6"/> to Morgenthau and others states behaved <pause dur="0.8"/> why <pause dur="0.3"/> because states were made up of human beings <pause dur="1.2"/> the people who made decisions for states <pause dur="1.5"/> translated their individual <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> methods of working <pause dur="0.5"/> to the state level <pause dur="1.8"/> it was individuals who made decisions on behalf of states <pause dur="1.0"/> states <pause dur="0.2"/> themselves couldn't make any decisions at all <pause dur="1.9"/> so that the <pause dur="1.2"/> debate which went on was between those who thought you could understand the international system <pause dur="0.6"/> by looking at <pause dur="1.2"/> issues <pause dur="0.2"/> in a scientific way <pause dur="0.6"/> and those who asserted that it was simply impossible <pause dur="0.5"/> to do so <pause dur="3.3"/> 
at a later stage in this debate which to some extent became rather sterile with each side <pause dur="0.7"/> shouting at the other and not really communicating <pause dur="1.0"/> there developed <pause dur="1.1"/> a new version of realism <pause dur="1.0"/> or neo-realism as it became <pause dur="2.7"/> the leading # figure in this # analysis <pause dur="0.4"/> was a man called Kenneth Waltz <pause dur="1.0"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> now Kenneth Waltz's analysis <pause dur="0.4"/> of international relations <pause dur="1.3"/> was very much <pause dur="1.5"/> to attempt <pause dur="0.2"/> the broad principles of realism <pause dur="1.7"/> but to argue <pause dur="0.3"/> that in a sense it needed to be modernized <pause dur="0.3"/> and brought in up to date <pause dur="0.4"/> and to accept a wider range of factors <pause dur="0.4"/> than people like Morgenthau <pause dur="0.5"/> and the early realists <pause dur="0.3"/> had suggested <pause dur="1.9"/> the Waltz book <pause dur="1.1"/> or <pause dur="0.2"/> series of books <pause dur="1.0"/> he made his name for example by <pause dur="0.3"/> an analysis of war entitled Man the State and War <pause dur="0.5"/> in which he tried to analyse the different levels <pause dur="0.5"/> of which war <pause dur="0.4"/> might be seen to have been the cause <pause dur="1.8"/> he then went on to look at the balance of power <pause dur="0.4"/> as a theory <pause dur="1.1"/> because as you'll see next time <pause dur="0.4"/> in which i'm sure you'll be pleased to know will be my last appearance #<pause dur="0.7"/> in this 
lecture <trunc>thea</trunc> <pause dur="0.3"/> # series <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> we # <pause dur="0.4"/> # he identified the balance of power as being one of the most crucial elements <pause dur="0.6"/> # for <pause dur="0.2"/> the realists and indeed for the maintenance of order <pause dur="0.5"/> within international <pause dur="0.5"/> relations <pause dur="2.9"/> but he also saw it in terms of the nuclear balance of power <pause dur="1.7"/> but what you had to do was you had to see the balance of power <pause dur="0.4"/> within the nuclear <pause dur="0.3"/> context <pause dur="1.1"/> and rather interestingly <pause dur="2.2"/> he and others have argued very strongly <pause dur="1.2"/> that deterrence is best achieved through the acquisition <pause dur="0.3"/> of nuclear weapons <pause dur="1.3"/> but Waltz went further <pause dur="0.7"/> he actually argued that as many states as possible <pause dur="0.5"/> should have nuclear weapons <pause dur="0.9"/> because that way <pause dur="0.4"/> every state would <pause dur="0.2"/> deter <pause dur="0.5"/> every other <pause dur="1.3"/> and that war <pause dur="0.2"/> would simply be abolished <pause dur="0.2"/> through deterrence <pause dur="1.3"/> he wrote a famous article called <pause dur="0.4"/> Nuclear Weapons More Would Be Better <pause dur="3.3"/> and that <pause dur="1.3"/> what he's trying to argue it seems to me <pause dur="0.6"/> is that you can create some kind of stability and order <pause dur="0.8"/> within 
the international <pause dur="0.5"/> community <pause dur="1.2"/> the search for order <pause dur="0.6"/> while as it is primarily <trunc>concer</trunc> the concern of the realist <pause dur="0.6"/> who assert that it is far more important than justice <pause dur="0.4"/> remains a key factor in international <pause dur="0.4"/> relations <pause dur="1.6"/> in the next few lectures that we shall be # <pause dur="0.4"/> having <pause dur="1.3"/> # and giving <pause dur="1.7"/> it is answering the questions of how we avoid war <pause dur="0.7"/> that will be central <pause dur="0.4"/> # to the discussions <pause dur="0.9"/> now half the reason for that <pause dur="0.5"/> is that even if you believe in international justice <pause dur="0.8"/> there is a general feeling <pause dur="0.4"/> that wars are destructive <pause dur="0.7"/> and should be avoided if at all possible <pause dur="1.1"/> the fact that war does exist and continues to exist <pause dur="0.5"/> is a key factor <pause dur="0.3"/> in understanding international politics <pause dur="0.9"/> how you avoid it <pause dur="0.6"/> and the answers to what the best means of achieving <pause dur="0.4"/> the avoidance of war <pause dur="0.4"/> is a matter <pause dur="0.3"/> which varies <pause dur="0.3"/> for individual approach <pause dur="0.3"/> to individual approach <pause dur="0.5"/> but next week <pause dur="0.3"/> i shall be looking at in detail <pause dur="0.3"/> at the balance of power <pause dur="0.3"/> as a concept <pause dur="0.5"/> for managing international relations
