yeah she's always joking </u><u who="nm5067"> right # okay well i'll start because # i'm going to have to go very quick today because we've only got an hour and really i usually do a two hour session on this </u><u who="sf5070"> all right yeah </u><u who="nm5067"> so # i'll just explain what i'm not going to do # and then maybe i'll say what i'm going to do # first of all oh don't worry about these cameras here i'm not going to do anything to do with cameras these are here purely for my own project # i'm doing a project where i'm creating a C-D-ROM so essentially i'm a materials writer </u><u who="sf5073"> <trunc>c</trunc> is it Cognis </u><u who="nm5067"> it's it's not going to be called Cognis but that's one of its early names # so i write materials and i develop materials but i do them mostly with video based # electronic materials # and you're all welcome to have a go on my C-D-ROM when it's finally ready which it it may not be for a while # so today # right the cameras are here for nothing to do with the talk what i'm 
going to talk about is # using video clips # i suppose just for for English language teaching purposes # i'm not exactly sure of the profile of your group and even this course because i was only invited to give a talk # quite recently and # i believe it's to do with materials writing </u><u who="sf5070"> yeah </u><u who="nm5067"> yeah okay well # unfortunately i don't have examples of materials writing with me or anything like that # but what i will do is show you lots of clips suggest some ideas of how they might be used in the classroom and then let your brains do the thinking of how you might apply that kind of oral situation we've got today to actual materials production okay # are you # experienced classroom teachers or </u><u who="sf5070"> yeah </u><u who="nm5067"> trainee teachers </u><u who="sm5068"> experienced </u><u who="sf5070"> experienced </u><u who="nm5067"> experienced okay so you know quite a lot about methodology and so on # okay that's good to know right have you used video before in your classrooms 
okay well if this is is too simple for you never mind okay # now # as i said i'm going to have to go very quickly because # i want to show you lots of clips and suggest lots of things # one thing i always think is # i mean people always say in in the literature it always talks about motivation and video being a good motivation and i think that's true but # that that only works up to a point i think you know if you choose your materials carefully of course you'll be # # perhaps choose exciting and interesting materials you'll probably help keep the motivation but # i think you also need to # think about <trunc>c</trunc> # creating tasks around any kind of clip # i know the lazy man's way or lazy woman's way is you know okay i've got a class today let's show them a video you know and maybe we'll talk about it at the end or something # that's probably not what i'll be doing today anyway although i will be showing you lots of little clips from films now just to increase the motivation 
okay # i'm sure you're all highly motivated intelligent people # you haven't been ground down by <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> and the course yet you know # but just to increase it # well i'd like you to be kind of i mean play along as guinea pigs today if you like # to be the students i know you are students but # you know you can # <trunc>i</trunc> # well i'll get you to take part in the tasks that i set rather than simply talk about them from the theoretical point of view which would be very boring actually # and hopefully through the experience of doing things this will give you a more concrete feel of of what things are about so you may find yourself doing some very simple things today but <trunc>tha</trunc> that's okay you'll be your your # rational brain will be thinking about applications and so on # perhaps one more thing i'll do just to # just to make it even more exciting if that's possible # now do we have some chalk we do # to add to the # yes the excitement # we'll turn the whole <trunc>w</trunc> hour we've got an hour into a a competition so </u><u who="sm5069"> 
is there going to be a conflict </u><u who="nm5067"> there will i like conflict yeah # no there'll be no conflict you know </u><u who="sf5071"> any prizes </u><u who="sm5069"> i can handle conflict </u><u who="nm5067"> # you'll get the well i don't know about prizes # </u><u who="ss"> <gap reason="inaudible, multiple speakers" extent="1 sec"/> </u><u who="nm5067"> # you might get you might get to see yourself on video # # at some stage in the future you know # </u><u who="sm5069"> are we going to be in the video in the future materials you going to produce </u><u who="nm5067"> you never know it's possible # </u><u who="sf5070"> you're going to be <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/></u><u who="nm5067"> so could we have anyway could we have three teams and we'll just run things just to add to the you know the excitement and the motivation so four here four at the back and four here okay that's dead simple </u><u who="sf5070"> all right perfect </u><u who="nm5067"> # can you give me a name for your team </u><u who="sf5070"> Sangbok </u><u who="nm5067"> how do you spell that </u><u who="sm5074"> Sang S-A-N-G </u><u who="nm5067"> S-A-N </u><u who="sf5070"> yeah yeah <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> </u><u who="nm5067"> G S-A-N-G-B-O-K </u><u who="nm5067"> Sangbok </u><u who="sf5070"> B-O-K </u><u who="nm5067"> middle line </u><u who="sf5071">

course be rewarded right let's get to look at the material let's think about material # right one of the beauties of video # and as i said i'm only going to talk about one little element which is video clips recorded off movies or T-V okay # but one of the beauties about using video in the classroom is that # you can manipulate sound and image # you don't necessarily # need to use both together so the first thing i'd like to do is do a very standard kind of language exercise i'm going to play i'm going to use this as if you like a tape recorder i'm going to play you a little clip and i'm going to ask you to do one thing very simple # two things perhaps # write down any greetings you hear okay and then suggest a possible situation okay so write down any greetings suggest a possible situation i'm just going to play this bit and you're not going to see it okay ow electricity

we call it Chinese whispers i don't know why but we call it Chinese whispers you know it when you whisper you whisper something in someone's ear and they whisper it # and the idea is that again there's another information gap but also the students will be speaking in English of course to their the person next to them and so on and then the person at the end will say what happened okay now we don't have time for that unfortunately # but it's a fun game it also gets a lot of speaking practice # but i'll show you the clip anyway good one for students of language i think this next clip one of my favourites </u><u who="nm5067"> okay # <trunc>i</trunc> i mean it is a good activity especially if you watch it without the sound you don't know what's happening and you get some very interesting answers from students look we're running out of time so what i'll do is i'll give you # just a handout which just will remind you of some of the things
