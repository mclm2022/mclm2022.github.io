particularly in what had happened in <pause dur="0.4"/> the newly independent states of Africa <pause dur="0.4"/> and the <pause dur="0.2"/> recently independent states <pause dur="0.3"/> of Asia where dictatorship reign <pause dur="1.1"/> # disappointments about the lack of urban jobs about the degree of informality <pause dur="0.6"/> of petty enterprise that people were undertaking <pause dur="0.4"/> in the cities <pause dur="0.4"/> the idea of Arthur Lewis that there was this ability to transfer from the traditional to the modern <pause dur="0.3"/> sector that this would soak up unemployment <pause dur="0.3"/> and create higher marginal productivity of labour <pause dur="0.3"/> did not seem to be working <pause dur="0.5"/> and that seemed to be owing to the inappropriate transfer of capital intensive <pause dur="0.3"/> agriculture industry <pause dur="0.3"/> and anything else <pause dur="0.3"/> from the north to the south <pause dur="0.8"/> okay those are are all the doubts <pause dur="0.8"/> now you need to know a little bit of history <pause dur="0.3"/> to understand <pause dur="0.3"/> how doubt crystallizes into action <pause dur="0.6"/> if you'd opened up books on <pause dur="0.2"/> development in the early nineteen-seventies <pause dur="0.4"/> you would have seen <pause dur="0.2"/> 
an awful lot of influential books <pause dur="0.5"/> really arguing that development was not just a game <pause dur="0.5"/> in <pause dur="0.5"/> economic growth <pause dur="0.8"/> look here's here's an influential <pause dur="0.3"/> book <pause dur="1.3"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="2"/> R-W Gee nineteen-seventy-five <pause dur="0.6"/> Redistribution with Growth <pause dur="0.6"/> published on behalf of the World Bank in nineteen-seventy-five <pause dur="0.5"/> this was a series of essays by some of the foremost development economists of the time <pause dur="0.7"/> and it argued the following <pause dur="0.5"/> that there was no trade-off between distributional objectives <pause dur="0.3"/> and economic growth <pause dur="0.6"/> in other words <pause dur="0.2"/> if you wanted the fastest and best return on capital <pause dur="0.4"/> put it into small scale industry <pause dur="0.4"/> put it into artisan industry <pause dur="0.4"/> put it into the urban informal sector <pause dur="0.3"/> and put it into small scale farming <pause dur="1.2"/> R-W Gee argued that that would give you faster rates of growth than investing in large scale formal enterprise be it urban <pause dur="0.3"/> or rural <pause dur="0.8"/> now this was wonderful news <pause dur="0.3"/> to have academics argue this <pause dur="0.3"/> because it was two for the price of one <pause dur="0.7"/> bet on the smallest and you not only get equity <pause dur="0.3"/> but you also get faster economic 
growth <pause dur="1.2"/> but the real spur i suppose to the changes of the nineteen-seventies <pause dur="0.2"/> come from the events of <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="2"/> nineteen-seventy-three <pause dur="1.3"/> now nineteen-seventy-three is <pause dur="0.8"/> one of the more interesting years of the last century <pause dur="0.9"/> # <pause dur="1.7"/> nineteen-seventy-three is the height of a world economic boom <pause dur="0.7"/> now remember what we saw last week the world economy grew steadily <pause dur="0.7"/> # <trunc>betw</trunc> in the nineteen-fifties and nineteen-sixties at rates that we don't think we've seen sustained <pause dur="0.4"/> before or since in the recorded history <pause dur="0.3"/> of humanity <pause dur="0.6"/> and those rates steamed on ahead <pause dur="0.5"/> into the early nineteen-seventies and culminated <pause dur="0.4"/> in a huge boom period <pause dur="0.3"/> which lasted <pause dur="0.4"/> <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="3"/> seventy-two <pause dur="0.2"/> seventy-four <pause dur="0.8"/> just about every country in the world had a boom period seventy-two seventy-four <pause dur="0.4"/> if you like the <pause dur="0.2"/> macroeconomic shorthand <pause dur="0.9"/> world economies economies throughout the world overheated <pause dur="0.3"/> during seventy-two seventy-four <pause dur="0.5"/> and that overheating <pause dur="0.3"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="8"/> pushed up <pause dur="0.6"/> the price of all commodities <pause dur="1.3"/> of all primary commodities <pause dur="0.8"/> they all went 
up <pause dur="0.7"/> now one that everybody knows about <pause dur="0.6"/> is the one that went up in October seventy-three <pause dur="1.0"/> the world commodity whose price quadrupled <pause dur="0.2"/> in October seventy-three <pause dur="1.1"/> what commodity was that </u><pause dur="0.3"/> <u who="sm0970" trans="pause"> oil </u><u who="sm0971" trans="latching"> oil </u><u who="nm0969" trans="latching"> oil <pause dur="0.8"/> it was the first time that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries had flexed its muscles <pause dur="0.4"/> and said let's see what we can do <pause dur="0.5"/> and led by Saudi Arabia those oil exporting countries in OPEC <pause dur="0.3"/> said what happens if we <pause dur="0.2"/> unilaterally raise the price of oil <pause dur="0.3"/> by four times <pause dur="0.3"/> and they tried it <pause dur="0.2"/> and it stuck <pause dur="0.8"/> and the world oil price rocketed upwards <pause dur="0.3"/> now that's the one that attracted all the attention <pause dur="0.8"/> well <pause dur="0.3"/> most of the attention <pause dur="0.7"/> except in seventy-three the world wheat price <pause dur="0.4"/> and all other cereals was dragged up <pause dur="0.5"/> by more than double <pause dur="0.4"/> by more than double i think it's triple <pause dur="0.6"/> may even be more than three times <pause dur="0.4"/> the world wheat price <pause dur="0.2"/> spiked <pause dur="0.8"/> now <pause dur="0.8"/> that world wheat price <pause dur="0.3"/> spiked <pause dur="0.3"/> was caused in part and probably largely <pause dur="0.5"/> by a harvest failure in the Soviet Union <pause dur="1.2"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> as the Soviet Union's harvest 
failed the Soviet Union imported about twenty-five-million tons extra <pause dur="0.3"/> of cereals <pause dur="0.5"/> in seventy-three <pause dur="0.7"/> that was a very large rise indeed <pause dur="2.1"/> # and it <pause dur="1.1"/> blasted the price of of wheat <pause dur="0.6"/> now wheat was also dragged upwards by the general inflation of the time <pause dur="0.5"/> but the effect of the rise in the wheat <trunc>pr</trunc> <trunc>c</trunc> # wheat price <pause dur="0.3"/> was dramatic on people interested in food policy <pause dur="1.0"/> and the the the real story that we've got there was an American commentator writing in Time magazine <pause dur="0.7"/> he said <pause dur="0.4"/> <reading>you have seen what Americans are doing on the forecourts this year <pause dur="0.2"/> wait till they're in a bread queue</reading> <pause dur="0.6"/> now what's the <trunc>amre</trunc> reference to the American forecourts <pause dur="0.7"/> when the world oil price went up by four times something happened in the oil supply chain <pause dur="0.6"/> and for a brief period Americans had undersupply of gas <pause dur="0.5"/> and it led to queuing on American forecourts <pause dur="0.4"/> and Americans with large gas guzzling cars found themselves queuing for fuel <pause dur="0.7"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> inevitably in a very large country there were one or two well publicized 
incidents yeah <pause dur="1.0"/> some drunken redneck in some place got out of his large car having queued for forty minutes picked up a shotgun and said right you fill this one up right now mate or that's it yeah <pause dur="0.7"/> one or two incidents like that you you can imagine <pause dur="0.4"/> and this gripped the imagination of American policy makers <pause dur="0.3"/> if Americans behave like this when they have to queue a little while for gas <pause dur="0.4"/> what happens when they have to queue for bread <pause dur="0.6"/> yeah <pause dur="1.9"/> why queue for bread well the wheat price had gone up <pause dur="1.0"/> now <pause dur="0.2"/> you also have to understand that during the sixties <pause dur="0.8"/> world population growth rates had risen <pause dur="1.1"/> the <sic corr="rates">grates</sic> had risen so not only was world population going up <pause dur="0.5"/> but it was going up exponentially <pause dur="0.5"/> and the rate was increasing <pause dur="1.3"/> at that rate you reach infinite population fairly quickly <pause dur="0.7"/> fairly quickly <pause dur="0.5"/> what nobody knew then <pause dur="0.4"/> is what we all know now <pause dur="0.6"/> and that was the arrow that looked like that <pause dur="0.8"/> but none of you can see this # <pause dur="1.9"/> <event desc="puts away screen" iterated="n"/><gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> let's let's do the job properly <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> where are we <pause dur="2.6"/> see if 
you looked at world population growth rates during the twentieth century <pause dur="0.7"/> and that's nineteen-fifties so and <pause dur="0.3"/> we're talking now about nineteen-seventy <pause dur="0.5"/> you've got a pattern that looks something like this <pause dur="3.6"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="2"/> yeah <pause dur="1.2"/> and people looked at that and they said wow <pause dur="0.4"/> you know <pause dur="0.3"/> any number you like <pause dur="0.2"/> by the end of the twentieth century <pause dur="0.7"/> unimaginable numbers by <pause dur="0.8"/> twenty-twenty-five <pause dur="0.5"/> yeah <pause dur="0.3"/> any projection <pause dur="0.4"/> that took the <trunc>c</trunc> the the the trends at that time reached an Olympic amount of of population very quickly <pause dur="0.8"/> people said look <pause dur="0.2"/> if that's what's happened to population growth rates <pause dur="0.8"/> and if <pause dur="0.2"/> agricultural growth is good but not spectacular <pause dur="0.2"/> what's going to happen <pause dur="0.7"/> so we got the <trunc>th</trunc> the old favourite geometrical growth of population versus something looking like arithmetic growth <pause dur="0.5"/> of <pause dur="0.2"/> farm output equals <pause dur="0.3"/> famine <pause dur="0.2"/> yeah <pause dur="0.8"/> equals Thomas Malthus <pause dur="1.4"/> bunch of guys published a book in the late sixties called Famine nineteen-seventy-five <pause dur="1.2"/> was it Famine nineteen-seventy-five i think so <pause dur="0.7"/> they were actually right about Famine nineteen-seventy-five what they didn't realize was where it'd be and what the extent of it was be <pause dur="1.0"/> but you see when people looked at that and then they looked at this wheat price <pause dur="3.6"/> <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="3"/> </u><gap reason="break in recording" extent="uncertain"/> <u who="nm0969" trans="pause"> is it <pause dur="0.4"/> 
this is the first stage of the food crisis apocalypse <pause dur="0.7"/> and so in seventy-three or seventy-four we have something called the World Food Congress <pause dur="0.4"/> convened by the Food and Agriculture Organization of Rome <pause dur="0.4"/> and it meets to deal with the world food crisis which <trunc>c</trunc> surely has come to rest <pause dur="0.8"/> with <pause dur="0.2"/> the world <pause dur="1.5"/> that is a huge spur <pause dur="0.2"/> to changing development ideas the idea that the food is now in aggregate short supply and we've got a supply-side crunch <pause dur="0.4"/> in food <pause dur="0.4"/> a supply-side crunch <pause dur="2.1"/> now <pause dur="2.3"/> what do you need to know <pause dur="0.5"/> you need to know that history makes fools of us all <pause dur="2.2"/> that graph there <pause dur="0.9"/> it doesn't <pause dur="0.3"/> carry on <pause dur="0.4"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="1"/> like that <pause dur="0.4"/> what happens to it is it starts going like this <pause dur="1.1"/> yeah <pause dur="1.1"/> something like that <pause dur="0.8"/> there's been a very considerable fall in population growth rates <pause dur="0.3"/> since 
nineteen-seventy <pause dur="1.2"/> world population growth rates of nineteen-seventy were what over two per cent maybe as much as two-and-a-half per cent per year <pause dur="0.5"/> world population growth rates are below two per cent per day <pause dur="0.4"/> # <trunc>t</trunc> # two per cent a year two per cent a day strewth <pause dur="0.5"/> two per cent a year <pause dur="0.4"/> they're somewhere i'll be about one-point-seven per cent one-point-eight per cent <pause dur="0.3"/> i'm guessing <pause dur="0.3"/> somewhere between one-and-a-half and two per cent <pause dur="0.3"/> they've come down <pause dur="0.7"/> and so we're looking at this <pause dur="0.4"/> and people can now reasonably say that by the time we get to the year what twenty-thirty twenty-forty <pause dur="0.4"/> world population growth will be very slow indeed we'll be <pause dur="0.3"/> getting pretty close <pause dur="0.4"/> to what we think may be the maximum population <pause dur="0.4"/> in this stage of human history <pause dur="0.8"/> we also know that the world wheat price which spiked in seventy-three <pause dur="0.4"/> within a year or two it was back down to its normal levels <pause dur="0.7"/> now for those of you who don't know this story <pause dur="0.4"/> if we plotted the world wheat price from round about here <pause dur="0.4"/> if this is 
the world wheat price in nineteen-fifty or so <pause dur="0.4"/> what we're going to see <pause dur="0.4"/> is a story that looks something like this <pause dur="5.8"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="5"/> that's the world wheat price over the last fifty years more or less <pause dur="0.3"/> there's the spike <pause dur="1.0"/> in the early nineteen-seventies <pause dur="0.3"/> that's the nineteen-ninety-six spike by the way <pause dur="0.5"/> which lasted all of what six months twelve months at most <pause dur="0.5"/> but the general picture of the real world wheat price is <pause dur="0.3"/> down down down <pause dur="1.0"/> # <pause dur="1.8"/> so the world food crisis was a short-lived event <pause dur="0.3"/> in the early seventies but it contributed <pause dur="0.3"/> to the big change in development thinking <pause dur="0.6"/> and what we find in the early nineteen-seventies <pause dur="0.3"/> is we find developmental specialists <pause dur="0.4"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="3"/> coming up with the following signpost <pause dur="0.5"/> to development now <pause dur="0.8"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="3"/> redistribution with growth <pause dur="0.4"/> is one of those <pause dur="0.4"/> let's have attention to <trunc>equit</trunc> equity <pause dur="0.3"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="12"/> so development now <pause dur="1.8"/> is not just economic growth <pause dur="1.6"/> but it's economic growth <pause dur="0.2"/> with equity <pause dur="1.2"/> with decent distribution <pause dur="0.3"/> of the benefits <pause dur="2.2"/> now here's another <pause dur="0.9"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="10"/> of the T-L-As that <pause dur="1.7"/> you perhaps 
need to know or don't need to know <pause dur="0.5"/> basic human needs <pause dur="2.3"/> the I-L-O the International Labour Organization said <pause dur="0.3"/> let's plan for development on the basis of meeting everybody's basic human needs <pause dur="0.7"/> let's let's not just go for maximum economic growth or industrial growth or <pause dur="0.4"/> iron and steel production <pause dur="0.7"/> what we should aim to do is satisfy everybody's basic human needs <pause dur="0.4"/> and those basic human needs <pause dur="0.3"/> nutrition <pause dur="0.3"/> shelter and housing <pause dur="0.3"/> clean water <pause dur="0.7"/> basic education <pause dur="0.4"/> health services <pause dur="1.0"/> clothing <pause dur="1.1"/> right <pause dur="0.3"/> satisfy those basic human needs of everybody <pause dur="0.5"/> more or less <pause dur="0.4"/> equivalent to alleviating poverty <pause dur="1.9"/> and the same organization I-L-O <pause dur="0.8"/> also came up with <pause dur="0.6"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="9"/> a similar message in a different set of clothes <pause dur="1.3"/> when it talked about <pause dur="1.3"/> employment first policies <pause dur="1.6"/> developing <pause dur="0.7"/> development plans <pause dur="0.5"/> producing development plans <pause dur="0.5"/> where the maximum goal was to create jobs <pause dur="1.3"/> and they sent missions famously to Sri Lanka Kenya and Colombia <pause dur="0.5"/> of very eminent development specialists <pause dur="0.4"/> who 
produced indicative development plans <pause dur="0.3"/> aiming to maximize the creation of jobs <pause dur="4.3"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="6"/> and here's another touchstone of this period <pause dur="0.9"/> appropriate technology <pause dur="1.2"/> lack of jobs in the south urban unemployment <pause dur="0.4"/> casualization of labour <pause dur="0.2"/> well <pause dur="0.4"/> went the argument <pause dur="0.2"/> that's because we've brought the wrong technology <pause dur="0.3"/> it uses capital and saves labour <pause dur="0.8"/> do remember of course that the technology developed in the west in the fifties and sixties <pause dur="0.4"/> was technology from America <pause dur="0.4"/> from Germany <pause dur="0.3"/> from the U-K from France <pause dur="0.3"/> all of those countries were short of labour in the fifties and sixties <pause dur="0.8"/> never forget that all of those countries <pause dur="0.6"/> invited large numbers of guest workers and immigrants to make up <pause dur="0.2"/> the labour deficiency <pause dur="0.5"/> hard to believe in these days of <trunc>s</trunc> tightening immigration controls and concerns about international migration <pause dur="0.4"/> but in the fifties and sixties all of those countries <pause dur="0.2"/> wanted people to come in they were short of labour <pause dur="0.3"/> so all of their technology was labour saving <pause dur="0.4"/> well the appropriate 
technology <pause dur="0.2"/> movement said look what we want <pause dur="0.3"/> is technology that can be maintained locally uses local materials <pause dur="0.3"/> and above all <pause dur="0.6"/> saves on capital <pause dur="0.3"/> and uses labour <pause dur="0.4"/> responds to the factor proportions available <pause dur="0.5"/> in the developing world <pause dur="1.8"/> now <pause dur="0.2"/> armed with these ideas one by one <pause dur="0.2"/> all of the major development agencies the World Bank <pause dur="0.6"/> Britain's O-D-A <pause dur="0.2"/> America's U-S-AID <pause dur="0.9"/> # the I-L-O you name it <pause dur="0.4"/> they all signed up for variants <pause dur="0.5"/> on development with equity <pause dur="1.0"/> and the most famous moment in this <pause dur="0.4"/> was a speech in nineteen-seventy-three in Nairobi Kenya <pause dur="0.5"/> by the then President of the World Bank Robert McNamara <pause dur="0.3"/> in which he committed the World Bank to shifting its resources <pause dur="0.5"/> to development projects which stressed redistribution with growth <pause dur="0.8"/> now what did that mean in terms of concrete development policy <pause dur="0.7"/> well what it did mean <pause dur="1.1"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="11"/> was it meant that you <pause dur="0.2"/> went for targeting the poorest <pause dur="2.3"/> you looked actively <pause dur="0.5"/> for the poor <pause dur="0.3"/> for the small scale <pause dur="0.7"/> for the meek and the humble and you tried to 
target those as the focus of your development efforts <pause dur="0.8"/> and <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="7"/> where this went sectorially <pause dur="0.4"/> was all of a sudden <pause dur="1.8"/> agriculture was king <pause dur="1.3"/> agriculture was king and it was king because <pause dur="0.3"/> that's where most of the poor were <pause dur="0.4"/> it was king because that was where so <pause dur="0.5"/> so many <pause dur="0.2"/> small scale entrepreneurs were smallholders <pause dur="0.5"/> and it was king because of the perceived <pause dur="0.3"/> world food crisis <pause dur="1.3"/> so agriculture was the win win win bet small scale agriculture you'd help the poor <pause dur="0.3"/> you'd drive forward economic growth <pause dur="0.3"/> and you'd solve the world food crisis <pause dur="0.6"/> so agriculture got prime attention in this <pause dur="2.1"/> now here's another <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="4"/> idea out of the seventies <pause dur="1.0"/> I-R-D <pause dur="1.1"/> integrated rural development <pause dur="1.4"/> and this was the idea that when you worked in rural areas with the poor with the small scale and so on <pause dur="0.6"/> what you tried to do is to deliver <pause dur="0.4"/> a package of assistance across sectors <pause dur="0.3"/> on the grounds this would give you synergy <pause dur="1.5"/> now <pause dur="0.7"/> just to give you a fairly <pause dur="0.4"/> exaggerated example <pause dur="0.5"/> but if you're trying to get people to 
plant new varieties of rice and use fertilizer to increase their rice yields <pause dur="0.9"/> which you hope is a scale neutral technology that can be used by smallholders <pause dur="0.6"/> then why not at the same time <pause dur="0.9"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> combat malaria <pause dur="0.4"/> inoculate people against diseases <pause dur="0.4"/> and clean up the water supply <pause dur="0.4"/> because all of those will give you better health <pause dur="0.5"/> which is a good thing in itself <pause dur="0.5"/> but of course healthier farmers can work harder in the fields <pause dur="0.4"/> and so that complements the agricultural measures <pause dur="0.8"/> and while we're at it we're going to build some access roads because that will improve <pause dur="0.6"/> price relatives at the farm gate <pause dur="0.3"/> reduce isolation <pause dur="0.4"/> and while we're at it we'll run a an adult literacy campaign because literate farmers <pause dur="0.3"/> can read the labels on the fertilizer packet and so on and so forth <pause dur="0.5"/> so <pause dur="0.2"/> there was the idea that you should try and do things <pause dur="0.3"/> in development in an integrated fashion across all sectors <pause dur="0.4"/> because you get synergy <pause dur="0.4"/> and you get more than the sum of the parts going on <pause dur="2.2"/> now <pause dur="0.2"/> integrated rural development was <pause dur="0.7"/> 
very very exciting to work in <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.9"/> very exciting to work in <pause dur="0.8"/> you got all kinds of things to have a go at <pause dur="0.4"/> # and you've got quite a lot of resources <pause dur="0.6"/> to play with <pause dur="0.9"/> but these resources were limited compared to needs so what happened with integrated rural development <pause dur="0.7"/> was within any country <pause dur="0.5"/> what you did is you took a country <pause dur="1.8"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="6"/> and a country <pause dur="0.3"/> might just look like that <pause dur="0.6"/> and might have its capital there <pause dur="0.5"/> and you take <pause dur="0.5"/> a country that looks like that and you do integrated rural development <pause dur="0.4"/> and you do it <pause dur="0.7"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="8"/> there <pause dur="1.2"/> there <pause dur="1.0"/> there <pause dur="1.1"/> there <pause dur="1.1"/> there <pause dur="0.8"/> oh <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="1"/> and there <pause dur="1.0"/> right <pause dur="0.6"/> and yes that is to scale <pause dur="0.8"/> yes that is to scale <pause dur="0.5"/> in other words you get these little <trunc>e</trunc> enclaves <pause dur="0.5"/> of very small areas where donors are putting in resources <pause dur="0.3"/> and everything is done <pause dur="1.4"/> now that country there some of you will have <pause dur="0.4"/> have <pause dur="0.2"/> have sussed <pause dur="0.6"/> # despite its <pause dur="0.4"/> wobbly outline <pause dur="0.5"/> is Kenya <pause dur="0.8"/> and in the early nineteen-seventies Kenya had six <pause dur="0.2"/> small integrated rural development programmes <pause dur="0.5"/> which were <pause dur="0.2"/> very well documented <pause dur="0.5"/> and some contemporary very influential 
thinkers about development <pause dur="0.4"/> worked on those projects in the early nineteen-seventies <pause dur="0.4"/> but look how tiny they are <pause dur="0.5"/> compared to the mass of Kenya <pause dur="0.5"/> that really is to scale these things were in very small areas indeed <pause dur="0.5"/> why because <pause dur="0.4"/> although you could target resources for a small area you couldn't have the whole country <pause dur="0.3"/> running the kinds of programmes that were run there <pause dur="1.1"/> so because you did everything in a integrated rural development <pause dur="0.4"/> you could only do it on a small scale concentrated in particular areas <pause dur="0.6"/> and because you were trying to do everything <pause dur="0.6"/> donors very often ran very special administrative structures quite different <pause dur="0.4"/> to normal government operations <pause dur="0.3"/> to <trunc>c</trunc> make these things work <pause dur="0.7"/> now those six small experiences i think were all successes <pause dur="0.5"/> they were all successes <pause dur="0.5"/> but <pause dur="0.6"/> i think with the benefit of hindsight we have to say <pause dur="0.4"/> they were unrepeatable <pause dur="0.7"/> and institutionally <pause dur="0.3"/> unsustainable <pause dur="0.5"/> when the donors got bored and the funds ran out <pause dur="0.4"/> and the foreign experts' contracts 
ended <pause dur="0.8"/> and the Landrovers began to rust <pause dur="0.4"/> these projects essentially <pause dur="0.3"/> stopped <pause dur="1.4"/> indeed i arrived <kinesic desc="indicates point on board" iterated="n"/> in this part of Kenya in nineteen-seventy-nine <pause dur="1.3"/> which had <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="2"/> been the administrative headquarters including that area there <pause dur="0.7"/> and there were two or three filing cabinets chock-a with files <pause dur="0.4"/> in my room and i i left them there for a while <pause dur="0.5"/> and then one day i thought what on earth <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> and i went through these filing cabinets and it was all the stuff on sort of four or five years ten years earlier <pause dur="0.3"/> of the implementation of this <pause dur="0.4"/> minutes plans documents contracts <pause dur="0.2"/> budgets <pause dur="1.1"/> semi-annual reports monthly reports all kinds of stuff <pause dur="0.7"/> and i looked at this and i said my goodness this is a vital bit of development <shift feature="voice" new="laugh"/> history here <shift feature="voice" new="normal"/> <vocal desc="laugh" iterated="n"/> but it's clogging up my office <vocal desc="laugh" iterated="n"/> <shift feature="voice" new="laugh"/> so it all <shift feature="voice" new="normal"/> went in a skip <pause dur="0.3"/> <vocal desc="laugh" iterated="n"/> there's never <trunc>en</trunc> never enough historians around to document these experiences and <pause dur="0.2"/> that's the sort of way and as i threw them in the skip i thought <pause dur="0.8"/> there you go <pause dur="0.2"/> good idea at the time good people working 
on it <pause dur="0.2"/> quite a success but not sustainable <pause dur="1.9"/> now one thing that you need to understand about these efforts of agriculture first targeting the poor is basic human needs integrated rural development <pause dur="0.9"/> is <pause dur="0.2"/> one element of the development equation hasn't changed in all this <pause dur="0.6"/> and that is <pause dur="0.5"/> <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="7"/> this is a game <pause dur="0.7"/> about the state <pause dur="0.9"/> and the state's agencies nobody is seriously questioning that if you're going to do integrated rural development <pause dur="0.2"/> it will be the Ministry of Agriculture and the Department of Health <pause dur="0.6"/> and the Directorate of Transport and so on <pause dur="0.5"/> 
it will be state agencies leading the charge <pause dur="0.5"/> and if the state agencies lack resources they'll get money from governments in other countries so it's <pause dur="0.3"/> a government first approach <pause dur="0.5"/> nobody's really challenging <pause dur="0.3"/> the supreme <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="2"/> role of the state <pause dur="0.3"/> as an organizer <pause dur="0.2"/> and an investor <pause dur="0.3"/> in development <pause dur="4.7"/> now look <pause dur="0.3"/> these ideas are publicized in the early nineteen-seventies <pause dur="0.4"/> one by one in the early nineteen-seventies <pause dur="0.3"/> all the major aid donors sign up <pause dur="0.2"/> to this new agenda <pause dur="0.4"/> and it's a very different agenda to the one that's prevailed for the <pause dur="0.3"/> previous twenty years <pause dur="0.5"/> one by one the agencies published documents <pause dur="0.2"/> saying this is what we're going to do <pause dur="0.7"/> now Britain had a world had a a world had a White Paper on development <pause dur="0.5"/> in nineteen-ninety-seven <pause dur="0.5"/> the previous one <pause dur="0.5"/> was all the way back in nineteen-seventy-five so the white the last White Paper <pause dur="0.7"/> # so recent was the first one in nearly a quarter of a century <pause dur="1.1"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> the nineteen-seventy-five White Paper <pause dur="1.0"/> # was called More Aid to the Poorest <pause dur="0.8"/> and it was at the height of 
enthusiasm for these ideas More Aid to the Poorest <pause dur="0.7"/> what is the nineteen-ninety-seven one called <pause dur="1.4"/> forgotten what the nineteen ninety-seven one was called but what's it about <pause dur="0.4"/> it's about reducing poverty by half <pause dur="0.3"/> in other words every time Britain has a White Paper on development it's heavily focused on poverty <pause dur="1.8"/> so Britain signed up to this in in in nineteen-seventy-five as did just about every other aid agency <pause dur="1.8"/> now what you have to understand about history is that <pause dur="0.4"/> if people write things down on documents in nineteen-seventy-three seventy-four seventy-five about <pause dur="0.3"/> we are going to do this <pause dur="0.7"/> how long does it take <pause dur="0.3"/> to make the plans for the new investments and the new direction of money <pause dur="0.8"/> one <pause dur="0.2"/> two three years at least <pause dur="0.4"/> before you redirect the flows of money <pause dur="0.3"/> create the new agencies <pause dur="0.3"/> the new plans <pause dur="0.2"/> the programmes <pause dur="0.4"/> so these I-R-Ds <pause dur="0.2"/> not many were in operation before the mid-nineteen-seventies <pause dur="0.7"/> and how long before you think it's fair to say what is the experience of things <pause dur="0.9"/> well when 
you're working in rural development anything less than five years <pause dur="0.3"/> is the short term <pause dur="1.0"/> # difficult to do things in agriculture and rural areas in less than five years <pause dur="0.3"/> so in other words as we come to the end of the seventies <pause dur="0.3"/> it's very early days with this new agenda <pause dur="0.3"/> it's barely started to be implemented <pause dur="0.2"/> in any great seriousness <pause dur="0.6"/> and the results are not entirely clear <pause dur="1.3"/> before we reach that <pause dur="0.7"/> the whole thing <pause dur="0.3"/> is flipped <pause dur="2.0"/> the whole cooking pot is turned upside down <pause dur="2.0"/> the pancake is turned <pause dur="1.7"/> and we're into the nineteen-eighties <pause dur="0.4"/> and by the time we're into the nineteen-eighties <pause dur="0.4"/> the entire focus of development <pause dur="0.6"/> has jumped <pause dur="0.2"/> radically from where it was <pause dur="0.3"/> in the early seventies <pause dur="1.0"/> now it's quite a long story to explain <pause dur="0.5"/> why development ideas in the nineteen-<pause dur="0.6"/>eighties were so <pause dur="0.3"/> radically different <pause dur="0.6"/> you've got them spelled out in your notes in some considerable detail <pause dur="0.4"/> let me try and summarize that experience <pause dur="2.5"/> what you have to understand is that <pause dur="0.8"/> from the early seventies onwards <pause dur="0.4"/> there was this 
primary boom <pause dur="0.2"/> and there was inflation beginning to come into the world economy <pause dur="0.7"/> in nineteen-seventy-one <pause dur="0.4"/> America left the gold standard <pause dur="0.5"/> the dollar which had been anchored against gold <pause dur="0.5"/> and had been the bulwark of the world economy <pause dur="0.5"/> for twenty-five years or so after the Second World War <pause dur="0.6"/> was suddenly cut free from gold <pause dur="0.4"/> it was effectively devalued <pause dur="1.2"/> remember in nineteen-seventy the American economy <pause dur="0.3"/> made up about one-third of the total product of the world economy today it's about twenty-five per cent or less <pause dur="0.6"/> at that time America was just <pause dur="0.5"/> mega <pause dur="0.2"/> on the scene <pause dur="0.3"/> and its currency was underwritten by the strength of America <pause dur="0.3"/> and it was pegged to gold and we had fixed exchange rates <pause dur="0.8"/> from nineteen-seventy-one America devalued the dollar <pause dur="0.3"/> and the exchange rates floated <pause dur="0.4"/> and from that moment onwards <pause dur="0.3"/> the major industrial economies which in the fifties and sixties had had inflation rates of <pause dur="0.3"/> one two three per cent per year <pause dur="0.4"/> suddenly found themselves with inflation rates running at <pause dur="0.2"/> ten per cent <pause dur="0.3"/> 
fifteen per cent <pause dur="0.3"/> twenty per cent <pause dur="0.7"/> none of you in this room these days will probably believe me <pause dur="0.3"/> when i tell you that in nineteen-seventy-nine Britain's rate of inflation <pause dur="0.4"/> was twenty-<pause dur="0.2"/>five <pause dur="0.2"/> per cent <pause dur="0.2"/> yes <pause dur="1.0"/> i can hardly believe that as the words come out of my mouth and i can remember the year very <trunc>c</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> very distinctly <pause dur="0.3"/> think about it during a year prices go up by a quarter <pause dur="0.7"/> it's unimaginable <pause dur="0.3"/> back then now <pause dur="0.2"/> and it was unimaginable in the sixties but in the seventies <pause dur="0.3"/> world inflation <pause dur="0.4"/> inflation in every country <pause dur="0.4"/> moved up a gear <pause dur="0.5"/> and it moved to double digit or more <pause dur="1.9"/> now the effect of the <pause dur="1.1"/> rise in oil prices <pause dur="0.5"/> was tremendous on the world economy <pause dur="1.0"/> what happened basically was that every country importing oil <pause dur="0.5"/> suddenly paid <pause dur="0.4"/> an awful lot of money <pause dur="0.7"/> to countries that exported oil <pause dur="0.8"/> and that huge transfer of resources meant that some of the oil exporters <pause dur="0.4"/> many of them small countries with limited investment possibilities at home <pause dur="0.8"/> how much money can you spend in Kuwait <pause dur="1.0"/> you can build a new airport a 
desalination plant <pause dur="0.6"/> you can build all kinds of luxury items as well as new hospitals and so on <pause dur="0.4"/> and you still haven't used up these hundreds of millions of dollars which are flowing in <pause dur="0.4"/> as oil rents <pause dur="0.7"/> so a lot of that oil money <pause dur="0.7"/> was put back into western banks <pause dur="0.4"/> in Zurich London Frankfurt New York Miami and so on <pause dur="0.6"/> and the money was then lent back to people who needed money <pause dur="0.4"/> now the people who needed money <pause dur="0.4"/> were <pause dur="0.2"/> countries that suddenly faced a higher oil import bill <pause dur="0.2"/> and had to cover the cost of that <pause dur="0.7"/> and those countries in the developing world <pause dur="0.5"/> who'd seen such <pause dur="0.2"/> incredibly fast growth in the late sixties early seventies <pause dur="0.5"/> that they honestly believed with very good justification <pause dur="0.4"/> that there was no way <pause dur="0.4"/> that they couldn't pay back any amount of debt that they could possibly get <pause dur="1.8"/> now <pause dur="0.2"/> the classic country for this is this country <pause dur="4.5"/><event desc="pulls down screen" iterated="n"/> Brazil <pause dur="1.9"/> nineteen <pause dur="0.3"/> Brazil in the early nineteen-seventies <pause dur="2.2"/> wish we had a Tardis a time machine to take you to Brazil in the early nineteen-seventies boy would 
you enjoy it <pause dur="0.7"/> this was a country <pause dur="0.5"/> which was so self-confident <pause dur="0.5"/> i'd never seen anything like it i've never seen a country <pause dur="0.4"/> so full of its own <pause dur="0.2"/> self-confidence <pause dur="0.4"/> about what it was up to <pause dur="0.3"/> and what the future was there <pause dur="0.5"/> in <trunc>n</trunc> in the early seventies <pause dur="0.3"/> Brazil had been growing for many years at seven or eight per cent per annum <pause dur="0.3"/> it was one of the world's fastest growing economies probably the world's fastest growing economy <pause dur="0.8"/> it had a mega-city <pause dur="0.3"/> which promised to be the world's biggest and most important city <pause dur="0.3"/> by the end of the twentieth century <pause dur="0.3"/> and that was 
São Paulo <pause dur="1.3"/> it also had unimaginable natural resources or appeared to have <pause dur="0.7"/> most of Brazil's population and economic developments concentrated in a small area <pause dur="0.5"/> coastal strip and above all Southern Brazil <pause dur="0.3"/> all the Amazonian forests <pause dur="1.0"/> were out there <pause dur="0.4"/> barely touched <pause dur="0.8"/> and those seemed to be a limitless <pause dur="0.2"/> supply of natural resources for agriculture <pause dur="0.4"/> and <trunc>hu</trunc> who knew <pause dur="0.5"/> in the early seventies <pause dur="0.3"/> what mineral resources there weren't somewhere in the 
Amazon <pause dur="1.6"/> there's Brazil second or third largest country in territory <pause dur="0.4"/> in the world with apparently unimaginable riches and already growing as quickly as possible <pause dur="1.7"/> and of course culturally Brazil knew it was the greatest country in the world because the finest football team ever seen to date <pause dur="0.4"/> had just won the World Cup in nineteen-seventy <pause dur="1.3"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> legendary team of nineteen-seventy with Pele Jairzinho and so on <pause dur="0.7"/> # Brazilians just believed they'd got it made <pause dur="0.5"/> now the Brazilian government that was a military dictatorship run by technocrats said look <pause dur="0.5"/> we'll borrow to build the world's largest hydroelectric dam on the Parana river here <pause dur="0.5"/> we'll borrow money to drive roads four-thousand kilometres across the <sic corr="Amazon">Aramazon</sic> <pause dur="0.4"/> from east to west from north to south <pause dur="0.5"/> we'll borrow money for hydroelectric dams on the São Francisco river <pause dur="0.6"/> we'll borrow money for this we'll borrow money for that <pause dur="1.0"/> and nobody lending the money thought they could ever lose lending to Brazil <pause dur="0.8"/> Brazil was a sovereign state it 
could always pay back the money it was large it was growing quickly <pause dur="0.3"/> whatever you lent Brazil <pause dur="0.3"/> in twenty years time <pause dur="0.3"/> that would be really small change that Brazil would just pay back <pause dur="0.3"/> very very easily <trunc>in</trunc> indeed <pause dur="0.8"/> and indeed the interest rates weren't that high <pause dur="0.7"/> world interest rates in the nineteen-seventies <pause dur="0.3"/> were no more nominal than about fifteen per cent <pause dur="0.8"/> and yet world inflation dollar inflation was frequently getting up to fifteen per cent <pause dur="0.7"/> in several years in the nineteen-seventies world interest rates in real terms <pause dur="0.3"/> were negative <pause dur="0.8"/> right <pause dur="0.7"/> so all you had to do was take the money you were lent put it into real estate gold <pause dur="0.3"/> or anything that kept its value <pause dur="0.5"/> and you were getting a free gift from the banks <pause dur="0.5"/> so everywhere you looked at it <pause dur="0.4"/> borrowing borrowing borrowing made a lot of sense <pause dur="0.9"/> Brazil borrowed a bundle <pause dur="0.2"/> Argentina did so did Chile <pause dur="0.7"/> so did all the Latin American countries <pause dur="0.3"/> so did the Philippines <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="1.2"/> and so did Mexico <pause dur="0.3"/> and Mexico borrowed a bundle <pause dur="0.3"/> and Mexico was an oil 
exporter as well <pause dur="0.4"/> at a time that the oil price was going up <pause dur="0.3"/> nobody could ever lose anything lending to Mexico <pause dur="1.4"/> there was no way that Mexico could overborrow <pause dur="0.6"/> it had huge oil reserves <pause dur="0.4"/> and oil price was going up <pause dur="0.4"/> and Mexico was also growing as quickly as Brazil <pause dur="1.4"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> you couldn't lose lending to Mexico <pause dur="1.5"/> now that was what happened during the nineteen-seventies <pause dur="0.6"/> now towards the end of the nineteen-seventies <pause dur="0.3"/> the world economy <pause dur="0.6"/> began <pause dur="0.2"/> to hit a rocky patch <pause dur="0.8"/> and that rocky patch is marked by the phenomenon <pause dur="0.8"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="8"/> of stagflation <pause dur="4.2"/> now the old Keynesian truths <pause dur="0.8"/> were rather simple <pause dur="2.2"/> you could boost aggregate demand in your economy get the economy to grow bring down unemployment but you were always going to risk pushing up the inflation rate <pause dur="0.8"/> or in the Keynesian model <pause dur="0.6"/> reduce aggregate demand <pause dur="0.2"/> take away the inflationary force and accept slower growth <pause dur="0.3"/> and fewer jobs <pause dur="0.7"/> but in the late seventies country after country <pause dur="0.4"/> in the industrialized world <pause dur="0.3"/> began to <pause dur="0.2"/> experience the worst 
of both worlds <pause dur="1.2"/> rising rates of unemployment <pause dur="0.3"/> hesitant economic growth <pause dur="0.6"/> and <pause dur="0.4"/> high rates of inflation <pause dur="1.4"/> Mrs Thatcher went into the nineteen-seventy-nine election in this country <pause dur="0.7"/> with <pause dur="0.7"/> an election poster that was very famous called Britain isn't working <pause dur="1.5"/> picking up on the figure that for the first time since the war Britain had got a million people unemployed <pause dur="0.6"/> in the late seventies that was a shocking statistic <pause dur="0.5"/> 
in the sixties very very few people were unemployed few hundred-thousand <pause dur="0.4"/> now we'd got a million unemployed <pause dur="0.4"/> and inflation was high as well <pause dur="0.8"/> and on the basis of this <pause dur="0.7"/> quite trenchant critique of the facts of a # of the Labour administration of the late nineteen-seventies <pause dur="0.3"/> Mrs Thatcher <pause dur="0.4"/> won her election victory <pause dur="0.5"/> now unlike other Conservative regimes <pause dur="0.3"/> after the Second World War <pause dur="0.3"/> Mrs Thatcher came to power with a very different set of economic advisers <pause dur="0.3"/> to those that had accompanied <pause dur="0.2"/> people like Edward Heath <pause dur="0.6"/> # in the early nineteen-seventies <pause dur="0.3"/> her advisers were not Keynesian macroeconomists <pause dur="0.3"/> they were monetarists <pause dur="0.4"/> and they said the main aim of economic policy is not Keynesian demand management <pause dur="0.5"/> it's a stable money supply <pause dur="0.7"/> get inflation down <pause dur="0.6"/> and you know how monetarists do this <pause dur="0.5"/> you do it <pause dur="0.6"/> by cranking the big lever <pause dur="0.2"/> of <pause dur="0.4"/> well <pause dur="0.4"/> come on <pause dur="0.7"/> sorry this is just <pause dur="0.5"/> a rampant monologue <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="1.2"/> how do you

over four-million <pause dur="0.5"/> in other words there was a huge increase in unemployment <pause dur="0.4"/> the British economy which had been growing slowly <pause dur="0.4"/> to nineteen-seventy-nine <pause dur="1.0"/> grew hardly at all during those four years and in some years it was backwards <pause dur="0.6"/> lots of industries closed down lots of <pause dur="0.6"/> lots of companies shut their doors faced by these cripplingly high interest rates <pause dur="0.3"/> and by the massive reduction of aggregate demand caused by <pause dur="0.3"/> the rise in interest rates <pause dur="0.5"/> it was a great way to stop inflation but it also <pause dur="0.2"/> did <pause dur="0.4"/> terrific # <pause dur="0.4"/> well had a terrific impact on economic growth <pause dur="0.4"/> and employment <pause dur="0.7"/> now that's what happened in this country <pause dur="0.4"/> similar things happened in other countries <pause dur="0.4"/> an abandonment of Keyensian demand management with <trunc>mac</trunc> with <pause dur="0.2"/> full time # employment <pause dur="0.3"/> full employment as the main objective <pause dur="0.6"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> the assumption <pause dur="0.4"/> of the monetarist objectives of <pause dur="0.3"/> staple money <pause dur="0.2"/> low inflation <pause dur="0.4"/> and then let the rest of the economy take <pause dur="0.2"/> care of itself <pause dur="0.4"/> by market forces <pause dur="0.6"/> now in nineteen-eighty <pause dur="0.5"/> the American presidential 
election was won by President Reagan <pause dur="0.4"/> and Reagan also <pause dur="0.2"/> had <pause dur="0.3"/> monetarist <pause dur="0.5"/> # economic advisers <pause dur="1.1"/> now there was one significant difference between Reagan's administration <pause dur="0.3"/> and the British administration President Reagan and Mrs Thatcher <pause dur="0.4"/> were very much fellow soulmates politically they agreed on so many things <pause dur="0.5"/> but there was one crucial difference in their in in their policy prescriptions <pause dur="0.4"/> and that was <pause dur="0.4"/> that whilst Thatcher and Reagan <pause dur="0.3"/> were both <pause dur="0.3"/> extremely hostile to the Soviet Union which in nineteen-seventy-nine <pause dur="0.3"/> had sent its troops into Afghanistan <pause dur="1.4"/> and believed that the West had to take a very <trunc>s</trunc> hard line against the Soviet Union <pause dur="0.8"/> what happened under Reagan was America began to spend huge amounts of money <pause dur="0.3"/> on new defence equipment <pause dur="0.4"/> believing that the Soviet Union was a menace <pause dur="1.8"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> now that money was spent <pause dur="0.2"/> by an American government <pause dur="0.4"/> which did not believe in raising taxes <pause dur="0.4"/> indeed <pause dur="0.4"/> President Reagan had told the American people i will not raise your taxes <pause dur="1.8"/> now there was a bit of a 
problem there because the American government was already <pause dur="0.2"/> spending more than it got on tax revenues in nineteen-eighty <pause dur="0.4"/> and here was a guy spending more on defence and promising not to tax the American people <pause dur="0.6"/> the fiscal deficit in America grew hugely <pause dur="0.4"/> hugely under Reagan <pause dur="0.9"/> and it was financed <pause dur="0.4"/> not by taxes <pause dur="0.3"/> not by the creation of money <pause dur="0.5"/> but it was financed by deficit borrowing <pause dur="0.7"/> and that's by issuing U-S Treasury bonds <pause dur="1.2"/> now for people to put their money into U-S Treasury bonds <pause dur="0.3"/> you had to offer an attractive rate of interest <pause dur="0.7"/> and what this led to was the U-S putting onto the world market treasury bonds <pause dur="0.3"/> at increasingly high rates of interest <pause dur="0.7"/> this happened at precisely the same moment <pause dur="0.4"/> that <pause dur="0.5"/> world <trunc>intr</trunc> # world inflation rates were coming down <pause dur="0.8"/> under the impact of monetary policy <pause dur="1.0"/> and the combined effect was that real interest rates which had been <pause dur="0.2"/> negative in some years in the nineteen-seventies <pause dur="0.5"/> and were consistently under <pause dur="0.2"/> five per cent real during the seventies <pause dur="0.3"/> suddenly in 
nineteen-eighty-one <pause dur="0.4"/> those interest rates leapt to ten per cent real or more <pause dur="1.1"/> there was a huge increase <pause dur="0.9"/> now you'll see in your notes the example of Mexico <pause dur="0.6"/> which in nineteen-eighty-one had a debt of roundabout ninety-billion dollars an awful lot of money <pause dur="0.3"/> owed by Mexico <pause dur="0.9"/> before nineteen-eighty-one Mexico was paying what what is it in your notes about three per cent on <pause dur="0.7"/> on that debt <pause dur="0.6"/> and had therefore to pay debt servicing somewhere between two and three-billions dollars a year <pause dur="1.0"/> on a trade balance which generated what about fifteen-billion dollars worth of exports in the Mexican economy <pause dur="0.4"/> in the early eighties <pause dur="0.5"/> now <pause dur="0.4"/> debt servicing <pause dur="0.6"/> you've you're spending less than three-billions dollars out of fifteen-billion dollars coming in <pause dur="0.4"/> sure <pause dur="0.2"/> it hurts you <pause dur="0.5"/> but <pause dur="0.2"/> you've still got a large import capacity <pause dur="0.3"/> yeah <pause dur="0.3"/> still a lot of money left <pause dur="0.2"/> to buy <pause dur="0.2"/> the other goods and services you want to import <pause dur="0.8"/> nineteen-eighty-one comes <pause dur="0.4"/> and Mexico's <pause dur="1.1"/> average interest rate goes from <pause dur="0.2"/> the low rates before to 
around about ten per cent <pause dur="0.6"/> and instead of paying under three-billion dollars a year <pause dur="0.3"/> the Mexican government now has to pay nine-billion a year <pause dur="0.4"/> and its total export earnings are fifteen <pause dur="1.0"/> so you can see what's happened to the residual <pause dur="0.2"/> import capacity it's gone from about twelve-billion dollars <pause dur="0.4"/> to about six-billion dollars <pause dur="0.8"/> this is a massive shock to the Mexican economy <pause dur="1.6"/> and <pause dur="1.0"/> it is simply unsustainable <pause dur="0.6"/> Mexico limps on <pause dur="0.2"/> for the best part of a year <pause dur="0.5"/> desperately trying to pay off <pause dur="0.5"/> its debt according to the schedule <pause dur="0.7"/> but in August nineteen-eighty-two <pause dur="0.6"/> the Mexican finance minister on a Friday evening sits down with his closest advisers <pause dur="0.4"/> looks at the data and says that's it <pause dur="0.5"/> on Monday morning <pause dur="0.3"/> we have to pay another two-hundred-million dollars of debt <pause dur="0.4"/> and we simply don't have two-hundred-million dollars <pause dur="0.8"/> stop worrying stop everything <pause dur="0.7"/> stop paying <pause dur="0.4"/> we can't do anything now <pause dur="0.2"/> there's only one decision <pause dur="0.9"/> press notice <pause dur="0.3"/> the Mexican government is now suspending <pause dur="0.3"/> debt repayments <pause dur="0.2"/> until 
further notice <pause dur="0.5"/> faced by <pause dur="0.4"/> current positions <pause dur="0.8"/> that press <trunc>c</trunc> communiqué went out that the Mexican government was suspending debt repayments <pause dur="0.8"/> and the world financial system at that moment was on the verge of collapse <pause dur="1.2"/> all of the world's major <pause dur="0.3"/> banks <pause dur="0.3"/> were massively overexposed on sovereign debt to the developing world if you looked at the balance sheets <pause dur="0.4"/> provisions for bad debt against this lending <pause dur="0.2"/> zero <pause dur="0.6"/> bank reserves bank capital <pause dur="0.2"/> figure X <pause dur="0.2"/> exposure to third world debt <pause dur="0.2"/> figure Y <pause dur="0.3"/> Y is larger than X <pause dur="0.3"/> if all governments had stopped repaying at that moment <pause dur="0.3"/> the world's major banks would have gone bankrupt <pause dur="0.8"/> the effect on the world's financial system would have been simply catastrophic <pause dur="1.5"/> now <pause dur="0.9"/> what happened as a result of that <pause dur="0.3"/> well the cavalry was <trunc>bou</trunc> brought in and the cavalry was the I-M-F <pause dur="0.9"/> and the I-M-F galloped over the hill <pause dur="0.3"/> and said look <pause dur="0.4"/> we'll produce a fix <pause dur="0.9"/> and the I-M-F fix went like this <pause dur="0.6"/> they took the banks <pause dur="0.5"/> and said to the banks and these are all private banks largely <pause dur="0.5"/> they 
said you must make it easier <pause dur="0.4"/> for the third world governments to repay the debt <pause dur="0.5"/> you must extend the periods of repayment <pause dur="0.4"/> give them grace periods <pause dur="0.4"/> do anything you can to make it softer and easier <pause dur="0.2"/> for them to repay <pause dur="1.0"/> well the banks of course didn't like that because it was going to hit their earnings and profits <pause dur="0.4"/> but the I-M-F had got a smoking gun against the temples and said fine <pause dur="0.4"/> if you don't play ball you can go bankrupt <pause dur="0.7"/> # you'll be the first ones to suffer in the world financial crisis that will ensue <pause dur="0.4"/> so you either play <trunc>ba</trunc> ball with us or you go bankrupt and the banks kicking and screaming said okay <pause dur="0.3"/> we'll play ball <pause dur="0.7"/> and the <trunc>wo</trunc> and the I-M-F said look if you do that we'll stitch up the other side of it with the governments in the developing world <pause dur="0.8"/> and what we'll do <pause dur="0.3"/> is we'll make sure that they carry on paying <pause dur="0.7"/> as much as they reasonably can <pause dur="0.9"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> we'll head off the possibility of a mass default <pause dur="0.6"/> and what the I-M-F then did is it went all over the developing world <pause dur="0.4"/> 
and said the priority now <pause dur="0.3"/> is to get your macroeconomy <pause dur="0.3"/> in a state <pause dur="1.0"/> that you have <pause dur="0.7"/> a better macroeconomy <pause dur="0.8"/> better chances of growth <pause dur="0.7"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> that you can keep paying the debt servicing <pause dur="1.2"/> and what they did <pause dur="0.5"/> was they went round the world and they signed with government after government <pause dur="0.4"/> structural <pause dur="0.2"/> adjustment agreements <pause dur="1.0"/> so as we come into the eighties <pause dur="0.4"/> we're into a world <pause dur="0.3"/> of structural adjustment <pause dur="4.4"/> now structural adjustment <pause dur="0.7"/> is a big topic <pause dur="0.7"/> so let's take ten minutes for a coffee break <pause dur="0.5"/> and then we'll have a look at what this world of the eighties was <pause dur="0.4"/> and </u><gap reason="break in recording" extent="uncertain"/><u who="nm0969" trans="pause"> 
on at slightly less blistering pace than so far <pause dur="0.7"/> those of you who are actually trying to follow it in the <trunc>hand</trunc> # handout where are we up to we're about page nine now <pause dur="2.0"/> page nine <pause dur="0.4"/> or so student</u><pause dur="3.6"/> <u who="sf0973" trans="pause"> which one </u><pause dur="2.6"/> <u who="nm0969" trans="pause"> well of the many ones handed out last week this is history of history of ideas about development <pause dur="1.2"/> and we've reached round about page nine <pause dur="8.0"/> well look what we've got in the early nineteen-eighties onwards <pause dur="0.4"/> is structural adjustment being more or less forced <pause dur="0.2"/> upon the developing world <pause dur="0.7"/> some countries took a stronger objection to the I-M-F than <trunc>oth</trunc> than than others <pause dur="0.3"/> some countries consistently for many years like Tanzania <pause dur="0.4"/> held out against I-M-F <pause dur="0.3"/> orthodox advice <pause dur="0.3"/> on macroeconomic management <pause dur="0.4"/> but eventually they were basically forced to signed structural adjustment agreements <pause dur="0.4"/> and why was that <pause dur="0.6"/> well from nineteen-eighty-two onwards from the debt crisis in August eighty-two <pause dur="0.5"/> there was no money 
anywhere in the world system <pause dur="0.5"/> for a poor country <pause dur="0.8"/> in the developing world <pause dur="0.5"/> to finance any trade deficit so if you were Tanzania <pause dur="0.4"/> and you'd got problems with your trade balance and we'll see in a moment why you would have had problems with your trade balance <pause dur="0.9"/> if you were Tanzania in the in the early eighties with a with a with a trade <pause dur="0.2"/> balance deficit and you needed to finance it <pause dur="0.3"/> who would give you money <pause dur="1.1"/> none of the commercial banks gave any money to the developing world <pause dur="0.4"/> for the best part of ten years after the eighty-two debt crisis <pause dur="0.7"/> they got such a bad fright by the debt crisis they more or less ceased lending <pause dur="0.2"/> into the developing world <pause dur="0.6"/> so the only people who were lending money to governments in the developing world from eighty-two onwards <pause dur="0.5"/> were other governments <pause dur="0.2"/> other aid agencies and other multilateral agencies like the I-M-F <pause dur="0.2"/> and the World Bank <pause dur="0.9"/> and remarkably in the early nineteen-eighties <pause dur="0.7"/> there was an intellectual consensus which applied to all of the major 
aid donors <pause dur="1.9"/> called the Washington Consensus <pause dur="0.6"/> and the only aid donors who weren't <pause dur="0.4"/> fully signed up to the Washington Consensus <pause dur="0.6"/> were the Scandinavian aid donors and the Dutch <pause dur="0.9"/> and then your only other possible source of money anywhere in the world <pause dur="0.6"/> was the Soviet Union <pause dur="0.8"/> but the Soviet Union was in such trouble itself with its economy <pause dur="0.5"/> in the nineteen-eighties that there were really only about two or three countries in the world <pause dur="0.4"/> that the Soviet Union could could <trunc>s</trunc> give significant amounts of aid to <pause dur="0.5"/> one of course was Cuba <pause dur="0.6"/> the other was Nicaragua <pause dur="1.8"/> so if you were Tanzania in the early eighties <pause dur="0.2"/> you basically had to do a deal <pause dur="0.3"/> with the western aid donors <pause dur="0.4"/> and you wouldn't get money from the British the Germans the French or anybody else for that matter <pause dur="0.4"/> unless you could tell the aid mission <pause dur="0.3"/> yes <pause dur="0.2"/> we are in agreement with the I-M-F <pause dur="0.6"/> if you asked for money from the British for example <pause dur="0.4"/> the British would say well <pause dur="0.4"/> where do you stand on your negotiations with the I-M-F <pause dur="0.4"/> and if the I-M-F 
hadn't give Tanzania a clean bill of health <pause dur="0.4"/> don't even think about it <pause dur="0.4"/> sort yourself out with the I-M-F <pause dur="0.4"/> then we'll see what we can do for you <pause dur="1.0"/> so the I-M-F had got tremendous power <pause dur="0.4"/> in the nineteen-eighties country after country <pause dur="0.2"/> had to go to the I-M-F <pause dur="0.2"/> and we may say well why have these countries got a trade <pause dur="0.2"/> trade deficit <pause dur="0.6"/> well let's give you three reasons for severe macroeconomic problems in the developing world <pause dur="0.3"/> in the early eighties <pause dur="0.2"/> but <pause dur="0.6"/> Tanzania would be a an excellent example of this <pause dur="1.6"/> problem number one <pause dur="0.4"/> oil prices which had gone up nineteen-seventy-three were also hiked up in nineteen-seventy-nine <pause dur="1.0"/> now that price spike on oil <pause dur="0.2"/> prices didn't last long <pause dur="0.6"/> by about eighty-five oil prices were moving back down and moving back down rather quickly <pause dur="0.7"/> but for a few years in the early eighties anybody who imported oil <pause dur="0.2"/> your oil bill had just gone once again through the roof <pause dur="0.3"/> and that had pushed you into deficit <pause dur="1.4"/> reason number two <pause dur="0.5"/> primary commodity prices which peaked in the early 
nineteen-seventies <pause dur="0.6"/> were on their way down <pause dur="0.4"/> throughout the nineteen-eighties <pause dur="0.6"/> now we've got this on a graph somewhere if we can <pause dur="1.2"/><event desc="looks through transparencies" iterated="y" dur="35"/> find it # <pause dur="1.5"/> where is it <pause dur="4.3"/> it's in your notes <pause dur="4.3"/> at least i think it's in your notes <pause dur="0.7"/> i don't seem to have <pause dur="0.7"/> an overhead of it <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> is it in those notes <pause dur="10.6"/> no it isn't <pause dur="2.1"/> yes it is <pause dur="1.3"/><kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="5"/> there you go <pause dur="1.2"/> real commodity prices <pause dur="1.8"/> and if you look at those real commodity prices they peak in the early seventies <pause dur="0.9"/> # by the <trunc>en</trunc> by the <pause dur="0.6"/> nineteen-eighty <pause dur="0.4"/> they've shuffled back down <pause dur="1.1"/> and you can see that from eighty to eighty-eight they're on their way down down down <pause dur="1.5"/> so you've got countries in the developing world which have seen the price of their main exported commodities <pause dur="0.6"/> moving downwards <pause dur="1.3"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> and so you've got for any unit volume of exports <pause dur="0.3"/> you've got a reduced <pause dur="0.2"/> export earnings <pause dur="0.9"/> and then you've got the effects of <pause dur="1.1"/> stagnation <pause dur="0.2"/> depression <pause dur="0.2"/> and deflation <pause dur="0.7"/> in the industrialized countries these countries are all using monetarist policies <pause dur="0.3"/> they're growing rather slowly <pause dur="0.5"/> their import capacity has 
been reduced <pause dur="0.4"/> or is not growing as it did <pause dur="0.7"/> demand for imported primaries is going down and this is pushing down the primary price <pause dur="0.8"/> and at the same time <pause dur="0.3"/> there are politicians in these countries saying well we have to protect our domestic industries <pause dur="1.3"/> so you take a country like Bangladesh which in the <trunc>earl</trunc> in the eighties is developing its cotton industry <pause dur="0.5"/> and it finds its possibilities of exploiting cheap labour in cotton to for <pause dur="0.2"/> textile exports to Europe or the U-S-A <pause dur="0.4"/> is heavily circumscribed <pause dur="0.5"/> by the multifibre agreement <pause dur="0.5"/> which is a bit of trade protectionism <pause dur="0.4"/> which makes it very difficult for Bangladesh to export more than a certain quota of cotton textiles <pause dur="0.3"/> to the industrialized world <pause dur="0.3"/> so protectionism and reduced demand or or <trunc>s</trunc> or slowly growing demand <pause dur="0.4"/> in the north <pause dur="0.3"/> is making it ever more difficult to export <pause dur="0.3"/> from the developing world <pause dur="0.8"/> so you've got the trade deficit the falling commodity prices and difficulties of protection on the world trade scene <pause dur="0.6"/> hence <pause dur="0.3"/> 
most countries in the developing world <pause dur="0.4"/> well <pause dur="0.2"/> most countries many countries in the developing world <pause dur="0.5"/> have got severe trade deficits <pause dur="0.2"/> in the early eighties <pause dur="0.6"/> they're also running high rates of inflation and they're also many of them are running <pause dur="0.4"/> high rates of fiscal deficit <pause dur="0.2"/> in other words the government is spending a lot more money <pause dur="0.3"/> than it brings in <pause dur="0.3"/> in tax revenue <pause dur="1.2"/> and when we look at structural adjustment <pause dur="0.8"/> and you'll see it's set out on page ten <pause dur="0.8"/> we've got a package of measures <pause dur="0.5"/> which can conveniently be divided <pause dur="0.5"/> into demand side and supply side <pause dur="0.5"/> measures <pause dur="0.4"/> or perhaps more accurately divided into stabilization measures <pause dur="2.3"/> and supply side measures <pause dur="0.8"/> now your stabilization methods <pause dur="0.6"/> improve the balance of trade <pause dur="0.7"/> and do that by devaluing the currency <pause dur="1.6"/> reduce fiscal deficits <pause dur="0.3"/> and the main weapon to do that is just cut government spending <pause dur="1.3"/> and reduce inflation <pause dur="1.1"/> and for any monetarists that means controlling the money supply <pause dur="0.3"/> and above all that means allowing interest rates to rise to 
market <pause dur="0.2"/> clearing levels <pause dur="2.0"/> so macroeconomic stabilization is one demand side of structural adjustment <pause dur="0.9"/> the second side is an attempt to improve the conditions for growth <pause dur="0.6"/> and that is to be done <pause dur="0.2"/> through the efficient use of resources <pause dur="1.4"/> and there you have two elements of it <pause dur="0.3"/> take out price distortions <pause dur="1.3"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> and you remove price distortions by getting rid of the distortion on the exchange rate by devaluing <pause dur="0.5"/> get rid of excessive subsidies <pause dur="0.7"/> and get rid of any <pause dur="0.2"/> <trunc>partic</trunc> particularly onerous taxes <pause dur="1.0"/> now many developing countries for various social and political reasons have <pause dur="0.3"/> subsidies on things like food <pause dur="0.3"/> electricity <pause dur="0.3"/> urban transport <pause dur="0.8"/> sometimes the price of fuel <pause dur="0.3"/> in the agricultural sector fertilizers pesticides <pause dur="0.3"/> irrigation water <pause dur="0.9"/> the message from the I-M-F was all of those subsidies distort prices <pause dur="0.3"/> and lead to inefficient allocation of resources in the economy <pause dur="0.3"/> as well as costing the government a lot of money <pause dur="0.3"/> get rid of them <pause dur="0.3"/> get efficiency into the system <pause dur="0.7"/> cut 
onerous taxes <pause dur="1.2"/> where would you have found onerous taxes <pause dur="1.1"/> does anyone know this <pause dur="0.6"/> it isn't is it <pause dur="0.8"/> where would you have found peculiarly <pause dur="0.2"/> high rates of taxation <pause dur="0.6"/> in a country like Tanzania <pause dur="0.4"/> or in any other developing country in the early eighties <pause dur="1.6"/> there were people paying tax rates of forty fifty per cent <pause dur="0.2"/> who <pause dur="1.2"/> any idea <pause dur="5.8"/> counts as interesting </u><pause dur="1.0"/> <u who="sm0974" trans="pause"> would it be multinationals </u><pause dur="1.1"/> <u who="nm0969" trans="pause"> some multinationals might have got a banging off the tax systems on corporate taxes there <pause dur="0.4"/> certainly in the nineteen-seventies some countries had <pause dur="2.2"/> tax regimes and investment controls that <pause dur="0.3"/> that that that tried to restrict the activities of multinationals <pause dur="0.4"/> they might have but there's another significant group <pause dur="0.2"/> who were getting banged by the taxes <pause dur="2.5"/> the answer is small farmers <pause dur="0.5"/> small farmers <pause dur="0.6"/> you might say well small farmers paid no taxes <pause dur="0.7"/> well if you check out effective tax rates <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> on anybody exporting cocoa coffee <pause dur="0.2"/> palm oil cotton and so on <pause dur="0.6"/> there were various things going on in many developing countries that meant that 
export taxes on cash crops <pause dur="0.3"/> the main exports they got <pause dur="0.3"/> at the margin were very high indeed <pause dur="0.8"/> and the <pause dur="0.4"/> I-M-F and the World Bank looked at those and said well get those taxes down because they're a <pause dur="0.3"/> major disincentive <pause dur="0.4"/> to exporting <pause dur="3.6"/> of course there were countries in which the macroeconomic malaise was phenomenal <pause dur="0.8"/> where <pause dur="0.7"/> exchange rates were so overvalued <pause dur="0.7"/> that the domestic price of an exported good was barely worth <pause dur="0.4"/> sticking it in a handcart <pause dur="1.5"/> classic example is Ghana <pause dur="0.2"/> in the early nineteen-eighties when the cedi <pause dur="0.5"/> was overvalued by more than ten times <pause dur="0.4"/> hugely overvalued cedi <pause dur="0.6"/> what that meant was that if you were growing cocoa in southern Ghana <pause dur="0.6"/> which at that time was one of the world's biggest cocoa exporters <pause dur="1.2"/> when the cocoa was sold and it was sold at a dollar price and the dollar price was translated back into cedis because the cedi was so strong against the dollar <pause dur="0.3"/> you got very very few cedis in your hand <pause dur="0.7"/> and cocoa growers looked at it and said is that all i'm getting for a ton of cocoa <pause dur="0.8"/> 
hardly worth me growing the stuff hardly worth cutting it off the trees <pause dur="0.9"/> except of course for those Ghanaian farmers <pause dur="0.3"/> who did cut the cocoa off their trees <pause dur="0.5"/> but most certainly did not export it through Ghana <pause dur="0.5"/> suddenly in the early eighties there were very large increases <pause dur="0.3"/> in cocoa exports from the Cote d'Ivoire <pause dur="0.4"/> to the <pause dur="0.7"/> to the west <pause dur="0.4"/> and from # <pause dur="0.3"/> Togo <pause dur="0.4"/> to the east of Ghana <pause dur="0.5"/> and that was nothing to do with the farmers in those two other countries <pause dur="0.3"/> there was an awful lot of Ghanaian cocoa <pause dur="0.3"/> that <pause dur="0.2"/> walked across the border <pause dur="1.2"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> so those kinds of distortions on the exchange rate and pricing systems <pause dur="0.3"/> get rid of those go for <pause dur="0.4"/> efficient prices for best resource allocation <pause dur="0.7"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> big message here <pause dur="0.3"/> allow the markets to function <pause dur="0.8"/> during the nineteen-sixties and <trunc>s</trunc> nineteen-seventies many developing countries had governments <pause dur="0.3"/> that were very distrustful of market forces <pause dur="0.8"/> and you can understand that distrust in market forces <pause dur="0.3"/> remember in <trunc>nineteen-se</trunc> in the early seventies people were very worried about the unequalizing effects <pause dur="0.4"/> of rapid economic growth <pause dur="0.7"/> and people feared that free markets would lead to inequities <pause dur="0.3"/> and sought to control the markets in various ways <pause dur="0.4"/> 
by the early nineteen-eighties <pause dur="0.5"/> the Washington Consensus argued that the cost of controlling markets was very high <pause dur="0.9"/> # that markets might not be perfect but they were <pause dur="0.3"/> much preferable to government control <pause dur="0.7"/> and so the argument there was liberalize your markets allow people to trade to move government to move <pause dur="0.6"/> # goods and services around the economy to <pause dur="0.7"/> # access foreign exchange to access credit to set up business to reduce regulations <pause dur="0.3"/> and so on <pause dur="0.3"/> so as to allow maximum market enterprise <pause dur="0.4"/> within the economy <pause dur="2.3"/> and the final element of structural adjustment is institutional reform <pause dur="0.4"/> reform your economic institutions <pause dur="1.6"/> # two elements in here <pause dur="0.3"/> privatization <pause dur="1.0"/> many developing governments <pause dur="0.5"/> world governments had large parts of their <pause dur="0.6"/> <trunc>eco</trunc> economy <pause dur="0.3"/> in state hands <pause dur="0.5"/> operated by state corporations <pause dur="0.5"/> that often had many remits 
besides <pause dur="0.3"/> making a profit <pause dur="1.5"/> Tanzania was in dreadful trouble in the early nineteen-eighties one reason that Tanzania was in dreadful trouble in the nineteen-eighties <pause dur="0.4"/> was that all <pause dur="0.3"/> formal sector cereals marketing processing distribution <pause dur="0.4"/> was in the hands of a very large parastatal called the National Milling Corporation <pause dur="0.6"/> now the National Milling Corporation was told by the Tanzanian government <pause dur="0.5"/> collect <pause dur="0.5"/> maize <pause dur="0.3"/> down in the bottom left hand corner right hand corner anywhere in Tanzania at the same price <pause dur="0.4"/> as you collect that maize <pause dur="0.7"/> in places much closer to Dar es Salaam <pause dur="1.0"/> everywhere they had to buy up <pause dur="0.2"/> the maize at the same price <pause dur="0.6"/> everywhere i think they also were <pause dur="0.4"/> were forced to distribute fertilizer to maize growers <pause dur="0.4"/> at the same price <pause dur="1.1"/> what that meant was that places close to Dar es Salaam <pause dur="0.9"/> found that the prices they got were not that great for maize <pause dur="0.5"/> so they didn't deliver to the National Milling Corporation <pause dur="0.5"/> places at the far end of the country <pause dur="0.8"/> which previously <pause dur="0.4"/> had got <pause dur="0.5"/> a very 
poor price for maize because of their isolation and transport costs <pause dur="0.3"/> suddenly were offered a price for maize <pause dur="0.7"/> that more or less ignored the transport costs <pause dur="0.4"/> so they grew a lot more delivered it to the N-M-C <pause dur="0.3"/> and then the N-M-C had got eight-hundred kilometres of trucking this maize <pause dur="0.3"/> to the main consumption points <pause dur="0.6"/> not surprisingly <pause dur="0.3"/> the N-M-C began to run big deficits <pause dur="0.9"/> now as a public sector <trunc>c</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> # corporation <pause dur="0.3"/> entrusted with a key element in Tanzanian food security <pause dur="0.5"/> it could not go bust <pause dur="0.3"/> it had to continue operating <pause dur="1.3"/> the N-M-C had an account at the Central Bank in Tanzania <pause dur="0.5"/> and the account was in the red <pause dur="0.6"/> and they just ran <pause dur="0.2"/> bigger and bigger overdrafts <pause dur="1.0"/> now if you have a huge parastatal in your economy <pause dur="0.3"/> running up a very large overdraft <pause dur="0.3"/> on the Central Bank account <pause dur="0.4"/> what happens to your money supply <pause dur="3.0"/> public sector overdrafts at the Central Bank <pause dur="0.2"/> what's happening to your money supply <pause dur="1.4"/> what does it do to your money supply <pause dur="2.3"/> any idea <pause dur="2.9"/> well it expands it yeah <pause dur="0.2"/> this is money for free <pause dur="0.8"/> all that the 
Central Bank is saying is carry on writing cheques <pause dur="1.1"/> so the N-M-C is writing cheques creating shilingis in the Tanzanian economy <pause dur="0.6"/> the money supply is way out of control <pause dur="1.5"/> money supply's out of control so inflation is being pushed up <pause dur="0.6"/> nominal rate of the Tanzanian shilingi is pegged <pause dur="1.5"/> and if your inflation is faster than world inflation and your nominal exchange rate is pegged <pause dur="0.4"/> what happens to your real exchange rate <pause dur="3.3"/> goes up <pause dur="0.8"/> your real exchange rate is going up shilingi is getting stronger against the dollar <pause dur="0.3"/> year in <pause dur="0.2"/> year out the degree of overvaluation gets greater <pause dur="0.4"/> so what does that then mean for a Tanzanian grower of cotton or a Tanzanian grower of coffee <pause dur="0.4"/> what it means is in an inflated economy <pause dur="0.4"/> you're getting the same number of shilingis for your cocoa <pause dur="0.3"/> for your for your coffee and your cotton <pause dur="0.3"/> this year <pause dur="0.3"/> as you did <pause dur="0.2"/> two three years ago <pause dur="0.6"/> inflation has eroded the value of those shilingis the real price to you <pause dur="0.3"/> in shilingis <pause dur="0.5"/> of your coffee <pause dur="0.4"/> and your cotton <pause dur="0.7"/> is going down <pause dur="0.4"/> 
right <pause dur="0.6"/> same things are happening in Ghana in the early nineteen-eighties <pause dur="0.7"/> so <pause dur="0.7"/> the operation of your large <pause dur="0.2"/> parastatal <pause dur="0.5"/> is snookering the whole economy <pause dur="0.9"/> there's a whole series of vicious effects here <pause dur="0.5"/> which push you into a bigger and bigger mess <pause dur="0.7"/> not surprisingly <pause dur="0.6"/> the I-M-F and the World Bank looked at this kind of thing and said <pause dur="0.3"/> for heaven's sake privatize these state enterprises <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> they're doing you no good at all <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> they're probably inefficient <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> well it's not obvious that they were all inefficient but the general feeling was that government was inefficient <pause dur="0.4"/> and they're messing up your economy in all kinds of ways <pause dur="0.9"/> they also wanted key economic institutions reforming <pause dur="0.6"/> and those included the tax system <pause dur="1.0"/> where the basic message was <pause dur="0.9"/> broaden your tax base <pause dur="0.6"/> and lower the tax rates <pause dur="1.1"/> # if you have a wider <pause dur="0.2"/> tax capture you can bring down the rates <pause dur="0.4"/> which was regarded as a stimulus to <trunc>in</trunc> <trunc>in</trunc> investment <pause dur="1.0"/> and also reform your financial sectors <pause dur="0.7"/> get yourself an efficient competitive 
financial sector <pause dur="0.4"/> very <trunc>ve</trunc> often meant privatizing banks <pause dur="0.2"/> and reducing state control of the banking system <pause dur="0.4"/> yeah <pause dur="2.1"/> which was the first Third World country <pause dur="0.4"/> to go for a fully liberalized banking system <pause dur="0.8"/> anybody know <pause dur="1.7"/> there was one country which ten years before this <pause dur="0.7"/> went for a big experiment in all of these policies and liberalized its bank system <pause dur="0.5"/> before almost any other country in the developing world did <pause dur="3.9"/> any idea <pause dur="2.3"/> Chile <pause dur="1.6"/> Pinochet's coup of nineteen-seventy-three <pause dur="0.8"/> brought to power in <pause dur="0.2"/> in Chile not just a dictatorship <pause dur="0.6"/> but a supply side monetarist set of <pause dur="0.2"/> economic advisers <pause dur="0.4"/> known as the Chicago Boys <pause dur="0.7"/> all <pause dur="0.2"/> ex-pupils from the University of Chicago where they'd been taught monetarism <pause dur="0.4"/> and free market economics <pause dur="0.3"/> implemented in Chile from seventy-three onwards ten years before it was done in the rest <pause dur="0.3"/> of the developing world <pause dur="0.3"/> fully liberalized financial sector <pause dur="0.9"/> in Chile from the mid-seventies onwards <pause dur="1.0"/> has anybody ever heard of what happened to the Chilean financial system in <pause dur="0.2"/> about nineteen-eighty-one <pause dur="1.6"/> collapsed <pause dur="0.9"/> massive bank failures huge bailout problems <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> totally liberalized bank sectors 
are a disaster <pause dur="1.8"/> nobody in this room will <pause dur="0.2"/> probably have any knowledge of what happened in the Midwest of the U-S-A in <trunc>n</trunc> in in <pause dur="0.5"/> during the first Reagan administration <pause dur="1.7"/> where the savings and loans trusts <pause dur="0.2"/> things a bit like the British <trunc>bo</trunc> building societies <pause dur="0.5"/> were deregulated by the Federal Reserve Bank <pause dur="0.7"/> and <pause dur="0.3"/> just told to do finance any way they like <pause dur="0.7"/> with the result <pause dur="0.2"/> that the losses in the savings and loans institutions <pause dur="0.5"/> were colossal <pause dur="0.6"/> i think we're talking trillions of dollars on losses in the savings and loans scandals of the nineteen-eighties <pause dur="0.7"/> fully liberalized financial systems are very very dangerous <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="2.0"/> so there are one or two experiences that pushed that too far but the general idea was to <trunc>dereguli</trunc> <pause dur="0.4"/> regulate <pause dur="0.3"/> and get more efficient financial institutions <pause dur="1.8"/> now those are the elements of structural adjustment <pause dur="1.0"/> what you'll find on the next couple of pages of your handout <pause dur="1.7"/> 'cause you'll find some of the problems <pause dur="0.2"/> involved in structural adjustment <pause dur="3.8"/> we're not going to go through 
all of the problems involved in structural adjustment it's a very big topic <pause dur="0.5"/> but let me give you three elements of structural adjustment which are <pause dur="0.2"/> really big problems <pause dur="1.6"/> the first is that <pause dur="0.2"/> when you look at the macroeconomic stabilization measures <pause dur="0.4"/> such as raising interest rates <pause dur="0.3"/> and cutting government spending <pause dur="0.6"/> these are severely <pause dur="0.2"/> deflationary measures <pause dur="0.4"/> they will reduce aggregate demand in the economy <pause dur="0.7"/> they will lead to business failures they will lead to unemployment they will lead to less business activity <pause dur="1.9"/> and those deflationary elements <pause dur="0.4"/> the creation of unemployment <pause dur="0.6"/> loss of demand in the economy and reduced economic <pause dur="0.6"/> # activity <pause dur="0.3"/> are major elements there which led people to criticize <pause dur="0.4"/> # structural adjustment as a set of measures <pause dur="0.4"/> that would increase poverty in the developing world <pause dur="1.7"/> now the I-M-F said okay there are deflationary sides side to it <pause dur="0.4"/> but there are supply side measures in there <pause dur="0.2"/> which will get your economy growing <pause dur="0.3"/> and any pain that there is in 
structural adjustment <pause dur="0.2"/> will be strictly temporary <pause dur="0.7"/> now that leads us to the second problem <pause dur="1.2"/> big problem of structural adjustment <pause dur="0.7"/> and that is <pause dur="0.4"/> that structural adjustment is usually not sequenced ideally <pause dur="2.3"/> now in a variant on how many economists does it take to change a light bulb <pause dur="0.5"/> # how many <pause dur="0.3"/> people does it <trunc>t</trunc> take to devalue the currency <pause dur="0.3"/> of a country <pause dur="1.3"/> apologies to those of you who've heard this at least twice before <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> how many people does it take to devalue you've got nominal exchange rates <pause dur="0.3"/> have i done this even with the undergrads <pause dur="1.0"/> now you're smiling as though <trunc>yo</trunc> i did it last week i <trunc>m</trunc> might have done it last week <pause dur="0.8"/> okay <pause dur="0.9"/> look if you have nominal exchange rates i mean these days most countries have now got free exchange rates but in the days that you announced the exchange rate <pause dur="0.4"/> how many people does it take <pause dur="0.6"/> and how long does it take <pause dur="0.4"/> to devalue <pause dur="0.2"/> a country's 
currency <pause dur="7.4"/> any idea <pause dur="5.3"/> no no idea <pause dur="1.7"/> who would have to make the decision <pause dur="2.6"/> you're in Ghana in the early nineteen-eighties and you've decided the cedi is <trunc>w</trunc> <trunc>w</trunc> way overvalued it's ten cedis to the dollar and it should be <pause dur="0.3"/> a hundred cedis to the dollar fine <pause dur="0.3"/> who's going to take that decision <pause dur="1.6"/> who do you need to take a decision like that <pause dur="4.6"/> no <pause dur="5.0"/> okay <pause dur="0.4"/> the answer is <pause dur="0.8"/> you <pause dur="0.2"/> you probably need your Minister of Finance your Chancellor of the Exchequer <pause dur="0.3"/> you probably need the Governor of the Central Bank <pause dur="1.0"/> and you'll probably have to consult senior cabinet colleagues or the President of the country <pause dur="1.3"/> so that's what two or three <pause dur="0.3"/> high ranking decision makers <pause dur="0.5"/> and a typist <pause dur="1.0"/> right <pause dur="1.4"/> how long does it take to devalue about five minutes yes <pause dur="0.9"/> as long as you've reached agreement that you're going to do takes five minutes <pause dur="0.5"/> that's all the time it takes to to to write out the press announcement that says as from today <pause dur="0.2"/> the government of Ghana redefines the cedi from ten <pause dur="0.5"/> cedis to the dollar to a hundred cedis to 
the dollar or whatever it is yeah <pause dur="0.9"/> takes five minutes and takes about three people to make the decision <pause dur="0.4"/> similarly if you want to cut the government budget <pause dur="0.9"/> you know how quickly can you do that how many people are involved <pause dur="0.6"/> well it's maybe a couple of dozen technicians in the Ministry of Finance go through the government budget with a red pencil <pause dur="0.3"/> reduce the budgets <pause dur="0.4"/> takes one week at most <pause dur="0.3"/> yeah <pause dur="1.1"/> how long on the other hand does it take <pause dur="0.2"/> to privatize <pause dur="0.3"/> a big state enterprise <pause dur="0.5"/> yeah <pause dur="1.9"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> those of you who lived through the British privatizations of the nineteen-eighties <pause dur="0.7"/> privatizations of British Gas British Telecom and so on <pause dur="0.3"/> even in this country took an army of people to do <pause dur="1.1"/> advertizing tendering <pause dur="0.2"/> recruiting shareholders producing documents <pause dur="0.3"/> deciding the form of privatization <pause dur="0.3"/> deciding what price you should try and sell things off <pause dur="0.3"/> it's a huge business <pause dur="0.3"/> you need an army of civil servants for this <pause dur="0.6"/> Nicaragua in nineteen-eighty <pause dur="1.2"/> decided to privatize <pause dur="0.3"/> the major state enterprises <pause dur="0.3"/> 
Nicaragua's a very small country <pause dur="0.6"/> when it <pause dur="0.3"/> drew up a list of state enterprises there were three-hundred-and-fifty to be privatized yes <pause dur="1.1"/> now think of all the legal documentation and all of the technical work in privatizing <pause dur="0.3"/> those three-hundred-and-fifty <pause dur="0.2"/> enterprises <pause dur="0.3"/> it's years and years of work <pause dur="0.5"/> it took Mrs Thatcher a decade to privatize what <pause dur="0.5"/> the dozen or so biggest <pause dur="0.9"/> public sector utilities in this country <pause dur="0.8"/> and that took <pause dur="0.8"/> huge resources <pause dur="1.3"/> so for a developing country to privatize <pause dur="0.2"/> it's <trunc>i</trunc> it's a mountain of work <pause dur="0.4"/> similarly if you're trying to liberalize parts of your market economy <pause dur="0.3"/> where you previously had lots of regulations <pause dur="0.5"/> and where you don't want to just rip away everything overnight <pause dur="0.7"/> # there's a lot of technical work there <pause dur="0.3"/> now the point i'm making is that the stabilization measures <pause dur="0.3"/> you can do them very quickly you can cut governments <trunc>ra</trunc> <pause dur="0.3"/> you can cut government 
spending rather quickly <pause dur="0.3"/> you can raise interest rates rather quickly <pause dur="0.4"/> the supply side liberalization measures <pause dur="0.3"/> the reforms of banking tax systems privatizations <pause dur="0.4"/> these take years to do <pause dur="0.8"/> so you've got a lag between those things that tend to deflate your economy <pause dur="0.6"/> and those things that give a stimulus to your economy <pause dur="0.6"/> and that lag can be quite a long lag it can be five years or more <pause dur="0.8"/> so it's no surprise to see that <pause dur="0.4"/> devaluation what the I-M-F claimed would be very short term pain <pause dur="0.6"/> has proved to be at least medium term <pause dur="0.3"/> if not long term pain <pause dur="0.7"/> and indeed for many countries you'd say <pause dur="0.3"/> where is the <trunc>e</trunc> where is the light at the end of the tunnel <pause dur="1.7"/> and here's a third problem with with structural adjustment </u><gap reason="break in recording" extent="uncertain"/> <u who="nm0969" trans="pause"> 
now you go to Tanzania and you say that <pause dur="0.3"/> and you go to Uganda and say that <pause dur="0.7"/> and then you say the same thing in the Cote d'Ivoire <pause dur="0.7"/> and you say the same thing in Colombia <pause dur="0.6"/> and in Costa Rica <pause dur="0.4"/> and El Salvador <pause dur="0.3"/> and Guatemala <pause dur="0.4"/> and Indonesia <pause dur="1.9"/> and so on <pause dur="0.3"/> yeah <pause dur="0.9"/> now it makes an awful lot of sense <pause dur="0.5"/> for <pause dur="0.4"/> an El Salvador or a Kenya <pause dur="0.5"/> to export more coffee <pause dur="0.5"/> earn more foreign exchange <pause dur="1.1"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="3"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> and balance its trade <pause dur="0.6"/> but what happens if all countries producing coffee <pause dur="0.3"/> all produce <pause dur="0.2"/> more coffee <pause dur="0.3"/> at the same time <pause dur="1.1"/> well <pause dur="0.2"/> against a demand schedule which is not that elastic <pause dur="0.6"/> the price will go down <pause dur="1.0"/> now that <pause dur="0.3"/> diagram that was in the notes of falling <pause dur="0.2"/> primary commodity prices <pause dur="0.5"/> one of the elements behind that fall in commodity prices <pause dur="0.4"/> were the efforts of countries under structural adjustment <pause dur="0.3"/> to increase the volumes <pause dur="0.3"/> of primary exports <pause dur="0.6"/> so <pause dur="0.5"/> an argument that makes perfect sense for one country <pause dur="1.1"/> isn't necessarily a good argument for all countries at the same time <pause dur="0.6"/> now that <trunc>argum</trunc> that that problem with the argument is known as the 
fallacy of composition <pause dur="1.1"/> composition <trunc>agg</trunc> added all together in aggregate <pause dur="0.3"/> it isn't good advice <pause dur="0.2"/> for any given country at any one moment it is good advice <pause dur="0.4"/> but then all countries were given the same <pause dur="0.4"/> advice at the same time <pause dur="6.6"/> now look on <pause dur="0.2"/> page nine <pause dur="0.2"/> you've got a little box called the Washington Consensus <pause dur="2.7"/> and this was an intellectual consensus built up in the early nineteen-eighties about what development policy should be <pause dur="1.7"/> and it's called the Washington Consensus because Washington is where you'll find the World Bank <pause dur="0.5"/> the International Monetary Fund <pause dur="0.8"/> # and you'll also find the Inter-American Development Bank and you'll also <trunc>s</trunc> find the U-S government <pause dur="0.8"/> now all of the <pause dur="1.7"/> well not all but <pause dur="0.2"/> many of the <pause dur="0.6"/> people defining policy in Washington in the early eighties very powerful people <pause dur="0.5"/> came to the same conclusions about what good policy would be <pause dur="0.3"/> in the developing world <pause dur="0.3"/> and there it is listed point by point <pause dur="0.6"/> let's have a look what we've got there <pause dur="0.7"/> a balanced fiscal budget government 
spends only as much as it takes in <pause dur="0.5"/> tight government spending controls <pause dur="0.3"/> broad based tax with low marginal tax rates <pause dur="0.9"/> reform your prices to market based prices <pause dur="0.4"/> make real interest rates positive <pause dur="0.6"/> get yourself a stable exchange rate <pause dur="1.5"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> trade liberalization and encouragement of <pause dur="0.2"/> foreign <pause dur="1.1"/> direct foreign investment foreign direct investment <pause dur="1.7"/> there's terrific change in fashions from the early seventies to the early eighties <pause dur="0.3"/> regarding multinational companies <pause dur="0.5"/> and <pause dur="0.3"/> foreign direct investment <pause dur="1.1"/> in the early nineteen-seventies people were very wary of the big <pause dur="0.3"/> multinational corporations believing that they were exploitative <pause dur="0.6"/> and through transfer pricing mechanisms <pause dur="0.4"/> were taking out bigger profits from the developing world <pause dur="0.3."/> than they should have been <pause dur="0.8"/> transfer pricing is where you have <pause dur="0.4"/> a local subsidiary of a major multinational <pause dur="0.8"/> and what you do with this <pause dur="0.3"/> is you <pause dur="0.3"/> the transfer prices as you <pause dur="0.8"/> transfer goods <pause dur="0.3"/> between elements of the same corporation <pause dur="0.5"/> you set the prices internally to your company <pause dur="0.4"/> so that you 
only make profits <pause dur="0.3"/> in countries <pause dur="0.9"/> which have low tax regimes yes <pause dur="1.4"/> now if you set this up well <pause dur="0.5"/> you can have a global corporation that makes very little profit <pause dur="0.4"/> in countries like Germany and Japan <pause dur="0.9"/> or Sweden <pause dur="0.7"/> and suddenly makes a fortune in the Cayman Islands yeah <pause dur="0.7"/> tiny part of the company makes a fortune in the Cayman Islands <pause dur="0.3"/> well it was never that naked <pause dur="0.6"/> but <pause dur="1.1"/> what you got your tax lawyers to do it was alleged was to make sure that you <pause dur="0.3"/> rack up your profits <pause dur="0.4"/> where the tax rates are specially low <pause dur="0.4"/> yeah <pause dur="0.8"/> so you pay very little tax in Sweden <pause dur="0.3"/> and then on your big profits in the places where you've got a lot of profit then <pause dur="0.6"/> you pay very little tax on that <pause dur="1.0"/> and we know how there i mean that game with taxes <pause dur="0.2"/> exploiting the possibilities of <pause dur="0.3"/> realizing your profits in low tax havens <pause dur="0.4"/> is why everybody today knows that some of the richest people in the world <pause dur="0.5"/> pay no tax <pause dur="0.8"/> now is that true <pause dur="0.5"/> that it's commonly alleged that the richest people in the world <pause dur="0.3"/> pay next to no tax yes <pause dur="0.5"/> they live in 
strange places <pause dur="0.5"/> they can't spend too much time in any one <pause dur="0.5"/> one of the major cities of the world <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> they have <pause dur="0.2"/> unusual nationalities <pause dur="0.3"/> unusual residences <pause dur="0.4"/> and pay next to no tax on phenomenally high earnings <pause dur="0.2"/> this is what we're told <pause dur="0.4"/> well in back in nineteen-seventy <trunc>th</trunc> this was a big fear <pause dur="0.4"/> and many governments put a lot of control on multinational organizations <pause dur="4.3"/> # <pause dur="2.5"/> by the time you get to the nineteen-eighties <pause dur="0.4"/> those ideas have been blown away <pause dur="1.7"/> because what people are saying by the nineteen-eighties is they're saying hey <pause dur="1.2"/> if you want <pause dur="0.2"/> to have something happen in a country <pause dur="0.4"/> maybe you can do it by a government parastatal <pause dur="0.5"/> but maybe that government parastatal will be inefficient <pause dur="0.4"/> and if it makes losses <pause dur="0.3"/> it'll borrow from the Central Bank <pause dur="1.0"/> expand the money supply <pause dur="0.3"/> and create problems for you <pause dur="1.0"/> on the other hand <pause dur="0.6"/> if you will give it this out as a franchise <pause dur="0.4"/> to some multinational company <pause dur="0.5"/> they can only <pause dur="1.3"/> # they can only operate if they make profits they have to be efficient <pause dur="0.8"/> and if they make 
profits this isn't going to cost your country anything <pause dur="1.1"/> and instead of getting debt from overseas <pause dur="0.5"/> to put into state investments that might go bad <pause dur="0.4"/> how about foreign direct investment <pause dur="0.7"/> because when one of the big corporations comes to invest in your country <pause dur="0.6"/> you don't have debt <pause dur="0.9"/> there's no reason to pay back the investment capital <pause dur="0.3"/> sure you'll have repatriated profits <pause dur="0.3"/> but that's only if the investment's successful <pause dur="0.5"/> if something goes wrong <pause dur="0.4"/> well the corporation loses not the country <pause dur="0.7"/> so by the early eighties you got a <trunc>f</trunc> you got a set of arguments saying <pause dur="0.4"/> foreign investment is a very good thing <pause dur="0.5"/> encouraging <pause dur="0.5"/> get rid of <pause dur="0.2"/> get rid of debt <pause dur="0.5"/> bring in foreign investment <pause dur="5.7"/> what else have we got in there in the <pause dur="0.2"/> Washington Consensus <pause dur="1.3"/> # <pause dur="0.8"/> a consensus in favour of privatizing state enterprise <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="0.9"/> get the state out of it <pause dur="0.2"/> on the grounds that states are likely to be inefficient <pause dur="0.7"/> and on the grounds that state enterprises are likely to be managed for as many political objectives as economic objectives <pause dur="1.1"/> 
deregulate your markets including the labour market <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> this is back to the nineteen-thirties <pause dur="0.4"/> if there's a problem of unemployment <pause dur="0.8"/> let the wages go down to a market clearing level <pause dur="1.7"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> sound macroeconomic policy in command <pause dur="0.7"/> and some rudimentary social safety nets if there are problems of poverty <pause dur="0.4"/> during adjustment <pause dur="0.5"/> throw a bit of money at the problem <pause dur="1.8"/> the World Bank also argued at the same time for investments in human capital <pause dur="0.5"/> for reasons that we will see <pause dur="0.3"/> in a few moments <pause dur="1.9"/> # and in timing stabilize before you create <pause dur="0.4"/> the conditions for growth <pause dur="1.8"/> now that's the Washington Consensus it's about macroeconomic stability and it's about trying to get a supply side <pause dur="0.3"/> market based miracle <pause dur="0.3"/> for economic growth <pause dur="4.2"/> now what do we need to say for the nineteen-eighties <pause dur="0.3"/> about agriculture <pause dur="1.6"/> this is really a story in the nineteen-eighties the big stories <pause dur="0.4"/> are about macroeconomic phenomena <pause dur="1.5"/> it's extraordinary how quickly the ideas of the early nineteen-seventies stressing equity stressing 
reaching the poorest <pause dur="0.4"/> had put agriculture <pause dur="0.3"/> top of the bill <pause dur="1.3"/> in less than ten years <pause dur="0.3"/> agriculture has been wiped out <pause dur="0.3"/> from the policy agenda <pause dur="0.3"/> in favour of macroeconomic concerns <pause dur="0.4"/> of the early nineteen-eighties <pause dur="0.5"/> and agriculture is now seen as nothing special to any other sector <pause dur="0.6"/> if anything's going to happen in agriculture <pause dur="0.3"/> base it on the market <pause dur="0.4"/> base it on efficiency <pause dur="1.9"/> but when people looked at agriculture <pause dur="0.6"/> they saw <pause dur="0.2"/> one major problem that was going on <pause dur="0.7"/><event desc="puts away screen" iterated="n"/> and that was this <pause dur="3.7"/> <event desc="turns off overhead projector" iterated="n"/> the problem of <pause dur="3.1"/><gap reason="inaudible" extent="2 secs"/> okay <pause dur="0.5"/> the problem of negative protection <pause dur="5.5"/> <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="6"/> 
and this is a very very simple argument <pause dur="1.3"/> what was argued <pause dur="0.5"/> was that <pause dur="0.9"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="6"/> you there's your agricultural supply curve <pause dur="1.0"/> quantity and price <pause dur="1.2"/> then <pause dur="0.2"/> in far too many developing countries <pause dur="0.8"/> what you got <pause dur="0.6"/> was negative protection <pause dur="1.1"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="7"/> and whereas <pause dur="0.2"/> that would be <pause dur="0.6"/> a market price <pause dur="1.2"/> delivering <pause dur="0.4"/> an output of <pause dur="0.6"/> O-A <pause dur="1.7"/> what you got in many countries <pause dur="0.4"/> was prices <pause dur="0.4"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="9"/> artificially depressed <pause dur="0.2"/> by government policy <pause dur="1.8"/> to a point here <pause dur="3.6"/> with a corresponding reduction <pause dur="0.2"/> in output <pause dur="2.6"/> now you look at that and you say well what government in their right mind <pause dur="0.6"/> would reduce <pause dur="0.3"/> agricultural prices <pause dur="0.4"/> and thereby suppress production <pause dur="0.4"/> that can't be a good thing <pause dur="1.2"/> but think about it <pause dur="0.3"/> any country that was worried for example <pause dur="0.3"/> about the price of urban food <pause dur="0.7"/> you might try and control the <trunc>froo</trunc> the food price <pause dur="0.5"/> on behalf of urban workers <pause dur="0.5"/> in the desire to keep down wages <pause dur="0.4"/> for your industrialization process <pause dur="1.2"/> you might be taxing your export <pause dur="0.2"/> crops very heavily <pause dur="0.4"/> because that's 
the only government revenue you've got in the country <pause dur="0.5"/> is is is to tax the <pause dur="0.3"/> the agricultural export <pause dur="0.4"/> taxing your exports effectively brings down the price <pause dur="2.4"/> now those things were fairly obvious to most governments <pause dur="0.2"/> what was less obvious to most governments <pause dur="0.4"/> was the impact of an overvalued exchange rate <pause dur="0.8"/> and if you overvalue your exchange rate <pause dur="0.4"/> you hurt your agriculture in two directions <pause dur="0.5"/> first any export crops you've got <pause dur="1.4"/> earn less <pause dur="0.6"/> than they would <pause dur="0.2"/> if you've got <pause dur="0.2"/> a free market exchange rate <pause dur="0.4"/> you end up with less local currency per dollar earned in your hand <pause dur="0.4"/> than you otherwise would <pause dur="0.4"/> and you put downward pressure <pause dur="0.5"/> on the prices of any export crops <pause dur="0.9"/> but you also put downward pressure <pause dur="0.3"/> on any food crops any domestic crops <pause dur="0.9"/> why <pause dur="1.2"/> because imports get cheap <pause dur="0.3"/> under an overvalued exchange rate <pause dur="1.2"/> a lot # a little of the local currency will buy plenty of dollars <pause dur="0.3"/> and it makes imported food cheap <pause dur="0.3"/> and brings down your <pause dur="0.2"/> overall price level <pause dur="1.3"/> so indirectly through things like the exchange rate <pause dur="0.4"/> you're bringing 
down <pause dur="0.2"/> the price <pause dur="0.8"/> and because you're bringing down the price <pause dur="0.2"/> you're taking away the incentive from agriculture <pause dur="1.6"/> faced by this analysis <pause dur="0.4"/> the World Bank spent most of the nineteen-eighties <pause dur="0.4"/> telling people looking at agriculture policy <pause dur="0.4"/> get the negative protection <pause dur="0.2"/> out of agriculture <pause dur="0.8"/> and you will deliver a major incentive <pause dur="0.7"/> to producers <pause dur="0.6"/> which will <pause dur="0.6"/> largely correct problems you've got of insufficient food production <pause dur="0.3"/> insufficient export crop production <pause dur="0.3"/> whatever <pause dur="1.2"/> so that was the particular message above all else that was given <pause dur="0.3"/> for the agriculture sector <pause dur="0.5"/> get negative protection out there it's a market based measure <pause dur="0.4"/> about <pause dur="0.2"/> the peculiarly <vocal desc="cough" n="sm0975" iterated="n"/> <pause dur="0.3"/><gap reason="inaudible due to background noise" extent="1 word"/> effects <pause dur="0.3"/> or price discrimination <pause dur="0.8"/> upon agriculture <pause dur="11.2"/> okay <pause dur="3.1"/> nineteen-eighties <pause dur="1.1"/> # <pause dur="2.5"/> what have we got <pause dur="0.2"/> during the <pause dur="0.3"/> nineteen-nineties <pause dur="2.0"/> well ideas haven't changed a lot <pause dur="0.5"/> between the eighties and the nineties and <pause dur="0.4"/> current day <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> the Washington Consensus <pause dur="0.7"/> is still largely intact <pause dur="2.1"/> during the nineteen-nineties <pause dur="0.6"/> 
changing ideas about development <pause dur="0.6"/><kinesic desc="turns on overhead projector showing transparency" iterated="n"/> were much influenced by <pause dur="2.2"/> an examination of the historical record <pause dur="0.5"/> for one part for the world <pause dur="1.7"/> and that is during the nineties people looked to what had happened in the developing world over the previous decade <pause dur="0.6"/> and said <pause dur="0.4"/> structural adjustment in the nineteen-eighties were a lot of misery in Africa <pause dur="1.1"/> Africa's per caput <pause dur="0.5"/> G-D-P earnings <pause dur="0.4"/> went down <pause dur="0.3"/> for most countries during the nineteen-<pause dur="0.4"/>eighties <pause dur="0.4"/> quite badly down for some some groups of people <pause dur="0.5"/> Latin America stood still <pause dur="0.3"/> or went backwards <pause dur="0.9"/> but one part of the world saw <pause dur="0.3"/> incredibly fast growth rates <pause dur="0.3"/> and as we mentioned last week <pause dur="1.3"/> that was East Asia <pause dur="1.5"/> # south China <pause dur="0.2"/> Hong Kong Singapore Korea <pause dur="0.2"/> but increasingly Indonesia Thailand Malaysia <pause dur="0.3"/> all of these countries <pause dur="0.2"/> grew very quickly indeed <pause dur="1.4"/> and they grew they were the fastest growing part of the world economy <pause dur="0.7"/> the British economy the American economy the German economy <pause dur="0.4"/> didn't do that well in the nineteen-eighties <pause dur="0.3"/> it was hesitate hesitant growth <pause dur="0.6"/> East Asia on 
the other hand <pause dur="0.3"/> was growing very quickly indeed <pause dur="1.0"/> and that led people in the in the nineteen-nineties to sort of say well <pause dur="0.3"/> what did these guys get so very right <pause dur="0.8"/> what was what was the wonder element <pause dur="0.4"/> that allowed these countries to grow very quickly <pause dur="0.4"/> when other parts weren't <pause dur="1.3"/> and a lot of time was spent in the nineteen-nineties trying to interpret the so-called East Asian miracle <pause dur="1.8"/> there are big disputes about the extent to which the East Asian miracle <pause dur="0.3"/> shows that market <trunc>liberaliza</trunc> liberalism works <pause dur="0.8"/> particularly when you realize that one of these countries is China <pause dur="0.5"/> with a highly controlled economy indeed <pause dur="0.7"/> the Japanese have never run <pause dur="0.3"/> a purely free market economy <pause dur="0.5"/> neither have the Koreans <pause dur="0.7"/> on the other hand <pause dur="0.5"/> Singapore <pause dur="0.3"/> Hong Kong <pause dur="0.6"/> were swashbuckling free market capitalism <pause dur="0.9"/> so there were debates about the extent to which state intervention in the free market <pause dur="0.4"/> pushed forward the East Asian miracle <pause dur="1.2"/> but nobody disagreed about one element of the East Asian miracle <pause dur="0.5"/> and that was investment in 
people <pause dur="1.2"/> country after country in East Asia it was argued <pause dur="0.4"/> had undertaken <pause dur="0.3"/> reasonably equitable investments in health care <pause dur="0.5"/> education <pause dur="0.3"/> and training <pause dur="0.5"/> of people in those countries <pause dur="0.9"/> and it was argued that this was a major stimulus to industrialization in this area <pause dur="0.4"/> that you could always hire <pause dur="0.5"/> a lot of people at low labour rates <pause dur="0.3"/> but who were in reasonably good health <pause dur="0.6"/> who were literate and had reasonable skills <pause dur="0.6"/> and that that was a difference between East Asia for example <pause dur="0.3"/> and Africa and Latin America <pause dur="0.9"/> or a difference for that matter between East Asia <pause dur="0.2"/> and South Asia <pause dur="1.9"/> India for example has concentrated its educational spending <pause dur="0.3"/> on elite facilities <pause dur="0.6"/> with the result that India has more PhDs than any country on Earth <pause dur="0.4"/> far more than the Chinese <pause dur="0.9"/> # <pause dur="0.9"/> it was argued in China on the other hand <pause dur="0.4"/> the distribution of education had been much broader with the result that this large <pause dur="0.7"/> set of people who'd been in the Chinese countryside with relatively low marginal products <pause dur="0.8"/> as i said last week 
this is the Lewis argument <pause dur="0.4"/> had moved into <pause dur="0.8"/> export processing zones and <trunc>con</trunc> and and <pause dur="0.6"/> and # <pause dur="1.8"/> manufacturing industry in Shanghai Canton Fujian the coastal area of South China <pause dur="0.9"/> and were highly employable <pause dur="1.0"/> # in ways that you couldn't do quite the same <pause dur="0.4"/> out of rural India <pause dur="1.5"/> so there was a lot of interest there in in in human capital <pause dur="0.4"/> and the advantages of investing in people <pause dur="9.2"/> now there's plenty more we can say about the <pause dur="0.3"/> <trunc>ni</trunc> the nineties <pause dur="0.7"/> and there are parts of this story which we still need to revisit <pause dur="0.7"/> and then there's all of the rest of the stuff that i hoped we might have had a a go at today <pause dur="0.9"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> what we're going to have to do is # put the whole sequence of these talks backwards once <pause dur="0.8"/> next week we'll be continuing with this because we'll need at least another session to get through it <pause dur="0.7"/> # before we get to the <pause dur="0.5"/> land talks <pause dur="2.0"/> so next week we'll carry on with this one
