<u who="nm1158"> <kinesic desc="overhead projector is on showing transparency" iterated="n"/> yesterday i <pause dur="0.2"/> i started to introduce a a a <pause dur="0.2"/> a a large number of quite difficult concepts and ideas to you <pause dur="0.4"/> # the idea of a a tenure <pause dur="0.7"/> a historical system of <trunc>landown</trunc> landowning in this country and how it developed <pause dur="0.7"/> the idea <pause dur="0.2"/> that flowed from that <pause dur="0.5"/> that it was impossible for people directly to own land <pause dur="0.7"/> so <pause dur="0.3"/> lawyers had invented <pause dur="0.2"/> this idea of the estate <pause dur="0.4"/> the abstract concept <pause dur="0.4"/> an estate <pause dur="0.5"/> which defines rights and interests in land <pause dur="0.5"/> it is the estate <pause dur="0.4"/> that <pause dur="0.8"/> people own <pause dur="2.0"/> i went on to look <pause dur="0.2"/> at the idea of <pause dur="0.2"/> possession <pause dur="0.5"/> being of fundamental <pause dur="0.2"/> importance <pause dur="0.9"/> in the English law <pause dur="0.8"/> and the concept of title <pause dur="1.1"/> as being <pause dur="0.5"/> a legal right <pause dur="0.7"/> to possess land <pause dur="1.7"/> so these <pause dur="0.2"/> four concepts <pause dur="0.4"/> tenure estate <pause dur="0.3"/> possession <pause dur="0.3"/> and title <pause dur="1.9"/> and i then went on to explain <pause dur="0.4"/> the doctrine of <pause dur="0.3"/> relativity of title <pause dur="2.6"/> and argued that this had arisen as a result <pause dur="2.4"/> of the adversarial system of adjudication <pause dur="0.3"/> that we have in this country <pause dur="1.3"/> and in particular the idea <pause dur="0.4"/> that when <pause dur="0.3"/> people have disputes <pause dur="1.1"/> about land and they take them to court <pause dur="1.3"/> the court is concerned solely with 
<trunc>det</trunc> determining <pause dur="0.3"/> the claims <pause dur="0.5"/> as between the parties <pause dur="2.4"/> the court doesn't go around <pause dur="0.2"/> looking for <pause dur="0.2"/> the true owner of the land <pause dur="0.6"/> it's simply concerned with <pause dur="0.2"/> resolving the dispute <pause dur="2.1"/> that it has before it <pause dur="3.7"/> and i looked at some ideas <pause dur="0.2"/> about <pause dur="0.5"/> relativity of title <pause dur="0.5"/> in that context <pause dur="0.2"/> first of all the idea <pause dur="0.2"/> that <pause dur="0.2"/> possession <pause dur="0.3"/> of land <pause dur="0.5"/> is prima facie evidence of title so if you physically possess land <pause dur="1.2"/> that gives rise to a presumption that you have a right <pause dur="1.3"/> to possess the land <pause dur="1.3"/> so possession and title are <pause dur="0.4"/> are <pause dur="0.9"/> linked together in that way <pause dur="1.9"/> moving on from that <pause dur="1.9"/> the idea that no one can acquire <pause dur="0.6"/> a better title to land <pause dur="0.4"/> or to any other form of property <pause dur="0.5"/> than the person from whom they acquired it <pause dur="1.0"/> or to put it the other way round <pause dur="0.2"/> you can't give <pause dur="0.6"/> someone a better title to property <pause dur="0.2"/> than <pause dur="1.7"/> than you yourself have <pause dur="3.1"/> this was the principle <pause dur="0.7"/> put in in in <pause dur="0.6"/> terms of its Latin tag <pause dur="0.4"/> of <distinct lang="la">nemo dat</distinct> <pause dur="0.3"/> <distinct lang="la">quod non habet</distinct> <pause dur="1.8"/> and then <pause dur="0.5"/> a final principle under <pause dur="0.2"/> this idea of relativity of title <pause dur="0.3"/> that when you have a <trunc>comple</trunc> competing <pause dur="0.6"/> claims to 
title so when people go to court <pause dur="2.0"/> and argue <pause dur="1.9"/> that they each have better title than the other <pause dur="1.3"/> then the first <pause dur="0.3"/> time <pause dur="0.2"/> prevails so the person who can show <pause dur="0.4"/> the longest historical claim to title <pause dur="0.7"/> is going to prevail <pause dur="1.3"/> there are some quite complex concepts and ideas here <pause dur="0.6"/> # i'd encourage you <pause dur="0.3"/> to read <pause dur="1.4"/> whichever textbook you've got with <trunc>i</trunc> in Smith i think it's <trunc>ch</trunc> it's chapter four in Smith which <trunc>i</trunc> # explication of his concepts # at greater length than i'm able to do <pause dur="0.4"/> in the context of a lecture so i would encourage you to go away and <pause dur="0.3"/> and read about these things we'll come back <pause dur="0.4"/> to many of these ideas later on in the course <pause dur="0.2"/> particularly <pause dur="0.4"/> # the doctrine of estates <pause dur="1.9"/> i then tried to to explain or tried to apply these these principles show how they were applied <pause dur="0.2"/> in the context of a specific case so and tried to bring them to life <pause dur="0.3"/> with this case from eighteen-sixty-five <pause dur="0.4"/> of Asher against Whitlock <pause dur="1.0"/> we saw <pause dur="0.2"/> that <pause dur="1.0"/><vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/><pause dur="1.5"/> character called Thomas Williamson <pause dur="1.1"/> had <pause dur="0.5"/> taken <pause dur="0.3"/> a piece of land he was 
a a squatter and he'd enclosed it in other words he'd <pause dur="0.3"/> he'd <pause dur="0.3"/> put some kind of fence round it <pause dur="0.8"/> and claimed it as his own took possession of it <pause dur="0.4"/> from someone who we don't know that person doesn't appear <pause dur="0.7"/> # anywhere in the proceedings <pause dur="1.1"/> # and he then proceeded to make <pause dur="0.2"/> a will <pause dur="0.6"/> leaving <pause dur="1.6"/> an interest <pause dur="1.0"/> in the land the interest that he'd acquired <pause dur="0.3"/> by taking physical possession <pause dur="0.5"/> to his wife for the rest of her life <pause dur="0.3"/> or until she remarried <pause dur="1.0"/> then <pause dur="0.7"/> after that to his daughter <pause dur="0.8"/> the chain of events that occurred was that <pause dur="0.4"/> Williamson then died so the land passes <pause dur="0.4"/> # to his wife <pause dur="0.2"/> for her for her life for the rest of her life <pause dur="0.3"/> or until she remarries <pause dur="0.8"/> she has what's known as a determinable <pause dur="0.5"/> life interest <pause dur="0.9"/> so the interest for life can be brought <pause dur="0.4"/> to an end <pause dur="0.5"/> by the occurrence of some future event <pause dur="0.6"/> remarriage <pause dur="1.2"/> we found out that she <pause dur="0.2"/> then remarried a character called Whitlock <pause dur="0.5"/> and she continued to live in the land with <trunc>whit</trunc> on the land with Whitlock <pause dur="1.1"/> # <pause dur="2.8"/> she then dies <pause dur="1.4"/> Mary Williamson the daughter <pause dur="0.2"/> 
also dies but before she dies <pause dur="0.4"/> she's made <pause dur="0.5"/> a will <pause dur="0.6"/> leaving <pause dur="1.1"/> her interest in the land <pause dur="0.4"/> and her interest <pause dur="0.3"/> is <pause dur="0.2"/> a reversionary interest in other words she acquires <pause dur="0.9"/> a title immediate possession of the right to immediate possession of the land <pause dur="0.6"/> once her mother has <pause dur="0.2"/> has died or has remarried <pause dur="1.4"/> she's made a will leaving it <pause dur="0.8"/> to a Mrs Asher <pause dur="1.4"/> and we've got a dispute between <pause dur="1.0"/> the mother's second husband <pause dur="0.9"/> Mr Whitlock <pause dur="1.0"/> and the daughter's <pause dur="0.4"/> heir <pause dur="0.5"/> under her will <pause dur="0.9"/> Mrs Asher </u><gap reason="break in recording" extent="uncertain"/> <u who="nm1158" trans="pause"> <kinesic desc="overhead projector is on showing transparency" iterated="n"/> these parties go to court and the <pause dur="1.9"/> arguments that they present are as follows <pause dur="0.5"/> first of all Whitlock <pause dur="0.4"/> argues <pause dur="1.3"/> that he's in actual possession of the land <pause dur="2.9"/> that gives rise to a <pause dur="0.3"/> presumption <pause dur="1.2"/> that he has good title to be there <pause dur="1.0"/> the fact that he's in possession <pause dur="0.7"/> implies that he has a right to possession <pause dur="3.3"/> secondly he argues <pause dur="0.2"/> that his title <pause dur="0.7"/> is at least as good <pause dur="0.4"/> as Williamson's <pause dur="2.2"/> Thomas Williamson's <pause dur="0.8"/> and better <pause dur="0.6"/> than Mrs Asher's <pause dur="1.0"/> because <pause dur="0.3"/> he and Williamson are both squatters <pause dur="1.8"/> neither of them had any right to be on the land <pause dur="2.3"/> so 
the court shouldn't decide as between them <pause dur="3.6"/> on the basis that one has some kind of better claim than the other <pause dur="0.3"/> they should simply look at the fact <pause dur="1.0"/> that <pause dur="0.8"/> he is in possession in these circumstances <pause dur="1.2"/> and then there's <pause dur="0.5"/> this further argument <pause dur="1.1"/> that <pause dur="1.1"/> because both <pause dur="0.2"/> he and and Thomas Williamson are squatters <pause dur="0.2"/> that there's some <pause dur="0.3"/> other true owner out there <pause dur="0.9"/> and therefore the court shouldn't decide the case in favour of Mrs Asher <pause dur="0.7"/> because of the existence of <pause dur="0.7"/> we'll call this character X <pause dur="0.2"/> we don't know who he is <pause dur="0.8"/> she is <pause dur="5.8"/> <kinesic desc="reveals covered part of transparency" iterated="n"/> the arguments that Asher puts forward <pause dur="0.9"/> are that she has derived her title <pause dur="0.5"/> from <pause dur="0.3"/> Thomas Williamson <pause dur="2.2"/> Thomas Williamson passed it to Lucy Williamson passed it to Mary Williamson <pause dur="0.5"/> passed it <pause dur="0.5"/> to Mrs Asher <pause dur="1.9"/><vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/><pause dur="2.2"/> and she claims that Williamson's title <pause dur="0.3"/> is better than Whitlock's because although admittedly they're both squatters <pause dur="1.0"/> Williamson was squatting first <pause dur="1.2"/> so <pause dur="0.2"/> we've got the idea <pause dur="0.3"/> principle of the principle of the first 
in time <pause dur="0.2"/> prevails in these circumstances <pause dur="2.2"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> the third argument that she makes <pause dur="1.6"/> in rebuttal of the of the the third point made by Whitlock <pause dur="1.6"/> is that the identity of X is irrelevant <pause dur="0.3"/> X isn't a party <pause dur="0.2"/> to the proceedings before the court <pause dur="1.0"/> so we see <pause dur="0.4"/> an illustration <pause dur="0.6"/> of <pause dur="0.4"/> that principle <pause dur="0.7"/> i mentioned at the earlier at the outset in connection with the concept of relativity of title <pause dur="0.3"/> that when you get cases before the courts <pause dur="0.5"/> the courts are only interested in the dispute between the parties they don't embark on this <pause dur="0.4"/> search for X <pause dur="0.4"/> and the court upholds <unclear>#</unclear> Asher's argument <pause dur="0.9"/> they're not interested in the identity of X <pause dur="0.7"/> as between Williamson <pause dur="0.7"/> Thomas Williamson <pause dur="0.9"/> and Mr Whitlock <pause dur="0.5"/> Thomas Williamson's title is better <pause dur="0.2"/> because he was there first <pause dur="2.4"/> and therefore <pause dur="0.4"/> although Whitlock is in actual possession of the land <pause dur="1.7"/> that possession can be overturned <pause dur="0.3"/> by evidence of a better title <pause dur="0.8"/> and Mrs Asher can show <pause dur="0.2"/> a better title <pause dur="0.2"/> because she's <trunc>direc</trunc> derived it directly <pause dur="0.7"/> by this chain of <pause dur="0.7"/> # # # 
of <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="1.3"/> gifts by by means of the will <pause dur="1.3"/> from Thomas Williamson </u><gap reason="break in recording" extent="uncertain"/> <u who="nm1158" trans="pause"> we've got a demonstration <pause dur="0.5"/> of <pause dur="1.9"/> quite a number of the principles that i <pause dur="0.2"/> i introduced yesterday <pause dur="0.4"/> going on from this case <pause dur="4.4"/> this <pause dur="0.4"/> method <pause dur="0.3"/> of <pause dur="0.5"/> dealing with disputes about land <pause dur="1.2"/> is <pause dur="0.5"/> efficient <pause dur="0.3"/> in terms of <pause dur="0.4"/> adjudication <pause dur="1.0"/> and i say that because <pause dur="2.2"/> another approach <pause dur="0.4"/> that the court could have adopted <pause dur="0.2"/> would have been to embark on a search for X <pause dur="0.3"/> in these circumstances and to say well <pause dur="0.3"/> neither Asher nor Whitlock have <pause dur="0.9"/> good claim here <pause dur="0.6"/> X owns the land <pause dur="5.7"/> but how are they supposed to go about <pause dur="2.1"/> that type of enquiry <pause dur="0.7"/> they don't have the evidence before them <pause dur="1.0"/> they only have <pause dur="1.4"/> the actual parties to the dispute <pause dur="0.6"/> there in the courtroom <pause dur="2.7"/> and their evidence is the only evidence <pause dur="0.2"/> that can be put <pause dur="0.8"/> to the test <pause dur="2.6"/> so it would be <pause dur="0.4"/> inefficient <pause dur="0.7"/> to embark on <pause dur="0.6"/> this search for <pause dur="0.7"/> the elusive character X in these proceedings <pause dur="0.4"/> the way they actually resolve <pause dur="1.1"/> the problem the dispute before them <pause dur="1.5"/> 
is sensible in terms of <pause dur="0.8"/> judicial decision making <pause dur="2.4"/> <kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="15"/> but it raises <pause dur="0.7"/> a problem <pause dur="1.7"/> if you <pause dur="1.8"/> consider Asher's position now <pause dur="0.3"/> Asher's title has been <pause dur="0.5"/> confirmed as against Whitlock by the court <pause dur="2.3"/> but what happens if Asher wants to sell <pause dur="0.8"/> the land <pause dur="0.7"/> to someone else <pause dur="3.0"/> how are we <pause dur="0.3"/> to say <pause dur="0.6"/> that this <pause dur="0.4"/><kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> character <pause dur="0.3"/> X <pause dur="0.4"/> question mark <pause dur="0.5"/> is not going to reappear <pause dur="0.5"/> at some point <pause dur="0.4"/> in the future <pause dur="2.7"/> and say well actually <pause dur="1.0"/> i have a better title than Williamson <pause dur="1.8"/> and as <pause dur="0.3"/> you Asher can have no better title than Williamson did <pause dur="2.2"/> i therefore <pause dur="0.2"/> have better title <pause dur="0.7"/> better claim to the to a right to possession <pause dur="0.5"/> than you do <pause dur="2.0"/><vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.8"/> so while <pause dur="1.0"/> the approach that that the court adopts in Asher and Whitlock <pause dur="0.3"/> is efficient <pause dur="0.3"/> in terms of <pause dur="0.3"/> judicial decision making <pause dur="0.6"/> it's potentially <pause dur="0.4"/> inefficient or ineffective <pause dur="2.2"/> in terms of looking at the way that markets <pause dur="0.4"/> for land might work <pause dur="0.3"/> who's going to buy the land from Asher <pause dur="0.7"/> if there is a risk <pause dur="0.2"/> that at some point in the future <pause dur="0.3"/> they may

boundary here there's a gate <pause dur="0.4"/><kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> that's been locked by the defendant <pause dur="0.5"/> and the only <pause dur="0.4"/> means of access to the disputed plot <pause dur="0.6"/> is <pause dur="0.7"/> through Moran's land <pause dur="0.9"/> so he's achieved <pause dur="1.2"/><kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="2"/> complete <pause dur="1.2"/> enclosure <pause dur="0.5"/> in that sense <pause dur="3.2"/><kinesic desc="reveals covered part of transparency" iterated="n"/> he's also put <pause dur="0.4"/> a lock <pause dur="0.4"/> and chain <pause dur="0.3"/> on this gate <pause dur="9.5"/><kinesic desc="reveals covered part of transparency" iterated="n"/> and thirdly he's taken possession <pause dur="0.5"/> by <pause dur="2.1"/> act of maintenance <pause dur="0.9"/> he's cultivated the plot he's <pause dur="0.8"/> mowed the grass <pause dur="0.7"/> put plants in it <pause dur="0.6"/> treated it as part of his garden <pause dur="2.5"/> in other words he's dealt with the disputed plot <pause dur="0.7"/> in the same way <pause dur="0.9"/> effectively as you would expect <pause dur="0.9"/> a person who owned a piece of land <pause dur="1.0"/> to deal with their own <pause dur="0.5"/> land <pause dur="6.0"/> so <pause dur="0.3"/> the court concludes that Moran <pause dur="0.5"/> by means of these acts <pause dur="0.3"/> that he's carried out <pause dur="0.6"/> predecessor in title carried out <pause dur="0.6"/> has established <pause dur="0.2"/> factual possession <pause dur="0.5"/> of the plot of land <event desc="takes off transparency" iterated="n"/></u><gap reason="break in recording" extent="uncertain"/> <u who="nm1158" trans="pause"> <kinesic desc="puts on transparency" iterated="n"/> the next thing he has to establish <pause dur="0.8"/> is the necessary <pause dur="0.4"/> <distinct lang="la">animus</distinct> the necessary intention <pause dur="3.0"/> can we say <pause dur="0.9"/> that <pause dur="0.7"/> Moran 
intended <pause dur="1.7"/> as the lawyers put it <pause dur="0.5"/> to exclude the world at large <pause dur="2.6"/> to prevent <pause dur="0.2"/> other people from getting access to the land <pause dur="0.6"/> including <pause dur="0.8"/> the county council itself <pause dur="1.8"/><vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/><pause dur="1.0"/> there was no evidence that the county council had ever physically tried to get access <pause dur="0.4"/> to the land during this period <pause dur="0.6"/> but if they'd wanted to do so <pause dur="0.5"/> they wouldn't have been able to <pause dur="1.3"/> they would have had to go and ask Moran for a key to unlock <pause dur="0.7"/> the gate <pause dur="1.8"/> suppose they could have # <pause dur="1.6"/> could have knocked the gate down or something of that kind <pause dur="3.3"/> but the fact that he had <pause dur="0.4"/> enclosed the land <pause dur="0.9"/> put this lock and chain in place <pause dur="1.8"/><kinesic desc="reveals covered part of transparency" iterated="n"/> was itself evidence of an intention to exclude <pause dur="1.6"/> and the argument here basically is that if you <pause dur="0.5"/> chain up a gate <pause dur="2.7"/> and lock it <pause dur="2.4"/> then <pause dur="0.8"/> by means of that action you've got <pause dur="0.4"/> prima facie evidence of intention to exclude </u><gap reason="break in recording" extent="uncertain"/> <u who="nm1158" trans="pause">  part of the problem though in this case <pause dur="4.5"/><kinesic desc="reveals covered part of transparency" iterated="n"/> is <pause dur="0.4"/> the evidence about <pause dur="2.7"/> whether or not Moran intended <pause dur="0.6"/> to exclude <pause dur="0.5"/> forever <pause dur="1.5"/> the county 
council <pause dur="0.7"/> or <pause dur="0.4"/> just until the occurrence of <pause dur="1.0"/> a future event <pause dur="0.8"/> the correspondence i referred to earlier <pause dur="2.7"/> he's actually said <pause dur="0.3"/> it's always been my firm understanding that the land should be kept <pause dur="1.1"/> by him <pause dur="1.2"/> until the proposed road diversion <pause dur="1.0"/> so he seems to be recognizing he seems to have recognized in that correspondence <pause dur="0.5"/> that <pause dur="0.6"/> his rights in relation to the disputed plot of land <pause dur="0.9"/> are limited <pause dur="0.3"/> in time <pause dur="0.6"/> there may come <pause dur="0.4"/> a future point in time <pause dur="0.7"/> of which <pause dur="0.3"/> the council wants to go ahead with the road diversion <pause dur="3.8"/> and at that point <pause dur="0.7"/> his rights will presumably come to an end <pause dur="1.4"/> so the question that the court is confronted with is what does Moran actually need to show does he need to <trunc>en</trunc> show <pause dur="0.3"/> an intention <pause dur="0.8"/> to <pause dur="0.5"/> possess the land <pause dur="1.2"/> whatever happens in the future <pause dur="0.3"/> in all future circumstances <pause dur="0.6"/> in which case he's in difficulty <pause dur="0.9"/> because he's admitted in the correspondence <pause dur="0.8"/> that <pause dur="0.5"/> his rights are limited <pause dur="2.1"/> potentially by <pause dur="2.0"/> what the county council is proposing at a future point to do with the land <pause dur="0.3"/> or does 
he simply need to show <pause dur="1.3"/> that his intention is to possess for the time being <pause dur="1.2"/> and then once the twelve years have accrued <pause dur="2.1"/> he gets the right to adverse possession <pause dur="0.3"/> 'cause his rights are <pause dur="0.3"/> are are effectively confirmed <pause dur="0.4"/> at that point <pause dur="2.1"/> and the court <pause dur="0.2"/> comes to the conclusion that effectively you deal with these things on a <pause dur="0.2"/> on a day by day basis <pause dur="0.4"/> all that he is required to show <pause dur="0.4"/> is that he intends to possess <pause dur="0.3"/> for the time being <pause dur="2.9"/> and once <pause dur="1.5"/> that's coupled with factual possession <pause dur="0.5"/> over the twelve year period <pause dur="1.6"/> then that is sufficient <pause dur="3.8"/> to make his <pause dur="0.5"/> claim to adverse possession <pause dur="0.8"/> operative </u><gap reason="break in recording" extent="uncertain"/> <u who="nm1158" trans="pause">  so here we've got # a a concrete example of how <pause dur="0.2"/> adverse possession actually works in practice <pause dur="0.4"/> and someone acquires <pause dur="0.2"/> rights <pause dur="0.6"/> as a result of <pause dur="0.4"/> of that adverse possession <pause dur="3.0"/> i think it's important to say <pause dur="0.4"/> that it's actually <pause dur="1.3"/> quite rare in practice <pause dur="0.4"/> for people <pause dur="1.3"/> to <pause dur="0.8"/> have their claims <pause dur="0.5"/> sustained by the court <pause dur="0.3"/> in other words <pause dur="0.2"/> these tests <pause dur="0.5"/> of factual 
possession intention to possess <pause dur="0.3"/> a twelve year <pause dur="0.2"/> period and adversity <pause dur="0.5"/> are actually quite difficult to maintain in practice <pause dur="0.9"/> one reason is that <pause dur="1.9"/> Buckinghamshire County Council here are are clearly being <pause dur="0.2"/> being negligent with regard to to their use of land they could have <pause dur="0.6"/> effectively <pause dur="0.6"/> brought the issue to a head <pause dur="0.9"/> much earlier <pause dur="0.7"/> by bringing a claim to possession within the twelve year period <pause dur="0.4"/> or <pause dur="0.7"/> just by giving <pause dur="0.2"/> Moran permission to continue using the land until <pause dur="0.4"/> # they <pause dur="0.3"/> needed it <pause dur="0.5"/> that would have brought <pause dur="0.6"/> the adversity to an end if they had actually written to him <pause dur="0.3"/> # and said well <pause dur="0.3"/> either <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> we'll either take you to court or we'll give you <pause dur="0.5"/> # # permission to continue to occupy the land <pause dur="0.7"/> # until we need it <pause dur="0.9"/> either of those actions or those interventions would have been sufficient <pause dur="0.9"/> to bring <pause dur="0.8"/> Moran's claims to an end <pause dur="0.2"/> so <pause dur="0.4"/> it's quite rare for these things to run on for this length of time <pause dur="1.5"/> where it most commonly happens <pause dur="0.3"/> is in relation to <pause dur="0.2"/> disputes over or <pause dur="0.5"/> # uncertainties if you like with 
regard to the boundaries of land and you can see this as a <pause dur="0.3"/> as a kind of extended example of that <pause dur="0.3"/> the area of land is is probably in this case is probably larger <pause dur="0.3"/> than those in most cases but where <pause dur="0.2"/> # # a fence has <pause dur="0.5"/> been put up it's <pause dur="0.3"/> two or three metres to <pause dur="0.6"/> the left or the right of where it should be <pause dur="0.6"/> then and <pause dur="0.4"/> that situation is allowed to rest and to continue <pause dur="0.4"/> that <pause dur="0.4"/> is the most common type of example <pause dur="0.3"/> in which <pause dur="0.2"/> you actually find <pause dur="0.4"/> adverse possession <pause dur="0.3"/> working <pause dur="0.5"/> today <pause dur="1.3"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> the <pause dur="0.2"/> other example that i've got in the case <pause dur="0.2"/> in in in in the cases in the in the materials <pause dur="0.2"/> of Hyde and Pearce <pause dur="0.6"/> shows an example of <pause dur="0.2"/> of a claim to adverse possession <pause dur="0.5"/> # not working <pause dur="0.9"/> despite <pause dur="2.0"/> what <pause dur="0.9"/> seems to be <pause dur="1.1"/> fairly outrageous behaviour <pause dur="0.4"/> on the part <pause dur="0.2"/> of the person <pause dur="0.4"/> who comes to own the land </u><gap reason="break in recording" extent="uncertain"/> <u who="nm1158" trans="pause">  # <pause dur="4.8"/><event desc="takes off transparency" iterated="n"/> i'm going to have to <pause dur="0.2"/> bring it to an end today to allow you to have your <pause dur="0.3"/> staff-student liaison committee elections <pause dur="0.5"/> but i'll talk a bit about Hyde and Pearce at the beginning of next time
