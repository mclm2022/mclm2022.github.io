<u who="nm5168">for the tutorials we thought it would be a good idea for once for us all to get together and # discuss a common issue # we chose the Gulf War as one which seemed to provide # enough material to discuss the structure of the international system the different policy-making agents and the norms and for you to think through # the different weight that each of these elements could have in explaining Japan's # policy decision in respect of the Gulf War so we've asked you basically to spend some of your Easter vacation preparing and we should have # about a forty-five minute presentation from the postgraduates first and Ian will lead off and explain what what that group is going to do and then the other Ian for the undergraduates # will then # hopefully explain how the undergraduates are going to proceed so it's basically forty-five minutes what shall we do let's think probably it's best to have both presentations isn't it</u>
<u who="nm5169">yeah</u>
<u who="nm5168">so i think we'll have both presentations and then you'll have ten minutes of questions for each team so in other words forty-five minutes presentation from the postgraduates forty-five from the undergraduates ten minutes of questions from the undergraduates to the postgraduates ten minutes of questions from the postgraduates to the undergraduates ten to fifteen minute break and then the three of us will ask both of the teams questions okay fine can i then hand over # to <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/></u>
<u who="sm5171">unfortunately our introducer # had a bit of a footballing accident and # he lost his teeth so <vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" dur="2"/> so we # couldn't do the introduction which was the what that Japan did but i'm sure you all know what Japan did it was mainly the thirteen billion US dollars to the war effort # so we're gonna move straight on to our second presentation which is gonna be by <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> and he's gonna talk about the levels of analysis the structure agency norms because we think it's important to have a # theoretical background as to why we're approaching it in this way # then we're gonna move on to the the three factors structure agency norms # first with Anthony talking about structure then # Roberto talking about agency and then Hannah's gonna talk about norms # in conclusion # Cosel is gonna come up and say where we think the emphasis should lie so i'll hand you over to <gap reason="name" extent="1"/></u>
<u who="sm5172"> thank you i actually know it wasn't that easy to become a presenter in our team because it was really competitive team so thank you very much for giving and presenting and Ian okay i'll start i'm going to explain about # the level of analysis and that fact is Gulf War and Japan's involvment and first is diverse explanations can we can we present varied generate generali- generalisations about why Gulf War occurred and why Japan as well as other states were involved are these insights get go beyond in the detailed and narrow treatment of individual disputes or obvious and understanding generations generalizations certainly devolves explanations and hypothesis of the questions are numerous and contradictory here an effective point of departure of the analysis of the Gulf War is <trunc>suggest</trunc> <trunc>suggest</trunc> suggested by the scheme Kenneth Walls employs in his book Madness States and War it is a classic work Walls organises the theories according to whether the cause of war is found in the nature of man in the nature of the states or in the nature of the international state system walls interview Jack Redding partly asserting the issue of Shumon to one side organises the theories according to whether they stress the system level the nature of citizen society or the decision making process nowadays professor Glenn Hook organises those theories according to whether the cause of Gulf War is found in agency norm in the nature of the international structure i'm going to talk about # the three devolved images first is # first image is second vision and third images the first image's assumption is that <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> the causes of Gulf War and Japan's involving are to be found in the nature and behaviour of individual political leaders or decision-makers however although first image sometimes provide useful emphasises on the responsibility of specific individuals for Gulf War they nonetheless tended to fall well short of providing comprehensive explanations of why Gulf War occurred they cannot for the most part explain why warfare has been endemic in some regions and historical periods and rather infrequent in others human beings <trunc>pos</trunc> possess <trunc>cap</trunc> capacities for both cooperation and conflict and explanations that concern themselves exclusively with individual human behaviour are likely to be incomplete that is our second image explanation this assumption is following as Gulf War and Japan's involving depend on the type of national government the <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> of the society or constitution this implication here is that while human nature may not be changeable social and political institutions are Wilson's formulation that <trunc>democra</trunc> democracies are more peaceable while authoritarian and monarchical states are aggressive feels better but still falls short of providing a comprehensive explanations in addition they <trunc>i</trunc> they are little relevance to any particular kind of government whether authoritarian or liberal communist or democracy military or civilian was more prone to undertake armed attack than any other other kind for a while a variant <trunc>o</trunc> a variety of regions are however democracies with constitutions towards peace to become involved in wars with non-democratic states what does seem to be the cause is that democracies based on democratic constitutions towards peace do not fight wars with each other democracies historically haven't <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> get involved in the numerous wars that occur in non-democracies so you should find <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> explanations it's related to structure the argument cause of Gulf War and Japan's involving inheres in the very condition of the international system which which for once and others have identified as one of international anarchy that is states existing in international milieu that lacks effective means for peaceful resolution of conflicts because of the absence of any acceptable overall authority or sense of community finally the position of individuals within an ordered nation state for security and interest of countries that are not by enlarge even i thought established orthodox with a monopoly of means of violence or by a judicial system for the authoritative resolution of this <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> instead states existed in an environment where it is substantially dependant on its own efforts for its security and failed to deal ultimate means a complete resolution a governmental dispute is often one of power co coercion or force okay that's it thank you <kinesic desc="clapping" iterated="y" dur="2"/></u>
<u who="sm5180"> # what do i do <kinesic desc="place OHT on projector" iterated="n" dur="1"/> what is it on right okay i'm going to talk about # structure and this is the outline of my argument <kinesic desc="point to OHT" iterated="n" dur="1"/> first of all i'm going to provide # the structural context of the Gulf War Japan's position in the world order structure the significance of the Gulf War to Japan and this kind of provides a background to # providing the argument why Japan reacted in the way it did and these two points security considerations and political considerations okay so starting off # i'll provide the structural context of the Gulf War # from a structuralist position it can be argued that the war was fought over oil and the maintenance of world economic order and was therefore market-driven # it was perceived there'd be little chance of the fighting escalating into world war the East-West confrontation was over # and the crisis was perceived as being a challenge to the economic structure and indeed after the Iraqi invasion prices of oil went up briefly hitting thirty-eight dollars a barrel and it was felt that a crisis was looming # under this assumption it was felt that oil prices would drop if coalition forces fought Iraq and that shortages of oil and other commodities were not likely as long as the world's countries US especially took a tough stance and indeed no sooner had an airborne attack begun than oil prices began to drop # and so this is a very reductionist but economic argument perspective that the war averted global crisis in the world capitalist structure it's important to note this because it's within this of course that Japan is situated okay so it's number two <vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" dur="2"/></u>
<u who="sm5180"> # Japan's position in the world order # Japan's structural position is defined by its relationship with the US since forty-five it's sheltered under a nuclear umbrella and this has enabled it to # spend nothing on defence and concentrate its production on mass goods # international order prior to the Gulf War # sorry it's the collapse of bipolarity for the collapse of bipolarity this provided the natural setting in which Japan was placed it's since forty-five politically Japan has been peripheral and its role defined by US policy makers # for example Kennan in i think forty-five identified Japan as one of <trunc>th</trunc> one of the five regions of the world that was crucial to the world system the world capitalist system and must be kept out of communist hands so its strategic position in the world is very significant # but of course in many ways it could be argued that this suited Japan it hasn't had to overcome a legacy of distrust of other Asian states it invaded through the war or raise the domestic divisive issue of sending troops abroad # so Japan's position post-war position in the structure of the world order # defines its behaviour and this is why the Gulf War is perhaps so crucial # because it provides the challenge to Japan's perception of itself and its role in the world # the end of bipolarity saw the reorganisation of the international structure # and its from this perspective the structuralist perspective is why the Gulf is so controversial # the nation was propelled into an environment of visibility and potential influence internationally because of its economic influence it is after all the economic lynchpin of the capitalist block # so the importance of Japan in sustaining this this hegemonic block centred around America the Gulf War i guess made this more plain and also illustrated how it was constrained structurally in its actions # so so far firstly provides background structural background so i'll get on to its actual responses to the Gulf War # <kinesic desc="place OHT on projector" iterated="n" dur="1"/> okay right # structural explanation of the Gulf War # the post war role of Japan in the world order world order the changing world order and significance of the Gulf all illustrates the new position of Japan okay so what of Japan's actual role from a structural perspective # it's clear that it was not directly because of self-interest or short-termism # Japan at the time obtained only two percent of its oil from Kuwait and two percent from Iraq so it could be argued that what was of primary importance was its strategic links with America and this links up with the economic structuralist argument provided in my introduction # it was pressure from America that was the fundamental motivation behind Japan's response to the Gulf and while perhaps an investigation into domestic agency provides an explanation of the manner in which Japan responded its crucial to understand that its pressure from America in the context of Japan's position in the structure in the alliance system # that made Japan respond as it did # Bush put pressure on Kaifu and for example on the day after Japan announced it was mere it was going to freeze Kuwaiti until us security council required further action and for example all one-hundred senators signed a letter urging Japan to take further action and as a consequence the day before the security council met Japan agreed to impose sanctions on Iraq # quite clearly Japan was more concerned with # the situation in Washington than it was in Iraq # so perhaps Japan fared to America and the second point is political considerations and this is perhaps more proactive argument and this concerns the role of Japan in United Nations affairs in world affairs through multilateral bodies # as i said before its position in the world since # nineteen-forty-five as a defeated nation and as part of the US security system limited its structurally limited its influence # and its only been through multilateral bodies perhaps that Japan has been able to attempt to assert some influence # and perhaps the Gulf offered offered this opportunity for Japan to reassert itself # a multilateralism i guess is a means of negating the fears of other countries of a resurgent Japan um an increased role of Japan in world affairs and this would also consolidate Japanese demands to remove the former the enemy clause from the UN charter and also Japan's desire for a place on the security council um senior officials at the Japanese foreign ministry were concerned that for once previously believed Germany and Japan would simultaneously become members of the security council # because German Germany was more willing to send military personnel to the Gulf whilst the enactment of the peace cooperation bill of Japan was still rather unclear they feared that Germany Germany?s entrance would precede Japan so there was also not only security but political # structural and political reasons why the Gulf has significance to Japan so from this perspective Japan found an opportunity to consolidate structurally Japan's influence in the UN # so in conclusion from this structural perspective # the Benefits of a structural perspective is that it perhaps provides a deep # a deep # context in which Japanese actions can be measured against so far as one can find an adequate explanation by embedding Japanese actions in the context of the Gulf as a whole and Japan's political and economic position in the structure of world order <kinesic desc="clapping" iterated="y" dur="2"/></u>
<u who="sm5181">i'm going to talk about agency and the reason why agency wasn't wasn't very effective # first of all Japan being a country that was decimated during the war made it very difficult for the peace the peacetime constitution article nine made it very difficult for Japan to actually enter or send any military commitment to the war the figure of # Prime Minister Kaifu was was was vital he was a weak man to say the least he was he was chosen just basically out of well the the the Japanese political system couldn't off # somebody better because of the corruption that had gone on so the first play # i'm going to # focus is on Prime Minister Kaifu # he was a very weak man and he really couldn't push or and he was being pressured by George Bush in the international scene and by Ichiro Sawa who was who was blackmailing him into into taking the position to send # forces into the Gulf i want to raise the political parties <kinesic desc="place OHT on projector" iterated="n" dur="1"/> okay here we go as we see all the major political parties have serious discrepancies on to as to what should be done the diet was very separated it didn't there wasn't a consensus Japanese society also was very divided they couldn't find a a consensus to sort of apply a strategy you see the liberal democratic party which is the strongest one wanted only to limit to transportation and communication to the all time members to carry light arms the Japanese socialist party is wouldn't hear of it the Komei party limited to just medical office without S-D-F status the democratic socialist party was willing to probate as long as members were not armed and the communist party just also wouldn't hear of it the Komei party was was willing to send medical officers or was willing to support that but the problem was that they couldn't really find people to go to the Gulf there was there was pressures from medicals staff and # unions and really nobody wanted to go there wasn't a really really big consensus they couldn't find volunteers to go to the to the Persian Gulf # another play # was probably and who would lat # reflect is # mr Hashimoto who # wouldn't really put the money for it he was he was really really against it although he did agree for a twenty-five-billion cheque and then he increased it to four billion but within the Japanese political system the minister # of of finance is usually a very independent person he usually never follows the lead of the Prime Minister # and he probably wasn't going to follow Kaifu anyway the last player or the last area of the agency is probably academics academics were also they couldn't agree professor Sadako Ogata of Sophia university or either <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> a specialist in peace without weapons and professor Tatsuro Kanagiyo international Christian university believed that the proposed peace cooperation force should not even be sent # Yoshio Suzuki chief councillor at <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> university argued that Japan's economy was unlikely to suffer and suggested another nine billion to be sent so at the end agency could produce no # no serious # diplomacy or no serious # solution to society to Japanese society and Japanese <kinesic desc="clapping" iterated="y" dur="2"/></u>
<u who="sf5182">i'm going to talk about norms and the influence on the response to the Gulf conflict and especially mention pacifist and sort of isolation # what was guiding the opposition against the <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> sending S-D-F the self defence forces to the Gulf was even a non-military mission it was the strong pacifist norm in Japan ever since the # throughout the post-war period there has been a image prevailing of Japanese sort of pacifist or at least conflictable in the free world and several opinions surveys ever since the sixties have confirmed this image # an opinion poll furthermore plays a very significant part in the public sphere in Japan and their political decision makers are constantly aware of where the public stands on different issues and it has led to that # their seeking out policy trying to avoid controversial decisions for example revising the constitution or taking away the one ceiling on defence expenditure which they finally did in nineteen-eighty-seven # public opinion is of course important for decision makers in all democracies the abilities and the strength of the # pacifist or anti-military norms in Japan are very important and they have had a significant influence on the defence and security policy of Japan non the least in the Gulf conflict and these pacifist norms they stem from the result of defeat in World War Two and the US they were determined to see to it that there were no seeds for remilitarisation both in Japan and in Germany so general Macarthur the supreme command # of the allied forces in nineteen-forty-six required incorporation of the principle of pacifist in the constitution # which and it's article nine then reads <reading>aspiring sincerely to an international peace based on justice and order the Japanese people forever renounce war as a sovereign right of the nation or the threat or use of force as a means of settling international disputes</reading> in order to accomplish the aim of the preceding paragraph land sea and air forces as well as other war potential will never be maintained the right of belligerency of the state will not be recognised so this is # Japan is the only country in the world to constitutionally renounce war and # as you can see it also prohibits land sea and air forces as well as sending them abroad it doesn't say here # and at the time nineteen-forty-seven this was convenient for Japan Prime Minister Yoshida wanted to focus on the economic build up of Japan and to # maintain the emperor system as the national distinct distinction of Japan so Yoshida fully endorsed the constitution in the diet the Japanese people did the same and after some time the principle became engrained in the Japanese the way they see Japan in the world so the distinctive constitution became a cause of national pride and # also as a way to make amends of imperial deeds and to make certain that Japan would remain a non-threatening nation in the world so the principle might have been an American creation but it soon gained a life of its own # after a while the constitution # became or soon after the constititution became reinterpreted to allow self defence forces but not to send these abroad they the public nowadays they accept their existence but few of them want any build ups and the overwhelming opposition against revising the constitution in order to make their stance clear # and more legitimate also against sending them abroad # and generally furthermore the Japanese don't see military power as a very effective way to secure land security the kind of security in a poll in nineteen-seventy-seven forty-eight said it's not effective while they while there opt for international exchange diplomatic negotiations and economic cooperation and # during a poll during in a poll in the Gulf War <kinesic desc="place OHT on projector" iterated="n" dur="1"/> in the time the Japanese people were asked: "what are the reasons Japan has been able to lead a peaceful existence after the second world war" and most people opted for the constitution and as you can see also economic and social stability Japanese diplomatic efforts of course the Japan-us security treaty # so about the legacy of war and how it has lead to the isolationist in political and international policy # the constitution and a strong attachment to it is origin originating from the memories of the war and the strong military culture that preceded and was during the war which led to an expansionist thrust to create the great # East Asia Co-prosperity spell and a <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> defeat so Japan promised itself and the world especially its neighbour to never again use military force and # to they should remain harmless and focus on economic advancement so the American created a constitution and a commitment by the US to bear the brunt of a Japan's defence it was it was in this context it was very welcomed and # Japan could focus on economic prosperity and welfare and isolation from international politics and this all became the part of the new Japan and pacifist norm became part of the new Japan Japanese identity made up Japanese identity made it strong # than what the US would have wanted # but <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> Japan was a poor country and they had a long way to go to reconstruct their society but they recovery of face was short # quick # than was first imagined and already in the seventies and eighties they developed into a great economic great power and with the economic achievements there also came pressure to re-evaluate its international role and to shed its isolationist # so this norms influence on the response to the Gulf conflict well the importance of the norms it does they do not try in the financial commitment of Japan to the alliance but in the decision not to contribute with manpower or material in the non military missions and this is a decision that they got devastating critique for # and a strong anti-military norm they have led they have led have led to a lack of discussion since the end of World War Two in Japan about its stance on international as well as national security issues and it led to the Japan was unprepared to meet a crisis like the Gulf conflict and the pressure that was was combined with it and because the constitution would mean that Japan would break the law if they send the S-D-F abroad the efforts to go about this to send the S-D-F to the Gulf through the UN peace cooperation bill they came to nought since the opposition in the diet <trunc>the</trunc> identified them with they identified with pacifist norms at least they knew that the electorate did and # also because of the absence of discussion in the diet so to shed or revises of Japanese face for national security equip identity now shrink in an ad-hoc decision to send forces abroad for the first time since second world war it was just not deemed possible # it might be a good idea to mud-fight as normal when the constitution since the world has changed quite a lot since nineteen-forty-seven as well as Japan but the Japanese people they first need an open discussion and critically analyse # the constitution and its role in the world and as a consensus seeking people and # the probably want to avoid the demonstrations that came about around nineteen six nineteen-sixty when the us-Japan security treaty was about to be revised and # Prime Minister prime minister Kishi had to resign and thereafter they have tried to avoid to use <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> majority as a way to get decisions through so that evidence of the influence of political opinion evidence of the influence of the political opinion in Japan # that's in April in April nineteen-ninety-one when the war had ended and there was maybe a shift in public opinion towards sending S-D-F as mine-sweepers to the Gulf and first then the government also did to finally send mine-sweepers and # so i also think so the pacifist norm and the long political isolation they led to a lack of discussion in Japan: the subject of security and defence were almost taboo that led as i said to a no re-evaluation of the inflexible constitution and it can be made in the ad-hoc manner that the that would have suited the allied forces so # this did not only lead to a decision not to send manpower and material abroad it also <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> power a non-directionally response to Japan's <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> so also public opinion about decision they pressured Japan in one direction while the international pressure present pressured in the opposite direction <kinesic desc="clapping" iterated="y" dur="2"/></u>
<u who="sm5183">ah i hope i can conclude all the things that my team mate made this conclusion i'd like to make four point the first point will deal with levels of analysis and the second will deal with agency the third structure and the fourth and the last norms firstly the explanatory powers of the three variables structure agency and norms enable us to comprehend why and how policy was made and what factors conditioned policy for example in the case of Japan's response to the Gulf War crisis we may recognise that the US and foreign <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> and economic decline of the US which so adds structural variables did play <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> Japan decision makers to make policy in response to the Gulf War crisis however due to the fact that Japanese society there has been norms of pacifism and anti-militarism which has been embedded as a result of the second world war this constrained policy makers to think carefully when dealing with the issue of dispatching the self defence force abroad the point here about level of analysis is that these three variables complement each other in other words they work interdependently to help us explaining the if we are to ignore one of the three variables we are not likely to logically and understandingly analyse the thing we want nevertheless it is not worthy that the work of each of these variables in explaining a particular case may not be equal to one another the second point in analysing Japan's response to the Gulf War crisis although we cannot make a consensus on the variables between structure agency and norms which one is the most important but we do agree that we should ruling out agency yeah because to explain why Japan behaved in the way it did in response to the crisis the policy making agents and other political actors seem to us to be the least important between the three variables this is because agency <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> the fundamental factor which <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> response to the United Nations flatter the agency the actors decisions seem in large part to reflect something <trunc>imen</trunc> emanating from the structure and norms variables in short this is not to say that the agency did not <trunc>influen</trunc> influence the way Japan reacted but the agency played a lowly formulating policy <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> by structure and norms third part: structure according to one of the two factions of our group <vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" dur="2"/></u>
<u who="sm5183">they insist that the structure of international system is the most important variable in analysing why Japan part in participated in the war because their structure is the fundamental variable which forced Japan to play more variety of roles in response to the war Japan decision making agents were faced with a dilemma: on the one side the government was pressured to play more roles commensurate to its position as an economic superpower on the other side the <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> of policies to send the self defence forces abroad was composed by Japanese society the structure of the international system at that time were the in <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> war the new world order of multipolarity system formed the current decline of the US the question of Japan's international role flow and the pressure from the US for Japan to play a more pro-active role it is worthwhile to say that the US forces source of power of the Japan government because Japan's security was mainly guaranteed by the US troops lastly: norms we agree to disagree over the roles of norms there are two positions of norms in dealing with the military issue the first position: norms that conditioned Japan's response were dictated by the structure of the world after the war after the second world war that is democracy and legacy and legacy of the second world war which created pacifism secondly norms have been wove into two directions traditional norms of anti-militarism and pacifism and the second and the most important norm that they were Japanese pro-active role at international levels this norms stems from the fact that Japan has finally succeeded in economic scenario thus now it is a time to recall Japanese dignity and honour which has been ruled out since the end of the second world war this will as advocated by most of our group argue that norms were the most important factor since they evolved and become a major constraint on policy makers <kinesic desc="clapping" iterated="y" dur="2"/></u>

<u who="sm5184">i've brought this along today <kinesic desc="hold up video box" iterated="n" dur="1"/> which is something i got from the charity shop <vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" dur="2"/> so as as the Gulf War was basically a media war i thought it would be nice to look at some pictures and distract you from me <vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" dur="2"/> so basically as i said the Gulf War was basically a media war as you can see <kinesic desc="points to screen" iterated="n" dur="1"/> # it presented an interesting point in history where the basic Berlin wall had fallen down and international communism was on the retreat and the cold war had basically ended and this situation gave a chance for a change in the international community a change in the structure of the international community and a chance for Japan also to revise its nature in the way it demon in the way it takes on its role in foreign policy and also in this situation gives Saddam Hussein a chance to invade Kuwait and draw the world's attention to the fact that although the cold war in many ways provided us with securities it also provided us with insecurities # the thirty years before this happened # president of Iraq at that time Hassam invaded well threatened to invade Kuwait # the British response was that only one brigade of troops and there was no international furore about it not compared to this with an international coalition of more than thirty countries so obviously there's been some change in the structure of the world somebody found this far more important in nineteen-ninety than they did in nineteen-sixty-three so the point being is that the international situation is always in a state of flux: it's always changing and this nineteen-ninety-six relation was just one more of the many changes which have happened in the international situation # so clearly the situation in the Gulf has changed: the influence of the world's oil economy had become so more such more significant than they had been in the sixties and this meant that issues of the middle-east region and the global economy were put on the line # so this time Japan's international basis was in a state of flux # during the eighties economic rivalry and trade disputes with America had meant that the nature of Japan's foreign policy had been shifting from what it had been in the nineteen-seventies which was an # very unilateral to a multilateral then again as as Japan witnessed the Russian invasion of Afghanistan and increased # naval activity out of Vladivostock Japan's # often changed its its foreign policy to realign itself with America but this realignment also came at a point in time where the book book called the Japan that can't say no was released Prime Minister Kaifu made a statement where he believed in nineteen-ninety Japan was starting to take a more important role in world affairs he thought that # the time for Japan's coping policy where it just reacted to situations and basically followed the line of least resistance was now over he believed it was time for Japan to take on a more important position in the world as reflected by its current situation # so many many people say that Japan's previous economic and political foreign policy of reaction rather than proaction was problematic and realistic for other people on the on the other side would call it spineless and in some cases immoral uh so the Gulf War provided a test of <trunc>Jap</trunc> of Japan's rhetoric was it really was it really willing to take on the responsibility of a world power so what did Japan do during the Gulf War so despite the rhetoric of words instead of tax which Prime Minister Kaifu say; the first thing Japan did was basically sit down and work out what its oil supplies were going to be and basically that was irrelevant it was obvious that they were going to think about that but it was again straight away a reversion back to coping policies that we talked about before # sanctions were issued on the ninth of august before the UN security council the UN had actually sanctioned it the foreign the Japanese foreign minister was sent on a tour around the eastern states so Japan on the face of it seemed to react very very quickly to the situation but many of these many of these points were brought about because of American pressure you probably see lots of examples of president Bush on the telephone in this video i imagine most of it was actually occupied by Tokyo say to try to get them to do more even before the United Nations had sanctioned put sanctions in force America had been asking or jockeying and pushing Japan into trying to make # a stand against what they saw as international they're breaking an international agreement of policing etc so Japan also said that the thirty the thirty member council which was supposed to be involved in organising Japan's response to the middle eastern crisis and in many levels this international council was plugged in to the American foreign office American <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> and so on # Japan made an effort to send shippings for food vehicles and also made offers of medical staff and supplies for many many times these failed to materialise quite as quickly as the Americans wished # food supplies were were delayed by two days because somebody forgot to order a ship to deliver them; <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> four wheel drive vehicles failed to get delivered to the Gulf on time because Japanese shipping unions were afraid refused to load and then refused to take the ship to a potential war zone and of a one-hundred medical officers # promised only seventeen volunteered so Japan in many ways talked the talk but didn't walk the walk so i think basically Japan as the as the crisis unfolded Japan took the decision where it wanted to avoid isolation # so when the house of representatives vote in America voted for three seventy votes to fifty-three for US troops to be removed from the Japanese from Japan unless Japan was willing to foot the whole bill for their occupant for their presence there Japan came up with four billion US dollars to help the war effort Japan's second policy was to vote for the was United Nations centre where it looked to use the United Nations to try and allow itself to be part of the international community to try and get past the # constrictions of the # of the constitution but in November this was abandoned # and Japan took on its part as i suppose an individual neighbour within the international community where it provide funding goes back to the which cheque-book economy # cheque-book foreign policy of the nineteen-eighties Japan set up a think tank to # decide what it could do in the future if such a crisis should happen in the future and i think that was the nail in the coffin Japan found it very difficult to react in this situation and set the think-tank for future reference and in January when the air raids started Japan promised nine well gave nine billion dollars in further economic aid so that is what Japan did and we have three groups to introduce individually how we go on to international structure agency and</u>

<u who="sf5173">is it between us we're all going to be looking at the international structure personally i'm going to introduce how the international structures influenced the debate on the role of the self defence forces # during the Gulf War new demands were set on Japan on deciding the scope of the international contribution they made and due to the position and power Japan acquired through economic means it was expected to take on a new global political role responsibility Japan had been prevented from dispatching self defence forces under the self defence force law but in this case more pressure was coming in from abroad mainly from the United States for Japan to contribute self defence force personnel and Japan was torn between these us demands and domestic constraints but the US wouldn't be satisfied if Japan's contribution failed to contain some commitment to self defence force manpower the reality of Japan's domestic politics ruled out any such a direct role and as if this wasn't problem enough Japan had to consider the political reactions of # the Asian countries should they agree to dispatching self defence force troops because these Asian nations as victims of Japan's aggression in the past would surely fear such military involvement and although Japan made a vast financial contribution it was clearly not sufficient in the eyes of others and Japan was taught by the lesson that you can't simply become economically involved with other countries and avoid political and military issues the Gulf War brought the issues of international cooperation into perspective Japan as a nation dependent on trade links with resource-rich countries to survive couldn't afford to be a bystander the demands on Japan included contributions of self defence forces and Japan's realisation of the importance of international cooperation for the future due to the issues that came about from the Gulf War has led to a mass debate on the expansion and role of the self defence forces though a lot of people have suggested that since Japan's a member of the UN the contribution to the collective security <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> is surely a duty rather than a right and a new pattern was reached in the handling of the issue and the idea was to surpass the problem of constitutional restriction by using unarmed volunteers # affirming Japan's participation through UN peace-keeping activity which also may help with ease the worries of Japan's Asian neighbours and this issue led to the proposal of a a larger <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> to allow Japan to contribute self defence forces and although it wasn't passed during this time in nineteen-ninety-two it finally was and since then the self defence forces have had some involvement in <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> and debate continues even now on the possibility of reforming the constitution to allow Japan to be come more fully involved in a collective security arrangement and in reality pressure from the international community not being put on Japan at this time the debate surrounding the importance of the S-D-F in Japan's involvement in the international arena ruled Japan out</u>
<u who="sf5175">the Gulf War belonging to the end of the cold war signalled a realignment of the world order it brought the question of how to deal with international conflicts in an age of d?tente to the fore Japan was used to operating within a <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> way east-west confrontation imposed a kind of order on the world and served to determine military reaction # new world orders always begins to emerge in times of crisis and become fixed however set amongst the conclusion of hostilities and the Gulf was no exception during the Gulf crisis the major countries of the world with the US in the lead acted to <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> a new world order Japan was aware of this but opinion in Japan regarding Japan's place in the new world order was divided and effected Japan's response to the Gulf War some subscribed to the pacifist view that Japan should remain pacifist and as if it was the Switzerland of Asia while others believed Japan should actively use the opportunity that the Gulf war presented to seek a more prominent place in the new world order previously Japan had been content as little Japan after World War Two Japan assumed the role of little Japan as a war devastated weak country Japan took as its role model Switzerland a neutral country uninvolved in international debates and decided to become the Asian Switzerland however with the Gulf crisis Japan became aware that remaining little Japan and uninvolved in international politics would be problematic they were no long # little but an economic superpower the outbreak of hostilities in the Persian Gulf gave rise to perhaps one of the greatest challenges to face Japan in the post cold war era prior to the Gulf crisis Japan had been operating on the hypothesis that it was possible to be a major power without being seriously involved in international politics this assumption was very seriously questioned by the Gulf crisis the Gulf crisis was a rude awakening for the Japanese government which had been burying its head in the sand regarding international politics Japan had previously escaped from becoming involved in international affairs the Gulf however forced the Japanese government to <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> issues that had previously been ignored - Japan's role in international politics Japan's involvement with the UN and her international responsibilities this in turn opened up many debates concerning Japan's facing the world in general while immediate debate still ran day to day concerns Japan's international military role and the question of whether economic dependency alone was effective sorry is sufficient with this comes the question of Japan's of Japan's international responsibilities and to Japan's right to become part of the new emerging world order and Japan also had to contribute to the Gulf and not abstain from the conflict there were constitutional constraints that limited their response perhaps it was na?ve of Japan to believe that she could secure herself a place in the formation of the new world order by bearing merely a financial burden and not contributing in human terms the new world order also had an effect on Japan's response to the Gulf War Japan had since World War Two made it a priority to pursue a strong # relationship with the UN and took the US response to the Gulf War as its example although the UN did not react as skilfully or impartially as the US and other allied forces who had already agreed and acted upon force deployment just four days after the invasion it didn't feel that it did not support Iraq's actions on a thirteen to one vote in the security council the UN chose to censor <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> this made it all the more necessary for Japan to become involved and to contribute to the allied efforts Japan was unable however to contribute to normative allied forces in the Gulf but was under pressure to contribute to peace keeping operations in a non-military role this was a source of contention in Japan but Japan was as Japan was the first to international <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> in nineteen-ninety-two a survey conducted by the pacific research group found that only fifteen of the Japanese supported sending troops abroad and fifty-one were opposed to this directly however Japan in order to become a major play # in the new world order also sought a permanent security council seat and this should be seriously considered when evaluating why Japan responded to the Gulf crisis in the way that she did even now nearly ten years lat # there are still debates surrounding Japan's involvement with the peace-keeping and whether she should work towards maintaining strong relations with the UN and seeking a permanent security council seat in a recent meeting with the UN special committee on peace keeping operations -

<u who="nm5168">thank you</u>
<u who="sf5176">okay i'm just going to touch on two dimensions the first being the # international political economy one # basically as # mentioned in the graduate presentation right after the invasion the price of oil did rise briefly hitting three eight dollars a barrel and other commodities as well as US dollar rose in price and strength # but within Japan interest rates were edging high # and stock prices were plunging down # and at this point the market was warning that a global crisis could be on the horizon and there was predictions that oil could hit fifty dollars a barrel now obviously as we have all discussed in the lecture you know Japan is extremely resource-poor oil is a very valuable commodity to this society and what we see here is a situation where an economic superpower is drawn into a problem firstly on the surface we see military and then we see the economic dimensions of that military political problem coming out so we see that this is going to be restraining obviously # but by November the market was sending different messages and the prevalent assumption was that oil prices would drop if coalition forces fought Iraq but they would rise sharply if a diplomatic solution were reached and obviously Japan would have pushed for a diplomatic solution preferring not to get involved in any worries about putting in military forces and this obviously in hand with the fact that this was the first international military incident since the Korean war that the US had acted so quickly towards doing something about they were put in a <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> situation here # then the second dimension i'm touching on is the # historical one do you have the right that's on okay <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> has to do with the idea of what had happened in the past when Japan had tried to persuade the independent diplomatic course # obviously up to this point they had Benefited by since World War Two they had Benefited being under the nuclear umbrella of the United States they had enjoyed the Benefits from the bilateral situation and they never felt the need to act as a custodian of the international order they had always completely accepted the existing order since the World War Two failure and there was a i mean they especially Benefited from the fact that never striking out on their own they had still been able to Benefit greatly from major elements of international economic order like I-M-F and G-A-T-T and these types of institutions so even though they had never tried to strike out and played the lead role something they may not have been used to not sure how to go about they had up to this point been getting all the Benefits so i guess to a certain extent it would just be the logic of why jump in now why at this point especially in terms of a crisis # generally from our perspective we thought that even though international structure did play quite a large role in determining the nature of Japan's response # we thought that domestic factors and crisis mismanagement was generally more important and they were not a result of Japan's traditional reluctance as a trading state to take sides in an international conflict and we also thought that it is important to note that within a historical perspective the government measures were swiftly implemented in an unprecedented in terms of the prominent role Japan played due to American pressure and the corresponding desire within the government for Japan to play a role in international affairs commensurate with its economic superpower size <kinesic desc="clapping" iterated="y" dur="2"/></u>
<u who="sf5177">we're just going to go through the main structure of what we're going to talk about: # impact of agency on the Gulf War reaction in Japan first we're going to outline the main agencies involved in foreign policy making and they're going through the constraints for example inter-minsterial disputes like the government arguments over the UN cooperation bill and the malfunctioning of international crisis management system Cath's then no <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/>'s going to talk about the limitations due to Kaifu <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> constitution they are and then Cath will go through constraints due to pressure groups public opinion and the media and divisions amongst political parties constraints due to the legacy of World War Two and then conclude with the results of such constraints on agencies policies with regards to Japan the main agencies involved in foreign policy would ref # to political and bureaucratic actors involved in decision making including the Prime Minister the diet the ministry of foreign affairs the ministry of international trade and industry defence agency and the transport ministry etc basically all of them for Japan's foreign policy it can be said quote: "that the multiplicity of agencies involved in external affairs is a source of confusion and inefficiency in formulation of foreign policy" this is true as well in regards to Japan's response to the Gulf War crisis one of the main constraints on agency was the malfunctioning of the international crisis management system # basically there was a need because of time constraints and political # nature of the issue there was a need for a top-down approach to decision-making rather than # a ringisei system which is like a bottom-up consensus approach which is used in Japan but so that made the bottom-up consensus approach inefficient and also there were so many agencies involved there was a lot of bickering between the different agencies for example the UN peace cooperation bill # the ministry of foreign affairs and defence agency were fighting over the composition of forces that were to be sent and who was to be sent there were daily heated arguments in cabinet with regards to sanctions # the ministry of foreign affairs and the M-T were at loggerheads with each other with the size of economic aid the ministry of foreign affairs and the finance ministry weren't agreed and just as Ian mentioned earlier i think shipping off road vehicles to Saudi Arabia the ministry of foreign affairs decided that they'd go they'd promised this while the ministry of transportation was still negotiating for labour unions <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> at all therefore they were basically unable to reach a consensus # in addition the pm Kaifu was very indecisive and at first he proposed that the S-D-F would take part in UN peace cooperation force but lat # changed his mind and said no maybe not so in general the decision making process can be seen to be very chaotic no set policies there</u>
<u who="sf5173"> # reactions of Prime Minister Kaifu Toshiki in addition to the bureaucratic and constitutional constraints constraints contributed to his failure to pass the UN peace cooperation bill this bill was presented at the diet session on October twelfth nineteen-ninety and was designed to allow the dispatch of the S-D-F personnel to trouble spots such as the Persian Gulf but due to opposition from members of the L-D-P the socialist party Komeito the Japan communist party and the # Japan socialist the democratic socialist party # it failed to win enough votes to pass through to the U-P-P- # house this failure added to the growing unpopularity of Kaifu whose weakness as Prime Minister was already obvious a weakness was most diff most physically seen when Kaifu was forced to agree to the rewritten bill that had been amended in his absence he was away # visiting America and the middle east and it was amended in his absence by the deputy chief cabinet secretary Ishihara who was himself influenced by other leading ministers his weakness was also obvious as he seemed to provide aid packages and financial assistance each time in response to US involvement and pressure from Prime Minister # president Bush there was much wavering and waffling in his in um indecision in the government statements about the bill itself this was because the traditional methods of debate such as the ad ad hoc committees and the diet the diet debates were avoided and it was hastily passed through also the bill was a contradiction in terms it stipulated that the S-D-F would not employ the use of force yet were being sent under the US military operations in addition to this there was also confusion as to whether it would be classed as peace keeping or peace making the constitution this was further confused the issue with regards to Prime Minister Kaifu with the S-D-F laws this made the dispatchment of the S-D-F abroad illegal and article nine of the constitution was itself the embodiment of pacifism article however article ninety-eight of the constitution also demanded that Japan honour its treaties Japan had agreed to the UN treaty that demanded all member countries make armed forces available to the security council so there was constitutional confusion everywhere and as i'd like to finish with # a quote that was made by prime minister Kaifu just before the outbreak of the war he announced in the foreign policy magazine that the way forward for Japan was: "dialogue and cooperation which were now replacing missiles and tanks as the tools for achieving order" and that "Japan would rely on economic strength as opposed to military capability"</u>
<u who="sf5178">as Sarah said i'm going to concentrate on constraints on Japan's political agent as a result of <trunc>controv</trunc> of the controversy of opinion in Japan firstly public opinion's an important factor the Kaifu government depended he depended heavily on this due to a lack of factional support within the L-D-P however the contradiction in public opinion which is existed in Japan and reflects the difficulties that Japanese political agents faced in policy formation for example # a majority whilst they clearly opposed dispatching military forces they also believed that # the cheque-book diplomacy was inadequate and half-hearted # the there was an Asahi poll which # shows the public opinion could also be a problem in the future as a constraint on # political agents for example sixty-seven of the Japanese favoured the use of non-military contributions in the future in the event of a future crisis nineteen percent still um nineteen favoured permitting the dispatch of forces whereas the rest remained unsure secondly the media # it's an interesting point cos it contrasts with this public opinion # there were three three out of four papers which i've never seen it mentioned lat # thought that Japan should take more military responsibility in the future these were the Sankei Shinbun who said well quoted in one edition "a nation must bear more risks" # the yomiuri sought re-examination of constitutional restrictions the Mainichi criticised the Japanese for their preference to send money rather than sacrifice their own blood and the Asahi was the only one that really supported the majority of public opinion which i mentioned earlier that Japan should maintain its non-military contributions # thirdly the division amongst political parties that was a a major constraint obviously there was the majority of the L-D-P supported the UN peace cooperation bill but the odd member for example the form # Prime Minister Fukuda opposed S-D-F involvement # the opposition party the Japan socialist party was # strictly against this bill apart from a few of the young # politicians <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> on the legacy of World War Two as a hindrance to political agents which links back to the public opinion # in Japan a deep aversion to military related mat matters was embedded in the way of thinking also there was much suspicion amongst the Japanese of internationalisation: the one that was forced upon them by the US and also must be considered that up to this point the economics first policy and subordination to the US had served Japan well up until now so again there's aversion to change # now the results of all these constraints on agents policies generally any aid packages and policies that were announced were vague and ineffective for example # in nineteen-ninety-one # a package called maximum aid set was announced however no military contributions were outlined at all and the scale of aid and details of activities were very vague also um belated gestures of cooperation were evident as a result of many hypothetical debates during the Japanese decision decision making process generally everything was slowed down an example of this is # debate over to send send mine sweepers the hypothetical debate that was occurring was if these mine sweepers were to be attacked would they constitutionally be allowed to fire back in this case so the resultant uncertainty um the <trunc>pol</trunc> the decision to send mine sweepers was delayed also as Ian mentioned at the beginning there's # political actors were generally full of rhetoric # rhetoric such as globalisation and internationalisation and because of such constraints generally they <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> i'm going to conclude with ways to improve the agents actions in the future # they need to politician Japanese bureaucracy and politicians needs to come up with a much more effective crisis management system # they also need a reinterpretation of the constitution not necessarily a complete reform but they need to include a more international perspective also # Japan just can't reform suddenly in a crisis so the political agents need to prepare Japan domestically # particularly public opinion # so i think in general if these issues and constraints are dealt with by Japan's political agents Japan may be ready for a future international crisis but the war in nineteen-ninety-one was generally characterised by Japan's political agents being reactive rather than proactive <kinesic desc="clapping" iterated="y" dur="2"/></u>
<u who="sf5179">okay finally we're going to look at the norms that constrained Japan in relation to the Gulf War crisis # first of all i'm going to look at the domestic norms # then Alex will look at international norms oh sorry international norms and then Alex nick's going to look at international norms and then Alex is going to look at changes in norms that the Gulf War brought about what we think anyway okay first of all um the biggest domestic norm is post-war constitution and Japan's legacy of # a pacifist state article nine of the constitution states that: "the Japanese people forever renounce war as a sovereign right of a nation and the threat or use of force as a means of settling international disputes" thus far this has been taken to mean that the S-D-F can only go into action if Japanese territory is attacked so ie exclusively defensive missions in their area # public opinion on this issue again # about Japan's involvement in the Gulf War consistently goes back to the constitution which has defined for most part the post-war Japan # and opinion polls from various newspapers back this up # in one particular nearly nearly half of those polled were unsure whether to send personnel at all to the Gulf never mind what for whether it was medical # back up troops or actually military force in another poll sixty-two wanted # a stipulation that anyone that was sent was for <trunc>mon</trunc> was for non-military use # the norm again showed itself in the proposed UN peace cooperation bill in October nineteen-ninety # the government was willing to set up peace-corps but only for monitoring and transport etc and the subsequent rejection of this bill again had links back to constitutional values # the role Japan wanted to assume and did assume in the Gulf War was that of kind of an international financier as it were it was willing to to pay for the war rather than get involved and # as is said for they paid thirteen billion US dollars towards it nine billion of those was a was kind of six months after the war had actually started and # much of that was to do with raise raising taxes within Japan to raise that nine billion dollars # Japan had already used this in the Iran-Iraq war in eighty-seven it had given economic assistance to Gulf nations in loans aid-packages and whatever it had seen itself as being quite successful in doing this # and this use of economic strength # was domestically considered considered enough for Japan to do and influences of economics and international politics was perhaps felt more strongly within Japan before the war started then the rest of the world felt afterwards # thirdly the anti-militarist and peace movement this is another area where the public and non-governmental organizations pressure the pressure form those came through again the legacy of the constitution and how the war is remembered in Japan is very important they tend to emphasise it being a bombed # in nineteen-forty-five rather than other atrocities that perhaps Japan inflicted on other nations # again this has to do emphasising this has to do with war guilt that Japan felt a certain responsibility for # the actions it took on other nations especially Asian nations # again another opinion poll showed that # the most popular answer to the question "what lessons have been learnt from the Gulf?" was that # Japan or maybe any other nation should establish a non-military system which shows an emphasis for the pacifist movement but also little understanding and or appreciation of international of their international position and expectations # again it can be said that that anti-militarists and peace movements # present in public opinion swayed the L-D-P to # reject the bill for sending troops and supplies to the Gulf forthly and finally <trunc>Ja</trunc> Japan-US relations play a part # in international relations Japan has for a long time followed the lead and the advice of the US it got stability from the US and also protection in terms of security and free trade but going into the Gulf War um while this was an acceptable norm in peace time or the cold war era it was brought into doubt by the strong # domestic norms ie the constitution and then and and anti-war sentiment and when the Gulf crisis broke out and Japan's constitution <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> came into conflict with its international duties it was forced to maybe reconsider this norm which Alex will talk about</u>
<u who="sm5185"># i'm going to talk about the international norms that # affected Japan's behaviour the first one i'm going to say is that # economic superpowers are sort of expect to take a role and # show responsibility in world affairs the obvious example of this would be the US in # cold war that they were particularly involved in situations of crisis around the world # although Japan in the end contributed thirteen billion dollars # it was not actually their soldiers that were at risk on that battlefield their mine-sweeping <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> operations in the light were not generally considered to be a fair share of the burden um in the west especially the fact that it was a a u a UN mission sort of gave it justification as a generally backed by most countries in the world so a just mission # in the far east on the other hand where relations with the UN aren't so cosy especially in terms of human rights and stuff # the idea of Japanese sending troops abroad would not have been quite so quite so um happily welcomed # force also seems more of a legitimate solution in dealing with national interests outside of Japan if you just take the example of Britain there's been the Suez crisis and the Falklands since the second world war which were the use of force force wasn't particularly popular # internationally but there was still set precedents for the Iraq crisis which Japan especially with Gulf War # left over from the second world war this put # put 'em in a bit of an awkward situation and as i said earlier our local # powers would not be too happy to see a rise in military power of Japan # Japanese-us relationships also # had an impact on this # with a US economic power gradually decreasing # it increasingly wants Japan to take a larger military military role to ease their burden article nine although it's actually # drawn up by the US is now seen as somewhat outdated and # count # to US and Japan's international interests again the local the local regional powers probably disagree with some of this china especially see doesn't want to a see a Japan rearmed and # it may be a slightly paranoid attitude but that's still important to # rearm and take a role military role outside their own borders</u>
<u who="sm5186">okay i'm going to take a look at what we felt came out of the Gulf War for Japan the Gulf War was like a big momentous occasion for Japan it actually forced it to confront a lot of issues # about self defence # the first point was the evolution of article nine # we felt that # then Gulf War forced Japan to relook at article nine and also look into its interpretation of how they interpreted article nine and what it meant # since nineteen-forty-five reinterpretations occurred on a numb # of occasions # after the Gulf War they finally had in nineteen-ninety-two peace keeping operation bill was passed and as a result we've seen Japanese uh soldiers involved in peace keeping operations in Cambodia and in Lebanon so as a result of the Gulf War # they've had to reinterpret article nine # not in just the context of defending their national territory but maybe looking at how that affects their national interests and international interests in the global # in the global world the second point was # the bi-polar world situation # a lot of the domestic and international norms had been set by the conflict between the Soviet Union and the western world in nineteen-eighty-nine with the fall of the Berlin wall # we saw the collapse of the Soviet empire # so there are two sorts of interpretations of what this led to one is that now we have a uni-polar world with America dominating and # as a result focusing the different international norms in its interests # on the other side you could argue that there's a multi-polar world and that's there more chaos and uncertainty in the world as a result of # there's no long # the pressure to conform to the black and white view of the cold war period and # Japan is a nation like other nations that has to respond to these international norms and # meet them with their own domestic norms so either their own domestic norms will have to evolve and change or international norms will have to evolve and change to fit with Japan obviously it's a lot easier to change domestic norms to fit in with international norms # the final point i wanted to look at was # the sort of concept of political citizenship which has # come out of the new world order # within domestic view within Japan there was a lot of dissatisfaction with domestic politics there's a lack of faith in politicians to do anything and as a result # there's been a corresponding increase in the numb # of people actively involved in non-governmental organisations # this is not unique to Japan: this has occurred globally as well # and the sort of great # feeling of within and outside of Japan that it should take great # sort of economic responsibility for make for it actions both en environmental considerations and to great # focus on quality of life and # the Gulf conflict has sort of helped focus on how they're going to achieve this # and how that's going to how they're going to play a full role in as a citizen of the planet that's everything we had to say <kinesic desc="clapping" iterated="y" dur="2"/></u>
<u who="sm5184">mm i have to say that the conclusions we're trying to say about what the Japan done you know and why did it act in that way and to use a cricketing analogy so i think you could say that Japan's foreign policy that it's run up was very good but its delivery was absolutely awful <vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" dur="2"/> and in many ways this is this is the this is the real thing important here is the international agency at home the government political actors i think are in many ways are the key although all the different groups and all like the international structure agency and the norms all work in in association with each other but i think agency was very important for why Japan did act in its way essentially Japan i think sat on its hands a lot of the time it it tried to under pressure from outside to react but at the end of the day it was so constrained by what what what it could do basically Japan Japan's government was weak internationally and weak internally and in many ways used the constitution as as i won't say an excuse but it is it's a way out "we'll we can't do anything because the constitution states we can't" which is very legitimate you know but it would take a much a much strong # government a much strong # government i'm sure would have been able to manipulate the constitution any way any way which they see fit to do it # it's not unusual that countries do do that and i think as i say again like a strong country would probably be able to manipulate the UN situation the constitution and probably public opinion as well to be able to deliver the goods in such a situation i would say that i think the international structure is really important here obviously the Japan-American relationship is really significant and Japan would not have found itself in the situation with the self defence force if America had not demanded it to invite troops if American made no demands Japan would not have deliver it would not need to deliver it was only president Bush i was saying before being on the telephone twenty-four hours a day to # <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> Prime Minister Kaifu who really put the pressure on Japan to make some sort of commitment to an international world Japan had been used to an international world in the eighties where in the Persian Gulf during the time of the Iran-Iraq war where tankers were under threat from # we say terrorist acts or attacks from nations the Japanese tankers were quite free to go under American protection into the Persian Gulf and back again and nobody said anything about it but in nineteen-ninety the situation had already changed America had lost a lot of its economic power i think America was afraid itself that it was losing its position and perhaps also frightened of over-committing itself in the Gulf which put Japan in the position well put America in the position where it had to say to Japan "look come on on we can't we can't do this anymore we can't just do its not going to be this hegemony any more where we can just # economically and military militarily police the world" perhaps if Japan had had a seat on the security council perhaps if Japan had had more input into the coalition they were allowed to have more input into the coalition perhaps things would have been slightly different so as i say i think it's a mixture of all these three groups but i would say definitely agency was weak and the Americans weren't very happy that <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> force one <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> agencies <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> so that's our conclusion <kinesic desc="clapping" iterated="y" dur="2"/> </u>
<u who="nm5168"><gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> choose from you to each other i mean i i thought they were quite contrastive in the in the way you presented em the undergraduate one was much more detailed about the agency and the conflict between the agents and how that affected the foreign policy process whereas the postgraduates said a lot more about the structure of the international system and how the structure of the system can constrain the way a state behaves so i think just on those two points there was there was quite a lot that you could ask each other but even on norms there were quite different ways that you emphasised the different role # that norms could play with some of you talking more about domestic norms and others saying what the contrast and contradictions may be between international norms and domestic norms and how that tension also constrained Japan so postgraduates first then and this is your chance to # sorry sorry the undergraduates to the postgraduates first so the Davids against the Goliaths with your your sling <vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" dur="2"/></u>
<u who="nm5168">okay who'd like to start out don't be shy most of you have lots of points that you've anyone <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/>you should # encourage your troops</u>
<u who="sm5184">come on <vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" dur="2"/> i think maybe the confusion is like what type of questions the people are a bit confused about what sort of questions we should be asking</u>
<u who="nm5168">well you're</u>
<u who="sm5184">and</u>
<u who="nm5168">you're trying to # weigh the different factors in explaining the Gulf crisis and you both came to different conclusions about why the Gulf crisis occurred</u>
<u who="sm5184">umm</u>
<u who="nm5168">which one's right are you right or are they right</u>
<u who="sm5184">so if i ask</u>
<u who="sf5179">we're right</u>
<u who="sm5184">if i ask</u>
<u who="nm5168">so in other words are there questions which which would strengthen your own case where you argued much more in favour of the domestic agency</u>
<u who="sm5184">um</u>
<u who="nm5168">in the light of the crisis policy making process within Japan</u>
<u who="sm5184">so that's</u>
<u who="nm5168">and that is a way to explain the way Japan reacted to the crisis postgraduates didn't tell us anything about that they said it was the structure of the international system which helps to explain the way Japan behaves which one of you is right</u>
<u who="sm5184">so we ask that in in the postgraduate's conclusion they were very <trunc>dismissi</trunc> dismissive about the agency part of what we what we believe what we find important so how would you believe that how could you justify that conclusion is that is that good enough <vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" dur="2"/></u>
<u who="nm5168">good start good start</u>
<u who="sm5171">well i think you actually just got it yourselves # in your talks when your agency group went they said that the agents were reactive rather than proactive and what were they reacting to they were reacting to structure and norms</u>
<u who="sf5177">that is true but the fact that they were reactive is that not quite a big part does that not show that agency plays quite a big part because of the way they acted because the way they act the way they sort of behaved in a was the main sort of sort really was the agency sort of what Japan actually did do to the Gulf War crisis the way in which they acted so does that not make them rather</u>
<u who="sm5171">so if they were proactive they would have reacted in a different way</u>
<u who="sf5177">it's not so much whether they're proactive or reactive</u>
<u who="sm5171">yeah</u>
<u who="sf5177">i don't know it's just the way you dismissed it as just like well agency just wasn't really very important</u>
<u who="sm5184">agency must be essential to policy decision</u>
<u who="sm5171">um</u>
<u who="sm5184">and like Americans didn't say "this is your foreign policy you must follow this foreign policy" because like in the nineteen-seventies with the United Nations what was the sea <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> the Japanese didn't follow American American lines on that at all they chose to pick and choose when they want to follow it it's in their interest and other things well sometimes they agreed to things and then don't do them you know so much rather agency well in reactions to domestic events and domestic opinion and things like that were really quite essential that to why Japan acted in this way if it had a strong # government it could have said no to America it could have said no we're not doing it you can't make us do it</u>
<u who="sf5177">hmm so your</u>
<u who="sm5184">you know</u>
<u who="sf5177">conclusion was</u>
<u who="sm5171">but they didn't</u>
<u who="sf5177">that agency</u>
<u who="sm5171">sorry go ahead</u>
<u who="sf5177">but your conclusion was that agency is basically a tool influenced by international structure and the norms</u>
<u who="sm5171">no we concluded that agency was reactive rather than proactive like you said and that is why it's more important to look at the things that made them react</u>
<u who="nm5168">yeah but you treated agency as the state they <trunc>cho</trunc> they treated the agency as the disaggregation of the state</u>
<u who="sf5177">cos you didn't you didn't mention say alright that in fighting between the different you know bureaucratic things like the different ministries and things like that and that played quite a big part in how Japan didn't react sort of or reacted late really and i don't think you really mentioned that at all</u>
<u who="sm5180"> i think maybe our position was that agency describes the manner in which a country or you know like a type of institution # responds but the actual reasons why a country like Japan reacts to a situation like the Gulf War is i mean i agree with him that we probably didn't talk about that enough <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> in fighting and stuff like that is # it creates the manner</u>
<u who="sf5177">that is but that is the reason why</u>
<u who="sm5180"> but that but why the thing is why</u>
<u who="sm5171">why the in fighting</u>
<u who="sm5180"> why the in fighting the bigger picture is that # the Japanese constitution and Japan's place in the international economy and also its # political significance in the and strategic significance in the US security system surely that's the major factor in # Japan's actions</u>
<u who="sm5187">no</u>
<u who="sf5179">so would you say</u>
<u who="sm5187">i think it's i think it's sorry i think its become quite obvious that that isn't the main factor simply because</u>
<u who="sm5180"> which wasn't sorry</u>
<u who="sm5187">the point that you just made was that # the main factor in how Japan reacted to it it was its economic position or <trunc>th</trunc> the position in the world</u>
<u who="sm5180">unh</u>
<u who="sm5187">i think you'll find that the reason it it reacted so the reason for it being reactive is that's because always going internally what was going on internally like anti-Japan anti-military movements and i think that's basically what they're all pointing to is that what causes</u>
<u who="sm5180"> sure</u>
<u who="sm5187">the problem if that didn't exist that wouldn't be a problem to start with</u>
<u who="nm5168">what's that you saying there norms which shape the agents or is it the agents themselves there's three right</u>
<u who="sm5187">they're part of the agents aren't they</u>
<u who="nm5168">well is it the norms which shape the way the agents behave or is it the agents themselves in their disaggregated form which is the way that your group's presented it it was disaggregated in that you talked about the unions for example ministry of transport ministry of finance you were arguing that for a very very complex policy-making process and that complexity meant that the crisis decision-making functions in Japan didn't work efficiently therefore Japan reacted in the way it did their argument is that irrespective of the domestic nature of that policy-making process the structure of the international system will constrain any state so that the weight is considerably different so irrespective of</u>
<u who="sf5177">it's not really both though</u>
<u who="nm5168">well which one is it</u>
<u who="sf5177">i wouldn't say its <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/></u> 
<u who="nm5168">so # you know</u>
<u who="sm5171">so</u>
<u who="sm5186">well what i was going to say is the interaction of all three and in different circumstances like in America the agencies were very strong they said "this is wrong we want this this and this" and that sort of led you know that fitted in with the international norms at the time which they accept and the um the norms the structure that was there allowed them to do that but Japan was very much in a different position as to how it how it reacted to the structures and its agencies were perhaps very different from different from many different countries</u>
<u who="sm5171">and</u>
<u who="sm5186">i think it's the emphasis within the interaction of the three that sort of determines it</u>
<u who="sm5171">i'd like to take up on this idea of international norms which you were talking about quite a bit i mean isn't that structure <vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" dur="2"/></u>
<u who="sf5179">if you're talking about an idea is that as an idea of structure</u>
<u who="sm5171">an idea</u>
<u who="sf5179">like a like a philosophy behind something</u>
<u who="sm5171">but the international norms that you were talking about were the exact same things as the structure that we were talking about so if that</u>
<u who="sf5179">so that</u>
<u who="sm5171">so if that isn't structure</u>
<u who="sf5179">so like a like a</u>
<u who="sm5171">what is structure</u>
<u who="sf5179">for example the the you could you could argue that say an <trunc>int</trunc> an international norm if that for want of a better word could be that you send troops to sort out a dispute is that would you agree with that as a kind of that's a kind of</u>
<u who="sm5180"> <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> and structure there</u>
<u who="sf5174">i think norms</u>
<u who="sf5179">is that would you call that a structure though</u>
<u who="nm5168">sorry do you wanna just step in</u>
<u who="sf5179">i think norms probably create a structure because if people are used to doing things one way then they're gonna kind of build up a system that allows them to sort of carry out their actions the way they've always been doing</u>
<u who="sm5184">but i could add to that just saying that probably international norms themselves are what probably was international structure from the second world war on to this point but what we're dealing with here is generally new territory and there's no norms existed for this like you had the Americans fighting with the Syrians together against the Iraqis you know there's no there's no sort of establishment idea on how on how this thing worked it was new territory for many of these countries especially America and it was the agency that was instrumental in bringing this about i don't think norms existed in many ways in during this during this conflict the as i say like there was such a big change in the world what were the norms no long # applied and it was difficult you know</u>
<u who="sm5171">but</u>
<u who="nm5168">but there were certain sorry</u>
<u who="sm5171">if there was such a change in the world is that a change in the structure</u>
<u who="sm5184">no i think well if there's a change in the world is there a change in the structure</u>
<u who="sf5182">but anyway</u>
<u who="sm5184">but it was in a state flux you know it was changing all the time and</u>
<u who="nm5168">yeah but some things remain constant i mean the</u>
<u who="sf5179">but i think what arguably i think what they were trying to say is obviously we could sit here and discuss whether or not like realists like politics liberals that go within Westphalian state system whether or not that's the structure versus whether the norms they produce where you'd be saying its obviously that structure was there you know maybe it was a little more fluid because the cold war etc had just ended but the point is is that because of that structure norms had developed and it wasn't just the structure it was this idea of it cos obviously people were operating within that structure doing different norms two different norms</u>
<u who="nm5168">so the norm the norm for example that that you # # that what # action Iraqi took was regarded by the international community as unacceptable is a norm which is embedded in the structure of the international system right there was no discussion about that that was an accepted by the international community how Japan or how the US responded to that is a separate issue but certainly within international even in international law it was regarded as unacceptable behaviour wasn't it so that was embedded within the international system even though the cold war had ended and there'd been that transition in the structure of the international system we still certain norms which were still constant from before the end of the cold war okay it's the other way round postgrads did you want to ask anything of the undergrads i mean it's a bit messy wasn't it all this stuff about domestic agency and stuff we're going to move on to <vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" dur="2"/></u>
<u who="sf5182">are we going to ask this</u>
<u who="sm5171">mm what we could do is nit-picking</u>
<u who="sf5182">yeah <vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" dur="2"/> it's just splitting hairs over the # importance of oil really i was just going to ask whether the fact that after the nineteen-seventy-three oil crisis and Japan diversifying its resources for oil did that not make the oil less important and there was also an argument within the Japanese ministry that even if the price of oil did rise which they didn't think it would even if it did that Japan Japan's economy would be # strong enough to cope with it and that they'd pay any price</u>
<u who="sf5179">so what's <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> the question sorry</u>
<u who="sf5182">so it's just um</u>
<u who="sm5171">cos it just appeared to us that #</u>
<u who="sf5182">you seem to stress the importance</u>
<u who="sm5171">of oil we disagree with that</u>
<u who="sf5182">yeah</u>
<u who="sf5179">you just think i over stressed it</u>
<u who="sm5171">well</u>
<u who="sf5179">and do i need to kind of defence that work can you just can you leave it that i overstressed it <vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" dur="2"/></u>
<u who="sm5171">just a bit more</u>
<u who="sm5186">it was important in the previous Gulf crisis i mean they had to cut back in eighty-one <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> but it did affect their economy not a grave amount but so i mean if if like i don't know your name</u>
<u who="sf5179">yeah</u>
<u who="sm5186">but in terms of fifty US dollars that's quite a lot at sixteen US dollars beforehand i mean it certainly your oil sort of energy costs shot up that much you've got to pass it on to the consumer you know people who are sort of buying your products can you afford to do that or are you going to rely on America to do the fighting and keep down the price of oil i think that's the point i'm making</u>
<u who="sf5182">hmm</u>
<u who="sf5179">the thing there was a <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> obviously Japan would have had enough resources to cope with it but it was more just the idea that it was a financial issue and an economic issue right whether or not they would be able to to get the resources that that was being they were they wouldn't have had any control over it right and that was a result of the fact that there was a war going on and they weren't sure what kind of role they were playing so obviously if they didn't play any sort of role in it or what kind of role they chose to play in the crisis situation would determine like how the resources would be effective afterwards it was more like enforce i think not necessarily like oh we're going to run out of oil therefore we should jump on the US bandwagon</u>
<u who="sf5182">um</u>
<u who="sm5171">we came to the conclusion that # no matt # who has control of the oil if it's Saddam or if it's Kuwait they will sell oil anyway to them and supply-demand will low # the price again they had that conclusion during the conflict</u>
<u who="nm5168">okay # let's # move on to the panel then because we're running out of time do you want to Philip and # Hiroko come up here</u>
<u who="nm5169">well okay</u>
<u who="nm5168"># perhaps perhaps we'll ask Philip first to give his impressions and # raise a question for the</u>
<u who="nm5169">well what my general observation is that # among the postgraduates we have a group of Japan specialists um</u>
<u who="nm5168">undergraduates</u>
<u who="nm5169">sorry i mean undergraduates and i think their specialisation i mean i think as as a school of east Asian studies i think we should feel quite pleased with the way in which those presentations went because it certainly does reveal that every specialisation is something that is worthwhile and important and the degree of detail and analysis that was done # on on # looking at the conflict from from the point of view of Japan's foreign policy and particularly from the point of view of agency # i mean in every perspective it was an impressive presentation but this # i think came out particularly strongly # and on the other side i would say that the Benefit of this course is again i'm associating myself to a certain extent with the undergraduates is that we have the Benefit of # specialists in political science and international relations who bring a heavy theoretical # knowledge and and experience to the group and i think we've all Benefited # from the the # knowledge and experience that they've brought on that side and # and it does it does raise the question of with events i mean even events like the Gulf War that that catch the whole of the international community by surprise to what extent in the system that that we're living in today the international system do # national governments and and and and independent national actors how important are the roles that they play how important are governments in governments one kind or another in the context of a system in which to a certain extent # things are almost preordained in in the way that they would be be worked through and # so from that point of view i've found the # the exercise very worthwhile and interesting</u>
<u who="nm5168">you were going to ask # a pointed question i know</u>

<u who="nm5168">but Hiroko do you want to say something first</u>
<u who="nf5170">mm well i leave evaluation with professor hook and doctor Charrier but i find it interesting especially # the discussion that began # regarding # norms and the system structure and how norms are implied from the structure and how correlate between the them and i would like to make a question that # um regarding the point um</u>

<u who="nf5170">for the U-S</u>
<u who="nm5168">ha ha</u>
<u who="nf5170">yeah for the U-S and for Japan how can Japan # # fill fulfil the <trunc>internation</trunc> # international responsibility the # and what is the best way for Japan at the time in that situation a really simple question</u>
<u who="nm5168">yeah but very difficult # okay let's try the postgraduates first then in terms of in the sense that that's the question behind the whole exercise: what should Japan have done i mean what is its international responsibility in such a situation and how can it fulfil that responsibility postgrads any anyone</u>
<u who="sm5186">i was going to say that what struck me was sort of how quickly it changed in <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> Japan and the west how to deal with the situation as being asked by America to participate and help out for American aims which were ultimately its international interests sort of aims that might have happened to fit in with great # sort of # international aspirations and Japan was basically asked to help out there and not knowing what to do you know the structure you'd lived by had suddenly changed was being asked to be more proactive so that that sort of got me mm</u>
<u who="nm5168">but can can Japan have a different role to play</u>
<u who="sf5179">i think # Japan's got it's recognized its economic wall and i think economically its its aid has been sort of befitting of its status but it's got responsibility now to get a more political role which is both be befitting of its status and equal to its economic aid so at the moment it's far too unbalanced so it needs to balance that out to fulfil its responsibility</u>
<u who="nm5168">so you would say that # an inbalanced state is an inappropriate state</u>
<u who="sf5179">well it's almost like it's it's a big state economically which obviously everyone's already recognised but it's trying to politically it's trying to remain a small state so the contradiction will well America won't let that work and # i know it's got a responsibility in the world today</u>
<u who="sm5181">but but but this is America who won't let it work i mean # other east Asian countries are not # they're not too too happy with the concept of Japanese remilitarisation you could have china who's a permanent security member vetoing that</u>
<u who="sf5177">i think that Japan has to weigh up like the influence of the US and the reactions of say the Asian countries in weigh up the importance of each one and develop a system what so crisis management system a set policy of how it should well react cos when the Gulf War happened it sort of thrown into the chaos it didn't even know where to look or what to do who to respond to that sort of thing they need to be a bit clear # maybe</u>
<u who="sm5171">i mean this is some</u>
<u who="sm5180"> yeah</u>
<u who="sf5177">what the important factors are that it should be reacting to</u>
<u who="sf5179">but it needs to do that at a time of stability rather than crisis i mean the Gulf War s set off all these debates but it can't really do anything <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> with a country let's say constitutionally restrained and idol ideology as well you can't just change that at a click of your fingers so you need to do they've got a responsibility to build it up and put more of a long term emphasis on that</u>
<u who="sm5181">but i think it's an appropriate time to just ask Japan it's a country that's ageing and i think the new generation is probably doesn't have as many # war time well it doesn't have any wartime traumas</u>
<u who="sm5187">but the problem is there's not enough emphasis being placed on the agents like in internally Japanese politics is is absolutely terrible they they aren't trusted and before that happens before there's a change internally in Japanese politics nothing will change externally and i think that's that's something that you can't forget i mean although you could argue that there's a new generation entering that same new generation that same that same sort of point has been made before was made in the seventies by people of <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> who said you know there's a new generation coming in they certainly barely lived through the war unfortunately nothing changed and something that you can't forget is if you live in a conservative society it's conservative people who are going to re-elect conservatives and fundamentally that's going to take a long time to change and until that changes you're not going to see an improve or change externally</u>
<u who="nm5168">a really clear position there Ben Hannah you've been wanting to #</u>
<u who="sf5182">can i just <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> what he said about international responsibility and # the Japanese people also thought that # roughly you know the failure of the UN peace cooperation bill showed that something needed discussion about Japan's international responsibility that's what was said and also since they're a member of the un and they decided to help out in international conflicts and so # they they can been helping their international conflicts without increasing their military much as shall we say and # on it was about three principles and they probably abide by the list to tolerance sovereignty and # not abide not appeasing aggression and also # peace and security which the UN # yeah which they signed and there's only south east Asia their neighbours would oppose so much any more Taiwan and Indonesia has shown an interest in Japan taking over taking on a bigger role in the security affairs</u>
<u who="nm5168">mm thank you Philip you have one question i know</u>
<u who="nm5169">i've changed my question <vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" dur="2"/></u>
<u who="nm5168">you've changed your question</u>
<u who="nm5169">yet again i i've just been reflecting that that really in the context of this crisis this Gulf War crisis for Japan that Japan emerged as somewhat of a political cripple unable unable to deal with with the crisis and we've seen that that this crippling of Japanese foreign policy probably resulted from several problems # spanning the whole range from structure right through to agency # we've seen since the Gulf War really Japan becoming an economic cripple # in the decade since the Gulf War almost a decade Japan has found it extremely difficult to get itself out of the recession it's been facing the question i have to ask is somewhat of an unfair one but # to what extent do the lessons and the # and the issues that emerged in the context of this discussion relating to the Gulf War # to what extent can those be applied also to the decade that followed and particularly the economic crisis that Japan found itself in and found that it had considerable dif has been finding it very difficult to get itself out of</u>
<u who="sf5179">i think like a major theme this is more general a major theme that i pick up from this class particularly is that there seems to be a very large gap between the political elite in Japan and how they view the world and the majority of the population it just seems to me that a lot of times when we're discussing popular opinion in Japan it seems very na?ve and i don't mean that in terms of necessarily you know not smart or anything like that just in terms of na?ve as to how the world actually operates they have isolated themselves to a certain extent built themselves up and they don't seem to understand why they can't just crash on to the scene and why things aren't good they don't understand how other people perceive them</u>
<u who="sm5171">mm</u>
<u who="sf5179"> and i think that it's just going to be a major problem for them unless they can get a class of political elites that will be able to bridge that gap know you know just so many of the comments that are like coming up all the time they just the majority of the well at least the voters or whoever don't seem to really fully grasp the implications that other people see that they have responsibilities whether or not they feel that they have those responsibilities themselves</u>
<u who="sm5187">the problem of # responsibility in Japan is one which i find particularly in my own personal experiences a fundamental and you don't it doesn't matt # what part of Japanese life or Japanese politics you look at responsibility always seems to be the main key issue and people not taking responsibility this you can look at in Japanese education in in pretty much any social area there's a problem of responsibility and you could attribute the problem of Japan's economy to the same problem of responsibility: who is to take responsibility who is to take responsibility for the Japanese banks crashing who is to take responsibility for # who # whether or not they should send troops to # to # Kuwait or to Kosovo i mean it's basically Japan has a fundamental problem with dealing with the problem of responsibility they they they they have a lack of of leadership in that sense there's nobody who really wants to take the role on of or take the flack of responsibility</u>
<u who="nm5169">how would you i mean how would you structure those answers in the context of structure agency and norms</u>
<u who="sm5187">it would take along time to do it but i would i would i can i could guarantee you i would be able to do it but i mean <vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" dur="2"/> the simple it's it's difficult because it i mean to be honest it just occurred to me now this just seems there's almost the same problems occur again and again in Japanese society as they do internally and externally and i think you could almost devise like an experience if you like you have the same problems everywhere i mean absolutely everywhere i think it's fundamentally speaking it's responsibility <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/></u>
<u who="sf5177">would that not come under # agency then probably cos we would argue that agency has been a major factor in how Japan <vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" dur="2"/> responded or didn't respond to the Gulf crisis and i think in the economic crisis we seen agency as quite a major factor as well the fact that when the bubble burst and a lot of problems were happening the sort of you know agencies buried its head and didn't really admit it for a long time and no one's really sort of dealing with anything proactive everyone's sort of just shifting about i don't really know exactly but like for unemployment they refused to admit for a long time that they had an <trunc>unem</trunc> unemployment problem until it was sort of really you know in the world's eyes and then they thought you know maybe so this was not picking up on things straight away and acting on them straight away which i don't know political anarchy <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/></u>
<u who="sm5186">after Kobe as well where it took them ages to mobilise the sort of civil defence forces to actually respond to that situation the army wasn't even allowed to go in because of the constitutional issue again going back to the second world war and sort of internal pressure so it's # how to deal with that and when the Americans offered aid tents and stuff it was turned down so there's sort of that issue how to deal with responses to crisis situation and not having a structure in place to like this is what we do then when we have this problem which maybe other nations do have in place</u>
<u who="nm5169">it sound from what you're saying as if with globalisation that that everything is speeding up decisions are having to be made more quickly systems are having to be more flexible and that that structures in Japan are straining under the under the under the in the changed circumstances and that particularly agency but i would think also norms # would be need to be # looked at quite carefully in terms of analysing the problems but i think i guess overall that structure would be something else that # what about on the what about on the postgraduate side</u>
<u who="sf5182">no i just well <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> Japan in the sense it's so recurring that the agency fails to come to quick responses: it has to be something deeper like the norms of consensus-seeking or conflict-avoiding and so something more than just agency</u>
<u who="sf5177">i was about to say as well the same thing that maybe it is the norms as well like just within an economic context now with restructuring and everything that laying workers off that wouldn't be such a shock sort of in the European system but for the Japanese you know when they laid off loads and loads of workers is quite recently seems a very big move and one that's sort of quite overdue i think because the norms are so there that you don't do that sort of thing in Japan</u>
<u who="sm5180"> i think yeah</u>
<u who="sf5177">it's sort of you know it takes them a long time to sort of change that mood and get going</u>
<u who="sm5180"> i think there's a sort of a dichotomy between Japan's domestic norms and the norms of the international structure <vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" dur="2"/> sorry but you know i think Japan's having difficulty in reconciling the two perhaps</u>
<u who="sm5171">yeah</u>
<u who="sm5181">just just the structure of the Japanese government compared to the United States you have a president that in the states who takes those decisions and they're obeyed and there's no there's nothing to it he's the command # in chief of an army he he he's the man <vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" dur="2"/> in Japan you don't in Japan you don't have a Prime Minister with all that power</u>
<u who="nm5168">okay # and anyone else who could slowly wind up and give the last comments Hannah</u>
<u who="sf5182">i just have a question for you</u>
<u who="nm5168">oh <vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" dur="2"/></u>
<u who="sf5182">it's still the the defence agency it's still on the Prime Minister's ministry <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> </u>
<u who="nm5168">yeah okay very # very rewarding i think the # the balance between # the different elements or explanatory variables that we are examining i think is is the key because you seem most of you seem quite happy to explain the Gulf crisis within those parameters which is quite interesting i thought you'd come back and say well actually you can't explain it by structure agency and norms you need to also include X Y and Z but all of the presentations either amplified structure mainly amplified agency we found a lot of different bureaucratic actors which were involved in the policy and also the way that norms is # have shaped the the behaviour of of those actors so i think in terms of at least some of the key variables that you can use to try and explain how and why a state behaves the way it does in response to changes in the structure of the international system i think is quite useful what i'd like to end on is is to suggest that that # all states are reactive and we seem to forget that the United States was reactive towards the Gulf war as as Japan was reactive towards the Gulf War the difference is that the norms which shape the behaviour of policy-making agents in Japan tend to come up with a an answer to the way that Japan should respond to that international crisis # in a way which is different to other states where the gap between domestic and international norms is not as salient it's a very salient gap in terms of Japan because those domestic norms and international norms are so different in terms of article nine of the constitution the way anti-militarism and pacifism has tended to shape # policy-making agents and other actors within domestic society whereas in the case of Britain or in the case of the United States people say "gung ho great send out the troops" because the gap between domestic norms and international norms is not salient at all in a sense those norms are what are regarded as normal that's just at this particular historical period</u>
<u who="sm5184">can i ask a question now i've heard that the American's have basically a blueprint and they've got lots of these blueprints that if such and such happens in such and such a place they've got a numb # of different plans now does that mean is that reactive to the fact that there might be a situation say in the Gulf or is it or is it proactive in the fact that they've thought ahead of themselves seems to suggest that they have that they should develop plans contingency plans and things like that</u>
<u who="nm5168">it's a contingent so the idea of reactive or proactive it's simply going back to the article you've all read about Japan's reactive state which was to argue that because of the the preconception that a major power in the international system takes a leadership role don't forget there are nearly two hundred countries that are members of the United Nations and we don't expect all of them to react in the same way it may be simply that because Japan has the economic power to make it # a big power in terms of the international system that it's behaviour is supposed to be similar to the behaviour of say the United States or other of the big powers in the international system but we don't expect Nepal or Venezuela or # any of the other one-hundred and odd states to behave in that way why is it that we expect Japan to behave in a particular way it's because of the expectations of the way big powers behave in the international system which means that you're conditioned by history in the way you view the way a state should behave so if if you reject that idea and argue instead that there are different ways that even big states can behave in the international system such as Funabashi's idea of Japan as a civilian power and that Japan will play a different kind of role even though it is a major international power and a major economic power that there are different options for states in the international system they don't all have to have nuclear weapons they don't all have to be members of the UN security council so i mean that's the sort of debate that's emerging in Japan at the moment with the question of whether Japan will revise the constitution or not what's Japan's identity going to be in the twenty-first century is it going to be a state which uses its military power as a means to realise its interests in the same way that it's used its economic power and hence become a "normal state" in the way that Ozawa Ichiro argues where it uses its full complement of power resources in terms of economics politics and military and uses those as instruments to realise the interests it wants to achieve or is it going to be a different kind of state and say well we're not going to use our military forces we're only going to use them through the United Nations in peace keeping operations we're going to use oda and other economic means as the way to realise our interests and we're not going to send troops abroad # to fight wars or to protect # protect resources or gain resources whatever so i mean there are different ways that Japan could decide to define its identity in the twenty-first century and i think the Gulf War started that debate that's why in a sense it was a watershed and the result is not known yet but it it really opened up the debate as to what kind of state Japan's going to be and what kind of identity it will have in the twenty-first century okay # we said we would go to the pub if people wanted to # if we don't then it doesn't matter either cos we haven't booked it or anything but # it's the # Star and Garter just at the back of the arts tow # and sometimes staff go there or students go there to if anyone wants to go along and have an informal chat at least i'll go <vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" dur="2"/> investigate
