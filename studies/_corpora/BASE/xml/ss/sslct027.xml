<u who="nf1207"> <kinesic desc="overhead projector is on showing transparency" iterated="n"/> one on learning <pause dur="0.5"/> next week <pause dur="0.4"/> Dr <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> will be starting <pause dur="0.5"/> the final section of this psychobiology course but this is the last one of mine <pause dur="0.9"/> and as i indicated in my last lecture <pause dur="0.8"/> up till now <pause dur="1.4"/> would you stop talking please <pause dur="0.5"/> thank you <pause dur="0.7"/> up till now <pause dur="0.6"/> i've been talking about animals learning individually <pause dur="0.8"/> and in this last lecture i'm going to talk a bit about <pause dur="0.5"/> what animals learn in the company of other animals in particular <pause dur="0.5"/> whether they learn from observing other animals and if so what <pause dur="1.2"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> the terminology i'll be using is that i'll be talking about <pause dur="0.6"/> quite a lot of experiments where some animals are observers that is they watch other animals performing <pause dur="0.6"/> and <pause dur="0.3"/> and <pause dur="1.0"/> other animals are the demonstrators or models that is they perform something <pause dur="0.2"/> or behave in a certain way <pause dur="0.3"/> and we want to know what the observers learn <pause dur="0.4"/> from <pause dur="0.3"/> watching the demonstrators or models <pause dur="0.6"/> well what might they learn <pause dur="1.2"/> basically the two kinds of things that they might learn correspond to the two kind of individual <pause dur="0.6"/> sorts of associative 
learning <pause dur="0.4"/> that i've been talking about in these lectures so far <pause dur="0.5"/> for example animals might learn from one another <pause dur="0.4"/> the significance of stimuli <pause dur="0.3"/> what foods are good or bad to eat <pause dur="0.4"/> what things are predators <pause dur="0.3"/> these are the kind of things that we know they can learn individually through Pavlovian conditioning <pause dur="0.3"/> but maybe they can learn it from watching other animals what other animal eat what other animals avoid as well <pause dur="0.9"/> the other kind of new learning i talked about in my last lecture <pause dur="0.4"/> is learning new actions <pause dur="0.5"/> for example <pause dur="0.3"/> learning how to get at or handle food <pause dur="0.7"/> this is the sort of thing that animals can learn individually through instrumental conditioning as i discussed in my last lecture <pause dur="0.4"/> perhaps they can also learn it to some extent <pause dur="0.3"/> by watching other animals <pause dur="0.4"/> and the two the sections of this lecture <pause dur="0.4"/> refer to experiments in which these two potential kinds of social learning are studied <pause dur="1.3"/> before talking about experiments <pause dur="0.2"/> i want to talk a bit about the kind of naturalistic 
data <pause dur="0.4"/> which suggest to people <pause dur="0.3"/> that this observational or social learning goes on <pause dur="0.5"/> that animals learn things from other animals in their social group or culture <pause dur="0.3"/> which they would not learn in other situations <pause dur="1.4"/> well <pause dur="0.2"/> there is lots of apparent evidence which has been interpreted as evidence of social learning <pause dur="0.6"/> for example if you look at different colonies or troops of chimps the same species <pause dur="0.4"/> but living in different parts of Africa <pause dur="0.5"/> you find that different <trunc>ch</trunc> <pause dur="0.5"/> troops show different behaviours <pause dur="0.4"/> for example some troops of <pause dur="0.2"/> chimps <pause dur="0.3"/> build nests in trees <pause dur="0.2"/> others don't <pause dur="0.7"/> is it possible that the troops that show this behaviour <pause dur="0.4"/> have learned it by <pause dur="0.6"/> joint learning by copying each other <pause dur="0.3"/> whereas the troops that don't show it have simply not had any demonstrators around so haven't had the opportunity to learn <pause dur="0.7"/> similarly <pause dur="0.3"/> certain specialized kinds of food getting behaviour <pause dur="0.6"/> there's a behaviour <trunc>i</trunc> a well known behaviour <pause dur="0.4"/> observed in chimps by Jane van Lawick-Goodall <pause dur="0.5"/> # which is termite fishing <pause dur="0.4"/> where <pause dur="0.4"/> a 
skilled chimp chimps <pause dur="0.2"/> feed off termites which are little ant-like creatures which live in mounds <pause dur="0.6"/> the termites have <pause dur="0.3"/> holes through which they enter and exit from the mound <pause dur="0.6"/> and chimps in some <pause dur="0.3"/> colonies <pause dur="0.3"/> have learned <pause dur="0.6"/> to <pause dur="0.4"/> get twigs or branches <pause dur="0.2"/> strip off the leaves from these twigs so they are nice and thin and pointed <pause dur="0.5"/> and poke the twigs down the holes into the termite mound sit and wait <pause dur="0.6"/> eventually termites will crawl on to the stick <pause dur="0.2"/> at which point the chimp whips the stick out and eats the termites off the stick <pause dur="0.7"/> now this is a quite a skilled behaviour <pause dur="0.3"/> but it's a very cunning way of getting termites out of mounds <pause dur="0.6"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> it's shown by some chimps and not others <pause dur="0.2"/> and more to the point <pause dur="0.4"/> young chimps have been observed <pause dur="0.2"/> watching their mothers do this <pause dur="0.6"/> and the question arises <pause dur="0.2"/> to what extent do chimps learn this skill by watching their mothers <pause dur="1.1"/> # <pause dur="0.8"/> another example <pause dur="0.8"/> of a similar kind <pause dur="0.4"/> which i mentioned in my last lecture <pause dur="0.5"/> is illustrated in this overhead <pause dur="0.8"/> it shows <pause dur="0.2"/> black rats <pause dur="0.3"/> i said in 
my last lecture black squirrel that was a mistake it's black rats <pause dur="0.6"/> feeding off pine cones <pause dur="0.4"/> you remember i said that black rats <pause dur="0.2"/> get quite skilled <pause dur="0.4"/> at stripping the exterior off pine cones so they can get at the kernels in the middle <pause dur="0.7"/> well adult rats of course do this skilfully <pause dur="0.4"/> and in the wild it's very often the case that young rats <pause dur="0.6"/> feed together with their parents <pause dur="0.6"/> watch them <pause dur="0.2"/> while they're feeding off pine cones and attempt to feed off pine cones at <trunc>thems</trunc> themselves at the same time <pause dur="0.5"/> so the question is <pause dur="0.3"/> to what extent are the young rats <pause dur="0.2"/> learning this skill <pause dur="0.3"/> by watching <pause dur="0.2"/> the black rats <pause dur="1.2"/> well you might say what are the alternatives the answer is there are lots of alternatives <pause dur="0.7"/> one possibility is just that <pause dur="0.3"/> young rats <pause dur="0.9"/> tend to <pause dur="0.3"/> follow their parents around <pause dur="0.3"/> so when the parents <pause dur="0.2"/> are among pine cones and picking them up <pause dur="0.4"/> the young rat <pause dur="0.2"/> also just because it's accompanying the adult rat <pause dur="0.3"/> will also be in the presence of pine cones <pause dur="0.2"/> also pick them up <pause dur="0.5"/> and it may learn the behaviour <pause dur="0.2"/> 
individually <pause dur="0.4"/> but just <pause dur="0.3"/> because it follows its rat it tends to do it its parent it tends to do it in the company of parents <pause dur="1.6"/> a slightly more sophisticated thing that the young rat might be learning <pause dur="0.3"/> is that pine cones are good <pause dur="0.9"/> they might be learning because their mothers <pause dur="0.4"/> spend a lot of time with pine cones <pause dur="0.2"/> there might be a kind of higher order conditioning going on <pause dur="0.4"/> whereas they associate pine cones with something good <pause dur="0.3"/> and therefore are attracted to pine cones themselves <pause dur="0.3"/> and to try to <pause dur="0.5"/> # try to get # <trunc>t</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> try them out <pause dur="0.4"/> and learn by themselves <pause dur="1.1"/> this <pause dur="0.4"/> what i'm getting at is that there are a number of simpler kinds of individual learning <pause dur="0.6"/> that might contribute <pause dur="0.3"/> to the young rats <pause dur="1.3"/> <trunc>i</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> to the way the young rat itself learns to interact with pine cones <pause dur="0.3"/> which do not necessarily involve <pause dur="0.4"/> the young rat <pause dur="0.3"/> actively learning its mother's actions <pause dur="0.3"/> or still less being taught by its mother <pause dur="0.9"/> as i have so often said in these lectures <pause dur="0.3"/> you have to discount simpler explanations <pause dur="0.3"/> before you can accept more complex 
explanations <pause dur="0.3"/> of what in this case the young black rat is learning <pause dur="0.6"/> so <pause dur="0.3"/> in the <pause dur="0.2"/> in <pause dur="0.6"/> in the later part of this lecture i'll be talking about how experimentally <pause dur="0.3"/> one might be able to distinguish between these <pause dur="0.4"/> rather simple explanations that what the young rat is doing individual learning but somehow enhanced by the presence of its mother <pause dur="0.5"/> or whether the young rat <kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="4"/> is really learning something by watching its mother <pause dur="0.5"/> that's the sort of question we have to address <pause dur="2.3"/> there are other <pause dur="2.2"/> there's another very well known example that i want to mention briefly and come back to at the end of this lecture <pause dur="0.6"/> which is the <pause dur="0.6"/> macaques in Japan macaques are a kind of monkey <pause dur="0.3"/> kind of rhesus monkey <pause dur="0.7"/> the macaques in Japan <pause dur="0.3"/> who learned to wash food <pause dur="1.2"/> they were <pause dur="0.4"/> these were macaques on an <pause dur="0.3"/> island colony <pause dur="0.5"/> which was <pause dur="0.2"/> provisioned artificially fed <pause dur="0.3"/> by people <pause dur="0.7"/> among the food they fed them <pause dur="0.3"/> were sweet potatoes <pause dur="0.6"/> these sweet potatoes tended to get sandy and dirty when they were lying on the ground <pause dur="0.6"/> and it was observed <pause dur="0.3"/> that 
certain individual macaques <pause dur="0.4"/> acquired the behaviour <pause dur="0.3"/> of dipping the potatoes in water or dropping them in water and then taking them out before eating them so they were nice and clean <pause dur="1.2"/> this behaviour was <pause dur="0.3"/> initially observed in a very small number of animals in fact in just one animal initially <pause dur="0.4"/> but it gradually spread through the colony more and more animals showed it <pause dur="0.6"/> and the question was <pause dur="0.2"/> was this social learning <pause dur="0.2"/> were the macaques learning from each other <pause dur="0.4"/> that it was a good idea to dip food in the water <pause dur="0.4"/> i'll come back to this question at the end of the lecture <pause dur="0.6"/> i won't stop with the rats diving for shellfish example because <pause dur="0.3"/> # i don't really have time but there are <pause dur="0.4"/> other examples where specialized behaviour such as diving <pause dur="0.4"/> to get shellfish from the bottom of a river <pause dur="0.4"/> are shown in just some colonies of animals <pause dur="0.3"/> and not others <pause dur="1.0"/> as i've tried to indicate <pause dur="0.3"/> these kind of observations while very fascinating <pause dur="0.3"/> do not themselves provide evidence of social learning <pause dur="1.0"/> i <pause dur="0.2"/> 
argued this in some detail in the case of the black rat <pause dur="0.3"/> but we can argue it more generally by saying that <pause dur="0.4"/> when you see a behavioural difference between different colonies of animals <pause dur="0.6"/> this might be due to learning <pause dur="0.3"/> social learning going on in one colony and not the other <pause dur="0.6"/> or it might be due to particular environmental conditions which are present in one group and not in another <pause dur="1.0"/> for example <pause dur="0.3"/> chimps who build nests <pause dur="0.4"/> might do so because the particular trees that they have exploited <pause dur="0.4"/> provide suitable material for making nests <pause dur="0.4"/> an environmental factor <pause dur="0.7"/> whereas chimps in other areas <pause dur="0.2"/> don't have such suitable trees perhaps if the chimps in other areas had suitable trees <pause dur="0.3"/> they too would learn to build nests <pause dur="0.2"/> individually <pause dur="1.2"/> # <pause dur="1.3"/> with the macaques watching washing food <pause dur="0.4"/> it could be that <pause dur="0.5"/> all the individual macaques are learning this by trial and error by instrumental conditioning without necessarily learning from each other <pause dur="0.5"/> and so on <pause dur="0.7"/> so <pause dur="0.4"/> we need some way <pause dur="0.6"/> to <pause dur="0.7"/> do controlled studies which <pause dur="0.2"/> 
manipulate <pause dur="0.3"/> what opportunities animals actually have to learn from each other <pause dur="0.5"/> and see whether they do in fact learn <pause dur="0.4"/> in the way <pause dur="0.2"/> that <pause dur="0.5"/><kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="4"/> that is being speculated <pause dur="2.0"/><vocal desc="cough" iterated="n"/><pause dur="1.0"/> my first set of examples come from <pause dur="0.5"/> <trunc>a</trunc> and and i'm going to talk about some fairly classic experiments in this lecture <pause dur="0.5"/> but <pause dur="0.9"/> i would point out before i go on that there is a really excellent chapter <pause dur="0.2"/> on this subject <pause dur="0.6"/> in Shettleworth's book <pause dur="0.8"/> which is <pause dur="0.2"/> referred to <pause dur="0.6"/> in <pause dur="0.7"/> the <pause dur="0.3"/> reference list for this lecture Sara Shettleworth has a superb chapter <pause dur="0.4"/> on <pause dur="0.2"/> social learning it's called learning from others <pause dur="0.3"/> it's very up to date <pause dur="0.2"/> very thoughtful very comprehensive <pause dur="0.6"/> and i'm going to mention just a few of the examples that she mentions but <pause dur="0.5"/> if you seriously want to think about this area and it involves many complexities <pause dur="0.4"/> her chapter is a very good place to go <pause dur="1.8"/> anyway <pause dur="0.8"/> some of the best known work <pause dur="0.2"/> on <pause dur="0.9"/> social learning <pause dur="0.2"/> or <pause dur="0.3"/> putative social learning <pause dur="1.1"/> in rats <pause dur="0.4"/><kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="3"/> in animals <pause dur="0.5"/> are about food preferences <pause dur="0.3"/> these are examples of learning the significance of 
stimuli <pause dur="0.3"/> learning what foods are good to eat <pause dur="0.2"/><kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="1"/> and what foods are bad to eat <pause dur="0.7"/> and as i pointed out in connection with the young black rats <pause dur="0.8"/> many animals eat <pause dur="0.2"/> in a social situation <pause dur="0.3"/> they will eat in the company of other rats <pause dur="0.4"/> for <trunc>ex</trunc> rats will eat in the company of other rats young rats will often eat in the company of their <pause dur="0.4"/> adult <pause dur="0.2"/> companions <pause dur="0.6"/> so <pause dur="0.5"/> the question arises what do they learn <pause dur="1.9"/> for example it's very well known <pause dur="0.3"/> that <pause dur="0.3"/> young rats will tend to prefer the same foods that their parents eat <pause dur="1.0"/> and in a simple experimental demonstration of this <pause dur="0.4"/> Galef <pause dur="1.2"/> got some <pause dur="0.2"/> adult rats <pause dur="0.7"/> and trained them by prior training <pause dur="0.3"/> using the taste aversion learning <pause dur="0.2"/> procedure that i talked about last week <pause dur="0.8"/> that a certain kind of food A <pause dur="0.2"/> was good to eat <pause dur="0.8"/> but they also learned to avoid another kind of food B <pause dur="0.2"/> by means of taste aversion learning <pause dur="0.5"/> so the adults prior to the start of experiment <pause dur="0.3"/> had learned that food A was good to eat and food B was nasty <pause dur="0.9"/> and they were provided with both foods A and B <pause dur="0.7"/> and then young rats <pause dur="0.3"/> 
were put in with the parents and allowed to accompany them while eating <pause dur="1.0"/> and of course <pause dur="0.4"/> naturally <pause dur="0.4"/> the parents ate lots of food A but avoided food B <pause dur="0.5"/> and naturally the young rats <pause dur="0.2"/> did the same <pause dur="0.3"/> if they were subsequently offered a choice between A and B <pause dur="0.3"/> the young rats would also prefer A <pause dur="0.9"/> the question is what had they learned <pause dur="0.2"/> from the parents <pause dur="0.5"/> the first basic question is <pause dur="0.3"/> had they learned that food A is good <pause dur="0.6"/> had they learned that food B is bad <pause dur="0.4"/> the parents knew both these things <pause dur="0.6"/> but had the young rats learned both these things had the adults communicated if you like to the young rats <pause dur="0.4"/> both that food A is good <pause dur="0.5"/> and that food B is bad <pause dur="0.9"/> to test this Galef did the following simple experiment <pause dur="0.3"/> he tested the young rats alone <pause dur="1.1"/> with food A versus a novel food that they'd never had before <pause dur="0.7"/> if the young rats know that food A is good <pause dur="0.2"/> they should prefer it to the novel food <pause dur="0.2"/> and they did <pause dur="0.8"/> so the young rats had clearly learned a preference of food A <pause dur="1.6"/> now to test whether the young rats had learned to avoid food B <pause dur="0.3"/> he tested them again on their own<pause dur="0.3"/> with B versus C <pause dur="0.6"/> 
if they learned from their parents that food B was bad <pause dur="0.3"/> they should have avoided food B <pause dur="0.2"/> and preferred the novel food <pause dur="0.2"/> C <pause dur="0.3"/> but they didn't they showed no preference at all <pause dur="0.8"/> in other words <pause dur="0.4"/> although the adults rats knew <pause dur="0.2"/> that food B was bad <pause dur="0.3"/> they had not transmitted this knowledge <pause dur="0.2"/> to the young rats <pause dur="1.1"/> so <pause dur="0.3"/> the young rats have learned to behave to some extent in a similar way to the adults <pause dur="0.3"/> but they had not <pause dur="0.6"/> learned all the information that the adults knew <pause dur="0.8"/> they had learned that A is safe but they'd not learned that B is dangerous <pause dur="0.8"/> and this simple experiment <pause dur="0.2"/> makes a very general point <pause dur="0.4"/> that just because <pause dur="0.5"/> an animal <pause dur="0.5"/> behaves the same way as another <pause dur="0.3"/> doesn't mean it's acquired all the knowledge that the other has there may be simpler means <pause dur="0.3"/> by which the young rats <pause dur="0.2"/> come to behave in the same way as the adults <pause dur="1.7"/> for example <pause dur="0.4"/> it might simply be that <pause dur="0.4"/> food A has become very familiar <pause dur="0.2"/> to the young rats <pause dur="0.3"/> if you imagine what's happening <pause dur="0.2"/> food A is over here food B is over here <pause dur="0.6"/> the adults eat a lot of food A <pause dur="0.3"/> 
ignore food B <pause dur="0.6"/> the young rats follow the parents eat where they're eating <pause dur="0.4"/> so necessarily the young rats eat a lot of food A as well <pause dur="0.4"/> just because they're spending a lot of time next to the parents <pause dur="1.1"/> what that means is that food A will become very familiar to the young rats <pause dur="0.6"/> food B will remain very unfamiliar <pause dur="0.6"/> and that in itself would just be a reason <pause dur="0.2"/> for the young rats to prefer A <pause dur="0.6"/> because animals as i've mentioned earlier in these lectures <pause dur="0.3"/> prefer familiar foods to novel ones <pause dur="0.6"/> it might simply be familiarity it might be nothing more than that <pause dur="4.4"/><event desc="takes off transparency" iterated="n"/> that simple experiments can't tell us which <pause dur="3.4"/> now <pause dur="2.7"/> the next experiment i'm going to talk about is one where adult rats <pause dur="0.7"/> learned <pause dur="0.2"/> by interacting with each other <pause dur="0.6"/> about <pause dur="0.3"/> what foods were good to eat <pause dur="0.4"/> so now we're talking about pairs of adult rats <pause dur="0.3"/> not young and adult rats <pause dur="0.7"/> and here <pause dur="0.4"/> the situation is much simplified because we don't have the situation where the young rats follow their parents around it's not a <pause dur="0.5"/> it's a much more straightforward situation <pause dur="0.7"/> 
the basic <pause dur="0.5"/> experimental observation <pause dur="0.2"/> which these studies are <pause dur="0.2"/> so which start from is this <pause dur="0.7"/> supposing you let <pause dur="0.2"/> one rat a demonstrator <pause dur="0.5"/> feed on a particular kind of food <pause dur="1.7"/> let's say it feeds on chocolate flavoured powder <pause dur="2.1"/> you then <pause dur="0.7"/> take that rat <pause dur="0.2"/> and put it in a cage with another rat <pause dur="0.2"/> who's never had chocolate powder before <pause dur="1.1"/> there is no chocolate powder present <pause dur="0.6"/> but the two rats will socially interact with each other <pause dur="0.2"/> and a lot of that social interaction involves <pause dur="0.3"/> sniffing <pause dur="0.5"/> licking <pause dur="0.6"/> grooming <pause dur="0.6"/> so that <pause dur="0.5"/> the <pause dur="0.4"/> observer rat the one whose never eaten chocolate powder before <pause dur="0.3"/> has a lot of opportunity <pause dur="0.3"/> to interact with the rat who's eaten chocolate and perhaps smell that food <pause dur="0.4"/> on the rat <pause dur="1.7"/> on on the demonstrator rat <pause dur="0.9"/> and you might well think <pause dur="0.3"/> that the <pause dur="0.3"/> observer rat would acquire a preference for chocolate <pause dur="0.2"/> as a result of this experience and indeed that's what happens <pause dur="0.8"/> observer rats who've been put in with a demonstrator who's previously fed on chocolate <pause dur="0.3"/> if they're then given a choice 
between chocolate and some other novel food <pause dur="0.3"/> they will prefer chocolate <pause dur="0.6"/> so clearly they're learning something <pause dur="0.3"/> from their encounter with the other adult <pause dur="0.8"/> but what exactly are they learning <pause dur="2.2"/><vocal desc="cough" iterated="n"/><pause dur="1.0"/><kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="2"/> Galef did a series of experiments where he kind of simplified <pause dur="0.7"/> the information <pause dur="0.7"/> that the <pause dur="0.4"/> observer rats were getting by means of this simple apparatus <pause dur="0.4"/> rather than letting the rats interact with each other <pause dur="0.4"/> and giving the opportunity for all sorts of potential <pause dur="0.2"/> social transmission <pause dur="0.6"/> he simplified the situation so that he could present <pause dur="0.5"/> the <pause dur="0.2"/> the <pause dur="0.2"/> observer rat here <pause dur="0.5"/> with a very simplified version of the information <pause dur="0.2"/> from the demonstrator <pause dur="0.4"/> he did it by putting <pause dur="0.4"/> the observer rat in this kind of bucket affair <pause dur="0.6"/> in the wall of the bucket <pause dur="0.3"/> was just a tube <pause dur="0.3"/> in which another rat <pause dur="0.2"/> could be placed <pause dur="0.6"/> so it was not possible for this other rat to actually get in the bucket with the observer <pause dur="0.7"/> but the observer <pause dur="0.2"/> could <pause dur="0.2"/> <trunc>int</trunc> could <pause dur="1.0"/> be exposed to <pause dur="0.2"/> whatever sensory stimuli were coming <pause dur="0.3"/> from the demonstrator rat <pause dur="0.5"/> and the 
demonstrator rat <pause dur="0.3"/> had eaten <pause dur="0.2"/> a particular food <pause dur="1.0"/> and the question is under what circumstances <pause dur="0.3"/> would the <pause dur="0.2"/> observer rat <pause dur="0.2"/> learn to prefer the food <pause dur="0.2"/> that the demonstrator had eaten <pause dur="0.4"/> ignore these graphs 'cause i'm just going to summarize <pause dur="0.3"/> the results <pause dur="0.3"/> of these studies <pause dur="1.3"/> in a moment in fact this is <pause dur="0.2"/> this is number three on your handout <pause dur="1.6"/><kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="2"/> so <pause dur="0.6"/> i've described the general <pause dur="0.5"/> # the general procedure <pause dur="0.9"/> what do observer rats learn <pause dur="0.3"/> when they have the opportunity to experience another food <pause dur="0.4"/> that <pause dur="0.2"/> # <trunc>th</trunc> <pause dur="0.5"/> another rat who has eaten a particular food <pause dur="0.9"/> and <pause dur="0.5"/> the observer rats were exposed to food X in a number of different ways <pause dur="0.3"/> and then on their own in the absence of the demonstrator <pause dur="0.3"/> they were given a <trunc>p</trunc> a choice between X and another food Y <pause dur="0.4"/> to see if they'd <pause dur="0.2"/> learned a preference <pause dur="0.6"/><kinesic desc="reveals covered part of transparency" iterated="n"/> and these were the kind of <pause dur="0.6"/> exposures that <pause dur="0.3"/> Galef could make in his bucket apparatus <pause dur="0.8"/> first of all you could have food X <pause dur="1.1"/> # <pause dur="0.9"/> smeared on the nose or mouth of the demonstrator rat <pause dur="0.8"/> and the demonstrator rat was just a normal awake rat <pause dur="0.3"/> so the observer <pause dur="0.3"/> could <pause dur="0.2"/> 
smell <pause dur="0.2"/> the food <pause dur="0.7"/> on the rat's face <pause dur="0.6"/> and also potentially maybe exchange some kind of information with the demonstrator <pause dur="1.5"/> the next <trunc>ex</trunc> the next condition was just the same except that the demonstrator rat was anaesthetized so it couldn't <pause dur="0.3"/> actively <pause dur="0.2"/> interact with the observer in any way <pause dur="0.4"/> but the food was still there on its nose and mouth <pause dur="1.2"/> in a third condition <pause dur="0.9"/> the rat who had the <pause dur="0.3"/> food on its nose and mouth <pause dur="0.3"/> was actually not alive <pause dur="0.9"/> the only difference was that <pause dur="0.3"/> in this case it was anaesthetized in this case it wasn't alive <pause dur="1.2"/> and <pause dur="0.4"/> you can see if you look at the result of the first three conditions <pause dur="0.4"/> that <pause dur="0.4"/> observers <pause dur="0.3"/> learned a preference for food X <pause dur="0.5"/> if they'd smelled it on the nose and mouth <pause dur="0.5"/> of a rat who was either awake or anaesthetized <pause dur="0.4"/> but not if they'd smelled it on the nose of the or mouth of a rat who was not alive <pause dur="1.3"/> it's important to realize people tend to assume that somehow <pause dur="0.7"/> the rats in condition three <pause dur="0.6"/> were <pause dur="0.2"/> avoiding a food 'cause it had been on the nose of the dead rat that's not the case at 
all they didn't avoid it <pause dur="0.7"/> they just treated it exactly the same as the other <pause dur="0.2"/> novel food they just treated it as it was completely unfamiliar they didn't avoid it all <pause dur="0.8"/> but in the first two cases they actively preferred it <pause dur="0.4"/> suggesting that for some reason <pause dur="0.5"/> they learned that this <pause dur="0.2"/> food is a good thing <pause dur="0.3"/> when they'd experienced it on the nose and mouth <pause dur="0.3"/> of an awake or anaesthetized rat <pause dur="0.4"/> so what was it that was crucial <pause dur="0.6"/> Galef tried two other conditions <pause dur="0.4"/> for example he said what would happen <pause dur="0.5"/> if you <pause dur="0.4"/> expose the observer to the food not on the nose and mouth but on the back <pause dur="0.3"/> of a live rat <pause dur="0.7"/> and in that case they didn't learn a preference either <pause dur="0.9"/> what happens if you just put it on a neutral base like a roll of tissue <pause dur="0.3"/> then they didn't observe then they didn't find a preference <pause dur="1.1"/> what Galef found in the end after these series of experiments that the only thing that was crucial <pause dur="0.7"/> there didn't have to be a rat there at all <pause dur="0.7"/> but that the observer rat had to experience the smell of the rat <pause dur="0.3"/> mixed with the smell 
of rat breath <pause dur="0.9"/> rat breath contains an unpleasant smelling chemical called carbon disulphide <pause dur="0.6"/> and what Galef found was that if he just exposed observer rats <pause dur="0.4"/> to the smell of food X plus the smell of carbon disulphide without any rat being there at all <pause dur="0.5"/> they would acquire just as much preference <pause dur="0.4"/> as if they'd smelled it on the face of a <trunc>wak</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> a waking rat <pause dur="2.2"/> what this implies is that there was no <pause dur="0.2"/> real <pause dur="0.2"/> social element to the learning in this case <pause dur="0.8"/> the observers had not learned to prefer <pause dur="0.3"/> the <pause dur="0.7"/> food X <pause dur="0.4"/> because of anything in the behaviour <pause dur="0.3"/> of the demonstrator rat <pause dur="0.6"/> but simply because if the demonstrator rat is alive <pause dur="0.5"/> that gives them the opportunity to smell it in the context of other rats' breath and this simple rule <pause dur="0.7"/> if you smell something <pause dur="0.3"/> in conjunction with a rat's breath it's good <pause dur="0.3"/> that's enough to produce <pause dur="0.2"/> this learned preference <pause dur="1.2"/> so <pause dur="1.0"/> this learning will normally take place in a social context <pause dur="0.3"/> other rats normally have to be around to generate the smell of rat breath <pause dur="0.4"/> unless an 
experimenter comes along and fools you by presenting you with carbon disulphide <pause dur="0.3"/> generally speaking you'll experience rat breath <pause dur="0.3"/> with <pause dur="0.6"/> a live rat <pause dur="0.6"/> but what this series of experiments shows is that the presence of the live rat is not necessary for the learning <pause dur="0.7"/> so <pause dur="0.4"/> this kind of experiment helps us to refine our understanding <pause dur="0.6"/> of <pause dur="0.3"/> what <pause dur="0.2"/> actually goes on <pause dur="0.2"/> as opposed to what might go on <pause dur="0.7"/> and <pause dur="0.7"/> it's <pause dur="0.5"/> it's very interesting to see how <pause dur="0.8"/> in real life <pause dur="0.4"/> a perfectly simple form of learning <pause dur="0.3"/> is enough <pause dur="0.2"/> to produce <pause dur="0.3"/> the desired effect <pause dur="0.4"/> that rats will produce foods <pause dur="0.4"/> which other live <trunc>ra</trunc> that rats will prefer foods <pause dur="0.2"/> that other live rats have eaten <pause dur="5.5"/> the next kind of <pause dur="6.2"/><kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="6"/> stimulus significance learning that i want to talk about <pause dur="0.3"/> is learning about predators <pause dur="0.7"/> clearly <pause dur="0.4"/> and i don't have time to go into this <pause dur="0.5"/> animals have many ways of signalling the presence of predators to each other like alarm calls <pause dur="0.5"/> it's very common for animals to learn <pause dur="0.3"/> what's dangerous <pause dur="0.4"/> in social situations <pause dur="1.0"/> and <pause dur="0.4"/> the experiments i want to describe now are a very <pause dur="0.5"/> 
well known and elegant series of experiments by Susan Mineka <pause dur="1.7"/> about <pause dur="1.0"/> the way in which <pause dur="0.6"/> monkeys <pause dur="0.2"/> learn <pause dur="0.9"/> that snakes are dangerous <pause dur="4.5"/> in <pause dur="0.2"/> their natural environment <pause dur="0.6"/> these are monkeys these are macaques again <pause dur="0.4"/> who live in the Indian who live in India <pause dur="0.3"/> mostly in <pause dur="0.7"/> jungle or in areas surrounding towns where are there are a lot of snakes <pause dur="0.4"/> snakes are genuinely dangerous <pause dur="0.5"/> and <pause dur="0.3"/> wild-reared monkeys monkeys that have grown up in the wild are all frightened of snakes <pause dur="1.6"/> however <pause dur="0.7"/> if you take <pause dur="0.7"/> monkeys who've been reared in a lab <pause dur="0.8"/> have never lived in the normal environment and have never <pause dur="0.3"/> come into contact with snakes they are not afraid of snakes at all <pause dur="0.4"/> you can show them a <pause dur="0.2"/> picture of a snake or even a real snake <pause dur="0.4"/> they'll just treat it as a novel and slightly interesting object <pause dur="0.6"/> so it seems very plausible <pause dur="0.6"/> that monkeys in <pause dur="0.3"/> the in the <trunc>le</trunc> in the wild <pause dur="0.5"/> learn to fear snakes from other monkeys who've already acquired the fear <pause dur="1.1"/> and Mineka set up an experimental situation <pause dur="0.5"/> where <pause dur="0.3"/> observer monkeys <pause dur="0.3"/> could watch 
who were of course naive and didn't fear snakes initially as you'll see <pause dur="0.6"/> could watch a demonstrator <pause dur="0.3"/> who previously had learned fear of snakes for example a wild-caught monkey <pause dur="0.5"/> and the question is <pause dur="0.2"/> what would the observers learn from the demonstrator <pause dur="1.8"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> to explain the <pause dur="0.2"/> procedure before i show you the data <pause dur="0.6"/> the observers were tested three times <pause dur="0.3"/> first of all a pretest when they were still naive and they'd never seen a demonstrator acting afraid of snakes <pause dur="1.1"/> 
a post-test immediately after they'd seen a demonstrator monkey acting afraid of snakes <pause dur="0.5"/> and then a follow-up three months later with no intervening training <pause dur="0.4"/> to see whether their <trunc>f</trunc> <pause dur="0.4"/> whether whatever they'd learned was persistent <pause dur="1.5"/> and the way the observers were tested was in a choice circus which was just a <pause dur="0.4"/> a round arena with four objects at the four corners <pause dur="0.3"/> one of which was a model snake <pause dur="0.6"/> and the other three were neutral objects <pause dur="0.5"/> and they simply measured <pause dur="0.3"/> how much time <pause dur="0.5"/> the observer monkey would spend <pause dur="0.2"/> near the snake <pause dur="0.5"/> if they were not frightened of snakes they'd spend about quarter of the time near the snake <pause dur="0.5"/> and a quarter of the time near the other objects <pause dur="0.4"/> if they were afraid of the snake they'd spend very little time near the snake <pause dur="0.3"/> and more much more time near the other objects so <pause dur="0.5"/> how much time they spend near the snake is one measure of fear <pause dur="1.0"/> the other measure of fear is that <pause dur="0.4"/> they used something called a Wisconsin test apparatus which is an apparatus simply where monkeys have to 
reach over a gap to get food <pause dur="1.3"/> and <pause dur="0.4"/> if you put <pause dur="0.2"/> a frightening stimulus in a glass box in the gap <pause dur="0.5"/> the monkeys will be reluctant to reach over it to get the food <pause dur="0.5"/> so in this test they put <pause dur="0.4"/> a snake <pause dur="0.2"/> either real or live in the glass box <pause dur="0.5"/> and look to see how slow <pause dur="0.2"/> the observers were <pause dur="0.4"/> to reach over the <trunc>s</trunc> over the snake <pause dur="0.3"/> to get a tempting bit of food <pause dur="0.5"/> and the slower they were and the more disturbed their behaviour <pause dur="0.5"/> the more frightened they were concluded to be of snakes <pause dur="0.2"/> so the question is how did the observers' behaviour change <pause dur="0.5"/> as a function of watching the demonstrators <pause dur="9.6"/><kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="4"/> the graph is slightly complicated perhaps i'll just stick to the top one <pause dur="0.5"/> which shows <pause dur="0.4"/> the time spent <pause dur="0.4"/> near the snake <pause dur="0.4"/> in the choice circus <pause dur="0.5"/> and remember <pause dur="0.5"/> an animal <pause dur="0.3"/> that is <pause dur="2.2"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> very frightened of a snake <pause dur="0.5"/> will spend very little time near the snake <pause dur="0.3"/> and much more time near other stimuli that are not snakes <pause dur="0.7"/> now this first graph here <pause dur="0.6"/> is not the behaviour of <sic corr="the">be</sic> observer but the behaviour of the model <pause dur="0.7"/> it's the behaviour of the 
monkey <pause dur="0.5"/> who really is frightened of snakes just to show you that if you really have a strong fear of snakes <pause dur="0.4"/> this is what you do <pause dur="0.6"/> in the <pause dur="0.3"/> choice <trunc>appara</trunc> in the choice <pause dur="0.2"/> circus <pause dur="0.6"/> mean time spent with each stimulus <pause dur="0.4"/> the stimuli are a real snake a toy snake <pause dur="0.3"/> a model snake and a neutral stimulus <pause dur="0.7"/> and you can see that the <pause dur="0.6"/> the monkey who really is frightened of snakes <pause dur="0.5"/> spends almost no time <pause dur="0.2"/> near <pause dur="0.3"/> either the real the toy or the model snake <pause dur="0.2"/> spends all its time near the neutral stimulus so that pattern <pause dur="0.3"/> indicates very strong fear of snakes <pause dur="1.0"/> what do the observers do <pause dur="0.6"/> okay here they are on the pretest when they're not afraid of snakes at all <pause dur="0.6"/> and as you can see they divide their time equally <pause dur="0.2"/> between the four stimuli they show no avoidance of snakes at all <pause dur="0.2"/> at the pretest <pause dur="1.2"/> but at the post-test when they've had an opportunity to watch an observer who is <pause dur="0.3"/> in the presence of a snake and acting frightened <pause dur="0.5"/> now they behave <pause dur="0.4"/> not as frightened as the model <pause dur="0.4"/> but very much more like the model 
they spend a lot of time near the neutral stimulus <pause dur="0.3"/> and very little time <pause dur="0.2"/> near the snakes so they have acquired <pause dur="0.4"/> fear of snakes <pause dur="0.4"/> just by watching another monkey <pause dur="0.9"/> and this fear is just as strong <pause dur="0.2"/> at the three month follow-up <pause dur="0.4"/> as it was immediately after <pause dur="0.9"/> so this is evidence that <pause dur="0.6"/> naive rhesus monkeys who are not afraid of snakes to start with <pause dur="0.5"/> can learn that snakes are dangerous <pause dur="0.3"/> just by watching another monkey they don't have to be bitten by a snake or attacked by a snake or anything <pause dur="0.4"/> they can just learn it by watching another monkey <pause dur="3.8"/><kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="7"/> there's another very interesting feature of this learning which i want to mention because it <pause dur="0.5"/> it allows me to link <pause dur="0.4"/> this phenomenon <pause dur="0.5"/> with another <pause dur="0.5"/> effect <pause dur="0.4"/> that i mentioned in my lecture a week ago <pause dur="0.6"/> you remember <pause dur="0.4"/> in my lecture a week ago i mentioned that <pause dur="0.4"/> contrary to what Pavlov thought <pause dur="1.2"/> associative learning is selective <pause dur="0.7"/> some <pause dur="1.0"/> pairs of stimuli if you like <pause dur="0.4"/> are easier to associate than others <pause dur="0.6"/> so <pause dur="0.6"/> tastes are easier to associate with sickness <pause dur="0.4"/> visual stimuli are 
easier to associate with external pain <pause dur="0.2"/> in the case of rats <pause dur="0.2"/> there are many other examples <pause dur="0.5"/> now this <pause dur="0.6"/> observational learning of fear by monkeys <pause dur="0.4"/> turns out to be <pause dur="0.5"/> to have rather similar properties <pause dur="2.0"/> we've seen in the last experiment <pause dur="0.3"/> that <pause dur="2.0"/> monkeys can readily learn <pause dur="0.2"/> to be afraid of snakes <pause dur="0.5"/> by watching another monkey who shows fear of snakes <pause dur="0.9"/> but can they avoid <pause dur="0.3"/> can they learn to avoid other stimuli <pause dur="0.4"/> not snakes <pause dur="0.5"/> by watching <pause dur="0.4"/> an animal <pause dur="0.3"/> another monkey <pause dur="0.2"/> who's afraid of those other stimuli <pause dur="1.2"/> the problem is how can you induce <pause dur="0.2"/> a monkey to act <sic corr="afraid">fafraid</sic> of a harmless stimulus <pause dur="0.5"/> well for this purpose <pause dur="0.4"/> Mineka very cleverly just used a split screen video technique <pause dur="0.5"/> she made a video of a frightened monkey <pause dur="0.9"/> and at the bottom of the screen she showed either a picture of a snake <pause dur="0.5"/> or by splicing in another video <pause dur="0.4"/> a picture of a different stimulus which in her case was a bunch of flowers <pause dur="1.7"/> so the observers <pause dur="1.0"/> were in two groups <pause dur="0.6"/> one group of observers <pause dur="0.5"/> watched a video <pause dur="0.3"/> apparently showing a monkey who was frightened of 
flowers <pause dur="0.2"/> but not frightened of snakes <pause dur="0.5"/> that's F-L-plus S-N-minus meaning <pause dur="0.6"/> this model <pause dur="0.5"/> monkey <pause dur="0.7"/> was afraid of flowers but not afraid of snakes <pause dur="0.7"/> the other group <pause dur="0.2"/> S-N-plus F-L-minus saw the opposite <pause dur="0.7"/> they saw a video of a monkey who acted frightened in the presence of the picture of a snake <pause dur="0.4"/> but not frightened in the presence of a picture of flowers <pause dur="0.5"/> and the question is <pause dur="0.9"/> would <pause dur="0.2"/> each of these groups <pause dur="0.2"/> learn to fear <pause dur="0.3"/> the stimulus that the model <pause dur="0.3"/> feared <pause dur="0.9"/> or <pause dur="0.2"/> as you might by now be expecting <pause dur="0.4"/> is there selectivity so that <pause dur="0.2"/> the observer monkeys <pause dur="0.4"/> can readily learn fear of snakes by watching a model <pause dur="0.5"/> but not readily learn fear of flowers <pause dur="0.4"/> and that's what happened <pause dur="1.0"/><kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> over here is the group F-L-plus S-N-minus <pause dur="0.5"/> who watched <pause dur="0.4"/> a video of a monkey who was frightened of flowers but not frightened of snakes <pause dur="0.6"/> and you can see <pause dur="0.7"/> in terms of their reaction here again <pause dur="0.6"/><kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> in this case <pause dur="0.3"/> slow responding indicates fear <pause dur="0.2"/> so i'm sorry this is the other way round from the last graph <pause dur="0.5"/> but <pause dur="0.5"/><kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> this is the case where monkeys had to reach 
over a snake to get food <pause dur="0.5"/> so if they're slow at reaching <pause dur="0.2"/> that's a long latency <pause dur="0.3"/> that means they're afraid of snakes <pause dur="0.8"/> so what you're looking for here is <pause dur="0.4"/> is there a long latency <pause dur="0.3"/> in the presence of real or toy snakes <pause dur="0.8"/> the black and white bars <pause dur="1.1"/> so here we see the group <pause dur="0.6"/><kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> who had <pause dur="0.4"/> watched a video of a monkey who was frightened of flowers but not snakes <pause dur="0.4"/><kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> here's prewatching the video and post-watching the video <pause dur="0.6"/> and you can see that <pause dur="0.3"/> first of all <pause dur="0.4"/> there's no change in the attitudes of these monkeys to flowers they haven't learned to fear flowers at all <pause dur="0.4"/> by watching another monkey being afraid of flowers <pause dur="0.5"/> if anything <pause dur="0.3"/> they've increased their fear of snakes a little bit <pause dur="0.6"/> even though the monkey they watched in the video was not frightened of snakes <pause dur="0.5"/> they've still <pause dur="0.3"/> somehow <pause dur="0.5"/> # presumably by stimulus generalization linked the two <pause dur="1.3"/> the other group were completely different the group who've watched a monkey frightened of snakes but not frightened of flowers <pause dur="0.3"/> show a big increase in fear 
of snakes <pause dur="0.7"/> high <pause dur="0.3"/> latencies for snakes <pause dur="0.7"/> so <pause dur="0.5"/> this kind of <pause dur="0.9"/> associative learning <pause dur="0.5"/> observational learning <pause dur="0.4"/> also can show stimulus selectivity <pause dur="0.4"/> and i don't think you need me to tell you little stories to understand why that <pause dur="0.2"/> might be <pause dur="0.4"/> advantageous <pause dur="0.6"/> because snakes are a genuine predator <pause dur="0.5"/> therefore <pause dur="0.3"/> monkeys who can rapidly and efficiently learn fear of snakes <pause dur="0.3"/> from a small amount of exposure to a frightened conspecific <pause dur="0.5"/> are the ones who are likely to survive if they meet an actual snake <pause dur="1.1"/> so <pause dur="1.2"/> i just wanted to show you that example not only because it's a very elegant experiment <pause dur="0.4"/> which has also of course <pause dur="0.6"/> been used to cast light on <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> some of the <pause dur="0.6"/> fears both learned and unlearned that humans show because of course as you know snake fears are extremely common in humans <pause dur="0.4"/> even humans who've never met a snake in their life <pause dur="0.7"/> so Mineka's experiments have been used to discuss the possible biological basis of snake phobia <pause dur="3.5"/> but <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> i think <trunc>th</trunc> # but i also wanted to make the point <pause dur="0.4"/> that there is <pause dur="0.3"/> associative 
selectivity in that as well as in other cases <pause dur="4.6"/><kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="4"/> the second kind of learning i want to discuss is the learning of new behaviours <pause dur="0.8"/> so far we've seen examples where animals <pause dur="0.3"/> learn something about the significance of stimuli <pause dur="0.6"/> in the food case <pause dur="0.4"/> they learned that food was okay <pause dur="0.2"/> but through a rather simple mechanism <pause dur="0.9"/> in the <pause dur="0.6"/> snake case they learned that snakes were dangerous <pause dur="0.3"/> <trunc>ra</trunc> in a rather specific way through watching other monkeys <pause dur="1.3"/> the next question is <pause dur="0.3"/> can animals learn <pause dur="0.3"/> complex new behaviours <pause dur="0.5"/> by watching others <pause dur="0.4"/> like <pause dur="0.4"/> the question <pause dur="0.3"/> can young black rats <pause dur="0.3"/> learn <pause dur="0.4"/> how to <pause dur="0.7"/> gnaw efficiently at a pine cone <pause dur="0.4"/> by watching their mothers <pause dur="5.8"/><kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="11"/> well experiments <pause dur="0.5"/> on this topic <pause dur="0.6"/> have basically the following kind of design <pause dur="1.2"/> obviously you have <pause dur="0.7"/> one group <pause dur="0.7"/> let's call them the experimental observers <pause dur="0.5"/> who have the opportunity to watch a trained demonstrator who's already learned a particular action call it X <pause dur="0.8"/> and importantly <pause dur="0.3"/> gets rewarded <pause dur="0.2"/> for performing action X <pause dur="0.4"/> because clearly <pause dur="0.4"/> if observers are 
going to learn <pause dur="0.6"/> that performing this action leads to good things like getting food out of a pine cone <pause dur="0.4"/> presumably they need to see <pause dur="0.3"/> the demonstrator <pause dur="0.3"/> actually getting <pause dur="0.2"/> food <pause dur="0.6"/> for performing the action <pause dur="2.5"/> and in the test <pause dur="0.4"/> the observers are put on their own without the demonstrator and the question is how good are they <pause dur="0.3"/> at performing action X or perhaps how quick are they <pause dur="0.3"/> to learn it by themselves <pause dur="1.0"/> we need a control group to compare this group to <pause dur="0.3"/> various kinds of control groups are possible <pause dur="0.7"/> you might have control who watch a completely untrained demonstrator who doesn't perform action X at all <pause dur="1.3"/> you might watch nothing at all <pause dur="0.8"/> a better control <pause dur="0.5"/> is to watch trained demonstrators perform action X but not get any reinforcement for it <pause dur="0.2"/> that's much a much better balanced control <pause dur="1.8"/> 
and if you find that it's the <trunc>expe</trunc> the experimental observers <pause dur="0.4"/> perform X more <pause dur="0.4"/> or acquire action X by themselves faster than the controls <pause dur="0.4"/> they must have learned something <pause dur="0.3"/> from watching <pause dur="0.5"/> the demonstrators <pause dur="2.0"/><kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="4"/> here's a simple example <pause dur="0.3"/> of such evidence <pause dur="4.9"/> this is an example that i took from Pierce's book <pause dur="1.1"/> # <pause dur="2.5"/> group E are the experimental observers who watch they're rats and they watched another rat performing action X which is pressing a lever <pause dur="0.3"/> and getting food <pause dur="1.0"/> there are two control groups <pause dur="0.2"/> control group one <pause dur="0.2"/> watch nothing at all they just watch an empty chamber so that's what i described as not a very good control group <pause dur="1.1"/> control group two <pause dur="0.6"/> experienced what i described as a good control procedure <pause dur="0.4"/> where they observed another rat pressing the lever so they saw the action <pause dur="0.4"/> but the action did not result in food <pause dur="1.1"/> finally all three groups of observers <pause dur="0.3"/> were put in the box on their own <pause dur="0.5"/> and allowed to press the lever for three days <pause dur="0.4"/> and in this case lever pressing did produce food so they 
had the opposite # the opportunity to learn for themselves that lever pressing produced food <pause dur="0.5"/> after watching <pause dur="0.2"/> these three <pause dur="0.3"/> possible demonstrations <pause dur="1.1"/> here's group E <pause dur="0.4"/> who <pause dur="0.3"/> had watched another rat pressing the lever and getting food <pause dur="0.5"/> and as you can see group E <pause dur="0.4"/> pressed the lever much more than the other <trunc>con</trunc> than either control group not only in the first session <pause dur="0.4"/> but they learned much faster as well <pause dur="0.9"/> so clearly <pause dur="0.3"/> group E <pause dur="0.2"/> had learned something <pause dur="0.2"/> from watching the other rat <pause dur="0.2"/> pressing the lever and getting food <pause dur="1.3"/> and <pause dur="1.1"/> what they'd learned was something <pause dur="0.2"/> different from what the controls <trunc>grou</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> from what the control groups might have gained <pause dur="0.2"/> from their experience <pause dur="0.4"/> it's interesting to notice by the way that the two control groups are very similar <pause dur="0.7"/> watching another rat pressing a lever and getting nothing <pause dur="0.5"/> really doesn't help you to learn <pause dur="0.3"/> any more <pause dur="0.4"/> than control one who watch an empty chamber <pause dur="0.3"/> so clearly watching the rat getting food and <pause dur="0.3"/> get <trunc>wo</trunc> pressing lever and getting food for it is quite crucial <pause dur="10.7"/><kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="12"/> 
now <pause dur="0.5"/> once again <pause dur="0.7"/> something is being learned <pause dur="1.4"/> but we can raise the question what is being learned <pause dur="0.3"/> how sophisticated <pause dur="0.4"/> is the learning that's going on <pause dur="1.3"/> when <pause dur="0.2"/> the rats in the experiment i've just described <pause dur="0.7"/> are better at learning to press a lever for food <pause dur="0.2"/> when they've watched another rat press a lever for food <pause dur="0.4"/> what might be going on <pause dur="0.6"/> and Galef again <pause dur="0.2"/> who has been <trunc>extreme</trunc> one of the most influential researchers in this field <pause dur="0.8"/> set out some possible ways in which <pause dur="0.3"/> the experimental observers might have learned <pause dur="1.6"/> one very simple one <pause dur="0.2"/> which is <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> perhaps <pause dur="1.6"/> rather like a very simple explanation that i offered for the young black rats learning about pine cones <pause dur="0.4"/> is what Galef called local stimulus enhancement <pause dur="0.7"/> what he meant by that is this <pause dur="0.8"/> perhaps <pause dur="0.2"/> what the experimental observers learn <pause dur="0.6"/> when they watch <pause dur="0.7"/> the demonstrators <pause dur="0.3"/> perform action X and get food <pause dur="0.6"/> is that <pause dur="2.6"/> it's a good idea to be near that lever <pause dur="1.3"/> that because another rat is near the lever <pause dur="0.4"/> they get interested in the lever <pause dur="0.5"/> so when they're allowed to 
try it out on their own <pause dur="0.3"/> they spend more time near the lever <pause dur="0.3"/> and as a result they learn by the sort of processes i described in yesterday's lecture <pause dur="0.4"/> how to press the lever for themselves <pause dur="1.3"/> now <pause dur="0.6"/> you should immediately be able to see that that cannot explain the results of the experiments i've just shown you <pause dur="0.4"/> 'cause if that were what was going on <pause dur="0.4"/> you should have got just as much enhancement of learning <pause dur="0.5"/> in <pause dur="0.5"/> control group two <pause dur="1.6"/> who watched another rat press the lever <pause dur="0.3"/> and get nothing <pause dur="0.5"/> after all control group two had watched another rat pressing the lever <pause dur="0.5"/> so if it was just <pause dur="0.3"/> local enhancement getting attracted to that area of the box <pause dur="0.5"/> then <pause dur="0.3"/> control group two should show just as much lever pressing but they don't <pause dur="0.7"/> so clearly <pause dur="0.9"/> local enhancement as Galef called it <pause dur="0.3"/> while it's <pause dur="0.5"/> logically possible <pause dur="0.5"/> can't explain that example <pause dur="1.0"/> however <pause dur="0.6"/> what about the second possibility what Galef called blind imitation <pause dur="0.6"/> which means just copying what another animal does <pause dur="0.5"/> but not being aware of the 
consequences <pause dur="1.1"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> you might say this is rather like <pause dur="0.5"/> kids who smoke <pause dur="0.6"/> because other kids smoke <pause dur="0.4"/> but don't actually care whether it makes them feel sick makes them ill later or whatever <pause dur="0.4"/> blind imitation <pause dur="0.2"/> without being aware of the consequences <pause dur="0.5"/> well once again this won't explain that example <pause dur="0.6"/> because otherwise again <pause dur="0.3"/> control group two who performed <pause dur="0.4"/> lever pressing without reinforcement <pause dur="0.3"/> should be likely to elicit blind imitation <pause dur="0.7"/> so that's not likely to apply here <pause dur="0.5"/> but one that certainly could be going on <pause dur="0.5"/> is what Galef called observational conditioning <pause dur="1.3"/> which is that what might be happening is not <pause dur="0.6"/> learning to associate the action of lever pressing with food <pause dur="0.3"/> but just learning to associate the lever with food <pause dur="0.7"/> perhaps <pause dur="0.3"/> the animals in <pause dur="0.4"/> the experimental group <pause dur="3.0"/> learn <pause dur="1.0"/> that <pause dur="0.7"/> every time they look at the lever <pause dur="0.2"/> because they're watching the rat <pause dur="0.2"/> food is delivered <pause dur="0.3"/> so they associate the sight of the lever with food <pause dur="0.5"/> whereas of course the other groups <pause dur="0.2"/> do not associate the sight of the lever with 
food <pause dur="0.7"/> it may not be <pause dur="0.3"/> learning the action of pressing the lever <pause dur="0.3"/> it may just be learning that that lever is a good thing it's associated with food <pause dur="0.5"/> and you all know what happens <pause dur="0.2"/> if you give that kind of Pavlovian training to rats <pause dur="0.4"/> if they learn to associate a particular object such as a lever with food what do they do <pause dur="0.3"/> they rush over to it <pause dur="0.3"/> they touch it <pause dur="0.2"/> they nose it <pause dur="0.4"/> and they're very likely to press it in the process <pause dur="0.4"/> get food for it <pause dur="0.4"/> and so this purely Pavlovian learning <pause dur="0.4"/> may <pause dur="0.2"/> set the scene <pause dur="0.2"/> for instrumental learning <pause dur="0.5"/> so this example could very well be <pause dur="0.5"/> what Galef called observational conditioning <pause dur="0.7"/> rather than what he called true observational learning <pause dur="0.5"/> I-E learning <pause dur="0.2"/> not just that the lever is good but you've got to press the lever to get food <pause dur="0.4"/> that's what Galef called true observational learning <pause dur="0.8"/> so <pause dur="0.6"/> how can one <pause dur="0.3"/> experimentally <pause dur="0.5"/> analyse <pause dur="0.5"/> which of these things is going on <pause dur="0.2"/> i've argued that not all of them could be going on <pause dur="0.3"/> in the rat case <pause dur="0.4"/><kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="13"/> but certainly <pause dur="0.2"/> more than one of them could <pause dur="4.4"/> a very 
neat experiment <pause dur="0.3"/> to try and <pause dur="0.6"/> sort out these possibilities <pause dur="0.9"/> is this one <pause dur="0.9"/> by Palameta and Lefebvre who were French Canadians which explains their <pause dur="0.5"/> # slightly unusual names <pause dur="0.6"/> still are French Canadians in fact as far as i know <pause dur="1.1"/> # <pause dur="3.6"/> in their case this was an experiment with pigeons <pause dur="0.9"/> they had <pause dur="1.6"/> untrained pigeon observers <pause dur="0.7"/> who observed trained pigeons <pause dur="0.5"/> performing a particular action <pause dur="0.6"/> under a number of different conditions <pause dur="0.6"/> the action was this <pause dur="0.8"/> the <pause dur="0.3"/> model pigeons were in a box which contained two bits of paper <pause dur="0.3"/> a red paper <pause dur="0.2"/> and a black paper <pause dur="2.0"/> underneath the red paper <pause dur="0.4"/> there was a bowl of food <pause dur="0.6"/> underneath the black paper <pause dur="0.2"/> there was nothing <pause dur="4.2"/> it was easy to train <pause dur="0.3"/> model pigeons <pause dur="0.4"/> to perform a particular action <pause dur="0.9"/> piercing the red paper with their beak <pause dur="0.5"/> to get through it to get the food from underneath <pause dur="0.9"/> so <pause dur="1.3"/> the true observational learning group <pause dur="0.2"/> of observers <pause dur="0.3"/> watched precisely that <pause dur="0.5"/> they watched <pause dur="0.3"/> a demonstrator pigeon <pause dur="0.3"/> perform the action <pause dur="0.3"/> of piercing with its beak <pause dur="0.8"/> directed at the red paper not the black paper <pause dur="0.4"/> and they 
observed it getting food as a result <pause dur="1.1"/> so <pause dur="0.5"/> if <pause dur="0.5"/> true observational learning is possible <pause dur="0.4"/> it should be particularly good in that group <pause dur="1.8"/> the other groups were given <pause dur="0.4"/> experience that might be expected to produce either blind imitation <pause dur="0.4"/> or local enhancement and the question is how much <pause dur="0.4"/> improvement <pause dur="0.2"/> in the behaviour would they show <pause dur="0.7"/> first of all what did the groups have well <pause dur="0.4"/> the naive group were just a control group who never watched a model anyway so they're just the baseline the controls <pause dur="0.7"/> the blind imitation group <pause dur="0.5"/> watched a trained demonstrator pierce the red paper but not get any food <pause dur="1.1"/> so if the only learning that was going on was blind imitation just do the same thing as the demonstrator <pause dur="0.6"/> that group should learn just as much as the observational learning group did <pause dur="0.9"/> if those groups were equal <pause dur="0.2"/> it would suggest that the learning was blind imitation <pause dur="0.5"/> but if the observational learning group were better than the blind imitation group <pause dur="0.3"/> it would suggest that learning was more than just blind imitation <pause dur="0.4"/> 
that it involved learning this action leads to food <pause dur="1.3"/> the local enhancement group and this was quite cunning <pause dur="0.7"/> they saw the red paper <pause dur="0.6"/> and they saw the demonstrator put the head through the red paper and get food <pause dur="0.5"/> but because there was already a hole cut in the paper the demonstrator didn't actually have to perform the action of piercing <pause dur="1.6"/> so that group would see <pause dur="0.6"/> what should produce local enhancement or observational conditioning <pause dur="0.5"/> that this red paper is good <pause dur="0.5"/> 'cause the pigeon goes near it <pause dur="0.4"/> and it's associated with food <pause dur="0.4"/> so if that's the basis of the learning <pause dur="0.5"/> it should be just as good in these two groups <pause dur="0.8"/> so the argument is that <trunc>th</trunc> there was another pair of groups which were tested after a delay but i won't waste time with them <pause dur="0.8"/> so by looking <pause dur="0.5"/> so <pause dur="0.2"/> subsequently <pause dur="0.6"/> the <pause dur="0.3"/> observers <pause dur="0.7"/> were <pause dur="0.3"/> put in the apparatus <pause dur="0.5"/> and Palameta and Lefebvre <pause dur="0.3"/> measured <pause dur="0.5"/> how much tendency they showed how quickly they learned <pause dur="0.3"/> to perform the action of piercing the red paper <pause dur="0.2"/> themselves <pause dur="0.6"/> and the argument was if the true 
observational learning group was best <pause dur="0.5"/> that suggests that more is going on than just local enhancement or blind imitation <pause dur="0.6"/> but if either of these two groups is as good as the <trunc>loc</trunc> the observational learning group <pause dur="0.4"/> that suggests that <pause dur="0.3"/> the learning can be explained <pause dur="0.4"/> by local enhancement or blind imitation <pause dur="0.3"/> and does not require <pause dur="0.4"/> the full <pause dur="0.5"/> panoply <pause dur="0.2"/> if you like <pause dur="0.9"/> shouldn't use this word with <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> here <vocal desc="laugh" iterated="n"/> he's testing out what language i use in my lecture you see i just realized that's a rather rare word <pause dur="0.2"/> anyway <pause dur="0.4"/> so <pause dur="0.5"/> if <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> pigeons who were <pause dur="1.3"/> learning the full <pause dur="0.2"/> experience if you like <pause dur="0.2"/> that <pause dur="0.2"/> this action is needed <pause dur="0.5"/> to get this food <pause dur="0.9"/> then <pause dur="0.7"/> only the observational learning group <pause dur="0.3"/> should <pause dur="0.4"/> be able to learn that <pause dur="0.2"/> and they should be best <kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="7"/> okay so what happened after all that <pause dur="4.8"/> forget the delayed groups we can just forget about them <pause dur="0.4"/> these are the four groups <pause dur="1.3"/> this is <pause dur="0.4"/> the true observational learning group who watched the model piercing <pause dur="0.3"/> the red paper and getting food <pause dur="0.9"/> 
this is their <pause dur="0.3"/> the latency of the observers <pause dur="0.2"/> to peck themselves over a series of trials <pause dur="0.3"/> these are like Thorndike's graphs showing <pause dur="0.4"/> the latency of responding getting faster and faster shorter and shorter <pause dur="0.4"/> as animals learn <pause dur="0.7"/> and you can see that that group <pause dur="0.5"/> really did learn fairly rapidly they took time on the first trial they weren't that wonderful they hadn't learned straight off <pause dur="0.5"/> but they fairly rapidly over a series of ten trials <pause dur="0.3"/> learned for themselves to perform the action <pause dur="0.6"/> none of the other groups was as good <pause dur="0.7"/> the group that was <pause dur="0.6"/> a little bit better than <pause dur="0.3"/> baseline <pause dur="0.3"/> was the local enhancement group suggesting that just local enhancement just learning that red paper is associated with food <pause dur="0.5"/> does produce some <pause dur="0.5"/> improvement <pause dur="0.4"/> so there is an element of local enhancement in this learning <pause dur="0.4"/> but much more of it is observational learning <pause dur="0.3"/> true observational learning <pause dur="0.4"/> the blind imitation group got nowhere <pause dur="0.3"/> suggesting that blind imitation just doesn't happen <pause dur="0.5"/> in this set-up <pause dur="1.2"/> and <pause dur="0.9"/> notice that these results are different 
from the results with the rats pressing levers there's no reason why the same learning mechanism should apply <pause dur="0.3"/> to pigeons learning to pierce a red paper for food <pause dur="0.3"/> and to rats learning to press a lever for food <pause dur="0.3"/> you have to do these experiments separately <pause dur="0.3"/> for each situation <pause dur="0.4"/> if you really want to know what's going on <pause dur="0.4"/> but the nice thing about this experiment <pause dur="0.4"/> is that it does demonstrate <pause dur="0.2"/> learning <pause dur="0.3"/> that an action leads to food <pause dur="0.5"/> and it rules out most of the simpler explanations except <pause dur="0.4"/> a very small element <pause dur="0.3"/> of local enhancement <pause dur="6.3"/><kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="5"/> finally then <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.8"/> i don't have time to discuss all these cases but <pause dur="0.5"/> these are the conclusions i'd like to draw <pause dur="0.9"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> we've seen from the lab studies that you can demonstrate these various types of observational learning <pause dur="0.6"/> but <pause dur="0.3"/> the underlying processes may not be obvious <pause dur="0.3"/> and they may often be much simpler than one would like to believe <pause dur="0.4"/> we're anthropomorphic <pause dur="0.4"/> we tend to believe that things go on in animals' heads <pause dur="0.2"/> similar to what would go on
in our heads when we're watching <pause dur="0.6"/> we think that if your mother shows you how to boil an egg <pause dur="0.2"/> you learn all about how to boil an egg <pause dur="0.3"/> and rats ought to be like that <pause dur="0.4"/> when they watch their mother <pause dur="0.2"/> <trunc>chew</trunc> chewing a pine cone <pause dur="0.3"/> they learn everything their mother knows that just isn't true <pause dur="1.0"/> animals' social learning is often a lot simpler <pause dur="0.5"/> than it would be in our case <pause dur="1.1"/> forget about the diving rats i'll leave that out because i haven't talked about it <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> i would like to talk finally very briefly about the famous primate examples <pause dur="0.7"/> you remember <pause dur="0.4"/> the case of chimps <pause dur="0.4"/> fishing <pause dur="0.3"/> for termites in a termite mound by putting in a twig <pause dur="0.5"/> and you remember the case of the macaques who washed food <pause dur="1.5"/> to what extent can we conclude <pause dur="0.4"/> that <pause dur="0.2"/> observational learning was responsible <pause dur="0.7"/> well in the case of termite fishing <pause dur="0.4"/> there's no doubt that young <pause dur="0.2"/> chimps <pause dur="0.4"/> intently watch their mothers <pause dur="0.2"/> when termite fishing <pause dur="0.7"/> and after watching their mothers <pause dur="0.5"/> they will often <pause dur="0.4"/> make a clumsy attempt to imitate <pause dur="0.4"/> they might get a twig <pause dur="0.4"/> they 
might wave it in the direction of the termite mound <pause dur="0.4"/> but just from watching their mothers they do not get skilled at it <pause dur="0.7"/> they <pause dur="0.3"/> do not learn from their mothers how to strip the twig they don't learn how to poke it in <pause dur="0.3"/> in a very stealthy way so that the termites will <pause dur="0.4"/> climb onto it without being <trunc>ditu</trunc> disturbed <pause dur="0.4"/> they don't learn the whole skill from watching their mothers <pause dur="0.5"/> after they've watched their mothers there is a long process of individual <pause dur="0.7"/> learning <pause dur="0.6"/> without necessarily another animal being around <pause dur="0.5"/> so they learn a little bit from observation but they don't learn the whole skill <pause dur="1.8"/> what about food washing <pause dur="0.8"/> well again <pause dur="0.2"/> there's been <pause dur="0.4"/> a lot of speculation about this example but i just want to show you <pause dur="0.9"/> i want to tell you two things about this finally <pause dur="1.0"/> the first is <pause dur="0.2"/><kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="2"/> this graph here <pause dur="0.2"/> which comes from Shettleworth's book which is pretty simple <pause dur="3.1"/> this shows <pause dur="0.9"/> observation of this colony where you remember <pause dur="0.5"/> the behaviour of washing <trunc>pot</trunc> sweet potatoes spread through the colony <pause dur="0.8"/> this shows over a 
series of years <pause dur="0.7"/> the number of monkeys in the colony <pause dur="0.5"/> who were either <trunc>o</trunc> observed <pause dur="0.2"/> never to wash potatoes and as you can see there were quite a lot of those <pause dur="0.9"/> the number who were observed to wash potatoes starting with just one in nineteen-fifty-three <pause dur="0.5"/> and increasing to about fifteen by nineteen-fifty-eight <pause dur="0.7"/> and also a few who were in the process of learning to wash <pause dur="0.5"/> now what can we learn from a graph like this <pause dur="0.8"/> this line <pause dur="0.4"/> the number who actually wash potatoes goes up really quite slowly <pause dur="0.3"/> goes up from one to fifteen in five years <pause dur="0.7"/> so if this is observational learning it's very very slow <pause dur="1.6"/> the other thing is to look at the shape of this graph <pause dur="0.5"/> it goes up sort of steadily <pause dur="0.9"/> now if observational learning were really important <pause dur="0.5"/> you'd think that <pause dur="0.6"/> the more animals had learned it <pause dur="0.7"/> the more new animals would have the opportunity to learn <pause dur="0.7"/> 'cause if there's only one monkey who shows this behaviour <pause dur="0.3"/> it's going to be very rare for other animals to have the opportunity to watch her <pause dur="0.2"/> and 
very few will learn <pause dur="0.3"/> it was by the way a female <pause dur="0.5"/> who was a young female who was number one <pause dur="1.4"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> but the more animals who were doing it you'd think the more opportunity <pause dur="0.3"/> other animals had to observe it happening so you'd think that this graph ought to go up more and more steeply <pause dur="0.4"/> whereas in fact it goes up rather slowly <pause dur="0.6"/> and Shettleworth argues that this kind of graph <pause dur="0.6"/> is much more suggestive <pause dur="0.6"/> of <pause dur="0.7"/> individual monkeys learning <pause dur="0.6"/> independently <pause dur="0.4"/> by personal by individual learning <pause dur="0.2"/> to do it <pause dur="0.4"/> rather than watching other animals <pause dur="0.3"/> one would like to believe that they do it by watching other animals <pause dur="0.4"/> but this kind of data is really not very compatible with that hypothesis <pause dur="0.4"/> it's much more compatible with individual learning <pause dur="0.4"/> individuals learning <pause dur="0.4"/> that oh this sweet potato tastes nicer if you put it in the water <pause dur="0.4"/> or maybe there was some local enhancement <pause dur="0.4"/> maybe they followed other monkeys to the water <pause dur="0.6"/> and thus had a better chance to learn themselves <pause dur="1.6"/> the other sad story <pause dur="0.2"/> about the monkeys <pause dur="0.2"/> on <pause dur="0.6"/> # Kashima 
Island <pause dur="0.7"/> is that it turned out later <pause dur="0.6"/> that you remember i've said that they were artificially provisioned <pause dur="0.2"/> they were fed by humans <pause dur="0.5"/> it turned out later <pause dur="0.4"/> that the humans who fed the monkeys were so charmed by this behaviour that they started training the monkeys to do it <pause dur="1.1"/> without the scientists knowing about it at first <pause dur="0.7"/> and in fact <pause dur="0.6"/> quite a lot of this <pause dur="0.2"/> increase <pause dur="0.3"/> could have been due <pause dur="0.3"/> to artificial training by humans <pause dur="0.3"/> rather than by the monkeys teaching each other <pause dur="0.6"/> now i <pause dur="0.2"/> i <trunc>d</trunc> i mean i'm ending these lectures on a note of scepticism i don't want you know to feel that there's nothing interesting to know about social learning in the wild there clearly is <pause dur="0.5"/> but the point i'm trying to make is that <pause dur="0.5"/> before jumping to the conclusion <pause dur="0.4"/> that some complex process is going on <pause dur="0.4"/> you really need to look a lot more closely <pause dur="0.6"/> at the experimental and behavioural evidence <pause dur="2.2"/> thank you
