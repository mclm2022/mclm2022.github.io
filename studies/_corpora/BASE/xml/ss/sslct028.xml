one area where the definition <pause dur="0.2"/> of expertise is <pause dur="1.6"/> vital is within the justice system <pause dur="0.6"/> so # expertise can actually be officially <pause dur="0.4"/> # conferred <pause dur="0.2"/> by a judge <pause dur="0.4"/> for the purpose of court room testimony <pause dur="0.6"/> and in fact <trunc>f</trunc> quite a few of my colleagues have been called up to court to give evidence as <pause dur="0.3"/> psychologists on various <pause dur="0.5"/> sort of different aspects <pause dur="0.2"/> particularly driving <trunc>dri</trunc> driver fatigue <pause dur="0.5"/> and various things to do with driving <pause dur="1.3"/> # <pause dur="2.5"/> and in this case <pause dur="0.8"/> the # <pause dur="0.2"/> definition of expertise <pause dur="0.5"/> is usually <pause dur="0.2"/> one on training this is # <pause dur="1.7"/><kinesic desc="reveals covered part of transparency" iterated="n"/> an official one this is actually in your handout <pause dur="6.1"/> okay so # for the purposes of justice <reading>the courts describe an expert as one who's qualified <pause dur="0.6"/> by training or experience to form a definitive opinion <pause dur="0.6"/> in areas of science arts or department of trade <pause dur="0.4"/> in which laypersons <pause dur="0.3"/> are not <pause dur="0.3"/> prepared to reach accurate conclusions</reading> <pause dur="2.0"/> but the problem with this sort of definition <pause dur="0.2"/> is that there is evidence that training <pause dur="0.7"/> and experience <pause dur="0.3"/> are <pause dur="0.2"/> poor criterion for judging the quality of an expert <pause dur="0.4"/> something we'll 
<pause dur="0.4"/> explore <pause dur="0.6"/> # later <pause dur="2.9"/> so # <pause dur="0.5"/> moving on to <pause dur="0.2"/> more psychological <pause dur="0.4"/><event desc="takes off transparency" iterated="n"/> like definitions <pause dur="0.9"/> <reading>expertise has been seen as the amount and complexity of knowledge <pause dur="0.6"/> gained through experience in a domain</reading> <pause dur="0.6"/> okay by the way this # <pause dur="0.5"/> these # <pause dur="0.2"/> definitions are in your handout so i think they are yeah they should be in your handout so <pause dur="0.3"/> don't need to scribble them down <pause dur="1.3"/> that's all right <pause dur="2.0"/> okay this is good old Eysenck and Keane <kinesic desc="puts on transparency" iterated="n"/><pause dur="1.0"/> our course textbook <pause dur="1.7"/> and # they stated that expertise means being good at specific <pause dur="0.2"/> problems <pause dur="0.7"/> within a specific domain <pause dur="1.4"/> in a lot of domains <pause dur="0.2"/> expertise <pause dur="0.2"/> is defined by peer review <pause dur="1.4"/> for example with driving <pause dur="0.2"/> top # police officers <pause dur="0.5"/> # top police drivers are often put forward <pause dur="0.4"/> as <pause dur="0.3"/> the model of driving <pause dur="0.4"/> so they can perform <pause dur="0.3"/> a range of skills <pause dur="0.6"/> which have <pause dur="0.2"/> been defined <pause dur="0.2"/> by other <pause dur="0.5"/> police drivers <pause dur="0.5"/> as being important <pause dur="0.2"/> to good driving <pause dur="0.3"/> like # skid control hazard perception <pause dur="0.5"/> vehicle control et cetera <pause dur="1.6"/> and most of the time this may be entirely sensible <pause dur="0.8"/> so <pause dur="0.3"/> you can assume that they must know something about what they're 
doing <pause dur="1.4"/> however police drivers have got a job to do <pause dur="0.6"/> and that job involves driving <pause dur="0.2"/> as fast as possible <pause dur="0.2"/> from A <pause dur="0.4"/> to <pause dur="0.2"/> B <pause dur="2.5"/> and with some <pause dur="0.2"/> advanced driving courses <pause dur="0.5"/> # which are usually run <pause dur="0.3"/> by <pause dur="0.2"/> police drivers <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> one problem with this is that people are often taught to drive <pause dur="0.2"/> like policemen <pause dur="1.0"/> and while this includes skills <pause dur="0.3"/> which have been shown to be beneficial to reducing accident involvement <pause dur="0.4"/> like hazard perception <pause dur="1.3"/> it can also legitimize <pause dur="0.2"/> practices <pause dur="0.3"/> which are inappropriate for people <pause dur="0.2"/> who aren't <pause dur="0.7"/> driving police cars <pause dur="0.5"/> so <pause dur="0.2"/> things like driving fast or making progress <pause dur="3.5"/> i'm very bitter about that 'cause i recently failed my motorbike test for failing to make progress by driving too slow round roundabouts <pause dur="0.7"/><vocal desc="laughter" n="sl" iterated="y" dur="2"/> and # <pause dur="3.0"/> here's another definition put forward by <kinesic desc="reveals covered part of transparency" iterated="n"/> some psychologists <pause dur="3.0"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> Ericsson and Lehmann nineteen-ninety-six <pause dur="1.8"/> argued that # <pause dur="0.4"/> <reading>expertise expert performance involves <pause dur="0.2"/> an individual <pause dur="0.8"/> being able to produce a <pause dur="0.3"/> consistent performance <pause dur="0.3"/> on demand <pause dur="0.5"/> over a range of tasks that are representative of
 of a domain</reading> <pause dur="0.9"/> that is <pause dur="0.3"/> expert <trunc>perf</trunc> # expert performers <pause dur="0.5"/> are those individuals who can reliably <pause dur="0.2"/> reproduce <pause dur="0.8"/> their skill <pause dur="0.2"/> their superior skill whenever <pause dur="0.3"/> you ask them to <pause dur="2.9"/> Ericsson and Lehmann <pause dur="0.2"/> argued that though this is quite a narrow definition <pause dur="0.3"/> the advantage <pause dur="0.4"/> of this sort of definition <pause dur="0.6"/> is that at last we have an opportunity <pause dur="0.5"/> for measuring <pause dur="0.3"/> expertise <pause dur="0.6"/> okay what we're doing here is operationalizing expertise <pause dur="0.5"/> so <pause dur="0.3"/> by by definition that means <pause dur="0.4"/> we can start measuring it in laboratory <pause dur="0.3"/> experiments the problem with all the previous <pause dur="0.3"/> definitions <pause dur="0.2"/> is because they're so nicely woolly and vague <pause dur="0.4"/> it's very hard to actually sit down and measure what we mean <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> by narrowing down the definition like this <pause dur="0.2"/> we can actually start measuring it <pause dur="0.4"/> which means we can start doing some science on it <pause dur="3.7"/> but as you can imagine <pause dur="0.5"/> evaluating <pause dur="0.2"/> performance is a real <pause dur="0.2"/> problem <pause dur="0.2"/> for this <pause dur="0.2"/> field <pause dur="4.1"/> for example what's a <pause dur="0.3"/> laboratory test for whether someone is an expert art <pause dur="0.2"/> critic <pause dur="1.3"/> so we could <pause dur="0.3"/> do something like <pause dur="0.5"/> develop a test of 
their knowledge <pause dur="0.5"/> of history of art but would that <pause dur="0.2"/> be a fair test of whether they were a good critic or not <pause dur="2.2"/> so there's great difficulty in <trunc>operi</trunc> <trunc>operisati</trunc> # <pause dur="0.2"/> operationalizing <pause dur="0.3"/> expertise <pause dur="0.5"/> in many domains <pause dur="0.2"/> so <pause dur="0.3"/> and actually measuring expertise <pause dur="0.2"/> quantitatively <pause dur="1.3"/> and <pause dur="0.4"/> what we find with our police drivers' peer review <pause dur="0.5"/> is often the only <pause dur="0.5"/> measure of success <pause dur="1.1"/> and # <pause dur="0.6"/> Goodyear in nineteen-ninety-seven <pause dur="0.5"/> brought up this point with respect to professional psychologists <pause dur="0.8"/> so with professional counselling <pause dur="0.2"/> psychologists for example <pause dur="0.5"/> how can we actually measure the quality of their work you know is it the number of people they successfully treat in the year <pause dur="0.3"/> in a year or something like that <pause dur="1.0"/> and <pause dur="0.3"/> with academic psychologists like me is it the number of papers published the number of research contracts i've won <pause dur="0.5"/> not the quality of the papers published <pause dur="0.4"/> okay <pause dur="0.2"/> and these are all things that <pause dur="0.2"/> you know are actually used to evaluate us <pause dur="0.4"/> in <trunc>ra</trunc> real life <pause dur="0.7"/> but you know <pause dur="0.2"/> are they <pause dur="0.2"/> fair measures <pause dur="2.5"/> okay <pause dur="0.3"/> i mean and 
you can see there's potential problems for that so for example <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> # we've we get although we get judged for teaching <pause dur="0.4"/> on a sort of department wide basis <pause dur="0.3"/> the teaching quality isn't actually <pause dur="0.2"/> formally assessed on a person by person basis <pause dur="0.2"/> okay apart from <pause dur="0.4"/> we get informal bits of feedback from the sort of sheets you fill in <pause dur="0.4"/> but # <pause dur="0.3"/> the actual formal assessment takes place on a department wide <trunc>proc</trunc> # process <pause dur="0.4"/> so at the moment <pause dur="0.4"/> # i actually have no personal <trunc>s</trunc> incentive for my career to <pause dur="0.2"/> sort of <pause dur="0.5"/> bother to sort of do any good teaching <pause dur="0.3"/> my all my incentive is based on research because that's <pause dur="0.2"/> what i personally get judged on <pause dur="0.2"/> not the teaching <pause dur="1.4"/> okay so there are problems <pause dur="0.3"/> in judging expertise <pause dur="0.3"/> in this sort of way <pause dur="1.6"/> so <pause dur="0.7"/> into the science how have people <pause dur="0.2"/> tried to get around <pause dur="0.5"/> these sort of problems <pause dur="1.7"/> well first thing they did <pause dur="0.3"/> was to choose <pause dur="0.2"/> a <pause dur="0.2"/> an appropriate domain <pause dur="0.7"/> and they chose a domain <pause dur="0.4"/> where expertise is well defined <pause dur="0.6"/> easy to operationalize <pause dur="0.4"/> and <pause dur="0.4"/> measurable <pause dur="1.1"/> and that domain <pause dur="0.9"/><kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="11"/> was <pause dur="0.2"/> chess <pause dur="10.0"/> okay <pause dur="0.3"/> so now <pause dur="0.4"/> chess was the # <pause dur="0.2"/> 
original domain for studying <pause dur="0.2"/> expert <pause dur="0.2"/> performance <pause dur="2.0"/> and the nice thing about chess is that there are <pause dur="0.2"/> clear criterion <pause dur="0.4"/> distinguishing novices <pause dur="0.2"/> from experts basically experts will beat <pause dur="0.5"/> novices <pause dur="1.2"/> and it's also <pause dur="0.2"/> a very well defined game set within a very rigid <pause dur="0.2"/> framework of rules <pause dur="0.8"/> and this makes it <pause dur="0.2"/> really nice for <pause dur="0.2"/> experimental work <pause dur="1.6"/> on the face of it it should be straightforward <pause dur="0.4"/> okay there's no <pause dur="0.3"/> # chance involved there's no <trunc>do</trunc> dice rolling or anything that that <pause dur="0.6"/> and there are a finite <pause dur="0.3"/> in theory finite set of moves that can be made at any one time <pause dur="1.5"/> but it's the sheer number <pause dur="0.2"/> of <pause dur="0.3"/> these possible moves which is overwhelming <pause dur="0.6"/> so just <pause dur="0.3"/> three moves into a chess game <pause dur="0.5"/> gives you more than nine-million <pause dur="1.7"/> distinct <pause dur="0.3"/> board positions <pause dur="5.4"/> and # on the face of it <pause dur="0.3"/> this should be an ideal task for a computer <pause dur="3.0"/> however attempts to design computers that can match <pause dur="0.3"/> the best chess players <pause dur="0.3"/> hasn't proved to be easy <pause dur="1.0"/> so <pause dur="0.7"/> what # computer chess <trunc>brai</trunc> # programs tend to do <pause dur="0.3"/> is search <pause dur="0.4"/> all available options <pause dur="1.1"/> for example a 
a recent one <pause dur="0.4"/> developed by I-B-M <pause dur="0.5"/> and known as Deep Blue <pause dur="2.6"/> considered about ninety-billion <pause dur="0.6"/> moves <pause dur="0.4"/> per turn <pause dur="2.1"/> at a rate of about nine <pause dur="0.2"/> billion <pause dur="0.7"/> per second <pause dur="5.0"/> okay and this is a computer that i think it eventually managed to beat Gary Kasparov but it was a close run thing <pause dur="1.5"/> but the point is <pause dur="0.7"/> that people <pause dur="0.2"/> can't do that <pause dur="0.8"/> our brains literally can't think <pause dur="0.3"/> at anywhere near that sort of speed <pause dur="1.4"/> so how come the best <pause dur="0.2"/> chess players human chess players still manage <pause dur="0.2"/> to beat computers most <pause dur="0.4"/> of the time <pause dur="1.3"/> well what are the best chess players doing <pause dur="0.5"/> that the computers <pause dur="0.2"/> and the novice chess players aren't doing <pause dur="3.0"/> originally <pause dur="1.7"/> it was assumed that chess experts were better <pause dur="0.4"/> as a result of superior intellectual capacity <pause dur="3.0"/> however <pause dur="0.2"/> it's # since been shown that expert chess players <pause dur="0.3"/> aren't actually any <pause dur="0.3"/> cleverer <pause dur="0.5"/> than anyone <pause dur="0.2"/> else or <pause dur="0.2"/> cleverer than a matched control group i should say <pause dur="0.9"/> so <pause dur="0.2"/> study found that their I-Qs are no higher <pause dur="0.2"/> than matched <pause dur="0.3"/> controls <pause dur="5.5"/> so <pause dur="0.7"/> if their mental capacity <pause dur="0.8"/> doesn't appear to be any higher <pause dur="0.2"/> 
than normal <pause dur="1.1"/> then presumably it must be their strategies <pause dur="0.8"/> which are superior <pause dur="4.2"/> so <pause dur="0.5"/> how has a chess performance been measured <pause dur="1.2"/> # lot of the <pause dur="0.6"/> original work which was carried out <pause dur="0.6"/> by <pause dur="0.3"/> de Groot <pause dur="1.7"/> and # <pause dur="0.4"/> what he did was get # <pause dur="0.2"/> two groups of chess players <pause dur="1.9"/> the first group were what he called experts <pause dur="0.3"/> and they were <pause dur="0.3"/> top local club players <pause dur="1.3"/> that's his definition of expert <pause dur="0.7"/> and he compared with an <pause dur="1.0"/> with an even better group <pause dur="1.1"/> the grand masters <pause dur="0.9"/> so <pause dur="0.2"/> grand masters are world class chess players <pause dur="0.2"/> so his comparison is between <pause dur="0.7"/> one really high level of expertise and a <pause dur="0.3"/> still a pretty high level of expertise and what <pause dur="0.2"/> he wanted to find out what is the difference <pause dur="0.2"/> between <pause dur="0.2"/> these two <pause dur="0.4"/> groups <pause dur="2.3"/><kinesic desc="reveals covered part of transparency" iterated="n"/> and what he did was # measure it measure <pause dur="0.5"/> # their performance and what they're thinking about <pause dur="0.5"/> with # <pause dur="0.2"/> verbal protocols <pause dur="0.6"/> and what verbal protocols are is simply getting people to talk aloud <pause dur="0.3"/> when they're doing the task <pause dur="0.2"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> then transcribing what they're saying and trying to analyse it <pause dur="1.1"/> okay so he analysed their performance by 
getting them to talk aloud <pause dur="0.4"/> and he also timed <pause dur="0.6"/> their responses <pause dur="4.1"/> and # he presented them with a <pause dur="0.3"/> game <pause dur="0.3"/> position <pause dur="1.5"/> and asked them to <pause dur="0.5"/> think aloud <pause dur="0.5"/> while deciding <pause dur="0.6"/> what move to make <pause dur="5.5"/> and <pause dur="1.0"/> he found that people were only considering <pause dur="0.3"/> about thirty <pause dur="0.3"/> alternative <pause dur="0.2"/> moves <pause dur="0.6"/> searching at most <pause dur="0.5"/> to a depth <pause dur="0.2"/> of six moves <pause dur="0.7"/> and <pause dur="0.3"/> frequently less <pause dur="3.3"/> okay <pause dur="0.2"/> and there's a <pause dur="0.2"/> nice summary of all this sort of stuff in Eysenck and Keane <pause dur="5.2"/> so the grand masters didn't consider more moves <pause dur="0.4"/> and they didn't search <pause dur="0.3"/> more deeply than the experts <pause dur="0.6"/> but they were <pause dur="0.3"/> <trunc>neverlethe</trunc> nevertheless slightly faster <pause dur="0.5"/> at getting to the right <pause dur="0.3"/> move <pause dur="2.0"/> and they also came to their chosen move <pause dur="0.2"/> earlier <pause dur="0.3"/> in their search through possible alternatives <pause dur="5.1"/> and # <pause dur="0.4"/> that was supported by the finding that the quality of the chess moves that these people were making <pause dur="0.7"/> remained high even when you <pause dur="0.2"/> forcibly reduced their search time <pause dur="0.4"/> okay so the <pause dur="0.3"/> the best players <pause dur="0.4"/> # still searching similar number of options <pause dur="0.3"/> but they're coming to the right option earlier <pause dur="0.4"/> in their search <pause dur="4.8"/> and in <trunc>a</trunc> in 
addition <pause dur="0.2"/> they found that the grand masters <pause dur="0.7"/> # actually came up with better moves <pause dur="0.4"/> which was assessed by independent <pause dur="0.7"/> raters <pause dur="5.2"/> and what # de Groot argued here <pause dur="0.7"/> is that the chess master doesn't generate moves by <pause dur="0.4"/> a simple search <pause dur="0.5"/> through possible alternatives <pause dur="0.7"/> which is exactly what our chess computers are doing <pause dur="0.2"/> to generate all possible <trunc>altern</trunc> alternatives and then go through them <pause dur="0.4"/> one by one <pause dur="0.9"/> instead our grand masters <pause dur="0.3"/> are using <pause dur="0.7"/> cued <pause dur="0.2"/> recall <pause dur="0.4"/> from memory <pause dur="11.4"/> okay so as i said the depth of search how many moves people are thinking ahead <pause dur="0.5"/> # increases up the level of our experts <pause dur="0.5"/> but it doesn't actually increase when people move on to be <pause dur="0.2"/> grand masters <pause dur="3.0"/> and de Groot suggests that the difference between these experts and these grand masters is that the grand masters have a <pause dur="0.2"/> superior knowledge <pause dur="0.7"/> of different <pause dur="0.2"/> board positions <pause dur="0.6"/> and what the best move from each position would be <pause dur="8.6"/> okay so the idea is that the expert <pause dur="0.2"/> can recognize <pause dur="0.6"/> the position <pause dur="0.7"/> and <pause dur="0.3"/> knows a good move from there <pause dur="0.5"/> and that means you don't 
have to think about <pause dur="0.2"/> all of the irrelevant moves <pause dur="0.4"/> which you know in advance are a load of rubbish <pause dur="0.4"/> because <pause dur="0.4"/> you've already you can recognize this pattern from your memory <pause dur="0.5"/> so you don't have to do what the computer is doing and go though all of the <pause dur="0.4"/> irrelevant <pause dur="0.3"/> <trunc>s</trunc> # possible moves as well <pause dur="0.7"/> and <trunc>ma</trunc> that makes it much more efficient <pause dur="0.4"/> and it means that you don't have to do <pause dur="0.5"/> do this # ninety-billion <pause dur="0.4"/> option search every time you make a move <pause dur="4.3"/> and # <pause dur="0.7"/> de Groot's colleagues found further evidence to support this in an experiment that involved chess master and expert players' <pause dur="0.4"/> recall of board positions <pause dur="2.1"/> they found that if the position was from an actual game <pause dur="0.7"/> than the grand masters 
<pause dur="0.4"/> were <pause dur="0.3"/> significantly <pause dur="0.4"/> better <pause dur="0.8"/> at remembering <pause dur="0.3"/> the position <pause dur="4.1"/> but <pause dur="0.7"/> if <pause dur="0.2"/> the position was random <pause dur="2.5"/> so you just <pause dur="0.2"/> pick your chess pieces <pause dur="0.2"/> whack them anywhere on the board <pause dur="0.2"/> nothing to do with the game <pause dur="0.7"/> then you found no difference <pause dur="0.3"/> between <pause dur="0.6"/> # the two <pause dur="0.2"/> <trunc>exp</trunc> <pause dur="0.5"/> expert groups no difference between the experts and the grand masters <pause dur="1.4"/> okay so <trunc>y</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> grand masters only get their advantage <pause dur="0.3"/> if they're trying to memorize an actual board position <pause dur="0.2"/> and they argued <pause dur="0.3"/> that <trunc>tha</trunc> this is because <pause dur="0.2"/> the grand masters simply <pause dur="0.3"/> knew more <pause dur="0.7"/> game <pause dur="0.4"/> positions <pause dur="6.7"/> so <pause dur="2.0"/> according to <pause dur="0.3"/> move on to Chase and Simon who followed up this work what <pause dur="0.2"/> differentiates <pause dur="0.7"/> expert chess players from novice chess players <pause dur="0.8"/> is that experts have stored <pause dur="0.4"/> and 
organized in memory <pause dur="0.5"/> many tens of thousands <pause dur="0.5"/> of <pause dur="0.2"/> different <pause dur="0.2"/> game <pause dur="0.2"/> positions <pause dur="2.4"/> and the idea is when they saw sensible game positions they could use the knowledge they had <pause dur="0.3"/> in memory <pause dur="0.9"/> to help them remember <pause dur="0.2"/> the various <pause dur="0.3"/> positions <pause dur="0.2"/> as integrated <pause dur="0.3"/> organized <pause dur="0.4"/> chunks <pause dur="0.7"/> of <pause dur="0.9"/><kinesic desc="reveals covered part of transparency" iterated="n"/> information <pause dur="3.7"/> and <pause dur="0.3"/> this is the sort of thing that Chase and Simon <pause dur="0.2"/> nineteen-seventy-three <pause dur="0.6"/> were looking at <pause dur="1.6"/> okay if you remember back to # <pause dur="0.3"/> about this time last year <pause dur="1.0"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> and my first year practical on <pause dur="0.2"/> memory chunking <pause dur="1.1"/> you'll remember that you could remember <pause dur="0.4"/> the same <pause dur="0.3"/> stimuli <pause dur="0.4"/> better <pause dur="0.6"/> when they were <pause dur="0.2"/> sort of chunked into groups <pause dur="0.3"/> that linked in <pause dur="0.7"/> with your own personal knowledge basis so remember i presented you with a list of <pause dur="0.5"/> sort of letters <pause dur="0.4"/> when i arranged them in one group in in certain groups they made no sense and so you're trying to remember each individual letter <pause dur="0.4"/> when i arranged them in other groups <pause dur="0.2"/> they actually formed <pause dur="0.2"/> # acronyms <pause dur="0.3"/> <unclear>sort of</unclear> common acronyms # <pause dur="0.4"/> so that instead of having to remember every single letter <pause dur="0.2"/> you could just remember <pause dur="0.4"/> 
the fewer number <pause dur="0.2"/> of acronyms <pause dur="1.4"/> okay so this is all Miller's stuff on there being room for <pause dur="0.5"/> seven plus-or-minus two <pause dur="0.3"/> items in short term memory <pause dur="1.4"/> but the size <pause dur="0.4"/> of <pause dur="0.4"/> what <pause dur="0.2"/> one of those items is <pause dur="0.3"/> depends on your <pause dur="0.4"/> personal <trunc>knowle</trunc> knowledge <pause dur="1.3"/> and Chase <trunc>an</trunc> <trunc>ar</trunc> Simon argued that <pause dur="0.6"/> chess players are chunking <pause dur="0.5"/> the board <pause dur="0.3"/> and the more expert you get at chess <pause dur="0.3"/> the bigger more complex <pause dur="0.3"/> your chunks <pause dur="0.6"/> become <pause dur="6.0"/> and # <pause dur="0.4"/> chess experts were found <pause dur="1.0"/> to be able to memorize board positions <pause dur="1.6"/> by breaking them down into seven or so <pause dur="0.2"/> familiar patterns or units <pause dur="1.6"/> and the difference between the <pause dur="0.2"/> novice and expert <pause dur="0.4"/> lay in the amount of information they could hold <pause dur="0.2"/> in one chunk <pause dur="15.2"/> so in # one experiment they did <pause dur="0.9"/> people had two chess boards in front of them <pause dur="0.8"/> on the first board was an arrangement of pieces <pause dur="0.9"/> and the second board <pause dur="0.3"/> was blank <pause dur="2.1"/> and what participants had to do was recreate the position they saw on the first board <pause dur="1.5"/> with the <trunc>pos</trunc> # <pause dur="0.5"/> sorry <pause dur="0.2"/> say that again <pause dur="0.4"/> what participants had to do was recreate the position they could see on 
the first board <pause dur="0.3"/> on the second board <pause dur="1.2"/> and what they measured <pause dur="0.4"/> was the number of glances <pause dur="0.3"/> that these people <pause dur="0.5"/> had between the two boards <pause dur="0.8"/> and how much <pause dur="0.6"/> they remembered <pause dur="0.2"/> in <pause dur="0.2"/> each of these glances <pause dur="1.9"/> okay <pause dur="0.5"/> so <pause dur="0.2"/> they argued that each glance between these two boards could be viewed as <pause dur="0.2"/> a chunk <pause dur="3.9"/> and better players could <trunc>rem</trunc> <trunc>r</trunc> recognize a chunk faster <pause dur="1.5"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> their chunks were also <pause dur="0.2"/> bigger <pause dur="10.8"/> and # work <pause dur="0.2"/> published <pause dur="1.0"/> in nineteen-ninety-six by <sic corr="Gobet">Gobel</sic><pause dur="0.2"/> and Simon <pause dur="5.2"/><kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="10"/> confirms this <pause dur="9.7"/> and # <pause dur="0.7"/> they demonstrated that <pause dur="0.2"/> retrieval processes involving <pause dur="0.8"/> recognition of board <pause dur="0.2"/> arrangements <pause dur="1.8"/> are actually instrumental <pause dur="1.9"/> in grand master level chess players' success <pause dur="0.4"/> compared with <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.9"/> less experienced <pause dur="0.4"/> other players <pause dur="7.8"/> okay so even when <pause dur="0.2"/> the grand masters were time constrained <pause dur="0.6"/> so they couldn't engage their looking ahead processes their performance isn't much affected <pause dur="0.9"/> okay <pause dur="0.6"/> and they argued <pause dur="0.7"/> this time that this suggests that an organized <pause dur="0.2"/> knowledge system <pause dur="1.0"/> is relatively more important to <pause dur="0.2"/> experts' performance <pause dur="0.5"/> than even the processes 
involved in predicting future moves <pause dur="0.4"/> okay so <pause dur="0.3"/> the key thing is organization <pause dur="0.4"/> of information <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> organization of knowledge <pause dur="6.8"/> having said that <pause dur="0.6"/> # Holding and Reynolds <pause dur="2.2"/> did experiment in nineteen-<pause dur="0.2"/>eighty-two <pause dur="0.7"/> # they reran de Groot's experiment using a random board position <pause dur="0.5"/> okay so again chess board <pause dur="0.4"/> and you just whack on the pieces at random <pause dur="0.4"/> nothing to do with the game <pause dur="1.2"/> and <pause dur="0.4"/> by comparing chess players of different levels <pause dur="0.7"/> on the move they would make from <pause dur="0.5"/> the random <pause dur="0.2"/> position <pause dur="1.7"/> they found that the experts produced better moves <pause dur="0.4"/> on <pause dur="0.3"/> even from these totally random board positions <pause dur="0.8"/> okay <pause dur="0.3"/> so the idea is here is that # <pause dur="0.4"/> the experts couldn't possibly have the board position previously analysed <pause dur="0.3"/> because it was a totally random board position <pause dur="1.1"/> # but they <trunc>inst</trunc> still generated better moves on from those random board positions so <pause dur="0.4"/> they argued that # <pause dur="1.3"/><kinesic desc="reveals covered part of transparency" iterated="n"/> we shouldn't be so one-sided about this <pause dur="0.3"/> and <pause dur="2.4"/> there is a important element of chess expertise that does involve <pause dur="0.8"/> evaluating <pause dur="0.2"/> board position as well

well defined as they are in chess <pause dur="0.2"/> so what research is there looking at expertise <pause dur="0.4"/> in domains with less rigid rules <pause dur="1.4"/> and in the literature areas commonly study studied <pause dur="0.8"/> involve <pause dur="1.6"/> <kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="5"/> things like <pause dur="2.1"/> chess <pause dur="0.3"/> medicine <pause dur="0.3"/> and <pause dur="0.6"/> computing <pause dur="3.9"/> so many of the features that characterize the expert chess players <pause dur="0.6"/> also seem to characterize experts in <pause dur="0.4"/> other domains <pause dur="1.2"/> for example the idea of information chunking <pause dur="0.4"/> was found to be important in the domain of computer programming <pause dur="1.3"/> computer programming it's been suggested that expert programmers <pause dur="0.9"/> have <pause dur="0.3"/> large chunks of code <pause dur="0.7"/> in memory that they can rearrange <pause dur="0.7"/> in order to solve a problem <pause dur="1.6"/> so the idea is that expert programmers can remember more code <pause dur="0.3"/> than novices <pause dur="0.5"/> and as Chase and Simon then showed with chess <pause dur="0.5"/> they can <pause dur="0.2"/> fit more information <pause dur="0.2"/> into one <pause dur="0.3"/> sort of memory chunk <pause dur="0.5"/> of code <pause dur="0.2"/> if you like <pause dur="3.4"/> okay <pause dur="0.6"/> as i said # <pause dur="1.9"/> well that was research by Adelson in nineteen-eighty-one <pause dur="2.3"/> one way of # analysing difference between experts and novices <pause dur="0.2"/> as i said previously <pause dur="0.2"/> is to get people to talk about 
what they're thinking of <pause dur="0.5"/> when their <trunc>solv</trunc> when they solve a problem <pause dur="0.7"/> and these are verbal protocols <pause dur="1.5"/> and # <pause dur="1.1"/> people have done this looking at these sort of domains <pause dur="0.6"/> and they've compared they've transcribed the commentaries and compared the statements people are making <pause dur="0.6"/> # between the expert and novice groups and they've also compared the length of time <pause dur="0.3"/> people have spent on various aspects <pause dur="0.6"/> of the problems <pause dur="0.9"/> and also the relationship between these sort of strategies <pause dur="0.5"/> used <pause dur="0.3"/> and the solutions reached <pause dur="2.9"/><kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="5"/> and <pause dur="1.3"/> it is using that sort of methods <pause dur="0.6"/> that # <pause dur="0.5"/> Glaser and Chi <pause dur="1.0"/> nineteen-eighty-eight <pause dur="9.2"/> found that # <pause dur="0.6"/> one difference <pause dur="0.2"/> between experts and novices <pause dur="0.2"/> is their different schemas <pause dur="1.1"/> for <pause dur="0.5"/> # solving problems within their own domain of expertise <pause dur="0.5"/> okay <pause dur="0.5"/> this bit of # overhead is actually on the handout so you don't need to scribble it down <pause dur="0.7"/> okay <pause dur="0.3"/> and so our schema <pause dur="0.5"/> what i mean by a schema <pause dur="0.2"/> is a sort of a plan <pause dur="0.2"/> an outline a structure <pause dur="0.2"/> framework a program <pause dur="0.7"/> okay so <pause dur="0.4"/> in this sort of context <pause dur="0.2"/> think of a schema <pause dur="0.5"/> as a sort 
of cognitive mental plan <pause dur="0.4"/> sort of guide for action <pause dur="1.0"/> okay especially in this case some sort of organized <pause dur="0.2"/> framework <pause dur="0.8"/> for solving problems <pause dur="1.1"/> and the <pause dur="0.2"/> schemas <pause dur="0.3"/> of experts <pause dur="1.0"/> have been argued to involve <pause dur="0.2"/> large <pause dur="0.3"/> highly <trunc>intercon</trunc> interrelated <pause dur="0.6"/> units of knowledge <pause dur="3.7"/> which are organized according to <pause dur="0.2"/> underlying structural similarities <pause dur="0.8"/> amongst these knowledge units <pause dur="2.0"/> okay <pause dur="1.8"/> so our experts large <pause dur="0.2"/> highly interconnected units of knowledge <pause dur="0.8"/> and connected together <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> by underlying structural similarities <pause dur="0.4"/> a contrast to that is the novices <pause dur="0.3"/> # the idea is that the sort of schemas <pause dur="0.2"/> that novices use <pause dur="0.4"/> in a domain <pause dur="0.5"/> are relatively small <pause dur="0.3"/> disconnected bits of information <pause dur="0.7"/> which are organized according to superficial <pause dur="0.5"/> similarities <pause dur="0.2"/> not structural <pause dur="0.4"/> similarities <pause dur="2.7"/> and # <pause dur="0.9"/> Glaser and Chi <pause dur="0.2"/> this is # <pause dur="0.5"/> <trunc>fun</trunc> # <trunc>th</trunc> this bit here is actually from # Steinberg <pause dur="0.3"/> <trunc>nineteen-ninety-ni</trunc> <trunc>wo</trunc> nine which i'll put in the # reprint collection <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> this is the difference between novices and experts <pause dur="0.2"/> and schemas <pause dur="0.4"/> it can be noted in how they 
classify different various problems <pause dur="1.0"/> # <pause dur="0.9"/> the idea's that experts and novices also describe the essential nature of various problems differently <pause dur="1.1"/> and <pause dur="0.3"/> determine how to solve <pause dur="0.5"/> various problems <pause dur="0.6"/> differently <pause dur="0.9"/> okay so <pause dur="0.3"/> three key expert <pause dur="0.2"/> novice differences <pause dur="5.8"/> and another thing that # researchers have found <pause dur="0.5"/> is that experts tend to spend much more time <pause dur="0.2"/> determining how <pause dur="0.5"/> to <pause dur="0.3"/> represent a problem <pause dur="0.2"/> than novices <pause dur="0.8"/> that's research by <pause dur="0.5"/><kinesic desc="reveals covered part of transparency" iterated="n"/> Lesgold et al <pause dur="0.4"/> nineteen-eighty-eight <pause dur="3.0"/> okay so experts spend more time representing the problem <pause dur="0.3"/> but <pause dur="0.2"/> they spent less time <pause dur="0.3"/> implementing <pause dur="0.4"/> that <trunc>solu</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> the solution <pause dur="0.4"/> or the strategy for <trunc>th</trunc> the solution <pause dur="7.8"/> and in contrast <pause dur="0.2"/> novices tend to dive into a problem <pause dur="0.3"/> without so much of this <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> initial analysis and hence spent much more time <pause dur="0.3"/> trying to figure out <pause dur="0.4"/> solution <pause dur="0.2"/> to the problem <pause dur="3.4"/> so differences between experts and novices in these sort of domains <pause dur="0.3"/> in their expenditure of time could be viewed in terms of the focus <pause dur="0.5"/> and the direction of their problem solving <pause dur="0.3"/> experts 
spend more time figuring out what they <pause dur="0.3"/> already know about the problem <pause dur="0.4"/> and how the information given in a problem <pause dur="0.2"/> maps on to what <pause dur="0.7"/> they already know <pause dur="0.9"/> and the idea is once the expert finds a previously existing strategy for solving <pause dur="0.4"/> the problem they can just put it down out of memory <pause dur="0.4"/> and implement it <pause dur="0.6"/> without too much bother <pause dur="1.9"/> okay <pause dur="0.9"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> another way to describe that <pause dur="0.2"/> is that experts are <pause dur="0.3"/> working forward <pause dur="1.4"/> from the given information <pause dur="0.4"/> to find <pause dur="0.7"/> their unknown information <pause dur="0.6"/> okay <pause dur="5.4"/><kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="2"/> okay so they're going from what do i know to what do i need to find out <pause dur="1.4"/> implementing the correct sequence of steps based on strategies they've retrieved <pause dur="0.2"/> from their <pause dur="0.2"/> schemas in long term memory <pause dur="0.9"/> okay in contrast <pause dur="1.1"/> to this <pause dur="0.3"/> the novices <pause dur="0.5"/> tend to work <pause dur="0.2"/> backwards <pause dur="0.7"/> so what they tend to do is generate a set of alternative <pause dur="0.4"/> solutions <pause dur="0.9"/> to start with and then trying to work out <pause dur="0.4"/> which one would be the best one to proceed with <pause dur="0.7"/> okay so little time is spent trying to represent the problem initially <pause dur="1.0"/> and # <pause dur="0.4"/> to illustrate this difference between forward 
processing and <pause dur="0.2"/> backwards processing here is an example <pause dur="0.2"/> that's in Steinberg <pause dur="2.3"/> imagine that we have an expert doctor <pause dur="0.5"/> and <pause dur="0.3"/> a totally green <pause dur="0.5"/> # novice <pause dur="0.3"/> <trunc>n</trunc> medical student <pause dur="0.6"/> and they're both presented with a patient <pause dur="0.5"/> who has a series of symptoms <pause dur="0.9"/> first of all what does the novice do <pause dur="0.4"/> well he's not sure <pause dur="0.4"/> exactly what to make of the symptoms and so what he does is goes and orders a <pause dur="0.3"/> whole long series of expensive <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> medical tests to be done <pause dur="0.5"/> in the hope <pause dur="0.2"/> that once he's got <pause dur="0.2"/> the full <pause dur="0.3"/> information in front of him full symptomatic information he may be able to <pause dur="0.6"/> then <pause dur="0.2"/> go ahead and make his diagnosis <pause dur="0.5"/> and he realizes that this illness could be <pause dur="0.2"/> any number of a wide range of things <pause dur="0.3"/> and he works backwards <pause dur="0.4"/> to try and <pause dur="0.3"/> sort eliminate them and work out exactly which one <pause dur="0.2"/> it is <pause dur="1.6"/> our more experienced doctor on the other hand <pause dur="0.3"/> is far more likely to recognize <pause dur="0.3"/> the initial <pause dur="0.6"/> set of symptoms he's being presented with <pause dur="0.8"/> as being as fitting <pause dur="0.2"/> a diagnostic pattern <pause dur="0.3"/> or one of a small number of patterns that she holds in her <pause dur="0.5"/> 
long term memory <pause dur="2.1"/> she's therefore worked forward from these initial symptoms <pause dur="0.2"/> to a much smaller <pause dur="0.6"/> set of possible <pause dur="0.2"/> illnesses <pause dur="0.3"/> and therefore she only needs <pause dur="0.4"/> a very small number <pause dur="0.3"/> of highly targeted tests <pause dur="0.5"/> to choose <pause dur="0.3"/> the correct <pause dur="0.2"/> diagnosis <pause dur="0.2"/> from among the <pause dur="0.2"/> limited number of possibilities that she's generated <pause dur="3.8"/> okay <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> okay a word of warning with that though <pause dur="0.3"/> is that obviously that's a that's a simple way <pause dur="0.3"/> of describing it and as you can imagine in real life <pause dur="0.3"/> get's much more <pause dur="0.4"/> fiddly than that <pause dur="0.9"/> okay those are sort of very sort of gross <pause dur="1.4"/> it's a very gross generalization on how <pause dur="0.9"/> people operate 'cause obviously as i described at the beginning it depends on how you define your expert <pause dur="0.4"/> and how you <pause dur="0.4"/> define your novice <pause dur="3.6"/> okay <pause dur="0.4"/> and # <pause dur="1.9"/> another thing to bear in mind <pause dur="0.2"/> is <pause dur="0.6"/> what a <trunc>w</trunc> first of all well <trunc>wh</trunc> <trunc>d</trunc> <trunc>w</trunc> how do we define our expertise and also <pause dur="0.2"/> how <pause dur="0.5"/> people in the study have chosen to measure <pause dur="0.7"/> that expertise <pause dur="2.1"/> and <pause dur="0.7"/> this actually makes the whole area of expertise quite tricky <pause dur="0.5"/> and when you're actually 
looking at research in this area <pause dur="0.3"/> you should bear <pause dur="0.2"/> that sort of thing in mind <pause dur="0.3"/> okay <pause dur="0.3"/> because despite the example i've just given you <pause dur="0.7"/> # what you actually find with doctors <pause dur="0.4"/> is that <pause dur="2.6"/><kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="9"/>for most <pause dur="0.2"/> cases <pause dur="3.3"/> you don't actually get that much difference between novice and expert doctors <pause dur="1.2"/> so it's been found that <pause dur="0.3"/> diagnostic performance doesn't actually seem to improve <pause dur="0.5"/> much beyond the first year <pause dur="0.4"/> of residency <pause dur="0.4"/> for <pause dur="0.2"/> typical <pause dur="0.2"/> diagnostic cases <pause dur="3.4"/> okay and # <pause dur="0.2"/> there are some small differences between doctors with different lengths of experience for everyday <trunc>agn</trunc> diagnosis <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> though it has been shown <pause dur="0.3"/> there are tend to be much bigger differences <pause dur="0.3"/> as soon as you start moving on to more difficult cases <pause dur="0.9"/> okay <pause dur="11.3"/><kinesic desc="reveals covered part of transparency" iterated="n"/> and <pause dur="0.7"/> Boshuizen <pause dur="0.3"/> and Schmidt nineteen-ninety-two <pause dur="2.9"/> found that the expert doctors seem to have <pause dur="0.3"/> easier access to higher level <pause dur="0.8"/> structured diagnostic information <pause dur="0.6"/> whereas the medical students <pause dur="0.6"/> tended to have to go through this sort of cumbersome biomedical reasoning <pause dur="0.5"/> to get to their solutions <pause dur="0.6"/> okay <pause dur="1.3"/> but <pause dur="0.2"/> say we've got to be 
very careful that we don't <pause dur="0.2"/> overgeneralize here <pause dur="0.2"/> because it matters what we're actually calling a novice doctor here and what we're calling an expert doctor <pause dur="0.4"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> how we're measuring <pause dur="0.6"/> their expertise <pause dur="2.1"/> another example <pause dur="0.6"/> of a <pause dur="0.9"/><kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="10"/> skilled domain where the problem may not be <pause dur="0.2"/> as well defined as we would like <pause dur="0.6"/> is <pause dur="0.2"/> physics <pause dur="3.2"/> and # <pause dur="0.9"/> it's covered by a lot of research by Chi et al <pause dur="1.7"/>and they tested # expert and novice physicists on a range of physics problems <pause dur="1.0"/> 
and they found that the novices tend to use the surface features <pause dur="0.3"/> of the problem <pause dur="0.5"/> while the experts <pause dur="0.4"/> # encode far more deeply <pause dur="2.5"/> # in this domain experts solved problems four times faster <pause dur="0.2"/> than novices <pause dur="0.6"/> though they spent longer analysing the problems <pause dur="0.3"/> and Chi et al argued that these differences <pause dur="0.4"/> between novices and experts were <pause dur="0.3"/> as a result <pause dur="1.1"/> of differences in strategy <pause dur="0.5"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> # knowledge <pause dur="2.1"/> so <pause dur="0.8"/> like with the chess <pause dur="0.4"/> the experts who use their superior knowledge of previous problems <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> but # is found that the experts not only had a greater quantity of knowledge <pause dur="0.2"/> 
they also organized <pause dur="0.3"/> that knowledge <pause dur="0.3"/> better <pause dur="1.7"/> and # <pause dur="0.3"/> experts also tend to exhibit superior memory <pause dur="0.2"/> on unexpected recall tasks <pause dur="0.3"/> possibly as a result of their deeper <pause dur="0.4"/> encoding <pause dur="0.5"/> of the problem <pause dur="3.5"/> okay <pause dur="0.3"/> and <pause dur="2.1"/><kinesic desc="reveals covered part of transparency" iterated="n"/> more research by Larkin et al <pause dur="0.2"/> where they <pause dur="0.2"/> took people <pause dur="0.5"/> with equivalent knowledge in solving <pause dur="0.2"/> physics problems <pause dur="0.2"/> but who differed on their level differed on their level of expertise and they found that <pause dur="0.3"/> when we actually controlled for the amount of knowledge people knew <pause dur="0.5"/> the # the experts still showed a superior performance <pause dur="0.6"/> okay <pause dur="0.3"/> so <pause dur="0.3"/> it's not <trunc>th</trunc> the <trunc>am</trunc> not just the amount of knowledge <pause dur="0.2"/> it's how you structure that knowledge <pause dur="0.2"/> which is important <pause dur="0.3"/> and then <pause dur="0.2"/> they described it as <pause dur="0.2"/> pattern based <pause dur="0.6"/> retrieval <pause dur="0.4"/> from memory <pause dur="0.9"/> and like medicine <pause dur="0.5"/> # they found that <pause dur="0.3"/> experts tended to use a forward working strategy <pause dur="0.6"/> whereas <pause dur="0.2"/> the novices tended to use a backwards <pause dur="0.3"/> working strategy <pause dur="2.6"/> and also this # expertise was found to be very domain <trunc>suspic</trunc> specific <pause dur="0.3"/> so <pause dur="0.2"/> being an expert physicist <pause dur="0.2"/> doesn't make you <pause dur="0.2"/> good at anything 
else <pause dur="0.2"/> whatsoever <pause dur="1.1"/> okay and this may reflect the finding <pause dur="0.4"/> that i talked about earlier where basic <pause dur="0.2"/> differences like things like I-Q <pause dur="0.5"/> # have surprisingly little <pause dur="0.2"/> bearing <pause dur="0.3"/> on expert <pause dur="0.3"/> performance <pause dur="4.5"/> okay <pause dur="1.5"/> <kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="15"/> # running out of time so <pause dur="0.2"/> i'm going to <pause dur="2.6"/> pop on to <pause dur="0.4"/> some people who've tried to summarize <pause dur="0.2"/> this sort of research <pause dur="4.2"/> okay <pause dur="0.3"/> # summarizing this sort of research <pause dur="1.8"/> <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 word"/><pause dur="0.7"/> is a problem <pause dur="0.2"/> 'cause as i said <pause dur="0.2"/> before we have to be very careful that <pause dur="0.5"/> first of all we know what definition of expert and novice we're using <pause dur="1.1"/> secondly <pause dur="0.3"/> we've got to <pause dur="0.4"/> be very careful about exactly how we're measuring <pause dur="0.2"/> expertise <pause dur="0.5"/> and the third thing we've got to watch out <pause dur="0.6"/> is <pause dur="0.2"/> that we don't overgeneralize from our results <pause dur="0.4"/> okay so it could be <pause dur="0.3"/> that # we say ah this is a <trunc>novi</trunc> this is an expert and the expert can do this this and this <pause dur="0.3"/> but then we discover <pause dur="0.2"/> that's only true of experts <pause dur="0.4"/> # solving maths problems <pause dur="0.2"/> and it has no bearing on experts <pause dur="0.7"/> # doing chess and things like that <pause dur="0.6"/> so you've got to bear all of these sort of these those three things in mind when you're analysing this research <pause dur="0.8"/> but # <pause dur="0.2"/> Glaser and Chi <pause dur="1.8"/> again have come <pause dur="0.2"/> come up with # a list <pause dur="0.8"/> of things they 
argued were common <pause dur="0.2"/> between different domains <pause dur="0.2"/> of expertise <pause dur="1.4"/> and <pause dur="0.3"/> these are all things that we've met previously in the lecture <pause dur="1.0"/><kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="2"/> okay <pause dur="0.2"/> so <pause dur="0.9"/> they argued that # <reading>experts excel mainly in their own domains <pause dur="1.8"/> experts perceive large meaningful patterns in domains <pause dur="0.7"/> experts tend to be faster at solving problems <pause dur="1.1"/> experts have superior short and long term memory <pause dur="1.2"/> experts see and represent problems in their domain at a deeper level than novices <pause dur="0.8"/> and experts spend more time <pause dur="0.4"/> analysing <pause dur="0.4"/> problems <pause dur="0.4"/> qualitatively</reading> <pause dur="1.4"/> and something we haven't talked about is <reading>experts have very strong <pause dur="0.2"/> self-monitoring <pause dur="0.5"/> skills</reading> <pause dur="0.4"/> okay <pause dur="0.5"/> and you'll see that <pause dur="0.5"/> similar pattern reflected <pause dur="0.2"/> in another example i've put in your handout <pause dur="0.5"/> # by Green and Gilhooly who tried to do the same thing and came up with <pause dur="0.3"/> five maxims <pause dur="1.3"/> okay <pause dur="1.2"/> right so we've looked at the differences between novices and experts <pause dur="0.3"/> one point we haven't addressed <pause dur="0.2"/> is how people <pause dur="0.2"/> become <pause dur="0.2"/> experts in the first place so how do you become skilful at something <pause dur="0.5"/> how can <trunc>a</trunc>  someone anyone become an expert at something or does <pause dur="0.5"/> # can anyone become an expert at something or does genetics play an important role <pause dur="0.6"/> and those <pause dur="0.2"/> are the issues <pause dur="0.2"/> we'll be looking at <pause dur="0.3"/> next week <pause dur="0.2"/> i'll see you then
