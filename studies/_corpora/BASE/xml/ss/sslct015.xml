<u who="nm1157"> today's topic <pause dur="0.6"/> is <pause dur="0.2"/> the <pause dur="0.4"/> law relating to prostitution <pause dur="1.8"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> which is also <pause dur="0.2"/> # to be the topic of our seminars <pause dur="0.2"/> next <pause dur="0.2"/> week <pause dur="1.6"/> as you will see <pause dur="0.5"/> # the focus <pause dur="0.6"/> next <pause dur="0.2"/> week <pause dur="0.9"/> is really on <pause dur="0.9"/> the issue of policy what should the <pause dur="0.4"/> law's policy be in relation to prostitution <pause dur="0.9"/> # and by policy we mean of course <pause dur="0.8"/> what should the law be doing in order to deal with any <pause dur="0.3"/> problems if any are found <pause dur="0.5"/> relating to prostitution <pause dur="0.5"/> # in order to # alleviate <pause dur="0.2"/> such problems <pause dur="0.6"/> and make the world better which is what policy is all about <pause dur="1.1"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> because we're going to be discussing policy in seminars <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> the lectures i'm going to give you <pause dur="0.4"/> are going to focus very much on the law <pause dur="0.7"/> # and i suppose i will be perhaps holding back from policy issues <pause dur="1.0"/> what this means of course is that <pause dur="0.3"/> you mustn't assume that <pause dur="0.4"/> all the answers to next week's seminar <pause dur="0.4"/> are to be found in today's lecture <pause dur="1.0"/> # today's lecture is going to give you some of the material for next week's seminar <pause dur="0.3"/> but you're going to have to go further <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> in the reading which we provide for you and 
indeed in your own <pause dur="0.4"/> thoughts <pause dur="2.1"/> right <pause dur="0.2"/> prostitution and the law <pause dur="1.0"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> the first question i suppose is <pause dur="1.0"/> what is the law trying to achieve <pause dur="0.8"/> # in relation to prostitution <pause dur="1.4"/> # if you remember we <pause dur="0.5"/> talked about the rationale of offences <pause dur="0.8"/> # in relation to other offences <pause dur="0.7"/> and # it's fairly easy to work out what the law is trying to achieve <pause dur="0.2"/> in relation to murder <pause dur="0.6"/> or rape or theft <pause dur="0.3"/> the objective is obvious <pause dur="1.1"/> what should the law try and achieve in relation to prostitution <pause dur="1.7"/> well <pause dur="0.4"/> i i think when much of our law was formulated <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> this issue may not have been addressed in precisely those terms <pause dur="1.0"/> however <pause dur="0.5"/> # there was a large scale <pause dur="0.2"/> review of the law <pause dur="0.9"/> # between <pause dur="0.4"/> nineteen-fifty-three and nineteen-fifty-seven <pause dur="1.0"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> by a committee <pause dur="1.4"/> chaired by <pause dur="0.2"/> # a man called Lord Wolfenden <pause dur="1.1"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> which had the job given the job by government <pause dur="0.5"/> of reviewing <pause dur="0.6"/> # the law relating to <pause dur="0.3"/> # homosexual offences <pause dur="0.2"/> and prostitution <pause dur="1.7"/> and # <pause dur="0.4"/> in order to review the law <pause dur="0.8"/> the Wolfenden committee <pause dur="0.6"/> started out by <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="1.3"/> trying to think about what the law should be 
trying to achieve in this area <pause dur="1.0"/> # and it came up with a formula <pause dur="1.2"/> # which i've quoted on the sheet <pause dur="0.7"/> # but which i will read to you now <pause dur="1.1"/> Wolfenden said <pause dur="0.2"/> committee said <pause dur="0.5"/> # <reading>the role of the law should be to preserve <pause dur="0.2"/> public order and decency <pause dur="1.7"/> to protect citizens from what is indefensive or injurious <pause dur="0.9"/> and to provide sufficient safeguards <pause dur="0.2"/> against exploitation <pause dur="0.4"/> and corruption of others <pause dur="0.9"/> particularly <pause dur="0.4"/> those who are especially <pause dur="0.4"/> vulnerable <pause dur="0.5"/> because they are young in mind or body <pause dur="0.8"/> inexperienced <pause dur="0.9"/> or in a state of special <pause dur="0.5"/> physical <pause dur="0.4"/> official <pause dur="0.2"/> or economic <pause dur="0.9"/> dependence </reading> <pause dur="1.7"/> # the committee then went on and said <pause dur="0.6"/> <reading>it is not in our view <pause dur="0.4"/> the function of the law to intervene <pause dur="0.9"/> in the private lives of citizens <pause dur="0.6"/> or <pause dur="0.6"/> it is not the function of the law to seek to enforce <pause dur="0.5"/> any particular <pause dur="0.5"/> pattern of behaviour <pause dur="1.3"/> farther at least than it is necessary to carry out for the purposes we have outlined </reading> <pause dur="2.4"/> what is the committee saying there <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.8"/> and <pause dur="1.6"/> when we've worked out what the committee is saying can we sort of proceed from that <pause dur="0.5"/> to 
work out what the law should be <pause dur="2.4"/> first of all they they they say <pause dur="1.0"/> it is the role of the law to preserve <pause dur="0.3"/> public order and decency <pause dur="2.0"/> and i think first of all the the reference to public order <pause dur="1.1"/> # indicates if you like that <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> the world can be divided up into public places <pause dur="0.5"/> which are shared <pause dur="0.8"/> by <pause dur="0.4"/> a number of us as citizens <pause dur="0.7"/> and <pause dur="0.4"/> private places which are occupied by us alone <pause dur="0.4"/> or those we choose to be with <pause dur="1.1"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> i suppose the legal theory <pause dur="0.2"/> of the public place <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> which <pause dur="0.4"/> the Wolfenden committee expressed <pause dur="0.5"/> is that <pause dur="0.3"/> because the public place is shared <pause dur="0.8"/> # it's important that the <pause dur="0.2"/> use that any individual <pause dur="1.0"/> puts the public place to <pause dur="1.0"/> doesn't unnecessarily infringe <pause dur="0.7"/> on <pause dur="0.3"/> the way others <pause dur="0.5"/> wish to use the public place <pause dur="1.5"/> i suppose in relation to prostitution <pause dur="0.8"/> # the Wolfenden committee would be <pause dur="0.7"/> thinking about <pause dur="1.2"/> ways of # practising prostitution which are carried in public <pause dur="0.7"/> soliciting particularly on the street <pause dur="1.1"/> and <pause dur="0.5"/> when the Wolfenden committee talked about preserving <pause dur="0.2"/> public order and decency <pause dur="1.0"/> # they were probably 
saying well <pause dur="2.3"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> soliciting in a public place has some impact <pause dur="0.4"/> on those around <pause dur="0.7"/> # other people mightn't want to see it they might consider it indecent <pause dur="0.8"/> # that might be a good reason for criminalizing <pause dur="0.6"/> soliciting for prostitution in public <pause dur="0.5"/> because <pause dur="0.4"/> public space has to be shared <pause dur="2.1"/> the other side of the coin of course to the notion of a public place <pause dur="0.6"/> # is <pause dur="0.3"/> private place <pause dur="0.9"/> and # <pause dur="1.4"/> if i just <pause dur="0.2"/> jump to the end of the quote from Wolfenden <pause dur="1.1"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> the committee said that <pause dur="0.7"/> it's not the function of the law to intervene in the private lives of citizens <pause dur="0.7"/> or to enforce any particular <pause dur="0.4"/> code of conduct <pause dur="1.0"/> the committee seems to be saying okay <pause dur="0.2"/> in public you've got <pause dur="0.2"/> to act in a way that keeps everybody else happy <pause dur="0.5"/> but there is a private sphere <pause dur="1.4"/> within the private sphere the law should respect autonomy <pause dur="0.5"/> shouldn't try and enforce some code about what should or shouldn't be <pause dur="0.5"/> done <pause dur="0.7"/> develop a sphere in which you can make your own decisions <pause dur="2.1"/> # <pause dur="2.9"/> if we go back to the the <pause dur="0.4"/> key # the core of the quote rather <pause dur="0.6"/> we find 
that <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> the Wolfenden committee were <pause dur="0.8"/> concerned about providing sufficient <pause dur="0.3"/> safeguards against exploitation and <pause dur="0.2"/> corruption of others <pause dur="3.2"/> now <pause dur="0.2"/> those words are loaded aren't they <pause dur="0.2"/> exploitation and corruption they sound bad <pause dur="1.0"/> # if i went out into the streets in <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> today and i said <pause dur="0.3"/> should the law try and prevent exploitation and corruption <pause dur="0.6"/> people would probably say <pause dur="0.2"/> yes <pause dur="1.7"/> they are very problematic notions though <pause dur="0.5"/> # particularly <pause dur="0.7"/> when we think about them in terms of <pause dur="1.0"/> the Wolfenden committee's other comments <pause dur="1.5"/> what does exploitation mean <pause dur="0.2"/> i suppose exploitation means using <pause dur="0.6"/> somebody else <pause dur="0.5"/> for some purpose of your own <pause dur="1.7"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> but of course <pause dur="0.7"/> exploitation in that sense occurs all the time doesn't it <pause dur="0.5"/> # you're exploiting me <pause dur="0.4"/> because <pause dur="0.8"/> managing to stay awake during this lecture <pause dur="0.8"/> writing lots of notes <pause dur="0.4"/> repeating it all in the exam is a necessary stage <pause dur="0.4"/> to you getting that much desired <pause dur="0.3"/> B-M-W and stripy suit in a few years' time <pause dur="0.9"/><vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" n="ss" dur="3"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> so you are exploiting me the university's exploiting me <pause dur="0.3"/> # by 
employing me <pause dur="0.6"/> # i exploit <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> i suppose you could say i exploit <pause dur="1.3"/> whoever it is who cooks my <shift feature="voice" new="laugh"/>food <shift feature="voice" new="normal"/><pause dur="0.7"/> # or or i exploit the person who <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> shears the sheep in New Zealand or something to provide the jumper <pause dur="0.4"/> <unclear>jumper i wear</unclear> <pause dur="1.3"/> <vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" n="ss" dur="1"/> whatever <pause dur="0.4"/> so exploitation happens all the time and in fact it's just # <pause dur="0.5"/> an aspect of modern society isn't it <pause dur="0.6"/> the whole idea of society is we live together <pause dur="0.3"/> we interact react we complement each other in the functions we perform <pause dur="0.6"/> you can call it <pause dur="0.5"/> mutual exploitation <pause dur="0.9"/> but it's also a normal aspect of modern society <pause dur="1.4"/> so exploitation is problematic <pause dur="0.9"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> in relation to prostitution <pause dur="0.8"/> is it really clear who exploits who <pause dur="1.5"/> well <pause dur="1.0"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> some people would argue that the male customers exploit <pause dur="0.3"/> # the woman who provides <pause dur="0.4"/> the prostitution services <pause dur="1.2"/> if however <pause dur="0.3"/> # you look at <pause dur="1.5"/> some <pause dur="0.2"/> # feminist analyses of prostitution <pause dur="0.9"/> they would disagree with this <pause dur="0.8"/> # if you look at # a book <pause dur="0.2"/> called Working Women by Arlene Macleod <pause dur="0.9"/> # <pause dur="1.1"/> when she was at this university <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="1.6"/> she talked to <trunc>prostitutio</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> prostitutes and 
prostitutes say <pause dur="0.6"/> oh we're in this job because we like it <pause dur="0.7"/> # it's by far the most satisfactory way for us <pause dur="0.3"/> to earn a living <pause dur="0.4"/> to make a reasonable amount of money <pause dur="0.4"/> to keep control of our own lives <pause dur="0.3"/> and to have the sort of flexible lifestyle we want <pause dur="0.6"/> <unclear>if you ever</unclear> ask prostitutes why they do the job they're not admitting to being exploited very often <pause dur="0.6"/> many of them it's just a rational <pause dur="0.3"/> choice <pause dur="0.4"/> # according to the options available to them <pause dur="1.6"/> # so it's not absolutely clear that the male customer exploits the woman <pause dur="0.8"/> and indeed <pause dur="0.2"/> # you might say it's the other way round <pause dur="0.8"/> # if you look at the areas where prostitution is <pause dur="0.2"/> is carried out you may say well <pause dur="0.6"/> here's the man gone for a drink after work on his way home <pause dur="1.1"/> # he's presented with a temptation <pause dur="0.6"/> # is that the woman exploiting him <pause dur="0.5"/> so exploitation is a problematic concept <pause dur="1.7"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> exploitation can also be seen <pause dur="0.5"/> # in the relationship <pause dur="0.7"/> between <pause dur="0.2"/> the <pause dur="0.4"/> so-called <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> pimp or ponce <pause dur="0.8"/> who is a sort of stereotypical <pause dur="0.7"/> figure <pause dur="0.4"/> # the man who lives off the earnings of 
prostitution <pause dur="1.2"/> and # <pause dur="0.4"/> if one went further through the Wolfenden committee report <pause dur="0.8"/> # you would see that <pause dur="0.2"/> that committee did think it appropriate <pause dur="0.8"/> to maintain <pause dur="0.2"/> penalties <pause dur="0.2"/> on <pause dur="1.0"/> # men who lived <pause dur="0.4"/> off <pause dur="0.3"/> the money women made by prostitution <pause dur="1.9"/> if you like the the man figure was seen as an exploiter <pause dur="1.1"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> but again that is rather problematic isn't it <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> all of us who earn money <pause dur="0.6"/> # well for many of us who earn money <pause dur="0.5"/> # we choose to support somebody else <pause dur="0.7"/> very common for <pause dur="0.6"/> # husbands <pause dur="0.7"/> or wives to support their partners isn't it <pause dur="0.5"/> where one person in the family works <pause dur="0.7"/> certainly <pause dur="0.3"/> common for adults to support <pause dur="0.6"/> # <trunc>fo</trunc> <trunc>fo</trunc> for parents to support grown up children <pause dur="0.8"/> so <pause dur="0.9"/> # we don't say oh well there's exploitation in this relationship just because one person who earns money <pause dur="0.9"/> pays the expenses of <pause dur="0.3"/> the family or or the couple <pause dur="1.8"/> the problem # exploitation then is problematic <pause dur="1.2"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> it's also true when we come to look at the law relating to <pause dur="0.2"/> # living off the earnings of prostitution <pause dur="0.7"/> that <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> the offence of living off can be 
<trunc>provi</trunc> # can be committed <pause dur="0.8"/> where a person who receives money from the prostitute <pause dur="0.7"/> provides <pause dur="0.2"/> some sort of service <pause dur="1.2"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> modern prostitution may be committed <pause dur="0.7"/> through # massage parlours <pause dur="0.9"/> or escort agencies <pause dur="1.6"/> both sorts of organization may be fronts for prostitution <pause dur="1.2"/> # the people who <pause dur="0.6"/> organize those <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> those # <pause dur="0.5"/> businesses <pause dur="1.0"/> can be found guilty of living off the earnings of prostitution <pause dur="1.3"/> # but are they exploiters <pause dur="1.0"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> certainly many would argue that they're not <pause dur="0.6"/> they're providing <pause dur="0.2"/> necessary <pause dur="0.5"/> ancillary business services <pause dur="1.0"/> in order to allow a prostitute to <pause dur="0.4"/> carry out <pause dur="0.5"/> her or his business <pause dur="0.6"/> # in a way which is <pause dur="0.4"/> safe <pause dur="0.2"/> and makes <pause dur="0.2"/> # business sense makes commercial sense <pause dur="1.1"/> so again <pause dur="0.9"/> exploitation is a tricky concept isn't it <pause dur="2.2"/> # <pause dur="1.1"/> corruption's a tricky concept as well <pause dur="1.4"/> i think the <pause dur="0.3"/> the essence of corruption <pause dur="1.2"/> # is <pause dur="0.9"/> # exerting an influence on somebody <pause dur="0.5"/> which in some <pause dur="0.2"/> way <pause dur="0.5"/> degrades them <pause dur="0.8"/> or makes them <pause dur="0.2"/> worse <pause dur="2.0"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> and i suppose here the Wolfenden committee when they when they said the law should deal with corruption <pause dur="1.4"/> # was probably 
concerned with <pause dur="0.9"/> # an individual who might <pause dur="0.8"/> recruit <pause dur="1.1"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> others into prostitution <pause dur="0.9"/> persuade them perhaps with <pause dur="0.2"/> offer of high earning <pause dur="1.2"/> # or a glamorous lifestyle or whatever to <pause dur="0.5"/> take part in prostitution <pause dur="2.5"/> well <pause dur="1.7"/> # again i think many people have a sort of gut reaction that that is a bad thing to do <pause dur="0.8"/> there is a problem though which is this that <pause dur="1.0"/> we can only call that corruption <pause dur="0.9"/> if we say that <pause dur="0.3"/> the non-prostitute lifestyle is fine <pause dur="1.8"/> and the prostitute lifestyle is in some way bad or degraded <pause dur="1.1"/> we're talking about corruption we're talking about an <trunc>in</trunc> an influence making something worse or degrading them <pause dur="0.9"/> so <pause dur="0.3"/> we must be making a value judgement mustn't we that <pause dur="0.5"/> you're a young person <pause dur="0.2"/> coming to university that's fine <pause dur="0.8"/> if somebody persuades you to go and work as a prostitute to earn money <pause dur="0.2"/> to support your university career in some way you've been degraded <pause dur="1.8"/> and of course once you make that value judgement <pause dur="0.6"/> # aren't you infringing <pause dur="1.0"/> one of the <pause dur="0.3"/> Wolfenden committee's later principles <pause dur="0.7"/> which is 
that <pause dur="0.6"/> # the law should not <pause dur="0.2"/> seek to enforce <pause dur="0.5"/> any particular <pause dur="0.2"/> pattern of behaviour <pause dur="1.5"/> or <pause dur="0.6"/> are you also infringing <pause dur="0.3"/> the Wolfenden committee principle <pause dur="0.8"/> that <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> there should be an area of <pause dur="0.9"/> private <pause dur="0.2"/> life <pause dur="0.7"/> in which the law should play no role <pause dur="2.0"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> as i said when we talk about <pause dur="0.7"/> saying <pause dur="0.2"/> there's an area a private sphere in which the law should not <pause dur="0.6"/> # <trunc>i</trunc> <trunc>i</trunc> <pause dur="0.4"/> in which the law should not involve itself <pause dur="0.3"/> we're really talking about protecting autonomy <pause dur="0.7"/> and autonomy <pause dur="0.4"/> means <unclear>though</unclear> <pause dur="0.2"/> the right and ability <pause dur="0.4"/> to make your own choices <pause dur="0.7"/> about how you lead your life <pause dur="1.8"/> so it's very difficult to square this notion of preventing corruption <pause dur="0.7"/> with this idea of letting individuals ultimately make their own choices <pause dur="1.3"/> # <pause dur="0.9"/> at the end of the day i suppose <pause dur="0.6"/> if autonomy is to be <pause dur="0.8"/> real and valuable <pause dur="1.0"/> it must be <pause dur="0.7"/> autonomy which allows you to make bad choices as well as good choices <pause dur="1.1"/> mustn't it <pause dur="0.9"/> that's the whole point of autonomy it is up to you <pause dur="0.8"/> the the one right you <pause dur="0.2"/> you <pause dur="0.2"/> the essential right you have to make your own choices about your own

we must be able to create a definition of prostitution <pause dur="1.2"/> and a definition of prostitute <pause dur="0.3"/> that distinguishes <pause dur="1.1"/> the prostitute <pause dur="0.8"/> and his or her practice <pause dur="0.6"/> from <pause dur="0.7"/> the conduct of other members of society <pause dur="0.9"/> which is <pause dur="0.6"/> approved of or at least <pause dur="0.2"/> tolerated <pause dur="1.1"/> yeah <pause dur="0.7"/> if we're going to have criminal law relating to prostitution <pause dur="0.5"/> there must be some way of defining prostitution that makes it different <pause dur="0.6"/> from <pause dur="0.2"/> the run of ordinary conduct <pause dur="0.7"/> let's have a quick look at what the law says about the definition of prostitution <pause dur="1.0"/> and i'm going to look at # <pause dur="0.5"/> a run of four cases <pause dur="1.0"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> all of the references to <trunc>the</trunc> these will be found on your handout <pause dur="1.1"/> which will # <pause dur="0.6"/> arrive in due course <pause dur="0.8"/> i wonder if it really will be delivered here <pause dur="1.7"/> maybe not who knows <pause dur="1.0"/> # first case was a case in nineteen-eighteen <pause dur="0.2"/> called <pause dur="0.2"/> De Monk <pause dur="1.2"/> De Monk nineteen-eighteen <pause dur="1.3"/> # <pause dur="2.3"/> this case # concerned # <pause dur="0.2"/> a <pause dur="0.9"/> prosecution of # <pause dur="0.2"/> a lady <pause dur="1.8"/> # who <pause dur="0.5"/> was <trunc>ch</trunc> charged <vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/> <pause dur="0.2"/> with an old offence <pause dur="1.1"/> of # <pause dur="0.6"/> encouraging <pause dur="0.6"/> the prostitution <pause dur="0.8"/> of # somebody else <pause dur="0.6"/> so so she was charged with

in the street or <pause dur="0.3"/> soliciting in the street is something which we as a community <pause dur="0.3"/> don't like to see <pause dur="0.5"/> which we think degrades our public places <pause dur="0.7"/> we find indecent <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.9"/> surely it's going to do so whether or not whether it's a # a woman who who does it or a man or a group of women or a group of men <pause dur="1.8"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> so <pause dur="0.2"/> that's very strange <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="1.6"/> why should the law focus on stereotypes <pause dur="1.0"/> well <pause dur="0.3"/> i think it's true historically <pause dur="0.5"/> that <pause dur="0.5"/> # it was the woman <pause dur="0.6"/> who was the object of the law <pause dur="1.7"/> # it's rather interesting that # <pause dur="0.7"/> in the middle of the nineteenth century <pause dur="1.3"/> # there was # an attempt <pause dur="0.9"/> to <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> deal with some of the problems associated with prostitution <pause dur="0.8"/> # through some acts called the Contagious Diseases Acts <pause dur="0.9"/> very interesting acts <pause dur="0.8"/> # the Contagious Diseases Acts were <pause dur="0.6"/> focused on <pause dur="0.4"/> # naval and army bases <pause dur="1.4"/> and <pause dur="0.3"/> they 
provided for <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> women <pause dur="0.8"/> who were found to be <pause dur="0.4"/> # involved in prostitution <pause dur="0.6"/> in the vicinity <pause dur="0.3"/> of naval and army bases <pause dur="0.6"/> they provided for these women to be <pause dur="1.0"/> forcibly taken from the streets <pause dur="0.5"/> to be subject to medical checks <pause dur="0.5"/> for # sexually transmissible diseases <pause dur="0.7"/> # and subject to compulsory cures if they were found to be infected <pause dur="2.4"/> and the law impacted on the women only <pause dur="1.1"/> well # <pause dur="0.3"/> it's rather interesting <pause dur="0.3"/> # the Contagious Diseases Acts were rather controversial <pause dur="0.8"/> and # <pause dur="0.2"/> a commission was set up to look into the operation of the acts <pause dur="0.9"/> and one of the issues which the <trunc>com</trunc> <pause dur="0.3"/> commission considered <pause dur="0.8"/> was whether the <pause dur="0.2"/> compulsory medical checks <pause dur="0.5"/> should apply to <pause dur="0.4"/> both sides of the prostitution equation <pause dur="1.1"/> # this was quickly dismissed <pause dur="0.9"/> they said <pause dur="0.8"/> well of course you can't do that <pause dur="0.6"/> the men are only # <pause dur="0.3"/> giving bent to quite 
natural desires <pause dur="0.6"/> # whereas it's the degrading women who are <pause dur="0.3"/> committing the unnatural act of offering themselves for sex <pause dur="0.6"/> so <pause dur="0.5"/> if you like way back in the middle of the nineteenth century we have two very clear stereotypes of <pause dur="0.6"/> the man well who's to blame him <pause dur="0.7"/> you know he's just lumbered with this sort of # <pause dur="0.8"/> sexual desire built into to his nature <pause dur="0.6"/> the woman on the other hand is a depraved person who's exploiting the unfortunate man <pause dur="0.7"/> # and # <pause dur="0.5"/> dragging him into <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> evil ways <pause dur="1.5"/> and <pause dur="0.4"/> i think it's true historically that # prostitution has focused on the activities of <pause dur="0.3"/> women <pause dur="0.7"/> and not men perhaps we'll return to that <pause dur="0.6"/> next <pause dur="0.2"/> time <pause dur="1.0"/> thanks for coming don't forget to # to <pause dur="0.9"/> pick up your <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> statutes as you leave
