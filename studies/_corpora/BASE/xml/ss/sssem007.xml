<u who="nm5447">right what do we have for # who wants territory and who wants sex <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 word"/> you know about degrees of freedom we might get to the back of you <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 word"/> but that serves you right for sitting at the back with all the troublemakers what would you like to do territory or sex </u>
<u who="su"><gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 word"/></u>
<u who="nm5447">what see if i said mating behaviour you'd probably've said territory but sex has got that works hasn't it so you're going to do sex and right the the the task at hand here is to think of how you do it how you space yourself out what territories mean to you and modesty forbids me from extending that to the other topic but i mean displays rituals how you do it the sort of key how it figures in your life so that both of those things getting off with people making mistakes and i'd like you to think about any of those examples what continuities there are between you and the rest of the animal world is what you're doing just the same as just the same as what animals are doing really mm you know they're quite homollegous <trunc>the</trunc>  they're basic forms of the same essential way of doing something even if it's only a fruit bat # <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 word"/> something like that or is it just something that's quite different what you're seeing here is only by analogy or or by some loose connection the same in inverted commas as what animals are doing and what you're doing is something for uniquely human ends in a uniquely human way so it's just to trace out the continuities and the discontinuities so you're going to do sex or mating behaviour and where's the next group start is that oh you're another group # are you alright what do you want to do</u>
<u who="su">we'll do territory</u>
<u who="nm5447">they're going to do territory then i suppose you could do territory separately can i do go round like that alternating so you're doing territory if you've got if you really object you can do the other it doesn't really matter so you're going to do sex you're going to do territory what do you want to do sex territory or sex </u>
<u who="su">sex</u>
<u who="nm5447">you're going to do sex well we're two up from sex what'll you do </u>
<u who="su">sex</u>
<u who="nm5447">sex sex sex <vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" dur="2"/> see me afterwards <vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" dur="10"/> right what do you want to do sorry what do you want to do <vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" dur="2"/> <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 word"/> <trunc>whe</trunc>  where's the next who's the next group are you a new one what do you want to do <trunc>se</trunc> alright we're looking a bit bit low on territory at the moment </u>
<u who="su">territory</u>
<u who="nm5447"> territory good for you </u>
<gap reason="inaudible" extent="uncertain"/>
<u who="nm5447">do territory alright so there's two groups at the back which one do you want to do </u>
<u who="su">yeah we'll do territory</u>
<u who="nm5447">territory right that's alright yeah we've got probably one up on territory but that's alright we've got we've got some examples of each and then all i'm going to do give you ten minutes quarter of an hour to sort of think of examples then i'd just like to go round see what sort of examples you've come up with and what what sort of conclusions we can draw okay then anyone got any questions put your hand up or shout out and i'll come round otherwise i'll just leave you to get on with it</u>
<gap reason="inaudible" extent="uncertain"/>
<u who="nm5447">how are you getting on do you think you've got enough to be getting on with i'd like to hear you know a bit from each group now # plenty of time # we are not ready to do it would you like another couple of minutes to jot down a few ideas or do you think you've got a few things to say you only need sort of to have a couple of what you think are telling examples of worth mentioning somewhere there may seem to be continuity but there is none or some where there seems to be a discontinuity but basically sort of saying how do you feel # go on # just # just stick your hand up if you'd like to go on for another couple of minutes # alright okay another couple of minutes then # start with territories and territoriality states claiming space things we do starting starting from the back are you a territory group i forgot now </u>
<u who="sf5452">yeah </u>
<u who="nm5447">could you give us give us one of your one of the topics that you thought of then initially #</u>
<u who="sf5452">mm about how both animals and humans mark out their own territory but in slightly different ways so like humans it could be mm their own room like at university you have your name on the door and that's like stating it's your territory and you may shut your door which means you know you want your own personal space whereas you know mm animals mark out their territory by like weeing and by senses and things </u>
<u who="nm5447">yeah did any of the other territory groups <trunc>sor</trunc>  focus on that the sort of marking of one's space and the marking of ones territories none none of the other none of you picked that the other groups doing territories how would you</u>
<u who="sm5448"><gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 word"/> when we first come to uni # kitchen everyone has to have their own cupboard and everyone names their own food <trunc>an</trunc>  and that's i don't know if that's normal or if that's just selfishness that you don't want to share any food or want other people stealing it but </u>
<u who="su">yeah </u>
<u who="sm5448"> you have a problem with trying to decide whether <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 word"/> library # if someone's sitting there and this other chair is available if you go and sit next to them that's # # </u>
<u who="nm5447">go on</u>
<u who="sm5448">it's more that you when you're you're brought up without other right situations to do that say from a pub or something and # you go up and talk to them it's the nature and that's okay but in a situation like that it's not really acceptable i'm not sure if it's inbuilt or not </u>
<u who="nm5447">that's that's a table there it's got six chairs around it someone with and someone with broad shoulders and curly hair working i mean i mean you're right if you were if you were in the library and you approached a table and # anybody you approached it and there's someone working there which seat would you go for</u>
<gap reason="inaudible" extent="uncertain"/>
<u who="nm5447">anybody think of it</u>
<gap reason="inaudible" extent="uncertain"/>
<u who="nm5447">yeah okay i mean B B or C this this is more distant but this is orientated away which is another way of making a distance # you can sort of create more distance from you and someone else by sort of turning away because # mm and then if if you know someone came and sat in A or E you'd feel miffed wouldn't you it's a bit like i guess going home on a bus if you're upstairs on a bus and there's only you're the only one up there and there's somebody else comes up it's not just you know they're not they don't just come and sit beside you even if they sat in the seat in front of you or the seat behind you alone it would still be awkward you'd wonder why i mean i guess it's it's a sort of expectation that you will maximise the distance between you and anyone else if it's a private situation isn't there there's a sort of norm that's an agreement that you do that would you not would you not say # if you <trunc>wer</trunc>  if you were going into someone you knew in the library but there was still still working in the library somebody you knew which seat do you think you'd go for </u>
<gap reason="inaudible" extent="uncertain"/>
<u who="nm5447">you would sit opposite them would you if you knew them then you'd go and sit near to them cause you'd want to talk to them rather than work i suppose <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 word"/> <vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" dur="2"/> if it was a meal like where would you sit cause you have a meal with you and then you've gone there <trunc>to</trunc>  together and somebody's sat down in where which seat would you pick </u>
<u who="ss">D yeah</u>
<u who="nm5447">so yeah or</u>
<u who="ss">E </u>
<u who="nm5447">or E i think it depends how big the table is if it's a very big table i think you'd go you'd probably go for E wouldn't you but if it was a sort of smaller table you'd go for D again if it was something if you were going to debate or negotiate with someone what would you do</u>
<u who="ss">D E</u>
<u who="nm5447">yeah you'd sit opposite someone there's something about confronting if it was an interview you walk into a room and you're going for an interview and the person interviewing you was sitting in that seat which seat would you take this would be part of the interview of course it'd be crucial you picked the right seat which one would you go for </u>
<u who="ss"><gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 word"/></u>
<u who="nm5447">which one </u>
<u who="ss"><gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 word"/></u>
<u who="nm5447">yeah i think so there's an element of sort of confrontation in an interview isn't there i think if you went for E or went for A A would be the cool one to go for <vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" dur="2"/> i mean you might it depends how they <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 word"/> there's something about intentions isn't there i mean one of the one of the pointers in this there's something about expressing your intentions when you when you have to go and sort of space yourself next to somebody else but also there's something about your entitlement you are entitled to some sort of to expect the other person to sort of keep some sort of distance from you i mean the question is is that the same as is that the same as what animals are doing when you talk about territories we were talking about marking territories weren't we and # i mean i suppose people do they sling their coats and books all over the table to keep everybody away and and compartments so that's if that's the equivalent of weeing do you think that's what it is sort of hanging jackets and sticking books do you think that really is the same as animals do with marking out territories</u>
<u who="su">they mark out territory for different reasons</u>
<u who="nm5447">to make sure they've got enough of an area to sort of to get food and things like that yeah you see i think that's a crucial difference actually <trunc>we</trunc>  <trunc>we</trunc>  we're using the word territory in this context in a in a sort of metaphorical way really it isn't really a territory it's a space around us for trying to sort of make sure that the norms are agreed to i mean we want that sort of space we don't want people sort of in our faces whereas what animals are doing is something about something <trunc>mu</trunc>  i mean they're not everywhere in that territory for a start are they i mean i guess i guess there is a sort of an analogy here rather than a homology i think for any otherany other comments on territory and space cause it is crucial it isit is a very important thing to consider really <trunc>whe</trunc>  when we're talking about space and when we're talking about territory and if what we're doing is is fundamentally doing what animals do or whether there are human needs here </u>
<u who="sm5449">with with human needs its cause # different like societies have different amounts of space like British are very very reserved and they probably would want a lot more space than a lot of other cultures which are more open to each other</u>
<u who="nm5447">that's a good point as well isn't it that that there are there's cultural variation in how much space we can lay claim to and how much space we want not very not only for sort of interactions i mean these usually assume that different cultures have different preferred distances for interacting from or doing various transactions # but even within a culture i mean some people are quite happy to live in very crowded conditions flats cities other people couldn't bear that there seem to be a lot of individual differences in how much space which is important <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 word"/> make it sound like a a human thing expressing some sort of individual preference did <trunc>any</trunc>  anybody else have anything to say about that the sort of cultural differences even within a society within a nation let alone across cultures </u>
<u who="sf5453">looking at the difference with age as well because children require less space than adults a child will come and sit next to you in that situation </u>
<u who="nm5447">yes would you would you agree with that that children seem to require less space and are less worried about the ownership of space not always children can be quite private about what they're doing and not want to be too i think i think that's right why why do you think that is then why is there a difference between adults and children</u>
<u who="sm5449">adults just learn what's to be expected what's right well not right but just the kind of norm</u>
<u who="nm5447">adults learn what's expected and what's the norm i think i'd agree with that any other # adults</u>
<u who="sm5451">adults are more likely to <trunc>so</trunc>  sort of come up with communications of something like if someone like goes to the toilet next to you like the next urinal there you might be a bit suspicious <vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" dur="2"/> <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 word"/></u>
<u who="nm5447">it's so unfair women wouldn't have this problem <vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" dur="2"/></u>
<u who="sm5451"><gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 word"/> be suspicious <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 word"/></u>
<u who="nm5447">there sort of asymmetries # # yeah i there are all sorts of asymmetries here aren't there about if a if a man goes and sits next to a woman in some public space as opposed to vice versa yeah mm what about this adult thing i mean you say that adults learn there is a norm is it not the case adults have have more to protect do you think the privacy the you know is something that you just have to try hard to maintain because it's more important to you i should think the maintenance of oneself as an adult is a sort of more more together more complicated process than as a child maybe adults you know desire that space more you know respite from having to interact with other people is perhaps more necessary they're certainly more aware of the norms as well i mean children don't they have a nice naivety about most social norms and we find that quite interesting quite attractive most of the time and we know we we smile and laugh at children's inability to behave socially whereas we get fed up with adults doing it usually let's get let's have another group move on from territory now now you were you a sex group or a territory group give this as an example # where are we on this next row the penultimate row are they i think you were doing territory were you </u>
<u who="sf5454">we were talking about whether it was mm inbuilt or not # we're about whether children about toys how they can be possessive sometimes with toys </u>
<u who="nm5447">right</u>
<u who="sf5454">and we didn't know whether that was a problem cause you will only see that at a certain age whether that's something that they learned </u>
<u who="nm5447">mm yes</u>
<u who="sf5454">or whether it was because it is a natural thing </u>
<u who="nm5447">i think to shade territoriality into possessiveness is an interesting step to take and i think it is relevant to human beings and i think a lot of what perhaps it's the case that a lot of what we construe as territoriality is as is as much about possessiveness you know my territory as <trunc>s</trunc>  <trunc>s</trunc>  something you own and it's a space you own or an object you own yes go on anything more about that then</u>
<u who="sf5454"># and we were talking also about cultures and whether like some people think that maybe it <trunc>di</trunc>  how territoriality you are is to do with your culture and that # so it's probably learned we were saying maybe it's initially inbuilt but then because of your culture some cultures go away from territoriality and some towards it more </u>
<u who="nm5447">yeah yes i think one one way of sort of tying this up as well is to think of the space you claim around you as something that you can personalise and claim as your <trunc>sp</trunc>  your own space and then it becomes an extension of you an extension of your own personality something that says something of you and everybody looks you know <trunc>your</trunc>  <trunc>yourse</trunc>  yourself and your identity doesn't stop at your skin it certainly includes your clothes and it might include space that's unique to yours i mean you've all moved into most of you have moved into your rooms in a residence and i guess you've done various things to personalise them so that it is your space and it speaks of you and is an extension of yourself you sort of establish yourself you know not not just by what you look like and who you know et cetera but but through a little bit of space that's uniquely yours you know someone comes in and insults your room in this sense they've insulted you and lecturers do it as well you can see it in their rooms my room's tastefully decorated as an extension of myself <vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" dur="2"/> i can see a few of my tutees around here nodding vigorously but # you know it is it is you know so space is space you can claim a bit of space that can be uniquely yours as well and i don't know whether any of you were considering this particularly in the light of recent experiences i guess you all have rooms here you have your cupboards in the kitchen as well i suppose which is i guess that's not so much an externalisation of yourself as a space of convenience / that you need that's sort of practical but you put some your name written in a silly way on it or painted or coloured or anything like that has anyone personalised their part of public spaces </u>
<u who="sf5455"><gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 word"/> nobody # in our kitchen <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 word"/></u>
<u who="nm5447">nobody does no what about on on doors you know in the slot where you put your names on your doors some people have nodded though <trunc>y</trunc>  <trunc>y</trunc>  yours is printed is it twelve point times and do you have do you write your names on the on your door </u>
<u who="sf5455">no <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 word"/></u>
<u who="nm5447">yeah what about inside though what've you got </u>
<u who="sf5455">put your name inside the door <vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" dur="2"/> </u>
<u who="nm5447">i mean i i just mean do you consider it as something that mm it it is a space it's not your territory but it's it's a space that you own to use as an expression of yourself as well as a place where you live and sleep and all the other things store your clothes and your books and do your psychology essays </u>
<u who="sf5455">yeah i suppose so </u>
<u who="nm5447">right so so there there is there so territory sort of shades in human senses shades in sort of spaces which are extensions of ourselves which is not what <trunc>ani</trunc>  animals are doing any animals think <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 word"/> territory my bit of the savannah or the woodlands which speaks well of me you know that's not sort of on the cards right other other territory groups where are we coming anybody else in the penultimate row did territories okay the middle row the middle rank did you what did you do sex territories or sex sex what about the second row from the front well you've said yes you said any other any other comments about territories then </u>
<u who="sm5450">yeah in the <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 word"/> <trunc>s</trunc>  society i mean you know you've got different countries for example you know they kind of that's their territory </u>
<u who="nm5447">yeah</u>
<u who="sm5450">they've got a need to belong to a certain country <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 word"/> English and we like that </u>
<u who="nm5447">yeah</u>
<u who="sm5450">and we clearly mark boundaries and to an extent in in countries as well you know you've got people say from Manchester or London or <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 word"/> so and so and they're quite proud of that fact and</u>
<u who="nm5447">that is a good point there are sort of territories nested within other territories aren't there that space is you know your room your house your university or your street your your town or region your country that's a good point # are there they're much more conceptual things aren't they you know they're they're based on ideas yeah what were you doing were you doing sex or territories </u>
<u who="sf5456">sex </u>
<u who="nm5447">what about what were you doing i've forgotten </u>
<u who="sf5457">we were doing territories</u>
<u who="nm5447">you're in the same group as them </u>
<u who="sf5457">yes</u>
<u who="nm5447">okay are there any any other things that we've missed going round any any points you've raised about the way we space ourselves out the way we marked mark territories the way we claim space the way we use space anything anything else we've missed are are your conclusions having thought about this then that that we are rather animal like or do you think we are rather unanimal like in in the way we use that word territory is it who thinks on the whole if you had to plump one way or the other we're fundamentally beastly we're we you know we're still rather like animals in the way we we use space implied territories who thinks that no one yeah go on be proud be proud to be a # go on see how it goes # interesting social phenomenon shark feeding frenzy one goes in everybody goes up okay and who thinks that no there are you know unavoidable discontinuities and that what we're seeing is only very superficially by analogy animal let's have a look how wonderful really nicely split on that i like that cause it's both it's the answer i guess the answer has to be both we are both you know the product of evolution is <trunc>sti</trunc>  you know still there and how how we need space functionally but also we're we're something quite separate which just makes it more complicated but more interesting okay let's let's go for a good quarter of an hour to hear what there is on the # mating behaviour so let's start anyone in the back row i've forgotten now <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 word"/> you were both doing territory were you</u>
<u who="su">yeah</u>
<u who="nm5447">okay so we're in the penultimate row starting with you you were doing sex right no one in your group territories you're all saying territories now aren't you <vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" dur="2"/> did you do you what are you doing mating behaviour and sex</u>
<u who="sf5458">yeah</u>
<u who="nm5447">great okay let's <trunc>ha</trunc>  have a pick out something new one particular issues which you thought was interesting either demonstrating a discontinuity or a continuity with with the animals</u>
<u who="sf5458"># the research about homosexuals was quite interesting about the mm different libidos between males and females and how with the homosexuals it was assumed that because they didn't conform to the norms as far as the mm with regards to having sex with males and females then they wouldn't conform to the norms about how often they did </u>
<u who="nm5447">how</u>
<u who="sf5458">often </u>
<u who="nm5447">often</u>
<u who="sf5458">yeah that the # <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 word"/> i read it somewhere </u>
<gap reason="inaudible" extent="uncertain"/>
<u who="nm5447">okay yeah</u>
<u who="sf5458">but mm i can't explain it very well but they were saying that females have lower libidos than males so they kind of put put the brakes on and # although lesbians have sex just as often as heterosexual females # gay men have a much higher partner turnover rate about ten to a hundred times that of heterosexual males because they haven't got the females putting the brakes on </u>
<u who="nm5447">well i mean you you say partner turnover is a function of frequency of of sex then cause it is that the implication you're just having so much sex you're ready for someone else much much quicker is that the implication then i'm not sure about that but it <trunc>do</trunc>  go on</u>
<u who="sf5458">well it was a piece of research i can't remember the exact details of it but # because of the # <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 word"/> or something cause you know males like to spread their seed and </u>
<u who="nm5447">that raises</u>
<u who="sf5458">pregnancy</u>
<u who="nm5447">i mean that raises a more general point about the asymmetries in participation sex and display and mating which some people assert are there in human behaviour and also seem to be there in similar ways in animal behaviour and mm you might put that forward as a continuity about men being basically more promiscuous men being less committed and and being dominant and doing the chasing all sorts of things like that there are lots of there are lots of ways which men in humans are sort of typify this being different from female in the in the roles they play in mating behaviour ritual displays and some sociobiologists people looking for biological explanations have said this is fundamentally what animals do would you did you did you develop that at all mm have a view on that </u>
<u who="sf5458">well we also talked about # the different reasons for sex between animals and humans # how in animals it's very much more reproductive reasons which is why the males of the species always have got elaborate colours # and fancy sort of displays for the female but in humans # it's not so much about reproduction any more it's got like a another meaning sort of in a relationship </u>
<u who="nm5447">mm</u>
<u who="sf5458"> # and we talked about the differences and like how they sort of developed separately</u>
<u who="nm5447">yeah it is i mean we have appetites we have to we have to want to do what we need to do otherwise our D-N-A doesn't get replicated we have to like eating we have to like drinking we have to like sex otherwise we wouldn't do it and we'd die all the species that didn't get that sorted are no longer here on the planet and all the species that really like doing those things presumably are still around and i guess it's a human achievement to educate taste and educate sound so we like listening to stuff and music and art and and sex is another appetite that has been has been educated from the kama sutra onwards and and and sold as well it has a has a commercial value anything people want will be turned into a commercial value you will realise that and that's that's something that i don't think you see in the animal world that elaboration of the pleasures of sensation and sort of conflicts as well i mean most of the Freudian psychology is about conflict between a biological urge and and a social a set of social conventions to control them to organise society in the face of it so i reckon that's a discontinuity between animals perhaps you know that an animal is is direct expression and the only thing that inhibits animals are a sort of other species fighting and threatening that they can't run fast enough and so on it's not quite the you and me situation as far as i can see anyway okay what's the next group anybody else on that row oh we've done that row haven't we you're all doing territory the middle row who's <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 word"/> no you're in the same group aren't you # were you in that group were you doing </u>
<u who="su">no</u>
<u who="nm5447">i can't remember you ought to have coloured shirts so we can better see what groups what did you any particular #</u>
<u who="sf5459"># we kind of picked up more on the physical attractiveness because # right and we were saying about how modern <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 word"/> like really really slim one is kind of a break from a built-in evolutionary <trunc>per</trunc>  perspective because if we were thinking in in evolutionary terms we'd expect men to like ones with like wide hips and big breasts and stuff but the slim shape doesn't fit in with the whole reproduction theme and # also the difference between # how in the animal world it's # men who do all of the strutting about with the fancy colours and what have you and then like in humans it tends to be women who put on the show more <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 word"/> changing</u>
<u who="su"><gap reason="inaudible" extent="2 sec"/></u>
<u who="nm5447">well that's i mean that's a good that's a good point again that's a good area for looking attraction and attractiveness and whether we see the same thing happening in animals as humans your example about thin narrow narrow-hipped you said women could what about the argument that what's really on show there is a tendency for for youthfulness and their fertility and reproductivity to be attractive and that's what you're really going for # that then that would be a more biologically reproductively orientated argument wouldn't it <trunc>th</trunc> that </u>
<u who="sf5460">could i just say something with the slim and # it's actually been suggested that males go for women with a slim waist because it show they're not shows that they're not already impregnated by another man and so they're not wasting their time by trying to make them pregnant </u>
<u who="nm5447">sounds far fetched <vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" dur="2"/> </u>
<u who="sf5460">no it's not really</u>
<u who="nm5447">no i know they wouldn't publish it if it is # no i it's possible and it it doesn't seem very feasible does it i mean i guess i mean if i happened to buy a biological argument i'd be more impressed with the sort of we go for youthfulness and we go for health and therefore you know things that things that we find attractive are expressions of health and expressions of youthfulness but i was wondering whether that is the case in human beings whether that is what people find attractive i don't know # what about what females find attractive in males what's that bright feathers</u>
<u who="sf5461">says something about strength # you know characteristics of strength</u>
<u who="nm5447">is it strength is that what's attractive </u>
<u who="sf5461">i think so</u>
<u who="nm5447">strength </u>
<u who="sf5462">they reckon it # <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 word"/> always go for a man that's more capable of providing for you and your child and that #</u>
<u who="su">the difference between #</u>
<u who="nm5447">that's a <trunc>diff</trunc>  slightly different thing or do you think do you think that is what when <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 word"/> you don't think it's strength in a man </u>
<u who="sf5462">well you look for both don't you really but it for some reason i reckon that particularly you'll go for a male that's stronger both physically and mentally to provide for you </u>
<u who="nm5447">mentally and physically</u>
<u who="sf5462">yes</u>
<u who="nm5447">right </u>
<u who="sf5462">i mean in humans more than animals</u>
<u who="nm5447">mm mm would anyone is that is that your common view # so is that isn't this a continuity between animal and human behaviour then # is this is this based on what we see in animals</u>
<u who="sm5449">similarly it's going to be difficult obviously <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 word"/></u>
<u who="nm5447">can you hear that at the back </u>
<u who="sm5449">in that it's just we go for the same things but in a different context such as animals will go for strength in terms of protection whereas female humans will go for strength represented by wealth good job et cetera it's the same sort of thing it's just that </u>
<u who="sf5463"><gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 word"/> socioeconomic crap thats</u>
<u who="nm5447">you'll have to speak up so they can hear at the back sorry</u>
<u who="sf5463">humans <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 word"/> socioeconomic factors they're important because animals don't have money basically they don't have and that sort of # and so what we were saying before about males having the brightly-coloured feathers for display humans do do that to an extent but it's more look how much money i've got rather than look how beautiful my feathers are </u>
<u who="nm5447">your Versace suits</u>
<u who="sf5463">yeah</u>
<u who="nm5447">well there's a good point made there about there's you know there's a <trunc>socio</trunc>  a socioeconomic context a symbolic context in which people participate and what you want to see is people who are successful in that and so in some senses it is a type of display it is a promise of being good in that context effective and being confident but it's not about it's not necessarily about strength it's just about being effective and confident </u>
<u who="su">it's about power</u>
<u who="nm5447">and power if you like yeah capacity in that sense </u>
<u who="sm5450">and humans have a choice i suppose animals normally the female has to cope with whichever male happens to win or be the strongest she hasn't got the choice <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 word"/> humans tend to chose their partners</u>
<u who="nm5447">you feel you feel humans have a choice do you </u>
<u who="sm5450">yes</u>
<u who="nm5447"> right yeah that's a good point humans have a choice you can go your own way and it is interesting that people different people like different things it isn't just the biggest <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 word"/> or the biggest car there are other other things it is interesting in the animal world that some it seems to me that some of the things that are selected in sexual displays are really functional things like sort of speed strength and there are other examples in the animal world of what <trunc>s</trunc>  selects like peacocks there's nothing # there's nothing functional about having all those feathers and that big display i mean you aren't going to be better <trunc>ab</trunc>  able the better to breed because of that are you it seems a puzzle i mean i don't know the answer to that why is it that you can go down that evolutionary cul-de-sac or that evolutionary path</u>
<u who="sm5449">isn't it that peacocks use them for intimidation and therefore the better the animal can intimidate the less likely it is to get killed or #</u>
<u who="nm5447">right but what intimidates a peahen might not be the same thing that <trunc>intimidate</trunc>  <trunc>in</trunc> intimidates a predator i suppose but maybe it does well perhaps you're right perhaps they don't have many predators perhaps they're pretty safe </u>
<u who="sf5458">is it so hard to <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 word"/> </u>
<u who="nm5447">possibly</u>
<u who="sf5458"><gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 word"/> </u>
<u who="nm5447">yeah could be</u>
<u who="sf5458">like with chickens how they have bigger things on their heads #</u>
<u who="nm5447">cones they're called cones i think aren't they</u>

<u who="sf5457"><gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 word"/> the whole thing </u>
<u who="nm5447">perhaps that's</u>
<u who="sf5457">form of display the healthier the # peacock is going to be so <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 word"/></u>
<u who="nm5447">i think perhaps that sorry yeah i think that perhaps answers the conundrum they are displays but behind those displays is health and fitness and vigour isn't it and perhaps that's you don't have to fight i mean fighting is one way of showing vigour and fitness and health and maybe another is a display okay got to where are we up to who's in the top groups have we have you done one no you haven't you've been very productive in the have you got anything else to say you were doing sex weren't you </u>
<u who="sf5457"><gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 word"/> territory</u>
<u who="nm5447">any other examples we haven't covered </u>
<u who="sf5457">we've got mating cycles </u>
<u who="nm5447">good yeah go on</u>
<u who="sf5457"># animals tend to have sort of seasons where they </u>
<u who="nm5447">that's a good point actually</u>
<u who="sf5457"># in the lunar world you don't have that </u>
<u who="nm5447">i think that is important from an evolutionary point of view did you hear that as a <trunc>it</trunc>  it's that most mammals # i think their their sort of breeding receptivity and their cycle is basically an olfactory thing the right smells and they just go bananas you've seen this with dogs on heat it's just a sad thing to look at without getting involved for most mammals <vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" dur="2"/> most mammals are a bit like this you know their and it's their seasoning and they only get interested when the right smells are about and and that is a cyclic thing an attraction and all and all the sort of the paraphernalia that goes with sex is only relevant for small parts of small segments of their life whereas in <trunc>cer</trunc>  in primates and human beings the shift has gone to the visual the <trunc>olfac</trunc> olfactory stimuli are not very important in in in attraction it's things you can see so baboons with his huge great red bum or chimpanzees <trunc>an</trunc>  and and you know whatever it is that turns people on is largely you know the example you've been given about sort of physical attractiveness in this are largely visual ones and certainly not olfactory ones power strength those sorts of things and and the and the game there is that the relevance of sex as a form of attraction is there all the time and can be an influence on institutions and on behaviour all the time so i think that is an important thing and i think that's a it's it's not a difference that separates us from all animals cause some primates and so on and birds as well i guess no birds get sort of feathers come at the right time of year they moult don't they but certainly some primates it's a it's a it's a largely a visual thing and i think that's quite a its a good distinction to make it's a sort of continuity and discontinuity # any any other examples were you doing sex or were you doing territory</u>
