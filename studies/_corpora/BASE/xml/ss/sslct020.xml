<u who="nm1163"> if for some reason you <pause dur="0.3"/> sort of get lost or want to know more about arms control which of course i assume that you will <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> Stuart Croft's Strategies of Arms Control is <pause dur="0.2"/> a really good introduction <pause dur="0.9"/> # and i think they have three copies in the library so <pause dur="0.2"/> you should be able to take turns and actually <pause dur="0.7"/> have a look at them <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.9"/> it sort of gives you a brief historical background and then goes into <pause dur="0.3"/> Cold War arms control negotiations <pause dur="0.5"/> and examines essentially the utility of arms control and <pause dur="0.2"/> the question of <pause dur="0.6"/> well is arms control <pause dur="0.2"/> a completely futile concept or is it not <pause dur="0.9"/> now the reason why he wrote the book <pause dur="0.4"/> partly was because <pause dur="1.4"/> <gap reason="name" extent="2 words"/> <pause dur="2.5"/> wrote a book called <pause dur="0.5"/> who is <pause dur="0.2"/> a member of the department now <pause dur="0.4"/> wrote a book called # <pause dur="0.8"/> House of Cards <pause dur="0.5"/> in which he argues very strongly against <pause dur="0.7"/> the <trunc>ut</trunc> <trunc>u</trunc> the usefulness of arms control <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> it was out of print for quite a long time but i hope that because he's joined the department <pause dur="0.4"/> i mean for quite a long time a few years <pause dur="0.8"/> i hope that because he's joined the 
department it should actually be available at least in the departmental library <pause dur="1.1"/> but i haven't checked i must admit it just <pause dur="0.4"/> occurred to me that i might # <pause dur="0.3"/> that it might actually be available now as well <pause dur="0.8"/> so you have two completely different perspectives Stuart Croft arguing well there is a there is a use there is some use to arms controls <pause dur="0.3"/> and <gap reason="name" extent="2 words"/> going no arms control it's all rubbish <pause dur="0.4"/> it's a completely futile endeavour <pause dur="1.1"/> i'm going to try to introduce you <pause dur="1.3"/><kinesic desc="puts on transparency" iterated="n"/> to concepts of arms control <pause dur="0.7"/> as they emerged <pause dur="1.2"/> now as i said <pause dur="0.3"/> last time <pause dur="0.2"/> arms control and arms races <pause dur="0.9"/> are <pause dur="0.5"/> not <pause dur="0.2"/> a phenomenon <pause dur="0.6"/> that's really only limited to the Cold War <pause dur="1.6"/> the reason why we have concentrated so much on <pause dur="0.3"/> arms control during the Cold War <pause dur="0.4"/> was simply because <pause dur="0.7"/> we were <trunc>d</trunc> we were dealing with nuclear weapons which you know loads about now after attending the lecture last week <pause dur="1.3"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> from a historical perspective arms races <pause dur="0.5"/> existed <pause dur="0.9"/> well since the <pause dur="1.5"/> well since <shift feature="voice" new="laugh"/> the beginning of time really <shift feature="voice" new="normal"/> <pause dur="0.6"/> one of the 
first # <pause dur="0.7"/> arms control measures <pause dur="0.6"/> was <pause dur="1.1"/> <trunc>p</trunc> <trunc>s</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> some <trunc>po</trunc> i forgot the name now <vocal desc="laugh" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.2"/> this is very embarrassing <pause dur="0.5"/> # <trunc>outla</trunc> outlawing the longbow <pause dur="1.2"/> simply because there was the idea that # that was an <pause dur="0.3"/> an immoral means of war <pause dur="1.8"/> but then real arms control on a political level <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> on a on a more concerted level <pause dur="0.5"/> you find before the <trunc>worl</trunc> the First World War <pause dur="0.5"/> when <pause dur="0.2"/> Russia and Britain both <pause dur="0.2"/> tried to push through <pause dur="0.6"/> # arms control <pause dur="0.9"/> agendas and and translate them into actual policy <pause dur="0.6"/> because <pause dur="0.2"/> they <trunc>s</trunc> they feared the outbreak of a war <pause dur="0.9"/> so the idea was if we try to cooperate on reducing levels of armament <pause dur="0.4"/> we reduce the security dilemma <pause dur="1.1"/> and therefore <pause dur="0.4"/> # war might actually not break out now there is <pause dur="1.3"/> a false logic <pause dur="0.2"/> to this argument but i get to that later <pause dur="1.3"/> now between the wars <pause dur="0.2"/> you had <pause dur="0.2"/> two <pause dur="1.1"/> broad categories of arms control one <pause dur="0.5"/> the Geneva Conventions <pause dur="0.5"/> which regulated the conduct of war <pause dur="0.3"/> the way in which military equipment was used <pause dur="0.4"/> military operations were conducted <pause dur="0.4"/> how prisoners were to be 
treated how <pause dur="0.2"/> which <pause dur="0.2"/> # targets were illegitimate targets <pause dur="0.6"/> how <pause dur="0.4"/> submarine warfare for example ought to be conducted or warfare at sea <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.9"/> all essentially aimed at regulating <pause dur="0.3"/> the the conduct of <trunc>mili</trunc> the conduct of military operations <pause dur="0.5"/> with a view to saving lives <pause dur="0.3"/> destroying the enemy's <pause dur="0.3"/> capabilities <pause dur="0.5"/> but saving lives and those whose lives have been saved and <trunc>be</trunc> and those who became prisoner <pause dur="0.6"/> were supposed to be treated in <pause dur="0.3"/> a reasonably decent way <pause dur="0.2"/> I-E not tortured et cetera et cetera <pause dur="1.3"/> now <pause dur="0.3"/> as such conventions often go <pause dur="0.3"/> they weren't adhered to in the Second World War <pause dur="1.2"/> # a great deal and <pause dur="0.2"/> obviously you still have violations of these conventions <pause dur="2.0"/> but then the question is might it not be a good <pause dur="0.2"/> idea to just have them for the sake of being able to refer to them <pause dur="1.0"/> the other <pause dur="0.6"/> # major system was the Washington Naval Treaty System <pause dur="0.6"/> in which <pause dur="0.4"/> Britain and the U-S Japan and Germany <pause dur="1.3"/> and France <pause dur="0.3"/> when and other countries but <trunc>th</trunc> those four countries particularly <pause dur="0.7"/> were meant to reduce their <pause dur="0.2"/> i mean Germany 
after the First World War had <pause dur="0.4"/> levels of armaments <pause dur="0.2"/> or top levels of armaments imposed on its armed forces at at any rate <pause dur="0.6"/> but they tried to come up with a system which would allow <pause dur="0.6"/> all of them to have some sort of <pause dur="0.3"/> armed forces or naval forces <pause dur="0.6"/> but which would not exceed a specific tonnage <pause dur="0.2"/> # the idea behind that being that <pause dur="0.5"/> if you only have a certain <pause dur="0.3"/> sort of size of ship you can only put <pause dur="0.2"/> a certain amount <pause dur="0.2"/> of <pause dur="0.5"/> weapons and and <pause dur="0.2"/> well <pause dur="0.5"/> weapons which which have <trunc>s</trunc> have limited capabilities on these ships <pause dur="1.1"/> now <pause dur="0.6"/> the Washington Treaty System also had a political dimension in that it <pause dur="0.2"/> was meant to force the countries that were members of the Washington Naval Treaties <pause dur="0.6"/> to talking to one another <pause dur="0.6"/> and to try to reduce to try to address each other's security concerns <pause dur="1.5"/> without <pause dur="0.2"/> always only bean counting <pause dur="0.2"/> but actually looking at what the political objectives were for each of these countries <pause dur="0.8"/> as we know <pause dur="1.0"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> the Washington <pause dur="0.2"/> Treaty <trunc>sys</trunc> <trunc>wa</trunc> Washington Naval Treaty System <pause dur="0.6"/> did not do its job as <pause dur="0.2"/> intended which 
is one of the reasons why <pause dur="0.4"/> arms control <pause dur="0.5"/> or <trunc>i</trunc> which is one example where arms control is sometimes dismissed as completely futile <pause dur="6.2"/><kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="6"/> now what what what are generally the aims <pause dur="0.6"/> of arms control <pause dur="2.1"/> i'll just look at them from the two main <pause dur="0.4"/> perspectives <pause dur="0.4"/> realist or neo-realist perspective and <pause dur="0.2"/> the # <pause dur="0.5"/> liberal or <pause dur="0.2"/> neo-liberal perspective <pause dur="2.0"/> from a realist perspective <pause dur="0.4"/> arms control <pause dur="0.3"/> # is essentially meant to maintain <pause dur="0.4"/> the balance of military power <pause dur="1.8"/> I-E that if you <pause dur="0.3"/> assume that <pause dur="0.2"/> if <trunc>ca</trunc> that capabilities <pause dur="0.2"/> it's particularly military capabilities <pause dur="0.6"/> are what make a state powerful <pause dur="1.3"/> then <pause dur="0.5"/> if there is a balance of military power <pause dur="0.8"/> if <pause dur="0.4"/> none of the states <pause dur="1.1"/> tied into this balance of power <pause dur="0.4"/> is capable <pause dur="0.6"/> of of<pause dur="0.2"/> mustering the military capabilites which would allow it to attack another state <pause dur="0.4"/> with the assumption that it would win the war <pause dur="0.4"/> and that's generally assumed as one of the <pause dur="0.2"/> principal <pause dur="0.4"/> causes of a war <pause dur="0.3"/> that if if there are <pause dur="0.3"/> political <pause dur="1.5"/> conflicts <pause dur="0.6"/> and state A assumes that it could win a war against state B <pause dur="0.8"/> then it is much 
more likely to actually go <pause dur="0.2"/> and attack that state <pause dur="0.2"/> than if it <pause dur="0.2"/> has <pause dur="0.4"/> capability reasons <pause dur="0.2"/> to assume it won't win that war <pause dur="1.2"/> so by maintaining the balance of military power <pause dur="1.1"/> the assumption was that this could avoid <pause dur="1.1"/> well would be the <trunc>assum</trunc> # <pause dur="0.2"/> that that this could be <pause dur="0.4"/> <trunc>s</trunc> that this could avoid war <pause dur="1.6"/> tied into that is obviously <pause dur="0.2"/> managing <pause dur="0.8"/> our old # <pause dur="0.8"/> concept the security dilemma <pause dur="1.8"/> not only with a view to avoiding the outbreak of war <pause dur="0.4"/> # at any given level <pause dur="0.7"/> but also <pause dur="0.3"/> because <pause dur="0.3"/> the security dilemma or or <pause dur="0.2"/> the spiral implied in the concept of security dilemma <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.9"/> implies <pause dur="0.2"/> defence expenditure <pause dur="0.3"/> it's an economic burden <pause dur="0.4"/> if <pause dur="0.3"/> two of or more states <pause dur="0.7"/> constantly respond to each other's <pause dur="0.2"/> increasing armament levels <pause dur="0.7"/> they will spend a lot of money on armed forces <pause dur="0.9"/> and arms control measures <pause dur="0.2"/> might be agreed upon <pause dur="0.5"/> if each side considers <pause dur="0.2"/> the defence expenditure far too high <pause dur="0.6"/> for <pause dur="0.4"/> its economic capabilities <pause dur="0.3"/> or chooses to or or would <trunc>desi</trunc> would desire <pause dur="1.1"/> to <pause dur="0.2"/> spend <pause dur="0.7"/> public money on <pause dur="0.2"/> things other <pause dur="0.3"/> than defence equipment <pause dur="1.8"/> so from a 
systemic perspective you could say <pause dur="0.5"/> if two two or more states <pause dur="0.2"/> seek to balance <pause dur="0.5"/> their cost-benefit equation in terms of military and economic security <pause dur="0.5"/> they might engage <pause dur="0.2"/> # in arms control <pause dur="2.0"/> the problem with that is that if you only <pause dur="0.2"/> reduce capabilities <pause dur="0.7"/> then that doesn't in itself prevent war because obviously the capabilities themselves <pause dur="0.9"/> do not cause war <pause dur="0.4"/> it's the intentions which lie behind the capabilities <pause dur="0.7"/> which <pause dur="0.2"/> might <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> lead to war <pause dur="0.8"/> so in a sense <pause dur="0.5"/> and this is what <pause dur="0.5"/> <gap reason="name" extent="2 words"/> for example would argue <pause dur="0.3"/> arms control leads you into a circular argument <pause dur="0.6"/> because <pause dur="1.0"/> since it's not the capabilities which cause war but political friction <pause dur="1.8"/> and <pause dur="0.3"/> as i will <pause dur="0.3"/> explain later you need trust in order to establish arms control measures <pause dur="1.2"/> by the time you actually would <pause dur="0.4"/> want to go for arms control measures <pause dur="0.5"/> it's quite likely that the states with whom you want to control your weaponry <pause dur="0.7"/> are not prepared to trust you <pause dur="0.2"/> therefore they are not going to negotiate with you <pause dur="0.3"/> so it doesn't make any sense whatsoever <pause dur="1.4"/> and <pause dur="0.9"/> 
if there is the trust and if there is negotiations are negotiations and if there are <pause dur="0.2"/> there is a preparedness in principle <pause dur="0.5"/> to cooperate <pause dur="0.7"/> politically <pause dur="0.9"/> then you don't need to avoid war <pause dur="1.0"/> so you don't need to control arms <pause dur="1.0"/> that would be <pause dur="0.2"/> one of the <pause dur="1.1"/> sort of perspectives on arms control which which <pause dur="0.5"/> basically says arms control <pause dur="0.2"/> doesn't do anything for anyone <pause dur="0.4"/> including for <pause dur="0.4"/> the stability in regions or the international system <pause dur="1.8"/> now from a more liberal perspective <pause dur="0.5"/> the argument would be <pause dur="1.0"/> the central <pause dur="2.3"/> benefit <pause dur="0.3"/> of arms control negotiations <pause dur="0.9"/> is that they can come up with rules <pause dur="0.2"/> and norms of behaviour <pause dur="1.5"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> as you will see later in the context of nuclear <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> weapons <pause dur="0.2"/> and <trunc>prolifera</trunc> # well nuclear weapons regulation <pause dur="1.5"/> that was a particularly <pause dur="0.2"/> prevalent argument <pause dur="2.3"/> partly <pause dur="1.4"/> # a liberal perspective of course is or this this idea that you can generate rules and norms of behaviour <pause dur="1.2"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> in the # on the on an international level or on a regional level <pause dur="0.2"/> through arms control <pause dur="0.3"/> that is tied in <pause dur="0.4"/> with the idea that <pause dur="0.4"/> 
weapons will only be be used as a last resort <pause dur="0.5"/> only if everything else has failed or if war is about to be pressed upon a state <pause dur="0.9"/> then <pause dur="0.3"/> a liberal state <pause dur="0.3"/> would <pause dur="0.2"/> find it necessary to defend itself <pause dur="0.6"/> but it would not necessarily advocate the use of force <pause dur="0.9"/> in order <pause dur="0.7"/> for for aggressive purposes <pause dur="0.6"/> now whether that still holds <pause dur="0.5"/> in today's environment where the use of force and the conditions for the use of force <pause dur="0.4"/> are changing <pause dur="1.3"/> is a different question <pause dur="2.0"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> a liberal perspective would furthermore <pause dur="0.2"/> emphasize the economic <pause dur="0.2"/> prosperity aspects of security building mechanisms <pause dur="0.7"/> # more than <pause dur="1.4"/> only to a <pause dur="0.2"/> limited degree but more than <pause dur="0.4"/> defence expenditure because <pause dur="0.2"/> there is <pause dur="0.9"/> liberals tend to see more of a trade-off between creating stability and security <pause dur="0.3"/> through economic means <pause dur="0.5"/> and the ability <pause dur="0.2"/> to <pause dur="0.3"/> preserve military or security by military means <pause dur="1.3"/> so from that perspective <pause dur="1.5"/> cooperation becomes more of a possibility even if <pause dur="0.5"/> this cooperation is seen <pause dur="0.3"/> essentially also as a means to fend off <pause dur="0.5"/> external threats <pause dur="0.2"/> which <pause dur="0.2"/> the 
international environment might throw at the state <pause dur="2.9"/> but that then leads <pause dur="0.7"/> in an argumentative line to <pause dur="0.3"/> the idea that economic gains through interdependence are preferable <pause dur="0.2"/> to <pause dur="0.5"/> using military means <pause dur="0.3"/> for the <trunc>condu</trunc> conduct of international politics <pause dur="0.8"/> that peaceful conflict resolution is # is essentially better than using force <pause dur="0.5"/> and that <pause dur="0.4"/> confidence and security building measures that's what this <pause dur="0.3"/> abbreviation means <pause dur="1.0"/> are a means <pause dur="0.3"/> of arms control in the sense that they control the will to use arms <pause dur="0.5"/> rather than <pause dur="0.3"/> on the <trunc>fir</trunc> in the first place <pause dur="0.2"/> the capabilities which the # <pause dur="0.3"/> weapons <pause dur="0.4"/> on each side convey </u><pause dur="0.6"/> <u who="sm1164" trans="pause"> so what does C </u><u who="nm1163" trans="latching"> sorry </u><u who="sm1164" trans="latching"> C-S-B-M stand for </u><u who="nm1163" trans="overlap"> confidence and security building measures <pause dur="3.2"/> sometimes you might find this also as <kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="6"/> just C-B-M <pause dur="0.3"/> which is confidence building measures <pause dur="6.6"/> now how is <trunc>arm</trunc> arms control conducted <pause dur="2.5"/> or what are the instruments of arms control <pause dur="2.7"/> 
much arms control happens on a state to state level <pause dur="1.5"/> since the end of the <pause dur="1.0"/> Cold War <pause dur="0.9"/> there is quite a lot of arms control <pause dur="0.3"/> which <pause dur="0.2"/> needs to happen in <pause dur="0.2"/> in the context of <pause dur="0.8"/> conflict resolution or resolution of conflicts in intra-state wars <pause dur="1.3"/> but that's a slightly separate issue <pause dur="1.7"/> now <pause dur="0.5"/> arms can be controlled nationally <pause dur="0.5"/> simply by a state imposing or a government imposing export controls <pause dur="1.2"/> we'll find that in the <pause dur="0.2"/> nuclear <pause dur="0.4"/> # non-proliferation regime <pause dur="0.8"/> # you find <pause dur="0.2"/> i i briefly touched upon that # in the context of <pause dur="0.2"/> dual use goods <pause dur="0.5"/> you found that although it doesn't always work or very often doesn't work <pause dur="0.5"/> # with regard to <pause dur="0.7"/> <unclear><trunc>nat</trunc></unclear> states <pause dur="0.2"/> that have a strong defence industry but also <pause dur="0.6"/> at least would like to pursue <pause dur="0.5"/> a policy which <pause dur="0.3"/> doesn't <pause dur="0.5"/> send arms into <pause dur="0.2"/> already conflict ridden regions <pause dur="0.3"/> watched through government sanction <pause dur="0.7"/> that they impose export controls <pause dur="0.2"/> temporary export controls <pause dur="1.5"/> and they are then this is then essentially a policy of unilateral restraint <pause dur="1.8"/> unilateral restraint can also be imposed of course on 
the development of certain weapon systems <pause dur="0.9"/> that <pause dur="0.2"/> some states just decide not to go for <pause dur="0.7"/> a particular weapon system or a particular technology <pause dur="1.2"/> which of course is <pause dur="0.4"/> a measure of arms control <pause dur="4.0"/> once you go on to <pause dur="0.2"/> sort of an international level <pause dur="1.0"/> and if you want to <pause dur="0.7"/> try to <pause dur="0.3"/> enshrine arms control measures <pause dur="0.8"/> on that level <pause dur="0.8"/> you have two options either <pause dur="0.4"/> states <trunc>agra</trunc> agree on a bilateral basis to <pause dur="0.4"/> reduce or control <pause dur="0.8"/> arms <pause dur="0.2"/> or their armaments <pause dur="1.0"/> or they agree <pause dur="0.7"/> on a bilateral level to <pause dur="1.7"/> unilateral measures <pause dur="0.2"/> that <trunc>pro</trunc> prohibit the <trunc>pro</trunc> the proliferation of certain technologies <pause dur="1.7"/> or <pause dur="0.3"/> you pursue a multilateral perspective which is <pause dur="0.6"/> particularly <pause dur="0.5"/> favoured for <pause dur="0.3"/> non-proliferation regimes <pause dur="2.5"/> now the difference between arms the <pause dur="0.6"/> you could say that non-proliferation is a subsection of arms control <pause dur="1.5"/> # just sort of <pause dur="0.3"/> for for conceptual clarification <pause dur="0.7"/> controlling arms essentially means controlling the level of armaments <pause dur="0.8"/> non-proliferation means preventing the spread <pause dur="0.2"/> of weapon systems or weapons 
technology <pause dur="0.8"/> so there is <pause dur="0.2"/> there is a slight difference but it's a <pause dur="0.2"/> significant difference between the two concepts <pause dur="2.0"/> bilaterally and multinationally <pause dur="0.4"/> # you have again different types of options you can either go for arms limitation <pause dur="0.5"/> or arms reduction treaties <pause dur="0.7"/> where the two sides agree to actually cut out <pause dur="0.5"/> a whole class of weapons <pause dur="2.9"/> there are arms or technology transfer controls or regimes <pause dur="0.2"/> regimes being <pause dur="0.4"/> multinational agreements which are then nationally implemented <pause dur="0.5"/> and which impose on the the members of the regime a set of rules and norms <pause dur="0.4"/> as to what they may and may not do <pause dur="0.3"/> which in turn is meant <pause dur="0.6"/> to make it more predictable for each of the members <pause dur="1.0"/> to <pause dur="0.4"/> know what <pause dur="0.6"/> another member is likely to do <pause dur="0.7"/> there are of course pitfalls to this but this is the <pause dur="0.4"/> the positive <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> the the <pause dur="0.4"/> perceived positive aspect of regime building <pause dur="1.6"/> you can have weapons exclusion zones <pause dur="0.2"/> where <pause dur="0.4"/> for example nuclear weapons are <pause dur="0.6"/> not not permitted or all the states in a particular zone <pause dur="0.5"/> region <pause dur="0.4"/> # agree not to acquire nuclear 
weapons <pause dur="1.5"/> moratoria which well particularly <pause dur="0.2"/> linked to nuclear weapons tests <pause dur="0.8"/> or one state would <pause dur="1.4"/> declare a moratorium on nuclear weapons testing <pause dur="0.3"/> which of course puts <pause dur="0.5"/> the other members of the nuclear <pause dur="0.4"/> power community under pressure <pause dur="0.4"/> if they also want to gain the moral high ground <pause dur="0.3"/> that they might also <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> call for a moratorium on their <pause dur="0.2"/> <vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.4"/> weapons testing <pause dur="0.9"/> and finally notification schemes which is essentially <pause dur="0.5"/> well it's one core of confidence and security building measures <pause dur="0.5"/> and that is <pause dur="0.7"/> because <pause dur="1.8"/> there is the assumption that capabilities <pause dur="0.7"/> might be <pause dur="0.7"/> might <pause dur="0.2"/> well the the possession of capabilities might trigger <pause dur="0.3"/> a war <pause dur="1.2"/> and there is also from a conventional war perspective <pause dur="0.3"/> still the very strong assumption that surprise attack is always <pause dur="0.2"/> better for the aggressor <pause dur="0.5"/> than <pause dur="1.1"/> sort of giving away too much <pause dur="0.7"/> now <pause dur="0.2"/> the reason why exercises and <pause dur="0.2"/> well exercises became an issue of notification schemes for exercises became an issue <pause dur="0.6"/> was that <pause dur="0.2"/> if <pause dur="0.2"/> armies exercise <pause dur="0.2"/> armies the air forces navies <pause dur="2.4"/> a potentially 
hostile <pause dur="0.5"/> state <pause dur="0.9"/> in the case of NATO and Warsaw Pact if NATO exercises the Warsaw Pact would look at NATO's exercises and go <pause dur="0.5"/> well what are they planning to do might they actually be tempted to attack us now <pause dur="0.7"/> but if there is early notification of what sort of exercises are going to be conducted <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.9"/> not what exactly they are going to <pause dur="0.2"/> exercise but <pause dur="0.4"/> how many soldiers or troops are going to be moved <pause dur="0.2"/> <trunc>base</trunc> <pause dur="0.4"/> how long the exercise is going to <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> going to be <pause dur="0.5"/> then the other side has some sort of reasonable <pause dur="0.2"/> way of assessing this exercise is just a pretence for <pause dur="0.3"/> an aggressive act or not <pause dur="0.6"/> now this is actually quite that that this was actually quite important during the Cold War because # <pause dur="0.5"/> NATO <pause dur="0.7"/> in fact did launch <pause dur="1.1"/> a missile as part of its exercise but that missile went astray <pause dur="0.6"/> and the Soviet Union wasn't sure whether that was an attack or not <pause dur="0.5"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> because they had good communications <pause dur="0.6"/> that meant that the that nothing <pause dur="0.3"/> worse than # just a small little blip happened <pause dur="0.9"/> it could have been <pause dur="0.2"/><kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="7"/> otherwise 
if there hadn't been <pause dur="0.9"/> a way of notifying each other of this <pause dur="0.7"/> and then for the Soviet Union to actually assure <pause dur="0.4"/> that this was not an aggressive act <pause dur="2.0"/> now how effective can arms control be <pause dur="2.0"/> if you have treaties on a government to government level <pause dur="0.7"/> whether they are <pause dur="0.4"/> multilateral or bilateral <pause dur="1.7"/> they constitute then international law but that means <pause dur="0.4"/> the implementation <pause dur="0.3"/> of the treaty <pause dur="0.4"/> depends on <pause dur="0.3"/> each <pause dur="0.2"/> government <pause dur="2.3"/> which poses a bit of a problem <pause dur="0.7"/> because <pause dur="0.3"/> yes governments agree to control or limit their <pause dur="0.2"/> their military arsenals <pause dur="0.4"/> but how does government A know <pause dur="0.4"/> that governments B C and D <pause dur="0.4"/> are actually complying with the commitment they entered into <pause dur="0.3"/> in the treaty <pause dur="4.3"/> the second issue is <pause dur="0.4"/> therefore <pause dur="0.4"/> that there has to be a degree of transparency <pause dur="0.5"/> in the arms control process <pause dur="0.5"/> now transparency really has two functions <pause dur="0.5"/> when it's talked about in the context of arms control <pause dur="0.5"/> one is <pause dur="0.5"/> that during arms control treaty negotiations <pause dur="0.2"/> each side <pause dur="0.3"/> is tasked with <pause dur="0.4"/> putting <pause dur="0.3"/> its capabilities <pause dur="0.7"/> more or less accurately on 
the table <pause dur="0.4"/> they have <pause dur="0.2"/> because they know the other side has been spying on them <pause dur="0.9"/> so they can't be completely off the mark <pause dur="0.9"/> so in a sense during the arms control negotiations they will try to tease out of each other <pause dur="0.4"/> what <pause dur="0.4"/> they have <pause dur="1.6"/> the other <pause dur="0.6"/> aspect of transparency is when it comes to implementing the arms control <pause dur="0.4"/> treaty that they have just agreed on <pause dur="1.6"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> and that is that <pause dur="1.1"/> whatever arms control measures have been agreed upon <pause dur="0.5"/> that should actually be <pause dur="0.5"/> verifiable and be made transparent <pause dur="1.1"/> by <pause dur="0.8"/> a multinational observer group or by <pause dur="0.3"/> # a small group <pause dur="0.5"/> of the opposite state <pause dur="1.3"/> now that doesn't always happen <pause dur="0.4"/> and there are actually a lot of arms control treaties which <pause dur="0.6"/> while still regarded valuable <pause dur="0.6"/> but which don't have either verification or transparency measures <pause dur="0.6"/> in that sense built into them <pause dur="2.1"/> particularly with regard to nuclear biological and chemical weapons the irreversibility <pause dur="0.7"/> of the arms control measures <pause dur="0.2"/> has gained <pause dur="1.0"/> very high priority in <pause dur="0.2"/> any <pause dur="0.2"/> sort of arms control negotiations but of 
course <pause dur="0.4"/> particularly with regard to <pause dur="0.4"/> nuclear and biological weapons where we have had most movement <pause dur="2.1"/> so transparency and verification are two essential components of arms control measures <pause dur="0.8"/> because <pause dur="0.2"/> yes <pause dur="0.5"/> you can say we have to trust each other <pause dur="1.2"/> but then <pause dur="0.6"/> checking <pause dur="0.2"/> whether it's worth trusting the other side is of course better <pause dur="0.5"/> than <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> just believing it <pause dur="0.7"/> and if the other side is compliant <pause dur="0.6"/> then that generates more trust which might in turn <pause dur="0.3"/> lead to more <pause dur="0.6"/> arms control measures <pause dur="0.4"/> if everything goes well <pause dur="1.0"/> and it <kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="6"/> often doesn't <pause dur="6.3"/> now <pause dur="1.3"/> you may recall that i mentioned on the side <pause dur="1.9"/> some time ago <pause dur="0.9"/> that the Cuban Missile Crisis was <pause dur="1.6"/> an important turning point in the way in which <pause dur="0.4"/> nuclear deterrence between the Soviet Union and the U-S was conducted <pause dur="1.0"/> now why was it so essential <pause dur="0.4"/> it was essential because it showed <pause dur="0.6"/> the two sides that they had no quick means of talking to one another <pause dur="0.9"/> that if anything happened if any nuclear accident happened <pause dur="0.8"/> they couldn't they would have to go through each other's 
<trunc>embas</trunc> # so through <pause dur="0.3"/> yeah their embassies <pause dur="0.7"/> and or each other's embassies <pause dur="0.4"/> to then <pause dur="0.2"/> and send <pause dur="1.0"/> letters by diplomatic post <pause dur="0.3"/> which is quicker than if they if it went by normal post but still <pause dur="0.4"/> it takes a little while <pause dur="0.5"/> and when when when we're talking about nuclear weapons and you didn't want to take that long <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="1.0"/> so <pause dur="0.3"/> the the need to actually be able to pick up the phone <pause dur="0.2"/> and <pause dur="0.3"/> talk to one another became <pause dur="0.4"/> a hugely important aspect <pause dur="0.2"/> of <pause dur="0.4"/> the way arms control negotiations started <pause dur="0.8"/> and it was really the first agreement that was that was implemented in nineteen-<pause dur="0.8"/>sixty-three <pause dur="0.5"/> meant they had a direct line between <pause dur="0.3"/> the Kremlin and the White House <pause dur="1.1"/> following <pause dur="0.9"/> that <pause dur="0.6"/> # we had several different measures which were meant to prevent <pause dur="0.4"/> or <pause dur="0.2"/> <trunc>ha</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> were were were included <pause dur="0.4"/> # notification about nuclear accidents <pause dur="0.4"/> accidents at sea <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="1.1"/> the Limited Test Band treaty <pause dur="0.6"/> and <pause dur="0.5"/> from <pause dur="0.2"/> nineteen-sixty-nine onwards <pause dur="0.2"/> the two sides of the U-S and the Soviet Union <pause dur="0.5"/> engaged in what became known as the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks <pause dur="1.4"/> now <pause dur="1.3"/> i mentioned 
SALT as <pause dur="0.2"/> an issue which the Europeans saw <pause dur="0.2"/> with some trepidation <pause dur="0.9"/> because as i said the negotiations went on between the U-S and the Soviet Union <pause dur="0.4"/> and didn't include either the European Warsaw Pact members or the European <pause dur="0.5"/> # NATO members <pause dur="1.0"/> so the worry on the part of the Europeans was <pause dur="0.4"/> that the U-S and the Soviet Union might actually break out to a degree <pause dur="0.7"/> of of <pause dur="0.8"/> their alliance well <trunc>pa</trunc> <pause dur="0.3"/> particularly for the for the <pause dur="0.2"/> # European NATO members that was the concern <pause dur="1.1"/> and that therefore the U-S might find a settlement which enhanced its own security <pause dur="0.6"/> through <pause dur="0.2"/> nuclear arms control <pause dur="1.4"/> but also made it less likely that <trunc>so</trunc> that the U-S would intervene <pause dur="0.2"/> or would come to the aid of NATO Europe <pause dur="0.4"/> if there was Soviet attack <pause dur="2.9"/> what it did do <pause dur="0.6"/> apart from the U-S then having to reiterate its point that it <pause dur="0.5"/> wouldn't <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.9"/> defect <pause dur="1.8"/> what SALT-one did <pause dur="0.7"/> was <pause dur="0.3"/> more a political achievement than an actual military achievement because it started <pause dur="0.3"/> a process of arms control negotiations which lasted through 
the entire nineteen-seventies <pause dur="0.6"/> was then interrupted for about <pause dur="0.2"/> five years <pause dur="0.6"/> because the Cold War <pause dur="0.2"/> became colder again <pause dur="0.8"/> and <pause dur="0.6"/> was then taken up <pause dur="0.5"/> really where SALT-two had left it <pause dur="0.5"/> in the start negotiations about which i will tell you <pause dur="0.2"/> briefly <pause dur="0.2"/> in a minute <pause dur="1.8"/> a central treaty <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> linked to SALT-one was the A-B-M Treaty the # Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty <pause dur="1.1"/> that was central <pause dur="1.3"/> because it enshrined <pause dur="2.0"/> the rationale that the <pause dur="0.2"/> well <pause dur="0.2"/> the the rationale which the U-S had favoured for <pause dur="1.1"/> a long time <pause dur="0.9"/> that nuclear deterrence should be <trunc>b</trunc> based on authentic capability <pause dur="1.1"/> with the <trunc>A</trunc> with the signing of the A-B-M Treaty which allowed <pause dur="0.4"/> the Soviet Union and the U-S to build <pause dur="0.3"/> anti-ballistic missile defences <pause dur="0.4"/> around <pause dur="0.3"/> first only <pause dur="0.2"/> one site each and then two sites <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.8"/> in in the respective country <pause dur="1.3"/> with the Soviet Union signing this treaty they basically said yes <pause dur="0.3"/> defence against nuclear weapons is not possible <pause dur="0.7"/> therefore or it's not affordable either <pause dur="0.4"/> therefore we are going to join you in building our capabilities <pause dur="0.4"/> or 
building deterrents on <pause dur="1.1"/> on offensive capabilities <pause dur="1.0"/> and <pause dur="0.5"/> this is <pause dur="0.2"/> essentially seen as the principal <pause dur="0.3"/> stability enhancing quality of the A-B-M Treaty <pause dur="0.4"/> now the reason i'm going on about this <pause dur="0.6"/> is that <pause dur="0.2"/> at the moment and <trunc>f</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> during the entire nineteen-nineties <pause dur="0.6"/> the U-S <pause dur="0.4"/> has <pause dur="0.8"/> pursued <pause dur="0.3"/> and is <pause dur="0.2"/> seriously thinking <pause dur="0.3"/> about <pause dur="0.4"/> deploying <pause dur="0.3"/> a national ballistic missile defence system <pause dur="1.0"/> and you have the same arguments <pause dur="0.2"/> over again <pause dur="0.5"/> as to what a national ballistic missile defence system will do <pause dur="0.5"/> for international and for European <trunc>se</trunc> security <pause dur="0.9"/> because if the <trunc>sov</trunc> if the U-S can can <pause dur="0.5"/> defend itself <pause dur="0.7"/> is it likely to actually <pause dur="0.4"/> come to the aid of allies <pause dur="1.2"/> 
for the allies it means <pause dur="0.2"/> are they going to spend their money on <pause dur="0.3"/> a European ballistic missile defence system <pause dur="0.4"/> which will also give them some degree <pause dur="0.3"/> some limited capability to <trunc>f</trunc> to defend themselves against <pause dur="0.6"/> missiles now no longer coming from well <pause dur="0.4"/> now the assumption is no longer that it that they primarily come from the Soviet <trunc>un</trunc> from <pause dur="0.2"/> well the successors of the Soviet Union <pause dur="1.1"/> but <pause dur="0.7"/> because Iraq Korea <pause dur="0.2"/> and well <pause dur="0.2"/> several <trunc>mid</trunc> Middle Eastern states and several <pause dur="0.9"/> <trunc>asia</trunc> # east Asian states <pause dur="0.5"/> have started <pause dur="0.7"/> building ballistic missiles which have now by now a medium range capability <pause dur="0.6"/> and the assumption is that well we need a ballistic missile defence system because <pause dur="0.5"/> these states are otherwise going to attack us <pause dur="0.6"/> now how serious this threat is <pause dur="0.4"/> is <pause dur="0.2"/> a hugely controversial issue <pause dur="1.1"/> they may have these capabilities but they may not want to attack <pause dur="0.3"/> Europe <pause dur="0.7"/> and <pause dur="0.4"/> is a ballistic missile defence system not an invitation <pause dur="0.6"/> for <pause dur="0.3"/> one of these states that is 
pursuing <pause dur="0.2"/> ballistic missile development <pause dur="1.0"/> to actually try and penetrate <pause dur="0.2"/> this ballistic missile defence system <pause dur="0.7"/> how secure can it be <pause dur="0.2"/> do you need a hundred per cent security or do you need <pause dur="0.2"/> eighty per cent security <pause dur="0.7"/> what if you feel secure <pause dur="0.2"/> under your ballistic missile defence system <pause dur="0.7"/> and have spent loads of money <pause dur="0.2"/> on the <pause dur="0.2"/> on that but you don't have any money for other defensive measures <pause dur="0.8"/> so it's an it's an enormously <pause dur="0.4"/> important issue <pause dur="0.6"/> which you will hear of <pause dur="0.4"/> much more <pause dur="0.4"/> if you read the newspaper <pause dur="0.3"/> and if # George W Bush is becoming president because he has already said that he will definitely deploy <pause dur="0.5"/> Clinton earlier this year <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.9"/> took back the earlier decision that <pause dur="0.3"/> the <trunc>uni</trunc> that the the U-S will definitely get a ballistic a national ballistic missile defence system <pause dur="0.8"/> Gore <pause dur="0.2"/> is basically pursuing a Clinton line <pause dur="0.5"/> but Bush has said we're going to go for it <pause dur="0.4"/> what that does for European defence <pause dur="0.6"/> is an issue we really need to think about <pause dur="2.8"/> hence <pause dur="0.2"/> the A-B-M Treaty <pause dur="0.2"/> being a very important <pause dur="1.6"/> historical relic <pause dur="0.5"/> 
and Russia i should <pause dur="0.2"/> add that just just for <pause dur="0.3"/> your full <shift feature="voice" new="laugh"/>information <shift feature="voice" new="normal"/><pause dur="0.5"/> Russia is seriously against <pause dur="0.5"/> any deployment of ballistic missile defence systems they <pause dur="0.6"/> there there have been talks as to what how they might cooperate on this # or not but Russia clings very much to <pause dur="0.5"/> the idea that the A-B-M Treaty is really unviable <pause dur="0.9"/> # unvialable <pause dur="1.1"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> going back to SALT SALT <trunc>re</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> limited really <pause dur="0.2"/> the deployment <pause dur="0.2"/> the number of deployments <pause dur="0.4"/> of medium range missiles <pause dur="0.5"/> these were missiles which were no longer going to be produced but they just agreed that they <pause dur="0.3"/> that they were essentially it was essentially outdated technology by the time <pause dur="0.6"/> but they agreed that they would no longer <pause dur="0.3"/> # develop them and deploy them <pause dur="0.7"/> it didn't have any verification measures apart from <pause dur="1.1"/> national technical means which is essentially <pause dur="0.2"/> spy planes or spy satellites <pause dur="1.0"/> # <pause dur="1.4"/> and there were no observer missions or anything built into this but the idea that they <pause dur="0.2"/> were talking about arms control <pause dur="0.3"/> was already seen as <pause dur="0.6"/> one mean a one one positive step forward <pause dur="0.6"/> 
SALT-two went a lot further <pause dur="0.3"/> but was never ratified <pause dur="0.2"/> because the Soviet Union <pause dur="0.3"/> invaded Afghanistan <pause dur="0.5"/> and U-S Congress then <pause dur="0.3"/> refused to ratify the treaty <pause dur="1.2"/> following the invasion of Afghanistan obviously <pause dur="0.3"/> as you all know the Cold War became a lot colder <pause dur="1.7"/> so it took until the advent of Mikhail Gorbachev <pause dur="0.7"/> to start <pause dur="1.2"/> some new approach to arms control <pause dur="3.6"/> some people <pause dur="0.4"/> argue that it was really Ronald Reagan's massive build up of nuclear and <pause dur="0.3"/> conventional capabilities <pause dur="0.8"/> of the U-S forces <pause dur="0.8"/> which escalated as you all know in <pause dur="0.3"/> the S-D-I <pause dur="0.6"/> proposal <pause dur="0.5"/> which is essentially the precursor <pause dur="0.4"/> to the ballistic missile defence systems we are talking about now <pause dur="2.4"/> so some people would argue that # <pause dur="1.4"/> Ronald Reagan out<pause dur="0.7"/>procured <pause dur="0.5"/> outarmed <pause dur="0.7"/> the Soviet Union <pause dur="0.8"/> others <pause dur="0.2"/> would say and <pause dur="1.2"/> i think they have a stronger case to make <pause dur="1.2"/> that <pause dur="0.2"/> Gorbachev's <pause dur="0.2"/> policy swing towards reasonable sufficiency in <pause dur="0.5"/> Soviet defence <pause dur="0.8"/> planning and Soviet defence spending <pause dur="1.1"/> was a major step forward which enabled <pause dur="0.3"/> nuclear <pause dur="0.5"/> arms reductions <pause dur="1.2"/> reasonable 
sufficiency was essentially a policy which went back <pause dur="0.2"/> from <pause dur="0.4"/> we have to have massive forces <pause dur="0.8"/> in <pause dur="0.2"/> any conceivable theatre that we might have to fight in <pause dur="0.8"/> to well how much do we actually need <pause dur="0.4"/> given the political situation surrounding us <pause dur="0.7"/> given that we are pursuing a policy <pause dur="0.5"/> that is meant to build friendly relations with all our neighbours <pause dur="0.3"/> and you can see that on the policy level that the Soviet Union went out and <pause dur="0.5"/> and <pause dur="0.4"/> started <pause dur="0.8"/> rebuilding trust between <pause dur="0.2"/> itself and its neighbours <pause dur="1.1"/> not least in order to <pause dur="0.9"/> have external stability <pause dur="0.3"/> for <pause dur="0.2"/> <trunc>dome</trunc> domestic political and economic reform <pause dur="1.4"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> and that was <pause dur="0.3"/> these <pause dur="0.3"/> diplomatic <pause dur="1.5"/> # <pause dur="0.8"/> <trunc>for</trunc> forays <pause dur="0.8"/> where <pause dur="1.0"/> replicated on the military level <pause dur="0.7"/> by <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.9"/> a new design of the defence of defence policy which would use defence spending <pause dur="0.5"/> and went for <pause dur="0.3"/> smaller amount of forces <pause dur="2.5"/> you also have Gorbachev <pause dur="0.2"/> <trunc>pro</trunc> # <pause dur="0.3"/> suggesting in various fora <pause dur="1.0"/> conventional arms reductions <pause dur="0.7"/> now the West didn't take that too seriously for quite a long time <pause dur="0.4"/> because the arms reductions he proposed <pause dur="0.4"/> 
essentially concerned <pause dur="0.7"/> weapons systems which were outdated <pause dur="1.1"/> such as <pause dur="0.2"/> small submarines in the Baltic sea <pause dur="2.7"/> but START-one <pause dur="0.4"/> which the U-S and and then still the Soviet Union <pause dur="0.3"/> signed in nineteen-ninety and was then ratified in nineteen-ninety-two <pause dur="0.7"/> was <pause dur="0.5"/> A an extension of the concept started in <pause dur="0.2"/> the SALT treaties <pause dur="0.5"/> I-E that launcher systems and platforms would be reduced <pause dur="0.3"/> not nuclear warheads <pause dur="0.7"/> that became an issue soon after START-one was signed <pause dur="1.5"/> but it was the first treaty which really significantly reduced <pause dur="0.7"/> nuclear <pause dur="1.1"/> long range or strategic <pause dur="0.3"/> # launch platforms <pause dur="0.9"/> in nineteen-<pause dur="1.6"/>ninety-five you also have the # well they agreed <pause dur="0.3"/> to reduce <pause dur="1.0"/> no nineteen-eighty-seven sorry <pause dur="0.5"/> wrong wrong date <pause dur="0.4"/> they agreed on # <pause dur="0.3"/> a complete reduction <pause dur="0.2"/> or a <trunc>comp</trunc> <trunc>comp</trunc> complete elimination <pause dur="0.4"/> of intermediate nuclear forces <pause dur="0.5"/> which # was the first time ever that a whole class of weapons <pause dur="0.2"/> was going to be abolished <pause dur="1.8"/> now <pause dur="0.4"/> START-one <pause dur="0.2"/> as much as it was a positive development soon ran into an enormous problem because what <pause dur="0.2"/> they had of course

whether they are using nuclear material <pause dur="0.3"/> for the purposes that they have committed themselves to <pause dur="0.3"/> I-E <pause dur="0.2"/> not for military purposes <pause dur="0.7"/> the I-A-E-A in essence is an audit organization <pause dur="0.5"/> which checks the books <pause dur="1.0"/> of all in all the <pause dur="0.2"/> # installations for which it has # <pause dur="0.3"/> access rights <pause dur="0.8"/> but it doesn't <trunc>ca</trunc> cannot prevent <pause dur="1.0"/> nuclear weapons development <pause dur="0.5"/> it's been <pause dur="0.2"/> recently earlier in <pause dur="0.2"/> this <pause dur="0.3"/> # in in in the last decade <pause dur="1.1"/> it has been strengthened <pause dur="1.2"/> but it still has only very limited <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="1.2"/> limited access rights <pause dur="1.1"/> the central deal in the N-P-T <pause dur="0.6"/> was that the four <pause dur="1.4"/> five <pause dur="0.9"/> permanent members of the security council <pause dur="0.4"/> all of whom had nuclear weapons by the time <pause dur="0.4"/> the N-P-T <pause dur="0.4"/> was # agreed upon in nineteen-sixty-seven <pause dur="1.8"/> that they would <pause dur="0.4"/> give access <pause dur="0.7"/> to nuclear <pause dur="0.2"/> material and technology for the <trunc>pa</trunc> production of power <pause dur="0.8"/> # electricity <pause dur="0.8"/> and any other peaceful purposes medical use for example <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> or in agriculture <pause dur="0.5"/> they would give access to this information and to this material to all the members <pause dur="0.4"/> of the N-P-T which joined the N-P-T <pause dur="0.9"/> but these 
members had to commit themselves to not <pause dur="0.5"/> procuring nuclear weapons <pause dur="1.3"/> I-E the trade-off was we abstain from nuclear weapons <pause dur="0.5"/> if you give us nuclear technology <pause dur="0.6"/> it's significant to remember that at the time nuclear <pause dur="0.2"/> power was seen as <pause dur="0.4"/> one of the major potential motors <pause dur="0.4"/> for <pause dur="0.3"/> development <pause dur="0.4"/> in <pause dur="0.2"/> lesser developed countries <pause dur="0.8"/> because <pause dur="1.2"/> you could produce a lot of power out of very very <pause dur="0.3"/> little material <pause dur="0.4"/> now if the investment <pause dur="0.4"/> in nuclear power has turned out to be <pause dur="0.3"/> enormously expensive <pause dur="0.4"/> in financial terms <pause dur="0.4"/> and of course there are <pause dur="0.2"/> serious risks associated with the use of nuclear power <pause dur="1.5"/> in turn <pause dur="1.1"/> the <pause dur="0.3"/> the P-five <pause dur="0.9"/> so-called nuclear weapons states <pause dur="0.7"/> committed themselves in article six <pause dur="0.2"/> to working towards <pause dur="0.6"/> early <trunc>nuc</trunc> <trunc>com</trunc> early and complete nuclear disarmament at the <pause dur="0.9"/> earliest possible time <pause dur="0.7"/> now their article six commitment <pause dur="0.4"/> has become <pause dur="0.5"/> an even more contentious issue than it was <pause dur="0.4"/> soon after it became apparent that <pause dur="0.3"/> the P-five had no intention to really seriously go towards zero <pause dur="0.9"/> during the Cold War <pause dur="0.6"/> since the end 
of the Cold War <pause dur="0.9"/> they have come under a lot more pressure <pause dur="0.4"/> from countries <pause dur="0.4"/> which used to belong to the non-alliant movement <pause dur="0.9"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> trying to force them into <pause dur="0.4"/> actually <pause dur="1.1"/> making serious steps towards <pause dur="0.5"/> complete nuclear disarmament <pause dur="1.5"/> the N-P-T is not the only element of the nuclear non-proliferation regime <pause dur="0.6"/> national measures have also been taken by those countries that had advanced nuclear <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> had access to or developed nuclear technology <pause dur="0.6"/> and they <pause dur="1.2"/> these measures are are sort of can be subsumed under nuclear suppliers regulations <pause dur="0.6"/> the London Club has come up with a list of trigger technologies <pause dur="0.4"/> which are supposed to be subjected to particularly stringent export controls <pause dur="0.6"/> and for which licenses have to be # <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> well obtained before they can be exported <pause dur="0.3"/> and they have committed themselves not to export any <pause dur="0.3"/> weapons related <pause dur="0.2"/> # technologies to non-weapon states <pause dur="0.9"/> 
and you have regional <trunc>regul</trunc> # regulations so you have <trunc>s</trunc> # a multitier system <pause dur="0.5"/> in the form of EUROTOM associated with <pause dur="0.3"/> the E-U <pause dur="5.5"/><kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="5"/> finally <pause dur="0.9"/> you have <pause dur="0.4"/> as i already said on the national level <trunc>ex</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> national export controls which are not tied into <pause dur="0.5"/> # a wider system <pause dur="0.4"/> and a so-called fuel takeback policy which has been on and off <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> whatever since it <pause dur="0.3"/> was started <pause dur="0.5"/> by the nuclear weapon states <pause dur="0.9"/> because the idea was that <pause dur="0.5"/> if <pause dur="2.7"/> a country runs <pause dur="0.2"/> nuclear power reactors it can in principle <pause dur="0.3"/> obtain the material for weapons <pause dur="0.5"/> from the fuel rods that have to go into the <trunc>pow</trunc> the reactor <pause dur="0.6"/> but if the state that has produced the fuel <pause dur="0.4"/> takes these these fuel rods <trunc>bage</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> back back <pause dur="0.4"/> and then supplies <pause dur="0.3"/> fresh fuel rods <pause dur="0.4"/> then <pause dur="0.2"/> the country that runs just the nuclear power station won't get access to that material <pause dur="2.9"/> the Partial Test Ban Treaty and the <trunc>c</trunc> the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty the Partial Test Ban Treaty is no problem that's been signed 
and ratified <pause dur="0.5"/> the C-T-B-T <pause dur="1.1"/> has <pause dur="0.3"/> huge <pause dur="1.4"/> political <pause dur="0.2"/> problems attached to it <pause dur="0.7"/> the reason why the C-T-B-T is seen as a valuable <pause dur="0.9"/> arms control measure <pause dur="0.3"/> is that in order to build up a militarily useful nuclear arsenal <pause dur="0.7"/> it is necessary to test <pause dur="0.2"/> weapons <pause dur="0.8"/> and <pause dur="1.4"/> these tests in most countries still would have to be done physically <pause dur="0.4"/> which means <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> that if you restrict <pause dur="0.2"/> testing <pause dur="0.9"/> then <pause dur="0.6"/> you put a break <pause dur="0.3"/> into the development cycle <pause dur="0.2"/> or <pause dur="0.2"/> nuclear <pause dur="0.4"/> # technology <pause dur="0.5"/> weapons technology <pause dur="0.9"/> # however not only the so-called rogue state or <pause dur="0.7"/> rogue states which the U-S called them tends to call rogue states <pause dur="0.5"/> but also the U-S haven't signed <pause dur="0.3"/> the # ratified the C-T-B-T yet <pause dur="0.6"/> remains to be seen whether that will be done <pause dur="1.3"/> and just one example for a nuclear weapons free zone was the Treaty of Tlatelolco <pause dur="1.1"/><kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="17"/> which is always a tongue breaker <pause dur="0.8"/> # signed in <pause dur="0.3"/> which established a nuclear weapons free zone for Latin America <pause dur="0.4"/> in nineteen-sixty-eight <pause dur="6.9"/> now a lot of the problems <pause dur="0.9"/> associated with nuclear <pause dur="0.6"/> nuclear technology <pause dur="4.1"/> is there

material <pause dur="0.8"/> adequately and actually check whether it's not going to be diverted in small amounts <pause dur="3.2"/> biological and chemical weapons you have essentially the same problem <pause dur="0.7"/> anyone who <pause dur="0.8"/> would want to start a lab <pause dur="0.8"/> in which <pause dur="1.4"/> biological weapons are to be produced <pause dur="1.1"/> essentially only needs to contact some farming supplier here <pause dur="1.0"/> and get <pause dur="1.4"/> the bacteria <pause dur="0.5"/> he or she wants <pause dur="0.7"/> and then start a production line <pause dur="0.2"/> for particular toxins <pause dur="0.5"/> for particular <pause dur="0.6"/> microbes <pause dur="1.7"/> things that that are not <pause dur="2.5"/> which are not very difficult to get <pause dur="0.6"/> you can <pause dur="0.4"/> you can buy cheaply and then produce <pause dur="0.5"/> in massive amounts <pause dur="1.2"/> chemical weapons very similar issue a lot of the # <pause dur="0.2"/> chemical or a lot of the elements which go into <pause dur="1.1"/> # chemical weapons <pause dur="0.4"/> are used <pause dur="0.4"/> in agriculture or in all sorts of other industries <pause dur="0.2"/> with civilian application <pause dur="1.0"/> now the real problem arises when <pause dur="0.9"/> we think about how biological chemical or even nuclear weapons are <pause dur="0.6"/> might be distributed <pause dur="0.8"/> and the most attractive means of doing that is <pause dur="0.3"/> by missiles <pause dur="0.7"/> now since the end of the 
nineteen-eighties <pause dur="0.4"/> ballistic missiles <pause dur="0.2"/> have <pause dur="0.9"/> <trunc>ba</trunc> ballistic missile technology which is also very largely dual use technology <pause dur="0.7"/> has been proliferating <pause dur="1.1"/> quite widely <pause dur="0.7"/> to a number of countries <pause dur="0.5"/> particularly <pause dur="0.2"/> # in west south <pause dur="0.4"/> and east Asia <pause dur="1.7"/> the three main <pause dur="0.2"/> treaties we have at the moment which are trying to sort of contain this <pause dur="0.7"/> are the ones listed here <pause dur="1.6"/> biological weapons convention the main problem as i said is <pause dur="0.2"/> that there is no <pause dur="0.2"/> there are no verification procedures <pause dur="0.8"/> although the U-S and <pause dur="0.3"/> Russia have an agreement <pause dur="0.4"/> by which the U-S <pause dur="0.4"/> is aiding Russia to reduce its <pause dur="0.2"/> biological weapons arsenal <pause dur="0.4"/> and destroy them which of course has the verification component attached to that <pause dur="2.8"/><kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="12"/> most notorious problem is conventional arms control <pause dur="3.1"/> because a lot of them well <pause dur="0.2"/> all the main <pause dur="0.6"/> weapons exporters <pause dur="0.8"/> have an interest <pause dur="0.9"/> for industrial employment but particularly <pause dur="0.5"/> military reasons to maintain a defence industry <pause dur="1.3"/> now because they can't <pause dur="0.2"/> apart from the U-S <pause dur="0.7"/> they can't afford to build <pause dur="1.1"/> the weapons that 
would make defence production economical <pause dur="1.0"/> only for their own armed forces <pause dur="0.5"/> they have to export <pause dur="1.2"/> otherwise they have to change their defence policy entirely <pause dur="2.5"/> but of course once you start doing that <pause dur="0.7"/> there are a lot of links in the chain <pause dur="1.3"/> and there are a lot of links <pause dur="0.6"/> which may <pause dur="0.2"/> not be interested in <pause dur="0.4"/> exporting weapons in accordance with international treaties <pause dur="0.6"/> # government regulation and such like <pause dur="1.1"/> plus of course nobody really wants to be too open about what sort of <pause dur="0.4"/> weapon systems they have in their <pause dur="0.5"/> in their arsenal <pause dur="0.7"/> because they don't want to give away too much <pause dur="1.9"/> so <pause dur="1.0"/> all the attempts at reducing <pause dur="0.4"/> conventional weapons <pause dur="0.9"/> which are not in a <pause dur="0.7"/> in a context <pause dur="0.2"/> or which were not conceived in the Cold War context <pause dur="1.0"/> particularly here the Conventional Forces of Europe Treaty # which was signed in nineteen-ninety <pause dur="1.1"/> which reduced <pause dur="0.9"/> the arsenals of <pause dur="0.2"/> both blocks <pause dur="0.4"/> brought both blocks down <pause dur="0.5"/> which then of course entailed a host of different problems <pause dur="0.6"/> as to implementing the treaty when the two blocks 
disintegrated or the Warsaw Pact disintegrated <pause dur="1.8"/> all the other agreements <pause dur="0.2"/> are very very vague <pause dur="0.7"/> they are <pause dur="0.3"/> conventions they are aimed at at creating norms <pause dur="0.6"/> at <pause dur="1.0"/> # generating rules and voluntary adherence to rules <pause dur="0.7"/> the Wassenaar Agreement <pause dur="0.7"/> is essentially a follow on to the COCUM Agreement which the West had <trunc>impl</trunc> had instated <pause dur="0.5"/> to limit exports of high <trunc>technol</trunc> high military <pause dur="0.2"/> use technology <pause dur="0.5"/> to the Warsaw Pact <pause dur="1.0"/> # Wassenaar is <pause dur="0.3"/> not very different from that <pause dur="0.9"/> the U-N conventional weapons register <pause dur="0.4"/> problem here <pause dur="0.7"/> returns to the <trunc>v</trunc> register through national governments are voluntary <pause dur="0.7"/> and even if <pause dur="0.2"/> # a government returns only an empty sheet <pause dur="0.6"/> it doesn't <pause dur="0.7"/> it it counted as a return <pause dur="0.3"/> but it doesn't really enhance transparency <pause dur="0.5"/> but <pause dur="0.2"/> nevertheless the conventional weapons register is meant to enhance transparency <pause dur="1.1"/> code of conduct we will probably hear <pause dur="0.2"/> a bit more about <pause dur="1.2"/> in the future again <pause dur="0.6"/> which is essentially also a means of trying to <pause dur="0.5"/> stimulate norms <pause dur="3.7"/><kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="12"/> just to make the <pause dur="0.6"/> i know i'm overrunning slightly <pause dur="0.5"/> just to 
make it complete <pause dur="2.8"/> these are a few examples of <trunc>confi</trunc> confidence and security building measures <pause dur="3.1"/> which as i said before are aimed at initiating a dialogue <pause dur="0.2"/> and <pause dur="0.7"/> building trust through talking to one another <pause dur="1.6"/> how far they are they can be in themselves <pause dur="1.7"/> an <trunc>instabil</trunc> or a stability increasing tool <pause dur="0.4"/> without any other ingredients <pause dur="0.4"/> is highly doubtful <pause dur="0.9"/> there has to be at least the initial will <pause dur="0.6"/> and that is often tied in with incentives as to what <pause dur="0.2"/> will be the actual gain out of <pause dur="0.2"/> negotiations <pause dur="1.2"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> before anything substantive happens <pause dur="3.3"/> but the other examples are essentially the ones that i have mentioned already <pause dur="5.3"/> in other words exchange of observers well <trunc>exe</trunc> exchange of <pause dur="0.2"/> <trunc>e</trunc> exchange of observers <pause dur="0.5"/> is essentially <pause dur="1.7"/> it's it's tied in with the notification of military exercises # idea <pause dur="0.5"/> and that is if if one <pause dur="1.2"/> for example at the end of the Cold War if the Warsaw Pact exercised or NATO exercised <pause dur="0.8"/> each side NATO would send <pause dur="0.2"/> or would be invited to send observers to some of the exercises <pause dur="0.4"/> in the Warsaw Pact <pause dur="0.3"/> 
and the Warsaw Pact was invited to send <pause dur="0.5"/> some observers to NATO exercises <pause dur="0.4"/> only selected ones but <pause dur="0.4"/> at least a beginning <pause dur="2.4"/> now where do we go from here <pause dur="4.4"/> arms control has become a lot more complicated in the contemporary environment because we don't have the blocks any more <pause dur="1.3"/> well i can over overrun <shift feature="voice" new="laugh"/> another five minutes but i don't think that would be a very good idea <shift feature="voice" new="normal"/><pause dur="1.3"/> # <pause dur="3.4"/> the possibly most promising way of approaching arms control issues is really in a multilevel <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> set up <pause dur="1.4"/> that we don't only rely on international <pause dur="0.3"/> arms control measures but also <pause dur="0.4"/> on regional or try to simulate regional arms control <pause dur="0.4"/> and bilateral understanding <pause dur="0.4"/> between <pause dur="0.5"/> states that are at risk of <pause dur="0.8"/> accelerating arms races or <pause dur="0.2"/> running <pause dur="0.8"/> up <pause dur="0.7"/> or <pause dur="0.6"/> well <pause dur="1.2"/> engaging in an arms race in the first place <pause dur="1.8"/> one of the <pause dur="0.2"/> principal advantages of doing that <pause dur="0.3"/> would be that <pause dur="0.2"/> neighbours <pause dur="0.2"/> who need to talk to one another
