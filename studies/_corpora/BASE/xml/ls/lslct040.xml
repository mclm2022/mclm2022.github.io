 this week i'm i'm going to <pause dur="0.4"/> just basically one lecture which comes on from from last week's <pause dur="0.7"/> session <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> last week we looked at climatic change <pause dur="0.3"/> sort of <pause dur="0.7"/> observation measurements <pause dur="0.3"/> today i want to sort of <pause dur="0.6"/> link in <pause dur="0.7"/> with that the implications for crops vegetation and land use <pause dur="0.4"/> and it will hopefully tie together some of the bits of the course that we've been <pause dur="0.3"/> doing with this this term <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> so that will be one lecture <pause dur="0.4"/> and then <pause dur="0.5"/> there'll be a pause <pause dur="0.3"/> and i'll tell you about the exam questions <pause dur="0.2"/> # and i'm happy to deal with any questions over over the course as a whole <pause dur="0.3"/> does 
 that sound okay <pause dur="2.4"/> okay so <pause dur="1.0"/> there's the title climate change implications of crops vegetation and land use <pause dur="1.1"/> # <pause dur="3.2"/> diagram about climatic change in general <pause dur="0.6"/> # and we've done part of this over the last few weeks <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="1.4"/> that basically <pause dur="0.2"/> we talked first of all about emissions and concentrations of greenhouse gases and and how <pause dur="0.8"/> man's activities on the earth's surface <pause dur="0.5"/> and agricultural activities land use changes et cetera were affecting that <pause dur="0.8"/> # then last week we talked <pause dur="0.5"/> a bit about <pause dur="0.2"/> the effects on climatic change <pause dur="0.3"/> the observed changes in temperature <pause dur="0.2"/> sea level rise et cetera <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="1.7"/> so today i'm going a little bit across to look at the effects of impacts on on <pause dur="0.4"/> human natural systems <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> we can actually have a whole module on that <pause dur="1.2"/> no doubt at all very important topic <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> but i've basically <pause dur="0.2"/> restricted myself really to # bits about food and agriculture and and crops <pause dur="1.0"/> # 
 <pause dur="0.7"/> obviously there is a circle here <kinesic desc="indicates board on wall" iterated="n"/> <pause dur="0.3"/> and we're not going to <pause dur="0.3"/> really get into how we adapt and <pause dur="0.2"/> affect and feedback into climate i'm going to <kinesic desc="indicates board on wall" iterated="n"/> concentrate on the effects <pause dur="0.4"/> of climatic change on on those <pause dur="0.3"/> uses <pause dur="0.5"/> just to summarise a bit these are the slides we had last week # <pause dur="1.0"/> # <pause dur="1.3"/> the I-P-C-C <pause dur="0.2"/> interdepartmental panel sort of prediction for climate change <pause dur="0.5"/> # for the next hundred years <pause dur="0.3"/> and <pause dur="0.8"/> # the thing that we're sure <pause dur="0.2"/> about are that C-O-two <trunc> concentra </trunc> concentrations are going to rise <pause dur="0.3"/> # over the next hundred years <pause dur="0.6"/> and <pause dur="0.7"/> certainly from <pause dur="0.8"/> where we are at the moment about three-sixty-five parts per million <pause dur="0.4"/> to a minimum of about five-hundred <pause dur="0.2"/> and possibly up to 
 eight-hundred <kinesic desc="indicates board on wall" iterated="n"/> pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="1.1"/> so that's <pause dur="0.3"/> going to be something that's going to affect plants and vegetation <pause dur="0.5"/> completely so <pause dur="0.2"/> C-O-two change is the one thing to think about <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.9"/> and then there's going to be changes in temperature <pause dur="0.2"/> again with great uncertainties <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> up to three or four degrees depending upon <trunc> gra </trunc> # green house gas emissions <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> and <kinesic desc="indicates board on wall" iterated="n"/> a corresponding increase in sea level rise <pause dur="0.6"/> but <pause dur="0.2"/> really <pause dur="0.2"/> for the point of view of <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> vegetation we <unclear> got to </unclear> concentrate on <pause dur="0.6"/> C-O-two <pause dur="0.2"/> temperature <pause dur="0.2"/> and <pause dur="0.5"/> the consequent effects upon rain fall and water 
 balance <pause dur="1.3"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> again this is just a recap from last week <pause dur="0.3"/> just to emphasise the changes that <pause dur="0.6"/> are likely to happen in the next hundred years or so <pause dur="0.5"/> and we are talking <pause dur="0.3"/> typically around three or four degrees increase in mean temperature in in our latitudes <pause dur="0.7"/> with the position about rainfall <pause dur="0.5"/> very much less clear <pause dur="2.2"/> okay so <pause dur="0.5"/> think now back to <trunc> photosynth </trunc> # to carbon dioxide and photosynthesis <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="1.0"/> and <pause dur="0.4"/> obviously <pause dur="0.5"/> as as i'm sure most of you're aware <pause dur="1.7"/> # <trunc> s </trunc> <pause dur="0.5"/> photosynthesis can be restricted by carbon dioxide <pause dur="0.6"/> and if you take <pause dur="0.6"/> most <pause dur="0.3"/> crop plants like wheat <kinesic desc="indicates board on wall" iterated="n"/> pause dur="0.5"/> which have sort of C-three <pause dur="0.7"/> # metabolism for <pause dur="0.2"/> fixing carbon in in photosynthesis <pause dur="0.5"/> then <pause dur="0.7"/> there's a relationship <pause dur="0.4"/> between the rate of carbon dioxide fixation photosynthesis 
 <pause dur="0.2"/> and <pause dur="0.4"/> the C-O-two level <pause dur="0.2"/> but this is inside the leaf <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> <kinesic desc="indicates board on wall" iterated="n"/> and basically as the C-O-two level inside the leaf increases <pause dur="0.3"/> photosynthesis increases <kinesic desc="indicates board on wall" iterated="n"/> <pause dur="0.6"/> # the C-O-two level inside the leaf also links <pause dur="0.4"/> with the C-O-two level outside <pause dur="0.3"/> so basically <pause dur="1.0"/> for C-three plants which are most of the crop plants of the world <pause dur="0.4"/> an increase in <pause dur="0.2"/> carbon dioxide <pause dur="0.6"/> in the atmosphere is going to give an increase rate of photosynthesis <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> that's not actually true for C-four <kinesic desc="indicates board on wall" iterated="n"/> plants <pause dur="0.4"/> # which are mainly that as you know <pause dur="0.3"/> tropical grasses sorghum maize <pause dur="0.3"/> millet et cetera being the main crops <pause dur="0.5"/> # 
 <pause dur="0.3"/> they have a sort of slightly strange <pause dur="0.5"/> or different i should say photosynthetic mechanism <pause dur="0.2"/> where they <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="1.2"/> effectively <pause dur="0.2"/> accumulate <pause dur="0.6"/> # carbon dioxide close to the sight of of photosynthesis <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> and the external <pause dur="0.9"/> concentration really doesn't make <pause dur="0.2"/> very much difference <pause dur="1.8"/> so <pause dur="1.5"/> increasing carbon dioxide in the atmosphere will increase photosynthesis by C-three plants but not by <pause dur="0.3"/> by C-four plants <pause dur="0.9"/> <vocal desc="cough" iterated="n" n="ss" dur="1"/> <pause dur="1.9"/> in theory anyway so individual leaves <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> if we're talking about <pause dur="1.6"/> # almost a doubling of C-O-two concentration <pause dur="0.2"/> by the end of the century <pause dur="0.5"/> that will give something like a fifty per cent <pause dur="0.3"/> increase in the rate of photosynthesis of individual of individual leaves <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> there there might be a small effect on C-four species i mean the the <pause dur="0.7"/> the evidence is a bit divided <pause dur="0.3"/> some people say there's no effect some people might be small effect <pause dur="0.4"/> but it's certainly going to be less than ten per cent <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> so that seams good that <pause dur="0.6"/> that's a positive effect of climatic change in a way that that <pause dur="0.5"/> 
 going to have increase rates of photosynthesis <pause dur="0.7"/> which <pause dur="0.4"/> again is a way of increasing the storage of carbon on the land's surface if we if we keep <unclear> as both </unclear> <pause dur="0.9"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> but it's not quite as straight forward as as that <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="1.3"/> one thing that <pause dur="0.4"/> generally will happen <pause dur="0.4"/> is that <kinesic desc="indicates board on wall" iterated="n"/> <pause dur="0.6"/> most evidence seems to be that <kinesic desc="indicates board on wall" iterated="n"/> there's going to be an increase in stomatal resistance <pause dur="1.2"/> if C-O-two concentration increases plants tend to close their stomata a little bit <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> they don't need to have them so wide open for photosynthesis <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.9"/> now that's <pause dur="0.9"/> that's good in some ways because it'll <kinesic desc="indicates board on wall" iterated="n"/> probably reduce transpiration <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> reduce the rate of water loss <pause dur="0.4"/> so we'll get more dry matter produced per unit of water used <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> it's been called water use efficiency <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> we've mentioned before the the ration of of dry matter to to water use
 <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="1.5"/> so that's sort of positive <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> but the stomata resistance may feed back and sort of cut down on this fifty per cent <pause dur="0.6"/> increase so you may get less less increase than that <pause dur="1.3"/> # <pause dur="1.2"/> but think back earlier on in the course we looked at the energy balance of leaves <pause dur="0.7"/> and <pause dur="0.7"/> and of crops <pause dur="0.4"/> and the energy got to go somewhere and if you reduce the transpiration <pause dur="0.5"/> then you're probably going to have an increase in in leaf temperature <pause dur="0.2"/> and # <pause dur="0.2"/> that may feed back into local air temperatures <pause dur="0.5"/> but <pause dur="1.0"/> when <kinesic desc="indicates board on wall" iterated="n"/> the warmer leaf temperature have <pause dur="1.2"/> a positive or negative effect on the leaf <pause dur="0.2"/> photosynthesis again is not really clear <pause dur="0.3"/> # it may be that there may be a negative effect of of warmer temperatures <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> so <pause dur="1.0"/> basically <pause dur="0.5"/> positive in C-three species but not necessarily that that clear <kinesic desc="changes powerpoint slide" iterated="n"/> <pause dur="2.8"/> now when you come <trunc> t </trunc> <pause dur="0.5"/> 
 that really i'm talking about individual leaf you know an individual leaf exposed to different levels of carbon dioxide <pause dur="0.7"/> but <pause dur="0.8"/>when you come to a crop the effects are likely to be less than for a crop the individual leaf <pause dur="0.5"/> because not all the leaves as we talked before we looked at light not all the leaves are <pause dur="0.8"/> receiving the same level of light <pause dur="0.5"/> the old leaves at the bottom probably won't respond to <pause dur="0.9"/> to C-O-two et cetera <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> so <pause dur="0.3"/> most values show the <pause dur="0.5"/> effects are less <pause dur="0.7"/> for a crop than for an individual leaf <pause dur="4.3"/> but also leaves may actually sort of acclimatize <pause dur="0.5"/> to the changing in C-O-two level <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> those results i put up before are really sort of <unclear> in </unclear> experiments i think we're probably using measure photosynthesis <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="0.9"/> and it may be <pause dur="0.4"/> that plants adapt to the to the rates to the levels of C-O-two and reduce their rates over time <pause dur="1.0"/> there's a sort of <pause dur="0.2"/> <trunc> s </trunc>
 <pause dur="0.4"/> phrase that's used here about down-regulating that plants control their rate of metabolism <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="0.9"/> so <pause dur="0.3"/> there's been a lot of interest recently in actually looking at long term studies <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> of the effects of C-O-two <pause dur="0.5"/> changes <pause dur="0.7"/> if you expose plants to different levels of C-O-two for a long time <pause dur="0.2"/> do they change their photosynthesis <pause dur="1.0"/> # <pause dur="1.0"/> and of course plant growth is not just <pause dur="2.0"/> determined by carbon dioxide <pause dur="0.2"/> you've got other interactions particularly with water nutrients and temperature <pause dur="0.4"/> so <pause dur="0.3"/> what i'm going to do now is tell you bit about some longer term studies that've been going on looking at looking at these things <pause dur="1.0"/> # <pause dur="1.2"/> i don't know have you ever come across the term FACE at all anybody not in in this context <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> well it stand for free air C-O-two enrichment <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="1.2"/> basically <pause dur="1.2"/> if you think about <pause dur="0.3"/> what how do you experiments about C-O-two <pause dur="0.3"/> you could 
 <pause dur="0.9"/> do experiments in the glass house # you could increase the C-O-two level in the glass house and look at the response <pause dur="1.0"/> as is done in <pause dur="0.2"/> commercial tomato production for <trunc> ex </trunc> example <pause dur="0.5"/> getting increased growth rates <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> but what what we really don't know is what's gong to happen to plants <pause dur="0.6"/> in the atmosphere outside <pause dur="0.6"/> so the idea of of these sort of experiments which are <pause dur="0.3"/> quite complicated <unclear> only done </unclear> in a few places in the world <pause dur="0.4"/> is <kinesic desc="indicates board on wall" iterated="n"/> <pause dur="0.8"/> to actually have <pause dur="0.4"/> experiments outside <pause dur="0.3"/> where <pause dur="1.0"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> C-O-two enriched air is released over vegetation and continuously released <pause dur="0.2"/> so you've got plants or trees and things growing <pause dur="0.6"/> in <pause dur="0.8"/> increased C-O-two levels outside in real conditions <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="1.1"/> so there's a lot of sort of engineering going on to control the carbon dioxide <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> levels <pause dur="1.0"/> # and provide a stable elevated level of carbon dioxide <pause dur="1.8"/> and <pause dur="0.4"/> 
 basically there should be no barrier to natural air flow so the wind et cetera can have its normal effect so the <unclear> issue </unclear> is not not affecting not affected <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="1.0"/> and <pause dur="1.6"/> basically <pause dur="0.3"/> these facilities have been built up mainly in in the states though there's been some work in the U-K <pause dur="0.3"/> # on a on a slightly smaller scale <pause dur="0.4"/> # but these ones are going to be <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.8"/> ones i'm going to show you in America <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="1.4"/> this is basically saying if we can't use full scale changes we need to use <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> bigger systems to look at <pause dur="0.2"/> but don't <kinesic desc="indicates board on wall" iterated="n"/> change the micro climate <pause dur="0.5"/> very much <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.8"/> so <pause dur="0.3"/> lets have a look this is this is a <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="1.0"/> called a FACE facility <pause dur="0.4"/> in <pause dur="0.5"/> # North Carolina <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> and these are <pause dur="0.4"/> the the facilities and these are circles about thirty metres <pause dur="0.6"/> 
 wide <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> and these are just vertical pipes around here which <pause dur="0.2"/> let C-O-two in <pause dur="0.6"/> across the vegetation inside there <pause dur="0.6"/> # now obviously you've got to have different treatments and things so it all gets a bit complicated <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> building up <pause dur="0.4"/> # those sort of facilities <pause dur="0.3"/> # so they're quite a major investment <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> but these have been going <pause dur="0.7"/> in the states for <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> since the sort of <trunc> mid-nineteen-sev </trunc> # mid-nineteen-nineties <pause dur="0.3"/> and built up some some useful results <pause dur="1.1"/> # <pause dur="2.4"/> so <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> <trunc> th </trunc> these are some results <trunc> fr </trunc> from that particular one looking at # <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="1.0"/> it's pine forest <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> in in U-S-A <pause dur="0.5"/> and <pause dur="1.1"/> you've got a control plot <pause dur="0.5"/> where <pause dur="0.3"/> the <pause dur="0.2"/> normal <pause dur="0.4"/> ambient C-O-two level <pause dur="0.2"/> three-sixty-five parts per million roughly <pause dur="0.5"/> 
 # <pause dur="0.2"/> and they <pause dur="0.3"/> increased that by two-hundred so the <pause dur="0.2"/> the treatment there is is two-hundred parts per million <pause dur="1.0"/> i'm sorry two-hundred parts per million extra <pause dur="0.3"/> five-sixty five-sixty-five parts per million <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> so that's <pause dur="0.3"/> experiment <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.8"/> is still running but they've only actually got the results up until two-thousand sort of published so far <pause dur="0.4"/> and <pause dur="1.0"/> do you remember back in <pause dur="0.2"/> one of the earlier works we talked about net primary production N-P-P <pause dur="0.8"/> how much production as a forest or something will produce <pause dur="0.6"/> over a year <pause dur="0.6"/> so <pause dur="0.2"/> this is what these figures are grammes per metre squared per year <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> and <pause dur="0.5"/> basically there's variation from year to year # <pause dur="0.3"/> natural other factors water rainfall <pause dur="0.7"/> solar radiation temperature et cetera <pause dur="0.5"/> but as you can see <pause dur="0.2"/> in each year 
 so far <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="2.1"/> the the trees receiving the higher level of C-O-two have produced <pause dur="0.2"/> more more <pause dur="0.4"/> biomass <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> somewhere between twenty and thirty per cent <pause dur="1.1"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> more increase <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> and then this supports the fact that <pause dur="0.8"/> over time <pause dur="0.5"/> as the C-O-two concentration in the atmosphere has gone up historically <pause dur="0.3"/> then <pause dur="0.9"/> certainly suggests that this <pause dur="0.5"/> this type of forest will have been accumulating <pause dur="0.4"/> biomass at a at a bigger rate <pause dur="0.5"/> we talked about <pause dur="0.3"/> over the last <pause dur="0.7"/> twenty years how we think that the net the earth's surface the the vegetation of the earth's surface has been a net 
 <pause dur="0.8"/> sink for C-O-two taking up C-O-two so this is part of the story <kinesic desc="indicates board on wall" iterated="n"/> <pause dur="1.2"/> plants responding to to C-O-two concentration <pause dur="1.8"/> does that seem okay at the moment is that <pause dur="1.7"/> # <pause dur="0.9"/> okay we'll go a bit further on those results then <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="2.0"/> so <pause dur="0.3"/> you <pause dur="0.3"/> so far there's been an increase in dry matter in a fraction over four years <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> but the sort of papers and that suggest that <pause dur="1.6"/> this may well <trunc> c </trunc> carry on <pause dur="0.4"/> but <pause dur="0.4"/> may not be sustained if nitrogen <pause dur="0.5"/> becomes limited obviously <pause dur="0.5"/> nitrogen is involved in in growth processes <pause dur="0.5"/> and <pause dur="1.1"/> can't necessarily <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="1.5"/> sustain increased rates of C-O-two if <pause dur="0.6"/> you don't add any more nitrogen <pause dur="0.4"/> # either naturally or not now there's again <pause dur="0.2"/> concern in <pause dur="0.4"/> that we're increasing the global nitrogen cycle <pause dur="0.2"/> so maybe <pause dur="0.2"/> that's happening anyway <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="1.0"/> and there's need for measurements of nitrogen then but at the moment it does seem to be sustained and carried on <pause dur="0.7"/> # 
 <pause dur="1.1"/> so there's <pause dur="0.5"/> # no evidence here of of acclimatization of of plants down regulating the photosynthesis <pause dur="1.0"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> there's also <pause dur="0.5"/> over those four years no matter no difference in dry matter partitioning <pause dur="1.1"/> the increased dry matter's going to leaves <pause dur="0.3"/> roots <pause dur="1.0"/> trunks et cetera in the same proportions as it was before <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="1.5"/> so you're just getting bigger trees but they're in the same proportions <pause dur="0.9"/> # <pause dur="1.7"/> there's also <kinesic desc="indicates board on wall" iterated="n"/> <trunc> s </trunc> no difference in stomatal resistance or or water use they've also measured those <pause dur="0.2"/> things there <pause dur="0.3"/> so basically these trees are producing more dry matter <pause dur="0.5"/> # for the same amount of water so they've got a greater water use efficiency <pause dur="0.9"/> # <pause dur="1.2"/> so <pause dur="0.2"/> this seems a fairly straightforward <pause dur="0.3"/> response it's <pause dur="0.7"/> it's behaving almost in expects <pause dur="0.2"/> as you'd expect it to <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> for simple rates of photosynthesis <pause dur="4.0"/> # <pause dur="4.2"/> <trunc> a </trunc> again in these experiments they measure all sorts of things <pause dur="0.4"/> and <pause dur="1.0"/> if you remember back # in about week five <pause dur="0.3"/> we # said that one way of analysing
 crop growth <pause dur="0.7"/> was to think about <pause dur="0.2"/> <kinesic desc="indicates board on wall using a stick" iterated="n"/> the dry matter produced grammes per meter squared <pause dur="0.8"/> in this case per year <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> as being made up of two things the absorbed <pause dur="1.0"/> radiation the the <pause dur="0.6"/> crop <pause dur="0.2"/> or the trees in this case captured in the sun <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> and <pause dur="0.7"/> the # <pause dur="1.1"/> thing called the radiation <unclear> sufficiency </unclear> <pause dur="0.2"/> which <pause dur="0.2"/> was basically <pause dur="0.2"/> how you turn the absorbed radiation in in into into dry matter <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> how many grammes of dry matter you get per mega joule of radiation absorbed <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="1.1"/> what these <trunc> a </trunc> are <pause dur="0.2"/> data from <pause dur="0.8"/> from <trunc> th </trunc> <pause dur="0.5"/> those trees <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="1.8"/> and <pause dur="0.5"/> essentially this bottom one is # three-sixty-five parts per million the normal <pause dur="0.2"/> <trunc> environm </trunc> the normal environment <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> <kinesic desc="indicates board on wall using a stick" iterated="n"/> and the five-sixty-five one here <pause dur="0.3"/> and you can see that <pause dur="0.3"/> over time there's really been no difference in the amount of radiation intercepted <pause dur="0.2"/> that's still <pause dur="1.1"/> still constant <pause dur="0.6"/> # 
 <pause dur="1.0"/> they're trees that've got a reasonable leaf area they they've got a leave area <unclear> in </unclear> about three to four <pause dur="0.2"/> so they're capturing a reasonable amount of light <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> and there's no difference here <kinesic desc="indicates board on wall using a stick" iterated="n"/> the difference is in <pause dur="0.2"/> the radiation sufficiency <kinesic desc="indicates board on wall using a stick" iterated="n"/> <pause dur="0.5"/> # which is what you'd expect really that's the <pause dur="1.8"/> that's the photosynthetic processes the conversion of <trunc> radi </trunc> # radiant energy into dry matter <pause dur="0.4"/> # that's been increased by by photosynthesis <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> so that's one example of of how the radiation <unclear> we used to understand the experiment </unclear> <pause dur="2.2"/> is that <pause dur="0.4"/> okay so far <pause dur="2.7"/> okay # so that's <pause dur="0.8"/> one bit <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="1.3"/> another <pause dur="1.0"/> FACE facility is in the University of Arizona <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> where they did experiments on wheat <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> so again <pause dur="0.5"/> these circles <kinesic desc="indicates board on wall using a stick" iterated="n"/> with C-O-two enrichment <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> coming in <kinesic desc="indicates board on wall" iterated="n"/> across the <pause dur="0.6"/> the individual plots in there <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> again a reasonable distance between the plots <pause dur="0.2"/> so avoids cross contamination and things like that <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="1.5"/> what do they <pause dur="0.4"/> show for wheat <pause dur="0.7"/> well <pause dur="0.7"/> that's a bit 
 more complicated really <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="1.0"/> they had # used a fifty per cent increase in carbon dioxide <pause dur="0.4"/> so you have <pause dur="0.5"/> plants at normal # <pause dur="0.6"/> atmospheric carbon dioxide and ones with fifty per cent increase <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="1.1"/> and <pause dur="0.4"/> there was a strong interaction between <pause dur="0.3"/> carbon dioxide and water use <pause dur="1.0"/> # <pause dur="2.2"/> the water use was reduced <pause dur="0.4"/> by about six per cent <pause dur="2.0"/> from well watered crops so there was there was some <pause dur="0.7"/> reduction in in stomatal resistance <pause dur="0.7"/> # stomatal stomata were probably closing a little bit <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="1.5"/> but <pause dur="1.5"/> in terms of the photosynthesis <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="1.0"/> when you had crops <pause dur="0.5"/> with <pause dur="0.3"/> adequate water <pause dur="0.7"/> well watered crops <pause dur="0.2"/> you got something like about a nineteen per cent increase <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> in in in photosynthesis <pause dur="0.5"/> for for the canopy <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> now you might expect on an individual leaf something like thirty per cent <pause dur="0.4"/> but it <pause dur="0.2"/> as i said earlier it's probably less for an individual <pause dur="0.4"/> for a for a whole crop <pause dur="0.6"/> so <pause dur="2.1"/> wheat # C-three species getting an increase in in canopy photosynthesis <pause dur="0.6"/> <kinesic desc="indicates board on wall" iterated="n"/> from C-O-two <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> but actually doing better 
 <kinesic desc="indicates board on wall" iterated="n"/> <pause dur="0.9"/> when you've got water deficiency <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.9"/> that <pause dur="1.4"/> when the crop is short of water the # the <pause dur="1.0"/> increase in C-O-two <unclear> is able to </unclear> compensate for that <pause dur="0.3"/> and and <pause dur="0.2"/> boost up rates of photosynthesis <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> so <pause dur="0.2"/> you've got a much greater increase <trunc> un </trunc> under water stress <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="1.4"/> so <pause dur="1.0"/> thus suggests that plants may <pause dur="0.4"/> the combination of <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> high C-O-two <trunc> an </trunc> and <pause dur="0.2"/> reduced water <pause dur="0.2"/> might be <pause dur="0.6"/> there might be some compensation there but it certainly in in wheat <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="1.2"/> but obviously when you come on to future predictions of what's happening to crops <pause dur="0.7"/> what's going to happen about # <pause dur="0.6"/> water <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> around the world is is very important <pause dur="4.0"/> # <pause dur="1.4"/> okay so that's looked at C-O-two <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> and some interactions with water <pause dur="0.5"/> but <pause dur="1.5"/> in the <pause dur="0.2"/> in what we think's going to be the world in the next next century <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> any increases in carbon dioxide are going to be <pause dur="0.4"/> accompanied by increases in 
 temperature <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> generally on average <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="1.1"/> you know we talked about mean temperatures increase increasing but in general there's going to be increase in temperature <pause dur="0.4"/> so <pause dur="0.4"/> we need to think about that those interactions <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="1.1"/> and <pause dur="0.8"/> we remember we struggled a bit with thermal time earlier on this product of temperature and time <pause dur="0.5"/> which really controls the development of crops <pause dur="1.0"/> so <pause dur="0.4"/> warmer temperatures mean quicker development <pause dur="0.9"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> so <pause dur="0.6"/> present day varieties will <pause dur="0.2"/> mature quicker <pause dur="0.6"/> and have less time for photosynthesis <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> do you remember we did the thing about maize and altitude in in one one of the <pause dur="0.4"/> lectures there <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.8"/> so <pause dur="0.4"/> what's going to happen <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="1.9"/> # <pause dur="0.8"/> when <pause dur="0.8"/> when temperatures increase <pause dur="0.4"/> # in combination with C-O-two levels <pause dur="0.6"/> well there've only been experiments <pause dur="1.2"/> on wheat <pause dur="0.4"/> there were some done here actually in <gap reason ="name" extent="1 word"/> <pause dur="0.2"/> and at Rothamsted experimental station <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="1.1"/> the ones here they they grew plants in plastic tunnels <pause dur="0.5"/> with big heaters at one end <pause dur="0.3"/> # increased the C-O-two level and got a grade of temperature went down the tunnel so you could look at the effects of temperature and C-O-two concentration <pause dur="0.5"/> and basically <pause dur="0.7"/> in terms of <pause dur="0.8"/> yield and things <pause dur="0.9"/> increases due to carbon dioxide <pause dur="0.3"/> were cancelled out <pause dur="0.4"/> or <pause dur="0.2"/> doubling of carbon dioxide <pause dur="0.5"/> <kinesic desc="indicates board on wall" iterated="n"/> was cancelled out by about a two degree temperature increase <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> because # <pause dur="0.4"/> the temperature increase meant the the plant growth was ever quicker <pause dur="1.2"/> # <pause dur="1.4"/> and this was sort of illustrated by <pause dur="1.0"/> sort of crop modelling if you like <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> i mean crop models are basically trying to <pause dur="0.2"/> people trying to predict how crops grow <pause dur="0.4"/> and they're based on things like thermal time and radiation efficiency <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> and <pause dur="1.5"/> these are some of the results
 they expect for a wheat crop <pause dur="0.3"/> this <kinesic desc="indicates board on wall using a stick" iterated="n"/> <pause dur="0.2"/> crop labelled nineteen-eighty-one refers to <pause dur="0.5"/> typical conditions <trunc> a </trunc> <pause dur="0.5"/> in in the nineteen-eighties <pause dur="0.5"/> so that <kinesic desc="indicates board on wall using a stick" iterated="n"/> might be total dry matter <pause dur="0.3"/> of a wheat crop <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> over time giving you something like <pause dur="0.8"/> # <kinesic desc="indicates board on wall using a stick" iterated="n"/> twenty tons per hectare so it's a pretty good crop <pause dur="1.6"/> then bringing those sort of results we've got in <pause dur="0.4"/> if you double carbon dioxide <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> you get a higher rate of photosynthesis and get more dry matter <pause dur="1.0"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> so that's a doubling of carbon dioxide <kinesic desc="indicates board on wall using a stick" iterated="n"/> <pause dur="2.1"/> but <pause dur="0.2"/> you also <kinesic desc="indicates board on wall using a stick" iterated="n"/> accelerate if you if you then <kinesic desc="indicates board on wall using a stick" iterated="n"/> have a three degree increase in temperature <pause dur="0.8"/> # you accelerate 
 development so you get the dry matter <pause dur="0.7"/> # and you get it quicker that that all seems fine you getting more dry weight and <trunc> an </trunc> in a quicker <pause dur="0.8"/> in a quicker time <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> but that then leaves little time <pause dur="1.0"/> for the grain <pause dur="0.6"/> to fill <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> in terms of grain weight <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="1.5"/> basically what you tend to happen is you accelerate the grain filling process <pause dur="0.6"/> and you don't get a lot enough time to fill grain so <pause dur="0.3"/> in terms of grain yield you get relatively difference <pause dur="0.8"/> between the conditions here and the conditions there <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> so this rapid development <pause dur="0.4"/> of of of cereal crops <pause dur="0.3"/> # sort of cancels out <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> the # <pause dur="1.2"/> the effect of <trunc> s </trunc> carbon dioxide <pause dur="0.2"/> and you don't get much effect upon upon yield <pause dur="0.8"/> does that seem to make any sense to people or not <pause dur="4.9"/> maybe <pause dur="0.5"/> ok <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="4.0"/> what what about other crops <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="1.0"/> well <pause dur="0.2"/> things like # <pause dur="0.6"/> vegetative crops <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.8"/> things like sugar beet and potatoes where you're not actually growing them for seed for grain <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> they're not so <pause dur="0.2"/> restricted by developments they will <pause dur="2.2"/> have yield formation over a longer period <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> continue growth along that <pause dur="0.2"/> 
 so <pause dur="0.8"/> basically the effects of carbon dioxide doubling there tend to be <pause dur="0.5"/> greater than the effects of negative effects of temperature <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> so provided you've got water you tend to <pause dur="0.3"/> evidence seems to be that you'll get an increasing yield <pause dur="0.9"/> on on those sort of crops <pause dur="7.5"/> okay so <pause dur="2.1"/> we're starting to get together a picture of how carbon dioxide <pause dur="0.6"/> and <pause dur="0.3"/> temperature <pause dur="0.5"/> # <trunc> inter </trunc> influence <pause dur="0.3"/> yields of crops <pause dur="1.0"/> one thing that's going to <pause dur="0.4"/> obviously differ <pause dur="0.3"/> in in climatic change is <pause dur="0.3"/> distribution of crops <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.9"/> it's slightly <gap reason="inaudible due to noise from audience" extent ="0.4 sec"/> illustrates the point quite quite nicely <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> this is maize in the U-K <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="1.0"/> now we don't really grow <pause dur="0.2"/> maize for grain <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> like they do in France <pause dur="0.7"/> grain for feeding of animals where you actually <pause dur="0.3"/> harvest the mature grain <pause dur="0.7"/> # because basically the season's really too too short <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="2.4"/> well we grow the maize for silage where we harvest the whole the whole crop <pause dur="0.4"/> and obviously we grow things for sweetcorn but sweetcorn's not mature grain it's an in between <pause dur="0.4"/> and <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="1.3"/> <vocal desc="cough" iterated="y" n="ss" dur="1"/> around the <pause dur="0.2"/> the end of <pause dur="0.4"/> well eighteen nineteen-eighty-seven nineteen-ninety <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> in terms of temperature <pause dur="0.7"/> the limit for grain maize is pretty well the south coast it can be grown in in <trunc> Fr </trunc> in <pause dur="0.3"/> northern France but not so much in the U-K 
 <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.9"/> an increase of <pause dur="0.2"/> half a degree in mean temperature <pause dur="0.5"/> would put the limit up to here <kinesic desc="indicates board on wall" iterated="n"/> <pause dur="0.2"/> one-and-a-half here <kinesic desc="indicates board on wall" iterated="n"/> and three degrees would take it up in into Scotland <pause dur="0.6"/> because temperature's the limiting factor <pause dur="0.6"/> based upon this thermal time <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> silage maize <pause dur="0.8"/> <kinesic desc="indicates board on wall using a stick" iterated="n"/> limit there <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="2.3"/> could could move quite appreciably <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="2.0"/> the other point about here <kinesic desc="indicates board on wall using a stick" iterated="n"/> is <pause dur="0.3"/> on here <kinesic desc="indicates board on wall using a stick" iterated="n"/> are some particularly <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="1.3"/> nineteen-seventy-six was a particularly hot year <pause dur="0.4"/> and <pause dur="0.3"/> before we got into <pause dur="1.0"/> the late nineteen-nineties and the warmest years of the millennium <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> and in that year the limit stop up here already <pause dur="0.3"/> a cold year <kinesic desc="indicates board on wall using a stick" iterated="n"/> nineteen-sixty-two it was down here <pause dur="0.4"/> so <pause dur="2.3"/> we've already experienced individual years some of the fluctuations of the same sort of size <pause dur="0.5"/> # as things that we're we're getting <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> but <pause dur="0.3"/> basically <kinesic desc="indicates board on wall using a stick" iterated="n"/> <pause dur="3.0"/> even a sort of one or two degree <pause dur="0.8"/> limit a change in temperature <pause dur="0.3"/> will vastly increase the range in which various crops can be grown going to be a lot of changes <pause dur="0.3"/> in in in crop composition <pause dur="0.7"/> and and and <unclear> into </unclear> grow in different places <pause dur="3.3"/> # <pause dur="2.7"/> what sort of yields could you get for for maize and i've put this in to illustrate one particular point <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> that <pause dur="0.7"/> these are estimated yields of forage maize <pause dur="0.5"/> in the U-K <pause dur="0.6"/> # 
 <pause dur="0.5"/> and basically <kinesic desc="indicates board on wall using a stick" iterated="n"/> <pause dur="0.3"/> the darker areas are the <pause dur="1.1"/> highest yielding areas at the moment <pause dur="0.9"/> # you can't get any yield of maize <pause dur="0.6"/> and <pause dur="0.3"/> this study looked at <pause dur="0.7"/> what would you what would happen to maize yields <pause dur="0.2"/> if <pause dur="0.3"/> i'm sorry it's off the top of the screen here but <pause dur="0.2"/> it's increase temperature by two degrees <pause dur="0.6"/> and rainfall by <pause dur="0.2"/> ten per cent <pause dur="1.0"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> very simple <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="1.0"/> adjustment in in <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> in climate <pause dur="0.3"/> <unclear> do you see </unclear> that the mean temperature's gone up by two degrees and rainfall's increased by ten per cent <pause dur="0.2"/> there's no effect of carbon dioxide in here <pause dur="0.4"/> and <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="1.4"/> the yields <kinesic desc="indicates board on wall using a stick" iterated="n"/> basically increase <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> and particularly increase <pause dur="0.8"/> <kinesic desc="indicates board on wall using a stick" iterated="n"/> in in the midlands and the west of of the country <pause dur="2.5"/> but <pause dur="0.4"/> if you increase

 there's # a general <pause dur="0.4"/> general increase trend this is <kinesic desc="indicates board on wall using a stick" iterated="n"/> like a smooth curve <pause dur="1.9"/> going through here and the colour's just to highlight the areas above and below <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> this is the nineteen <pause dur="0.3"/> # sixty-one to ninety average <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> so <pause dur="0.3"/> over the last few years the number of hot days has increased <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> and <pause dur="0.8"/> these are the number of of cold days <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="1.9"/> # <pause dur="4.2"/> linked in to frost occurrence we saw this before but certainly that occurrence is is is much less <pause dur="0.3"/> in the last part of this century than than back in the previous centuries <pause dur="0.6"/> and and those are <pause dur="0.2"/> things that are relevant to to to garden plants <pause dur="2.0"/> the length of the growing season <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.9"/> we talked back in earlier times about <pause dur="0.6"/> thermal time <pause dur="0.6"/> and <pause dur="0.4"/> roughly <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="2.5"/> growing season is is roughly defined for time when temperature <pause dur="0.4"/> is above <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> is is greater than five degrees <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="1"/> five degrees <pause dur="0.8"/> five degrees centigrade roughly speaking <pause dur="0.5"/> so this is the number of days in in a year in central England <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> that the the growing season has been <pause dur="0.7"/> # the temperatures have been above five degrees <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> the average in sixty-one to ninety <pause dur="0.5"/> is two-hundred-and-forty-two days <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> for central parts of England <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> and you can see <pause dur="1.4"/> that <pause dur="0.3"/> how <pause dur="1.1"/> the sixty-one to ninety average <pause dur="0.3"/> year <pause dur="0.4"/> # is higher <pause dur="0.2"/> than <pause dur="0.6"/> the last <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> a-hundred-and-fifty years <pause dur="0.4"/> and how <pause dur="1.4"/> <kinesic desc="indicates board on wall using a stick" iterated="n"/> apart from a little dip <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="1.4"/> in <pause dur="0.8"/> in the sort of seventies

 <pause dur="0.2"/> decade <pause dur="0.2"/> so <pause dur="1.3"/> there's no doubt that growing seasons and times of things are are changing <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="2.2"/> and and # as temperatures increase <pause dur="2.4"/> # <pause dur="2.5"/> i haven't got <pause dur="0.2"/> time today at all to look at <pause dur="1.0"/> natural vegetation in any great detail at all <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> but obviously <pause dur="0.8"/> many species are temperature dependent <pause dur="0.6"/> and <pause dur="1.5"/> in general <pause dur="0.7"/> most natural species will <pause dur="0.2"/> probably move <pause dur="1.5"/> northwards in in a very general sense <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> until they run out of space <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> and and <pause dur="0.8"/> can't go any further <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> and these are again people are are producing models of how species distribution <pause dur="0.4"/> # be affected by climatic change <pause dur="0.7"/> most are driven by temperature <pause dur="0.2"/>

 if you like the mean winter <pause dur="0.7"/> and then <pause dur="0.2"/> we we have warm winters <pause dur="0.7"/> and cooler winters <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> or wetter winters and dry winters <pause dur="0.7"/> and <pause dur="0.5"/> the black dots are what we've had <kinesic desc="indicates board on wall using a stick" iterated="n"/> <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> over recent times over <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> last twenty or thirty years <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> we've had some winters that <kinesic desc="indicates board on wall using a stick" iterated="n"/> are <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.9"/> sort of drier and colder <pause dur="0.6"/> than than the average <pause dur="0.4"/> # or we have warmer <kinesic desc="indicates board on wall using a stick" iterated="n"/> wetter <pause dur="0.9"/> winters but not particularly so <pause dur="1.1"/> the <pause dur="0.3"/> the circles <pause dur="1.0"/> # sorry the the red symbols <pause dur="0.3"/> # are what's likely to happen <pause dur="0.3"/> by the time you get <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> into <pause dur="0.6"/> two-thousand-and-twenties and two-fifties and the eighties <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> and but
 <pause dur="0.2"/> with # <pause dur="1.1"/> various bits of <trunc> s </trunc> of scatter <pause dur="0.3"/> and essentially <pause dur="1.2"/> the the implications are for what we talked about last week that we're going to be having warmer and wetter winters <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> and considerably <kinesic desc="indicates board on wall using a stick" iterated="n"/> <pause dur="0.5"/> warmer and wetter <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="1.0"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> by the end of the century <pause dur="2.7"/> if you look at summer <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> the points tend to be all cluttered <kinesic desc="indicates board on wall using a stick" iterated="n"/> round there that we <pause dur="0.6"/> tend <pause dur="1.0"/> we've had <pause dur="1.1"/> dry <kinesic desc="indicates board on wall using a stick" iterated="n"/> <pause dur="0.3"/> summers <pause dur="0.2"/> and wetter summers <pause dur="0.2"/> but we don't actually have so much variation in temperature <pause dur="0.2"/> over over the summer as a whole <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> but that again is is likely to change and all the predictions are <pause dur="0.5"/> remember we said last week of a decrease in in rainfall in the summer <pause dur="0.4"/> and the increase in temperature <pause dur="0.3"/> so <pause dur="0.3"/> the evidence <kinesic desc="indicates board on wall using a stick" iterated="n"/> seems to be for the U-K that we are certainly moving <pause dur="0.5"/> towards <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="1.1"/> warmer drier summers <pause dur="0.4"/> which will have <pause dur="0.6"/> obviously effects upon natural vegetation crops water resources and things like that <pause dur="2.4"/> any any thoughts about that any questions about that does
 it <pause dur="4.5"/> <unclear> good for going to the beach </unclear> but then again not so good for <pause dur="0.6"/> other things <pause dur="1.7"/> # <pause dur="1.8"/> again i i don't expect you to look at these in in in any any detail <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="1.0"/> but these are <pause dur="0.4"/> the sort of level of detail that people are now modelling <pause dur="0.3"/> the climatic change of the U-K <pause dur="0.3"/> you see the U-K is made up of little <pause dur="0.4"/> little grids <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="1.0"/> and <pause dur="0.7"/> this is looking at winter <pause dur="0.6"/> rainfall <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.8"/> and then summer rainfall over here <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> and <pause dur="1.7"/> this is <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="1.2"/> looking at what they think is a is a reasonable scenario and given <pause dur="0.3"/> the present rate of C-O-two emissions and things what's likely to happen <pause dur="0.4"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> basically <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> anything 
 <pause dur="0.5"/> green or blue means more rainfall <pause dur="0.9"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> and <pause dur="0.5"/> anything yellow down to red brown means less rainfall <pause dur="0.7"/> so <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="2.4"/> and <pause dur="0.5"/> sorry what i didn't say <pause dur="0.6"/> i can't see here quickly this top line is for <pause dur="0.5"/> sorry for <trunc> re </trunc> relatively low emissions and high emissions <pause dur="0.5"/> of C-O-two and <pause dur="0.4"/> you know we may be somewhere in between <pause dur="0.4"/> but it this quantifies the effects and the important thing is that <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> in terms of winter rainfall <kinesic desc="indicates board on wall using a stick" iterated="n"/> <pause dur="0.7"/> it seems that most of the effects are going to be concentrated in the in the south and south east 
 <pause dur="1.1"/> of of of <pause dur="0.7"/> of the country <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="2.2"/> and <pause dur="0.5"/> the same is going to be true in in <pause dur="1.0"/> summer rainfall <pause dur="0.7"/> that the summer rainfalls will decrease everywhere <pause dur="0.5"/> but <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> there's a <pause dur="0.5"/> more a tendency of bigger effects in in the south <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.9"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> and particularly as you get towards the end of the century <pause dur="0.6"/> so <pause dur="0.3"/> these are the sort of latest predictions that people have got and and <pause dur="0.5"/> people are trying to think of the implications of of these things for <pause dur="0.2"/> for <pause dur="0.6"/> for life in the U-K <pause dur="1.6"/> # <pause dur="2.5"/> temperature again <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="1.6"/> all the colours here are positive <pause dur="0.6"/> # nought's down here <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> going up to <trunc> f </trunc> <pause dur="0.6"/> four and a half degrees five degrees increase in in temperature <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="1.4"/> and obviously
 <pause dur="0.8"/> high emissions have a bigger effect <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.9"/> but again <pause dur="0.8"/> there's there's a # <pause dur="2.4"/> a a tendency again <pause dur="0.3"/> for the for the <pause dur="0.7"/> well <pause dur="0.3"/> for England i suppose and particularly for the south east # <pause dur="0.4"/> to have the biggest effects <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> moderated in in in in in in in in other places <pause dur="4.7"/> # <pause dur="1.2"/> soil moisture content this is this is # <pause dur="1.7"/> # <pause dur="1.5"/> very small you can <trunc> r </trunc> read the details on on the web if you want to <pause dur="0.4"/> but essentially again <pause dur="0.3"/> it's 
 <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.9"/> getting drier essentially in in in in in the average soil moisture content <pause dur="2.7"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> thermal growing season i <trunc> s </trunc> showed you figures how that've changed over time already <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.9"/> and <pause dur="1.4"/> again we're talking about fairly <pause dur="0.8"/> long changes <pause dur="0.5"/> # big changes # <pause dur="2.0"/> that <pause dur="0.7"/> increases <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.9"/> i mean the lowest colour <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="1.4"/> i mean <pause dur="0.4"/> # this is for two-thousand-and-eighty so i suppose it's it is the end of <pause dur="0.3"/> getting towards the end of the century <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.8"/> but i mean the smallest changes here are something like an increase in thirty <pause dur="0.6"/> thirty thirty-five days <pause dur="0.6"/> # under low
 emissions <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.8"/> and # <pause dur="1.0"/> under high emissions <pause dur="0.8"/> basically temperatures being <pause dur="0.4"/> probably <pause dur="1.5"/> warm enough for <pause dur="0.5"/> substantial crop growth throughout throughout the year <pause dur="0.7"/> so again it's going to have a major effect upon upon vegetation and and cropping <pause dur="2.2"/> # <pause dur="2.4"/> people are doing all sorts of different approaches to try to predict the effects of <pause dur="0.4"/> of climatic change <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="2.3"/> one one of the nicest studies that <pause dur="0.9"/> i've seen recently is is this one from Ireland <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> so i thought i'd stick it in to give an idea of what people actually do <pause dur="0.3"/> it uses the same sort of ideas as as before <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> a big general circulation model and then <pause dur="0.2"/> coming down to give you more <pause dur="0.7"/> local detail <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="1.0"/> and it uses something called weather 
 generators <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> the idea <pause dur="0.2"/> there is that if you sort of estimate the the monthly <pause dur="1.6"/> temperatures for instance or the monthly rainfall <pause dur="0.6"/> you've got an idea of how many <pause dur="0.7"/> days it's going to rain <pause dur="0.8"/> you can generate <pause dur="0.3"/> the daily <pause dur="0.5"/> artificial daily data if you like to simulate <pause dur="1.2"/> typical <pause dur="0.2"/> climate patterns <pause dur="0.5"/> quite a bit of research getting into that sort of area <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> how you take sort of monthly data <pause dur="0.2"/> and <pause dur="0.9"/> guess at what the daily data will be so it all adds up together <pause dur="0.4"/> if that makes makes sense <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.8"/> because obviously it matters a bit # <pause dur="1.4"/> you know if you if you get <pause dur="0.7"/> sixty millimetres of rain a month does that come in one storm 
 <pause dur="0.5"/> # which has <pause dur="0.8"/> probably nasty effects and damaging effects or <unclear> does it </unclear> come in <pause dur="0.4"/> in ten <pause dur="0.8"/> nice gentle rain days spread over the month and things like that <pause dur="0.2"/> so there's work going on there <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="1.2"/> so <pause dur="0.7"/> it tries to estimate daily data <pause dur="0.2"/> and then <pause dur="1.0"/> uses crop models # <pause dur="0.4"/> these are a set of crop models that are very widely used <pause dur="0.4"/> throughout the world <pause dur="0.2"/> to estimate yields <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> so <pause dur="1.4"/> what they've done is to try to <pause dur="0.6"/>
 look at <pause dur="0.6"/> patterns of rainfall <pause dur="0.6"/> in # in Ireland <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="1.0"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> they they <pause dur="0.2"/> sort of tested it by <pause dur="1.0"/> going back to predict the past climate if you like <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="1.3"/> this isn't real data it's predictions from <pause dur="0.7"/> a model <pause dur="0.7"/> with sort of run <pause dur="1.0"/> from from from early on in in in time <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> don't worry about the details but basically <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="1.0"/> January <pause dur="0.2"/> these examples of January rainfall <pause dur="0.2"/> basically getting wetter in Ireland the the darker colour <pause dur="0.2"/> the the more rainfall <pause dur="0.4"/> 
 but summer rainfall <pause dur="0.5"/> # again decreasing <pause dur="0.2"/> consistent with the U-K <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="1.6"/> but what does that do to <pause dur="0.4"/> to crop yield oh that's that's temperature sorry <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="1.5"/> again these are all positive <pause dur="0.2"/> temperatures <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="3.1"/> # <pause dur="1.0"/> but basically <kinesic desc="indicates board on wall using a stick" iterated="n"/> <pause dur="0.9"/> lighter colours here increasing temperatures in in summer <kinesic desc="indicates board on wall using a stick" iterated="n"/> and increasing <kinesic desc="indicates board on wall using a stick" iterated="n"/> temperatures in <pause dur="0.7"/> in <pause dur="0.9"/> in # winter <pause dur="1.8"/> but then using that data <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> you can basically run the crop model to estimate the yields that you'd get 
 <pause dur="0.7"/> for the crops <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> in each of these little squares <pause dur="0.2"/> you know so each square <kinesic desc="indicates board on wall" iterated="n"/> basically <pause dur="0.3"/> has got its own <pause dur="0.3"/> climate <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> generated and produces its own estimates in yield <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="1.1"/> so this is a pattern <pause dur="0.3"/> # nineteen-sixty-one to ninety <pause dur="0.7"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> basically <pause dur="0.6"/> these conditions <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> given that barley <pause dur="0.2"/> is is basically grown as a winter crop <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="1.8"/> so sown in the autumn and harvested later on in in in in the <trunc> s </trunc> in <pause dur="0.4"/> in <pause dur="0.2"/> in the summer <pause dur="0.4"/> # 
 <pause dur="0.3"/> you're actually tending to get increases in yield <pause dur="0.7"/> in in in barley <pause dur="0.3"/> predicted <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="1.1"/> in in in Ireland <pause dur="1.0"/> potatoes <pause dur="1.0"/> without irrigation # <pause dur="0.7"/> which <pause dur="0.4"/> are quite widely grown in Ireland at the moment <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="1.3"/> the colours get lighter basically as time goes on <pause dur="0.4"/> because the summer <pause dur="0.7"/> water shortage becomes more and more <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.9"/> important <pause dur="0.3"/> and and restricts the growth <pause dur="0.2"/>
 # of of of <pause dur="0.2"/> the yield <pause dur="0.7"/> so <pause dur="0.2"/> don't worry about the details now i've really put it just put it in to show you <pause dur="0.3"/> what people are doing how people are trying to <trunc> im </trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> model predict the impacts <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="1.8"/> but to my mind it's very crucial that the the the <pause dur="0.3"/> the assumptions about rainfall are are are good <pause dur="0.6"/> and i've still got a big question mark over that <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> you know you still have to trust the <pause dur="0.4"/> the the models or whatever <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> and they're certainly getting better # they're doing very well but <pause dur="0.4"/> the results are very sensitive to <pause dur="0.6"/> to to to rainfall <pause dur="2.6"/> # <pause dur="3.5"/> as i say we we could spend the whole module

 weeds likely to to be there <pause dur="0.9"/> among the growing seasons <pause dur="0.5"/> and summer water supply may well be a problem <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> there's going to be a lot of work about efficient irrigation and things to to make use of water resources <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="2.0"/> so <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="1.0"/> and in these sort of impact studies you can read much more about these these particular details <pause dur="1.4"/> # <pause dur="2.4"/> rainfall <pause dur="0.4"/> well <pause dur="1.4"/> the predictions all seem to be reduced summer rainfall <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> will effect water supply <pause dur="0.5"/> and <pause dur="0.3"/> warmer temperatures will really increased demand <pause dur="0.6"/> and i know that the <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> water companies and and people are very concerned about <pause dur="0.3"/> possible demand in in in <pause dur="1.0"/> two-thousand-and-fifty whatever <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> and need <trunc> in </trunc> increased

 in parts of the U-K <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> there're <pause dur="0.7"/> geological movements <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> here in in in millimetres per year <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> so Scotland's going up <pause dur="1.0"/> very gently <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> and other parts are going down et cetera <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> and <pause dur="1.4"/> you have to take that into account when you look at the effects on on on actual <pause dur="0.2"/> practical sea-level rises <pause dur="0.5"/> so <pause dur="0.4"/> these are the sea-level rises that are being predicted for the various areas <pause dur="0.6"/> of the U-K <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="2.3"/> but again <pause dur="0.9"/> # <pause dur="1.3"/> you know if we if we take # <pause dur="1.0"/> where shall we take take eastern England which is 
 <pause dur="0.4"/> somewhere that people are often very concerned about <pause dur="0.2"/> that's actually sort of <pause dur="0.5"/> sinking down a bit <pause dur="0.4"/> but we've we've still got a big range between twenty-two <pause dur="0.4"/> centimetres <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> and eighty centimetres depending upon the different <pause dur="0.3"/> emission scenarios <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="1.6"/> so again a great cause for concern <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="1.1"/> and this this is very much a lower limit <kinesic desc="indicates board on wall " iterated="n"/> of i think <pause dur="0.3"/> # of what <pause dur="0.4"/> is likely to happen <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> so again <pause dur="1.0"/> people looking at <pause dur="0.2"/> you know <pause dur="0.9"/> precautions <trunc> wh </trunc> <pause dur="1.0"/> can't spell coastal can i <pause dur="1.0"/> sorry <pause dur="0.2"/> deliberate mistake <pause dur="1.0"/> # increased coastal flooding coastal erosion <pause dur="0.8"/> and things like that and things to be concerned about <pause dur="4.8"/> right <pause dur="0.5"/> that was really concentrating on the U-K <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.8"/> just to finish up <pause dur="1.1"/> a couple of slides about # world 
 production <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="1.5"/> this is looking at <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="1.3"/> U-K production <pause dur="0.2"/> sorry <pause dur="1.0"/> cereal production in the world <pause dur="0.5"/> under different <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> climatic change models <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> you needn't worry about these these are three different models one one's the U-K model and whatever <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="1.1"/> because the <pause dur="0.2"/> the models don't necessarily agree <pause dur="0.3"/> but <pause dur="0.6"/> the question is 
 do you get consistency on on on on the output <pause dur="0.2"/> et cetera <pause dur="0.5"/> and <pause dur="0.9"/> # <pause dur="0.8"/> what this graph is is basically looking at is <pause dur="1.0"/> developed countries <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> developing countries and and the world total <pause dur="0.6"/> and <pause dur="2.5"/> overall <kinesic desc="indicates board on wall using a stick" iterated="n"/> <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> in terms of cereal production <pause dur="0.4"/> the climatic effects only <pause dur="0.7"/> which are are basically temperature and rainfall <pause dur="1.9"/> the the estimates seem to be that <pause dur="1.7"/> total developed world <pause dur="0.7"/> cereal production should go down <pause dur="0.6"/> but <pause dur="1.4"/> i'm sorry <trunc> i </trunc> if you can't read the detail but # <kinesic desc="indicates board on wall using a stick" iterated="n"/> <pause dur="1.2"/> the climate effects are are rainfall # and temperature <pause dur="0.6"/> the the 
 <gap reason="inaudible" extent ="0.3 sec"/> effects of carbon dioxide <pause dur="1.0"/> increase will probably <pause dur="0.6"/> turn that into into a positive effect <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.8"/> so <pause dur="1.2"/> increased <kinesic desc="indicates board on wall" iterated="n"/> temperature reducing yield <pause dur="0.2"/> but the carbon dioxide effects <pause dur="0.6"/> generally balancing that although <pause dur="1.0"/> depending on which climate scenario you you you pick up <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> you may have a a negative effect or positive effect <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> but then <pause dur="1.7"/> there are various 
 things that we can do <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="1.3"/> this is a <unclear> dash </unclear> # called adaptation level one <pause dur="0.3"/> which are things like <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> changing the crop variety changing the planting date <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="1.2"/> # and the amount of water applied for a <pause dur="0.3"/> level <trunc> a </trunc> areas already irrigated <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> so we can do some things to <pause dur="0.3"/> to <pause dur="0.5"/> maintain cereal supplies <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="1.3"/> or we can <pause dur="1.6"/> grow <pause dur="0.5"/> go on to further adaptation by growing different different <trunc> varie </trunc> different crops <pause dur="0.4"/>
 you know maybe growing <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="1.1"/> well say more maize instead of instead of wheat and things like that <pause dur="0.5"/> # and other things <pause dur="1.2"/> but i suppose the the basic picture to get from from here is that <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="2.3"/> that in theory the developed world can probably <pause dur="0.5"/> maintain its food supplies its cereal supplies <pause dur="0.5"/> by <pause dur="0.2"/> <trunc> a </trunc> <pause dur="0.3"/> adapting changing varieties moving things around <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> that's much less harder to do or much harder to do in developing countries <pause dur="0.3"/> where the scope for <pause dur="0.3"/> 
 adaptation is less <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> adaptation may reduce <pause dur="0.3"/> things but the <pause dur="0.3"/> the climatic effects <pause dur="0.2"/> particularly in the tropics <pause dur="0.6"/> would seem to be <pause dur="0.2"/> generally fairly negative <pause dur="0.4"/> and that's a <pause dur="0.5"/> a position that we need to <pause dur="0.6"/> need to think about <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> in terms of world <pause dur="0.2"/> total <pause dur="0.7"/> well maybe we can <pause dur="0.3"/> keep <pause dur="0.3"/> food supplies <pause dur="1.1"/> together <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> at # <pause dur="0.8"/> the same sort of level <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="1.5"/> but <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> you know there's there's a tale of two two worlds there if you like and # <pause dur="0.7"/> the world's got to be able to 
 come to terms with this particular problem in in in the near future <pause dur="2.7"/> # <pause dur="2.2"/> again <pause dur="0.5"/> a couple of international studies to show that people are looking at these things around the world <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="1.7"/> the the current distribution of beech trees in in in north America <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> how that's likely to change under different <pause dur="0.2"/> predictions of of climatic change in the next <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="1.6"/> # fifty years or so <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> simple things like <pause dur="0.9"/> again i've just picked out one individual crop <pause dur="0.2"/> this is coffee <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="1.4"/> quite an important crop in in parts of Uganda <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.9"/> coffee doesn't really like warm temperatures <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="1.8"/> there's a lot of material out there that that you can read <pause dur="0.4"/> # you don't really need to read for <pause dur="1.4"/> for boring things
 like the exams in this course and things like that <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> you know the hand outs and some of the particular things i'll i'll talk about exams a bit later on <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> but <pause dur="0.3"/> these are some of the the important sites for climatic change <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.8"/> the grid what we we we've referenced before <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> <kinesic desc="indicates board on wall" iterated="n"/> which is the United Nations environment programme <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> that <kinesic desc="indicates board on wall" iterated="n"/> one we had up <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> we had sort of climatic graphics with last week <pause dur="0.5"/> climatic research East Anglia <kinesic desc="indicates board on wall" iterated="n"/> is is is quite an important one <pause dur="0.6"/> met office <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> U-K <pause dur="0.5"/> World Meteorological Organization in in Switzerland <pause dur="1.0"/> # is W-M-O <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> this is the United Kingdom <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> climatic impacts programme <pause dur="0.9"/> the Tyndall centre
