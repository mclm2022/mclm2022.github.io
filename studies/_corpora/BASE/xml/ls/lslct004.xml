you've probably heard quite a lot about that in the course <pause dur="0.2"/> already <pause dur="1.6"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> for herbicides <trunc>th</trunc> <pause dur="1.0"/> the usage is mainly to do with # direct drilling <pause dur="0.2"/> where <pause dur="0.5"/> in the past # historical past of course <pause dur="0.3"/> farmers would have always ploughed their fields before they planted the crops to kill off the weeds <pause dur="0.6"/> now they can spray the fields and kill off the weeds and then plant the seeds directly in the ground without having to <pause dur="0.4"/> to plough the <pause dur="0.2"/> plough the field and this saves them an enormous amount of money in labour <pause dur="1.0"/> this is called direct drilling <pause dur="1.0"/> # fungicides are used mainly for seed dressings <pause dur="0.7"/> when you collect seeds from a crop <pause dur="0.2"/> to store for the following year if you store them in a <pause dur="0.3"/> in a barn or something they can go mouldy quite quickly so if you <pause dur="0.2"/> cover the seeds in a very thin layer of <pause dur="0.4"/> of fungicide <pause dur="0.6"/> and this prevents them from going mouldy <pause dur="0.3"/> this is the main use of fungicides <pause dur="0.5"/> in the U-K <pause dur="0.9"/> insecticides have a have a <pause dur="0.5"/> much smaller usage <pause dur="0.5"/> because there aren't any really major insect pests of 
crops <pause dur="0.6"/> and we don't in the U-K we don't get things like locusts swarms <pause dur="0.4"/> # coming in <pause dur="0.3"/> and it's only occasionally when you get things like Colorado beetles <pause dur="0.3"/> which is on the handout that i gave you <pause dur="0.4"/> arriving <pause dur="0.3"/> that # <trunc>tha</trunc> that you have to very seriously spray for insect pests <pause dur="0.8"/> so that's the sort of ratio that # <pause dur="0.5"/> of usage that you get <pause dur="1.8"/> now the <pause dur="0.3"/> ideal pest-killing chemical <pause dur="0.6"/> if it existed <pause dur="1.1"/><kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="2"/> would <pause dur="0.5"/> do the following <pause dur="0.7"/> first of all it would only kill the target pest <pause dur="3.5"/> so <pause dur="0.5"/> if you have a pest <pause dur="0.9"/> problem <pause dur="1.0"/> you want your pesticide to be very specific to only target the specific thing that you're trying to <pause dur="0.3"/> kill off <pause dur="1.5"/> of course as we know that's not <pause dur="0.8"/> often # <pause dur="0.3"/> invariably not the case <pause dur="1.6"/> # <pause dur="2.5"/> they should have no short <pause dur="0.3"/> or long term health effects <pause dur="0.9"/> on non-target organisms and this of course includes people <pause dur="6.2"/> clearly you <pause dur="0.5"/> preferably don't want to kill off the natural predators <pause dur="1.0"/> of things so if you have had a <pause dur="0.3"/> problem with <pause dur="1.4"/> greenfly <pause dur="0.3"/> # aphids on a crop <pause dur="0.9"/> # clearly you don't want to kill off all the ladybirds because ladybirds eat lots 
of aphids lots of greenfly <pause dur="1.0"/> but if you spray the crop to kill off the aphids then you'll kill off their natural predators as well <pause dur="0.5"/> so the pest problem in the long term can in fact become worse <pause dur="2.1"/> so ideally you'd want to target a specific # <pause dur="0.5"/> specific organism that was causing the problem <pause dur="3.6"/> # the third <pause dur="0.2"/> factor is you'd want them to break down rapidly into harmless components better rub this off while i remember hadn't i <pause dur="0.4"/><event desc="wipes board" iterated="y" dur="1"/><vocal desc="laughter" n="sl" iterated="y" dur="1"/> <pause dur="2.4"/> break down into harmless components <pause dur="0.6"/> so that you spray your <pause dur="0.6"/> or you apply your chemical to the crop <pause dur="0.4"/> it kills the pest <pause dur="0.3"/> and then it breaks down very quickly <pause dur="1.5"/> and # one as we'll see one of the problems of pesticides that were used <trunc>s</trunc> <trunc>s</trunc> historically in in the past <pause dur="0.7"/> was that many of them were extremely persistent <pause dur="0.9"/> you remember when we did the practical on D-D-T <pause dur="0.3"/> the <pause dur="0.3"/> D-D-T was shown to cause eggshell thinning <pause dur="0.9"/> eggshell thinning in birds of prey <pause dur="0.8"/> and i'll come back that to that in a bit more detail later on <pause dur="0.7"/> but the pesticides which are being developed nowadays 
tend to have a much shorter half-life in the environment <pause dur="0.6"/> and some of them will in fact break down instantly when they touch the soil <pause dur="0.5"/> so # they're very effective <pause dur="0.3"/> when you spray them but they break down very quickly so there aren't such long term <pause dur="0.5"/> effects <pause dur="1.3"/> a fourth # factor is quite important <pause dur="0.7"/> although difficult to control <pause dur="0.2"/> i mean <trunc>i</trunc> the ideal <trunc>pe</trunc> # pesticide should prevent <pause dur="0.9"/> the development of genetic resistance to target <pause dur="0.4"/> organisms <pause dur="1.9"/> and i'll come back to this in more detail later on <pause dur="0.8"/> 
but # <pause dur="0.9"/> there are several species of insects which have become resistant <pause dur="0.5"/> to a <trunc>w</trunc> a wide range of pesticides <pause dur="0.5"/> and these are have very difficult to control <pause dur="0.6"/> in the field without # <pause dur="0.3"/> massive applications of pesticides which become ecologically <pause dur="0.4"/> unacceptable <pause dur="1.6"/> finally <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> farmers of course are all in in a business <pause dur="0.2"/> as as we hear <pause dur="0.7"/> <trunc>i</trunc> increasingly nowadays <pause dur="0.6"/> and the use of pesticides <pause dur="0.4"/> should save money compared to making no effort to control pest species <pause dur="2.8"/> and # pesticides are relatively have been relatively cheap <pause dur="0.2"/> # and it's <pause dur="0.3"/> in the <trunc>farm</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> been in the farmer's interest to spray the crops very regularly <pause dur="0.6"/> without actually <pause dur="1.0"/> doing doing without the scientific back-up to to <pause dur="0.7"/> # know whether or not this # is an an effective way of controlling the pests <pause dur="1.4"/> sometimes you can get away with much fewer with with many fewer <pause dur="0.3"/> 
applications of pesticides if you look for example at the climate <pause dur="0.4"/> and the the weather conditions <pause dur="0.3"/> and # <trunc>th</trunc> the natural population fluctuations of the pests rather than just spraying <pause dur="0.4"/> say every <pause dur="0.3"/> on the first Monday of every month <pause dur="0.5"/> because your farmhand happens to have that allocated in his diary <pause dur="0.6"/> look at the population structure of the pests <pause dur="0.7"/> look at the weather <pause dur="0.3"/> what's the best time to spray to have the most effective effect rather than just <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="1.3"/> spraying just because it happens to be that time of the month <pause dur="2.3"/><kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="9"/> okay now i want to say something very briefly about the different <trunc>th</trunc> the three main <pause dur="1.3"/> types <pause dur="1.0"/> of pesticide <pause dur="1.5"/> just to illustrate the sort of <pause dur="0.5"/> problems that you can have environmental problems that you can have <pause dur="4.7"/> now <pause dur="0.9"/> the most or <pause dur="0.3"/> one of the most effective herbicides <pause dur="0.2"/> that's a <pause dur="0.2"/> pesticide for killing other plants <pause dur="0.6"/> is a <trunc>s</trunc> chemical called two-four-five-T <pause dur="1.5"/> and this was very widely used in farming <pause dur="1.0"/> and was also unfortunately very widely used in the Vietnam War <pause dur="0.2"/> where it became known as Agent 
Orange <pause dur="1.1"/> and the American Army sprayed <pause dur="0.5"/> # vast areas of the Vietnamese jungle <pause dur="0.7"/> with two-four-five-T <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> in an attempt to actually wipe out the jungle completely so the Viet Cong <pause dur="0.5"/> had nowhere to hide <pause dur="1.4"/> couldn't hide in the jungle and <trunc>l</trunc> vast tracts of Vietnam were laid waste by the spraying of this chemical <pause dur="0.8"/> and unfortunately during the manufacturing process <pause dur="0.8"/> there's an impurity which <pause dur="1.7"/> evolves <pause dur="0.3"/> in the in the chemical process called dioxin and dioxin is extremely toxic <pause dur="0.9"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> many of the American servicemen who were involved in spraying this chemical <pause dur="0.4"/> and also farm workers who were spraying two-four-five-T <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> got some symptoms of dioxin poisoning <pause dur="0.6"/> which is a general sort of # aching of the body aching of the limbs <pause dur="0.4"/> # acne develops on the skin you get quite severe acne <pause dur="0.6"/> # and eventually headaches # and # it can be quite dehabilitating <pause dur="0.8"/> of course what happened to the <pause dur="0.2"/> poor Vietnamese who were in the <shift feature="voice" new="laugh"/> jungle <shift feature="voice" new="normal"/> <pause dur="0.7"/> when they got sprayed i mean they've got very badly affected as well so # <pause dur="0.6"/> the 
effects of dioxin <pause dur="0.3"/> <trunc>ca</trunc> # have been quite serious <pause dur="0.4"/> so one of the problems with <pause dur="0.2"/> pesticides is that can contain impurities which cause effects <pause dur="0.4"/> which are nothing to do with the <pause dur="0.9"/> # <trunc>th</trunc> <trunc>th</trunc> the pest-killing <pause dur="0.7"/> status <pause dur="2.0"/><kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="3"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> for fungicides <pause dur="0.5"/> there is an example <pause dur="0.3"/> quite a <trunc>sev</trunc> <trunc>s</trunc> # serious example <pause dur="0.4"/> in Iraq in nineteen-seventy where <pause dur="0.7"/> # seeds were dressed with mercury <pause dur="0.2"/> it was quite common a common practice to dress seeds with mercury as a fungicide <pause dur="1.0"/> <trunc>ev</trunc> even in the U-K up until # <pause dur="0.3"/> the early nineteen-nineties it was still legal to do this <unclear>no doubt</unclear> now it's been stopped <pause dur="1.5"/> but # in Iraq in nineteen-seventy <pause dur="0.7"/> # the mercury which had been dressed <trunc>s</trunc> <pause dur="0.3"/> <trunc>w</trunc> <pause dur="0.3"/> <trunc>ha</trunc> was by mistake sent to a bakery <pause dur="0.5"/> and # loads of bread were made out of this <trunc>brea</trunc> this these seeds <pause dur="0.6"/> and # before it was discovered <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> that that this <pause dur="0.9"/> had # had occurred # about a thousand people died of mercury poisoning <pause dur="0.3"/> and many others were # <pause dur="0.4"/> dehabilitated by the mercury <pause dur="3.1"/> so you have to be very careful with these things with # that that that

problem with these insecticides is that they can accumulate in the food chain <pause dur="0.7"/> now you don't need to copy this <pause dur="0.2"/> down because you've had it on the # on the handout that i gave you for the practical but just to <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="1.0"/> reiterate again the problem about the eggshell thinning <pause dur="1.3"/> the # D-D-T which was used very widely for <trunc>sp</trunc> for spraying crops <pause dur="0.3"/> as an insecticide <pause dur="0.6"/> was accumulated through the food chain <pause dur="0.8"/> and # birds of prey like peregrine falcons and sparrow hawks which were eating <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> small small mammals and birds which had <pause dur="0.3"/> accumulated D-D-T <pause dur="0.7"/><vocal desc="cough" iterated="n"/> became # badly affected because their <pause dur="0.5"/> the D-D-T would <pause dur="0.2"/> would interfere with the calcium metabolism of the birds <pause dur="1.4"/> so if you remember from the practical when we measured the egg <pause dur="0.2"/> eggshells <pause dur="0.4"/> # i've just put up the peregrine falcon data <pause dur="0.5"/> # we saw a thinning of the peregrine falcon <pause dur="1.0"/> eggs that had been removed from <pause dur="0.3"/> abandoned nests <pause dur="0.5"/> # in the sort of nineteen-fifties nineteen-sixties and there has quite been quite good recovery <pause dur="0.5"/> # in recent years although we did still find a 
few eggs that were <pause dur="0.3"/> were thinned <pause dur="2.4"/> okay so <pause dur="1.3"/> there can be impurities in these pesticides they can <pause dur="0.7"/> get # into the human food chain if <kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="9"/> if you're not very careful <pause dur="0.5"/> and the insecticides can also affect <pause dur="0.3"/> things if they pass up through the food chain <pause dur="1.9"/> now D-D-T it might interest you to know you'd think that D-D-T would have been banned but in fact this is an article from New Scientist <pause dur="0.4"/> on the eighteenth of September <pause dur="0.4"/> last year <pause dur="0.8"/> and it says here <reading>proposals to ban the pesticide D-D-T by two-thousand-and-seven <pause dur="0.6"/> have been dropped <pause dur="0.9"/> for fear of harming efforts to fight malaria <pause dur="0.7"/> instead countries negotiating to limit persistent organic pollutants <pause dur="0.5"/> agreed in Geneva last week to achieve elimination over time</reading> which is a good <pause dur="0.2"/> politician's fudge phrase <pause dur="0.5"/> <reading>on condition that poor countries get help <pause dur="0.3"/> finding alternatives <pause dur="1.3"/> # World Wide Fund <pause dur="0.2"/> for Nature says combinations of safer insecticides bed nets and draining of mosquito breeding areas <pause dur="0.2"/> control malaria just as well <pause dur="0.7"/> but the World

flowers of a <pause dur="0.3"/> pyrethrum plant so you pick the <pause dur="0.2"/> the flowers from the pyrethrum plant <pause dur="0.7"/> # and they would be soaked in water and then you could spray that onto crops and the natural defence of the plant would also protect against insects <pause dur="0.7"/> and there's evidence that the Chinese were doing this # two-thousand years ago so <pause dur="0.4"/> many quite ancient cultures <pause dur="0.5"/> have been using pesticides for <pause dur="0.2"/> some considerable time <pause dur="2.1"/> but # <pause dur="1.1"/> <trunc>s</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> just <trunc>bef</trunc> before and after the Second World War <pause dur="0.2"/> there was a an explosion in the chemical industry <shift feature="voice" new="laugh"/> # not an explosion <pause dur="0.2"/> expansion <shift feature="voice" new="normal"/> <pause dur="0.7"/><vocal desc="laughter" n="ss" iterated="y" dur="1"/> in the <trunc>chemi</trunc> well probably was an explosion as well though <trunc>w</trunc> though i <pause dur="0.3"/> talk about explosions later on <pause dur="0.5"/> # there was a persistent <pause dur="0.8"/> # <trunc>th</trunc> <trunc>th</trunc> the persistent <trunc>organ</trunc> inorganic chemicals were developed <pause dur="0.9"/> and it was thought at the time that # <pause dur="0.6"/> in the sort of white heat of technology <pause dur="0.7"/> that existed that # this was the answer to all pesticide problems <pause dur="0.6"/> and that # if you had a pesticide problem you could just go and spray it with these chemicals and the problem would 
disappear <pause dur="0.7"/> of course as we know that hasn't happened <pause dur="3.1"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> some of the <pause dur="0.2"/> chemicals which were used <pause dur="1.3"/> in <pause dur="0.5"/> in Victorian times <pause dur="0.3"/> were quite toxic and in up to relatively recent times <pause dur="0.8"/> # these include things like Bordeaux mixture <pause dur="0.7"/> which is named after the <pause dur="0.2"/> fact that it was used extensively for spraying vines in France <pause dur="0.5"/> grape vines <pause dur="0.8"/> and these are <trunc>b</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> basically just solutions of of metal salts like copper <pause dur="0.4"/> and arsenic <pause dur="2.0"/> and these are very persistent # and these would be sprayed on on <pause dur="0.3"/> crops <pause dur="0.6"/> and # <pause dur="0.4"/> would be quite good at resisting <pause dur="0.8"/> insect attack <pause dur="1.6"/> # i always think it's ironic that if you go a garden centre and you go to the organic <pause dur="0.4"/> sort of gardening section <pause dur="0.7"/> they include <pause dur="0.4"/> Bordeaux mixture as a traditional organic remedy which <shift feature="voice" new="laugh"/> in fact it's <shift feature="voice" new="normal"/> <pause dur="0.3"/> probably about the worst thing you could spray on your <pause dur="0.5"/> on your garden because it is very persistent <pause dur="0.7"/> and # if you analyse soil <pause dur="0.5"/> from gardens and houses of more than <pause dur="0.3"/> say before about nineteen-ten nineteen-twenty <pause dur="0.6"/> they invariably have very high concentrations of <pause dur="0.7"/> # copper 
and lead and arsenic because people would traditionally just use this Bordeaux mixture as a traditional remedy <pause dur="0.7"/> # the house we used to live in off the Oxford Road in <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> which was built in about nineteen-hundred <pause dur="0.5"/> i analysed the soil <pause dur="0.5"/> from from the back garden and it had about between five and ten times the normal background level of copper <pause dur="0.6"/> and it's almost certainly because people had been spraying Bordeaux mixture <pause dur="0.5"/> on their # on their roses or <shift feature="voice" new="laugh"/> whatever they were growing there <shift feature="voice" new="normal"/> <pause dur="0.7"/> at # the turn of the century <pause dur="5.6"/> okay <pause dur="4.4"/> now the second generation pesticides which have developed from the Second World War onwards are mainly synthetic <pause dur="0.8"/> organic chemicals <pause dur="0.9"/> so for example D-D-T came into <pause dur="0.5"/> widespread use <pause dur="0.5"/> from nineteen-thirty-nine onwards <pause dur="1.8"/> and # <pause dur="0.6"/> it was a very <pause dur="0.2"/> important # chemical it it its <trunc>n</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> <trunc>s</trunc> it <trunc>i</trunc> # its use has certainly saved <pause dur="0.7"/> # millions of lives <pause dur="0.7"/> particularly for control in in wartime conditions where you get <pause dur="0.4"/> where you get high concentrations of people soldiers or refugees or <pause dur="0.5"/> 
whatever people in very impoverished conditions or difficult <pause dur="0.3"/> cramped conditions <pause dur="0.4"/> you can get <pause dur="0.2"/> diseases # <pause dur="0.2"/> diseases like # typhoid <pause dur="0.6"/> transmitted very easily and and <pause dur="0.3"/> if you have <pause dur="0.4"/> # mites <pause dur="0.5"/> for example which or lice which are transmitting the diseases <pause dur="0.7"/> # these were controlled quite effectively by D-D-T <pause dur="0.8"/> and # this this # <pause dur="0.2"/> had a big effect on # saving many a people's lives <pause dur="0.4"/> 
particularly during the war <pause dur="0.8"/> so although <pause dur="0.2"/> these <pause dur="0.2"/> chemicals clearly have have major problems environmentally they have saved a lot of lives <pause dur="1.7"/> now worldwide <pause dur="1.1"/> something like two-point-five-millions tons <pause dur="0.6"/> of second generation pesticides <pause dur="0.6"/> are used every year <pause dur="0.8"/> so the massive <pause dur="0.5"/> massive quantities it's a huge # industry which is economically <pause dur="0.9"/> is very important <pause dur="0.9"/> but # eighty-five per cent of these are used <pause dur="0.9"/> in the most developed countries like # America and <pause dur="0.3"/> Western Europe <pause dur="2.0"/> most farmers in developing countries <pause dur="0.6"/> don't # use <pause dur="1.1"/> as # pesticides <pause dur="0.3"/> very <pause dur="1.2"/> extensively because they're they're expensive <pause dur="0.4"/> and # <pause dur="1.0"/> there are cases of them being used <pause dur="0.4"/> locally of course but # <pause dur="0.2"/> in general <pause dur="0.4"/> most of the pesticides are used <pause dur="0.4"/> in developed countries <pause dur="4.3"/> # there are something like fifty-thousand different types of second generation pesticides <pause dur="0.7"/> which have been developed <pause dur="1.4"/> and of course this has <pause dur="0.4"/> <trunc>implicatio</trunc> environmental implications because it's really would be impossible to test <pause dur="0.7"/> every single <pause dur="1.4"/> pesticide on every single potential species in the wild <pause dur="0.6"/> and ways of getting around this problem i'll come back to later on when we <pause dur="0.2"/> we talk about ecotoxicology after 
the break <pause dur="0.7"/> so there are large numbers of of these chemicals <pause dur="0.6"/> and the usage is more or less the same as it is in the U-K <pause dur="1.6"/> about eighty-five per cent <pause dur="0.5"/> of herbicides <pause dur="0.2"/> <trunc>o</trunc> of <trunc>c</trunc> pesticides used in the world are herbicides <pause dur="1.5"/> and of that eighty-five per cent about twenty-five per cent <pause dur="0.2"/> sorry twenty per cent is used on golf courses <pause dur="0.4"/> and gardens <pause dur="1.0"/> i read some statistic once that said that five per cent of all <pause dur="0.6"/> herbicides in the world were sprayed on Japanese golf courses <pause dur="0.8"/> and they just drench them with <pause dur="0.4"/> chemicals to kill off the weeds <pause dur="0.5"/> so they have this very very <pause dur="0.5"/> particularly on the golf greens <pause dur="0.4"/> they have this very very pure # <pause dur="0.3"/> grass <pause dur="0.3"/> on a <pause dur="0.5"/> on a specific <pause dur="0.5"/> culture of grass which is mowed to within a couple of millimetres of <shift feature="voice" new="laugh"/> the soil <pause dur="0.6"/> <shift feature="voice" new="normal"/> so the golfers can <pause dur="1.2"/> knock their balls in the holes <pause dur="2.2"/> another reason reason for <pause dur="0.4"/> banning golfers # <pause dur="0.5"/><vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" dur="1"/> <pause dur="0.8"/><shift feature="voice" new="laugh"/> # <shift feature="voice" new="normal"/> <pause dur="2.5"/> ten per cent are used # for insecticides <pause dur="0.8"/> and about five per cent for fungicides <pause dur="1.5"/> so # <pause dur="0.6"/> again we can see that the vast majority of chemicals are used for # <pause dur="0.2"/> for herbicides <pause dur="2.7"/> 
now <pause dur="0.2"/> the third generation pesticides <pause dur="0.7"/> which have come into <pause dur="0.6"/> being in the last <pause dur="0.8"/> few years of course are genetically modified <pause dur="0.5"/> crops or G-M crops <pause dur="3.3"/> and if i asked any people in this room whether they would eat genetically modified crops i would guess that most people would say no they wouldn't <pause dur="0.9"/> and # the fact is that we've all eaten <trunc>gemet</trunc> genetically modified crops and we've been doing so for at least two or three years <pause dur="0.7"/> and this is because <pause dur="1.0"/> most of the soya <pause dur="0.9"/> that's used <pause dur="0.7"/> in # in food <pause dur="0.3"/> processing for a very very wide range of things like <pause dur="0.2"/> cakes <pause dur="0.9"/> baked beans # <pause dur="1.1"/> sauces # biscuits <pause dur="0.4"/> tons of things <pause dur="0.6"/> are made with the <pause dur="0.2"/> <trunc>h</trunc> have soya added as a as a part of the food # <pause dur="0.3"/> preparation process <pause dur="0.6"/> and most of the soya that's used is now genetically modified soya <pause dur="1.5"/> so we've all been eating it <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> whether or not we whether we like it or not <pause dur="1.3"/> and the main thrust for the development of the genetically modified crops is to develop <pause dur="1.5"/> crops which are resistant to herbicides <pause dur="0.5"/> which may sound rather peculiar <pause dur="1.6"/> but # the 
point of it is that if you can <pause dur="0.5"/> make your crop resistant to herbicides then you can spray <pause dur="0.3"/> # larger quantities of herbicides on a crop <pause dur="0.5"/> you can make them grow faster because you can get <trunc>r</trunc> rid of the weeds more easily <pause dur="0.6"/> # and this is because you <trunc>cou</trunc> if you for example if you spray twice as much herbicide <pause dur="0.4"/> on a herbicide resistant crop <pause dur="0.5"/> in theory you can get rid of the weeds twice as fast <pause dur="0.5"/> because your genetically resistant crop is able to survive much higher doses of herbicide <pause dur="0.9"/> this is very good for the <pause dur="0.2"/> the manufacturers of herbicides because they can sell more <pause dur="0.8"/> basically that's the that's the <trunc>th</trunc> idea behind the <pause dur="0.4"/> the problem <pause dur="1.4"/> and # on the handout one of the handouts i've given you this is # <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="1.2"/> on the one about Colorado beetle <trunc>i</trunc> i'll come back to Colorado beetles later on <pause dur="1.6"/> # the one that's on sideways on the bottom this is from yesterday's New Scientist so this this <trunc>t</trunc> course is nothing if not # topical <pause dur="0.9"/> and # there's a little article here which says resistance is useless <pause dur="0.7"/> 
and it's confirmed that in fact the major fear <pause dur="0.2"/> of the development of these herbicide resistant crops <pause dur="0.5"/> is that the genes for resistance can pass from the crops to the weeds <pause dur="1.2"/> if you then get <pause dur="0.4"/> weeds which are <pause dur="0.4"/> resistant to herbicides you can imagine the potential financial implications for farmers <pause dur="0.9"/> because if you <pause dur="0.7"/> # if you've got <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> weeds in a crop and you can no longer when you spray them with herbicides the weeds are no longer killed <pause dur="0.6"/> it means that you might have to go back to the # <pause dur="0.7"/> to a traditional method of farming <pause dur="0.2"/> <shift feature="voice" new="laugh"/> again which is <pause dur="0.2"/> of course might be quite good but # <pause dur="0.7"/><shift feature="voice" new="normal"/> but # has enormous economic implications <pause dur="3.7"/><kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="13"/> now # in in America <pause dur="0.3"/> there well let's just <pause dur="0.3"/> do this where are we <pause dur="0.3"/> properly <pause dur="0.2"/> here we are <pause dur="0.9"/> if we look at # <pause dur="0.8"/> a couple of recent articles this is one from <pause dur="1.7"/> this is from Nature back in November <pause dur="0.6"/> this says # <reading>area under transgenic crops <pause dur="0.2"/> shoots up forty-four per cent <pause dur="1.4"/> it's the area of land planted with <pause dur="0.2"/> G-M crops is expected to increase dramatically <pause dur="0.3"/> particularly in China Argentina

fifteen years or more <pause dur="9.9"/> okay the second type of insecticides are organophosphates <pause dur="1.4"/> we're sort of going through a sequence of of development here in terms of the <pause dur="0.3"/> <trunc>t</trunc> <pause dur="0.3"/> historically how they developed <pause dur="1.5"/> the the second type of insecticides are organophosphates and an example of an organophosphate is malathion <pause dur="1.0"/> and these are tend to be <trunc>l</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> these tend to be less persistent <pause dur="1.1"/> up to # <pause dur="1.3"/> to a year or so <pause dur="0.3"/> <trunc>de</trunc> again depending on the <pause dur="0.2"/> the sort of climatic conditions <pause dur="1.5"/> and then <trunc>th</trunc> the final two <pause dur="1.0"/> have low persistence <pause dur="0.4"/> carbamates <pause dur="1.0"/> # <pause dur="1.1"/> an example of which is carbaryl <pause dur="0.7"/> has a low persistence typically of weeks <pause dur="1.0"/> and pyrethroids <pause dur="0.9"/> again have a low <pause dur="0.6"/> persistence of days or weeks <pause dur="2.1"/> but # <trunc>py</trunc> most of the pyrethroids that are used now <pause dur="0.4"/> in farming are synthetic pyrethroids <pause dur="0.7"/> and # one of the ways in which these insecticides have been developed <pause dur="0.8"/> is that scientists have looked at the <pause dur="0.5"/> chemical structure the molecular structure <pause dur="0.6"/> of naturally occurring <pause dur="0.4"/> chemicals like pyrethrum <pause dur="0.7"/> and they have then synthesized a molecule

the # the <trunc>nowad</trunc> <pause dur="0.3"/> in the last year or two <pause dur="0.4"/> head lice have become resistant to all the chemicals that have been used and it's now become very difficult to get rid of them <pause dur="0.6"/> and # people are recommending that you go back to the traditional methods <pause dur="0.4"/> of of <pause dur="0.6"/> of # combing with a very fine comb <pause dur="0.4"/> on a regular basis to try and get rid of them but it's not <pause dur="0.5"/> nothing like as effective as dousing them with <pause dur="0.6"/> chemicals <pause dur="0.5"/> so head lice is a is a <pause dur="0.2"/> <trunc>m</trunc> <pause dur="0.4"/> major problem at the moment <pause dur="2.3"/> another problem with pesticides of course is that you tend to kill off natural enemies <pause dur="1.7"/> if you spray a crop you'll kill off things like ladybirds and # <pause dur="1.3"/> fly larvae that are eating eating things <pause dur="1.4"/> and of course # you can kill off <pause dur="0.9"/> # <pause dur="1.4"/> wildlife <pause dur="3.7"/> and there are <pause dur="0.2"/> clearly threats to # <pause dur="0.2"/> to wildlife if you're spraying a crop particularly on a windy day <pause dur="1.2"/> less than ten per cent of the <pause dur="0.3"/> pesticide that you spray will settle on the crop most of it will get <pause dur="0.3"/> land on the soil or will get

the the the the the density of the parasites isn't sufficiently high <pause dur="0.3"/> to control the pest because they tend to fly away <pause dur="0.6"/> so that works pretty well <pause dur="0.8"/> in # in glasshouses <pause dur="1.9"/> course you can also introduce <pause dur="0.6"/> diseases <pause dur="0.8"/> into <pause dur="0.9"/> pests <pause dur="1.3"/> # particularly virus diseases <pause dur="0.7"/> and this can also be <trunc>ef</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> effective <pause dur="2.6"/> and there's a thing called bacillo virus which is <pause dur="0.5"/> quite widely used commercially as a pesticide which contains a bacterial toxin <pause dur="0.9"/> which will <pause dur="0.7"/> kill off <pause dur="0.6"/> insect pests particularly <pause dur="0.2"/> caterpillars <pause dur="3.8"/> now <pause dur="0.2"/> another <pause dur="0.2"/> way which is quite a cunning way and this is a good example of where basic biological knowledge <pause dur="0.2"/> zoological knowledge is used <pause dur="0.5"/> in an applied sense <pause dur="0.7"/> and this is what's called <trunc>insa</trunc> insect sterilization <pause dur="0.7"/> and this has been quite effective in controlling a pest <pause dur="0.2"/> rather disgusting pest <pause dur="0.4"/> called the screw worm fly <pause dur="0.8"/> in America <pause dur="0.7"/> this fly lays its eggs on the back of a <pause dur="0.4"/> back of a cow <pause dur="0.6"/> and the larvae hatch out and then burrow through the skin of the cow and live in a sort of chamber underneath with a breathing

deformed <pause dur="0.5"/> you can see the upper part of the beak here is curled <pause dur="1.6"/> and here the eggs have become squashed by the female because the eggshells have become thin because of the interference with the calcium <pause dur="0.2"/> and metabolism by the D-D-T that was used in the area <pause dur="2.5"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> in the U-K <pause dur="0.6"/> # this is <pause dur="0.3"/> changes in the status of sparrow hawks in relation to agricultural land use <pause dur="0.9"/> this is a proportion of land which is farmed <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="1.0"/> intensively and you can see the black areas here in East Anglia particularly <pause dur="0.4"/> of very intensive farming <pause dur="0.7"/> and this is the # populations of sparrow hawks <pause dur="0.9"/> around the time when D-D-T was being used <pause dur="0.9"/> and you can see there's an almost mirror image here in the <pause dur="0.2"/> in the terms of the intensity of farming <pause dur="0.5"/> and the populations of sparrow hawks <pause dur="0.3"/> sparrow hawks manage to <pause dur="0.7"/> # persist <trunc>qu</trunc> in quite high populations in Wales and south-west England where the farming intensity is lowest <pause dur="0.9"/> but # during the maximum period of usage of D-D-T the sparrow hawks died out almost completely <pause dur="0.4"/> from East Anglia <pause dur="0.3"/>

pests <pause dur="0.8"/> # this is <pause dur="0.4"/> over in chemistry this is the where the manic mole used to # <vocal desc="laugh" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.7"/> do its stuff there's a big <pause dur="0.2"/> huge <trunc>ar</trunc> there's this big area of daffodils which are about to come out now <pause dur="0.7"/> but # <pause dur="0.2"/> every so often the mole manages to get across the road and then it <shift feature="voice" new="laugh"/> causes all these little # <shift feature="voice" new="normal"/><pause dur="0.4"/> little hummocks <pause dur="0.4"/> but again it's a <pause dur="0.3"/> the concept to the fact that the moles are a pest because they're in an area that # <pause dur="0.4"/> the ground staff don't want them to be so they <pause dur="0.3"/> they're defined as a pest <pause dur="0.6"/> whereas if they were a <trunc>t</trunc> colony of bats <pause dur="0.4"/> living in the <pause dur="0.3"/> top of the # Chemistry department up here then we wouldn't be able to do anything about it because they'd be legally <pause dur="0.4"/> protected even though they might be covering the floor in <pause dur="0.2"/> # bat droppings <pause dur="0.5"/><vocal desc="laugh" iterated="n"/><pause dur="2.4"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> okay here's some more pests this is a <pause dur="1.0"/> # an example where you can have a an animal which has a natural <pause dur="1.8"/> its natural food # is a plant which grows wild in the environment but # if it manages to cross that barrier and start eating other plants then it becomes a serious

okay # greenfly this is a <pause dur="1.6"/> <trunc>w</trunc> one of the main problems with aphids is that they can reproduce very rapidly and <pause dur="0.3"/> they can reproduce parthenogenetically <pause dur="0.5"/> which means that <pause dur="0.3"/> they don't have to have males <pause dur="0.5"/> the females can produce <pause dur="0.5"/> baby greenflies little baby greenfly here <pause dur="0.2"/> aren't they sweet </u><u who="sf0226" trans="latching"> mm </u><u who="nm0217" trans="latching"> <vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" dur="1"/> <pause dur="0.7"/> # without without mating with a male so they can increase their population <pause dur="0.3"/> density extremely rapidly <pause dur="1.4"/> # exponentially in fact # <pause dur="0.6"/> in under certain circumstances <pause dur="0.4"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> and of course if you spray the crops then you'll kill off <pause dur="0.5"/> the natural predators of <pause dur="0.5"/> of these things like two-spot and seven-spot ladybirds <pause dur="0.5"/> these here are munching their way through some <pause dur="0.5"/> # cherry aphids on a cherry # <pause dur="0.2"/> cherry tree in our <trunc>b</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> again in our back garden at home <pause dur="1.1"/> so they a ladybird can eat <pause dur="0.4"/> between fifty and eighty greenfly a day so they really are major # <pause dur="0.4"/> pests # <pause dur="0.2"/> major predators of pests <pause dur="2.4"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> here's another one this is a hoverfly larvae <pause dur="1.2"/> # sorry not a hoverfly larvae a lacewing larvae <pause dur="0.3"/> eating a eating a fly here and these again are major pests
