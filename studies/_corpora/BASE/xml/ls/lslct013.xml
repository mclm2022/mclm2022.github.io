<u who="nf0268"><kinesic desc="projector is on showing slide" iterated="n"/> okay are we ready to start <pause dur="3.1"/> okay so how can <pause dur="0.2"/> inequalities in health <pause dur="0.4"/> be tackled <pause dur="2.4"/> so in this session we're going to look at <pause dur="0.5"/> why tackle health inequalities <pause dur="0.2"/> why tackle these # <pause dur="1.0"/> unequal patterns of health that we've been looking at <pause dur="0.2"/> very carefully over the last few weeks <pause dur="1.6"/> so we're looking at why tackle them <pause dur="0.9"/> then we're going to start to look at what the evidence says <pause dur="1.0"/> about how health inequalities can be tackled <pause dur="3.1"/> and then we're going to # start to look at <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="1.2"/> later on this morning <pause dur="0.6"/> policies that are in place to tackle health inequalities <pause dur="1.1"/> and to start to think about how effective <pause dur="0.2"/> these policies are likely to be <pause dur="0.6"/> # to reduce health inequalities <pause dur="3.3"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> so <pause dur="0.2"/> just to remind you <pause dur="0.2"/> we've looked at <pause dur="0.3"/> the four main explanations for inequalities in health <pause dur="2.7"/> are they just an artefact of the way <pause dur="0.2"/> the stastistics statistics are collected <pause dur="0.6"/> are they due to social selection <pause dur="0.3"/> are they <pause dur="0.2"/> due to lifestyles and <pause dur="0.2"/> behaviour <pause dur="0.4"/> or are they due to material circumstances <pause dur="1.5"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> oops <pause dur="1.0"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> and that <pause dur="1.2"/> probably wasn't a clever way to do 
that <pause dur="1.8"/> and again <pause dur="0.2"/> <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> looked quite # thoroughly at the evidence that suggests <pause dur="0.2"/> that # <pause dur="1.7"/> the only explanation that can effectively <pause dur="0.3"/> explain <pause dur="1.1"/> inequalities in health <pause dur="0.3"/> is the fact that # <pause dur="0.5"/> is the explanation related to poor material circumstances <pause dur="1.9"/> culture and health behaviour on its own can only <trunc>es</trunc> explain about twenty to thirty per cent of the differences health differences between social groups <pause dur="3.8"/> but <pause dur="0.2"/> social and material circumstances # <pause dur="0.7"/> in particular low income <pause dur="0.4"/> # poor access to physical resources like housing <pause dur="0.4"/> and the psychosocial stress of <pause dur="0.2"/> # living with low income <pause dur="0.5"/> # affects people's health both physically <pause dur="0.3"/> and mentally <pause dur="0.3"/> and shapes people's health behaviour <pause dur="0.4"/> and we looked at how people's health behaviour <pause dur="0.3"/> was <trunc>sh</trunc> # in in <trunc>re</trunc> how <pause dur="0.3"/> was shaped by <pause dur="0.3"/> in the area of # access to food and eating <trunc>beha</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> behaviour <pause dur="0.4"/> and in relation to cigarette smoking so we looked at that last time we were in <pause dur="5.1"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> okay so <pause dur="1.3"/> why <pause dur="0.3"/> should <pause dur="0.3"/> health inequalities be a concern <pause dur="0.5"/> of doctors really why are we 
teaching you this why <pause dur="0.4"/> why is it considered important # that you study this <pause dur="0.4"/> # other than the fact that <pause dur="0.2"/> the General Medical Council said says that it's part of your curriculum <pause dur="0.4"/> there are a number of reasons why # you need to <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="1.2"/> understand and be aware of how health inequalities can be tackled <pause dur="0.8"/> i mean first of all because they have a profound effect on people's lives and have a profound effect <pause dur="0.3"/> on the lives of the patients that you're going to be dealing with on a daily basis <pause dur="0.6"/> and as Frank Dobson said in nineteen-ninety-seven <pause dur="0.4"/> <reading>inequality in health is the worst inequality of all <pause dur="0.8"/> there is no more serious inequality <pause dur="0.3"/> than knowing that you'll die sooner because you're badly off</reading> <pause dur="1.0"/> and i think that sums up very clearly <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> why <pause dur="0.5"/> we should concern ourselves with this issue <pause dur="1.5"/> so <pause dur="0.8"/> inequalities in health are really <pause dur="0.2"/> an issue of of natural justice <pause dur="2.5"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> so continuing that <pause dur="0.4"/> why else might we need to # <pause dur="0.6"/> think about reducing health 
inequalities <pause dur="0.5"/> well first of all we need <pause dur="0.2"/> to <pause dur="0.2"/> to do so because # health inequalities have substantial costs attached to them <pause dur="0.8"/> and by reducing them we'd be reducing the costs <pause dur="0.3"/> associated with premature deaths and illness <pause dur="0.4"/> both to individual patients <pause dur="1.1"/> and to the state <pause dur="1.3"/> so the cost to the state of # <pause dur="0.2"/> caring for people # <pause dur="0.3"/> # who are experiencing the health effects <pause dur="0.4"/> of <pause dur="0.3"/> health inequalities is substantial <pause dur="5.4"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> another reason is that because <pause dur="0.2"/> if we don't take account of or you don't take account of health inequalities <pause dur="0.5"/> in your medical practice <pause dur="0.3"/> then your practice # can confound the effects <pause dur="0.3"/> can worsen if you like <pause dur="0.2"/> or make more complex the effects of <pause dur="0.4"/> # poor <sic corr="material">masiterial</sic> circumstances on people's health and again we'll be looking at that issue <pause dur="0.3"/> this afternoon <pause dur="2.5"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> and lastly <pause dur="0.9"/> we need to concern ourselves with <trunc>ine</trunc> inequalities actually 'cause the government says that you must <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> health inequalities is a key theme <pause dur="0.3"/> in the government's health and social policy <pause dur="0.4"/> and the government has 
put in place a number of policies which we're going to look at # <pause dur="0.6"/> # in a minute <pause dur="0.3"/> that have <pause dur="0.4"/> that influence medical practice on a day to day basis <pause dur="0.4"/> so you will be seeing <pause dur="0.2"/> when you're out in in hospitals and in the community <pause dur="0.4"/> # how medical practice is being shaped by <pause dur="0.4"/> # initiatives from the government <pause dur="3.8"/> so what i'm going to turn to now is to look at <pause dur="1.3"/> what does the evidence say on how <pause dur="0.2"/> health inequalities can be most effectively <pause dur="0.2"/> tackled <pause dur="1.7"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> so the main evidence that we can draw on are <pause dur="0.2"/> evidence from a number of reports which took # <pause dur="0.4"/> which reviewed all the evidence on health inequalities and <pause dur="0.4"/> # put forward ways in which they thought health inequalities can be most effectively tackled <pause dur="1.4"/> the Black Report # <pause dur="0.5"/> you heard <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> refer to <pause dur="0.6"/> # those of you that came to <gap reason="name" extent="2 words"/>'s lecture <pause dur="0.8"/> will # remember that <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> <pause dur="0.3"/> talked about the Black Report and the fact that <pause dur="0.3"/> it was commissioned by the outgoing # Labour government in the late seventies <pause dur="0.4"/> but reported to <pause dur="0.4"/> the incoming Conservative 
government in nineteen-eighty <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="1.3"/> and # the report those of you who'll remember <pause dur="0.2"/> Nick talking about how the report <pause dur="0.4"/> really was wasn't circulated widely there was only about two-hundred copies of the report <pause dur="0.3"/> actually distributed <pause dur="0.3"/> because of the fact it was considered to be quite radical <pause dur="0.5"/> # and that it wasn't in the government's interest to to circulate the report <pause dur="0.4"/> but as things happen once you try to # <pause dur="0.3"/> squash the circulation of something it has a life of its own and in fact was published as a Penguin book and was <pause dur="0.5"/> and the <trunc>re</trunc> the findings were very widely publicized <pause dur="1.2"/> but <pause dur="0.2"/> Douglas Black # and colleagues # concluded that <reading>while <pause dur="0.2"/> the health care service can <trunc>pl</trunc> can play a significant part in reducing inequalities in health <pause dur="0.6"/> measures to reduce differences in material standards of living <pause dur="0.2"/> at work and in the home <pause dur="0.5"/> and in everyday social and community life <pause dur="0.3"/> are of even greater importance</reading> so the Black Report was concluding <pause dur="0.3"/> that we need <pause dur="0.2"/> to # <pause dur="0.4"/> give people better access to <pause dur="0.3"/> # a a a better <pause dur="0.2"/> 
standard of living at home and at work and in everyday life <pause dur="1.7"/> the same conclusions were # <pause dur="2.1"/> came to in a a report that was published in the nineteen-eighties which was <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> commissioned by the Health Education Authority called The Health Divide <pause dur="4.0"/> neither the <pause dur="0.4"/> findings from the Black Report or The Health Divide were # <pause dur="0.6"/> put into action <pause dur="1.0"/> so during # the nineteen-eighties we continued with # # a set of health policies <pause dur="0.4"/> that were concerned with really <pause dur="0.2"/> changing individual behaviour <pause dur="0.4"/> rather than # <trunc>aim</trunc> <pause dur="0.4"/> aiming at reducing health inequalities between groups <pause dur="2.4"/> in <pause dur="0.2"/> the nineteen-seventies or the late i'm sorry nineteen-nineties # <pause dur="0.3"/> with a new government came to power <pause dur="0.4"/> # the <pause dur="0.2"/> the government was it came into power commissioned a <trunc>re</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> a an independent <trunc>inq</trunc> <trunc>i</trunc> inquiry <pause dur="0.5"/> into that should say into inequalities in health <pause dur="0.5"/> which was published # <trunc>b</trunc> in nineteen-ninety-eight <pause dur="0.5"/> and this report was <pause dur="0.2"/> chaired by Sir Donald Acheson <pause dur="0.6"/> who # <pause dur="2.9"/> <trunc>w</trunc> was <pause dur="0.2"/> before # <pause dur="0.5"/> this period had been <pause dur="0.3"/> during the i think late 
eighties and nineties <pause dur="0.3"/> the Chief Medical Officer for Health at the Department <pause dur="0.5"/> at the Department of Health <pause dur="0.8"/> # and he <pause dur="0.2"/> also <pause dur="0.2"/> prior to that was the dean of # <pause dur="0.3"/> the medical school at Southampton <pause dur="1.4"/> and in fact we were very lucky 'cause our guest lecture <pause dur="0.4"/> lecturer here on the last day of the module last year was actually Sir Donald Acheson who came to talk about the independent inquiry <pause dur="2.3"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> so <pause dur="0.5"/> the independent inquiry into inequalities in health was <pause dur="0.2"/> # commissioned <pause dur="0.5"/> by the Labour government and reported in nineteen-ninety-eight <pause dur="0.5"/> its remit was to review and summarize the evidence on inequalities in health in England <pause dur="0.3"/> to identify priority areas <pause dur="0.3"/> for the development of policy <pause dur="3.2"/> but <pause dur="0.4"/> it was limited to making recommendations that fell within the government's overall financial strategy <pause dur="1.4"/> so this report <pause dur="0.3"/> this # <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> inquiry reviewed and took evidence from <pause dur="0.4"/> # a huge number of people and reviewed # all the <trunc>re</trunc> # the research studies within this area <pause dur="1.6"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> # it drew the 
same conclusions as the Black Report and The Health Divide <pause dur="0.6"/> and the report when it was published <pause dur="0.3"/> was accepted by government with # some government action in key areas and that's what we're going to look at this morning <pause dur="2.1"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> okay so it's if we think about what its conclusions and recommendations were <pause dur="0.7"/> # these were that firstly <reading>inequalities in health reflect <pause dur="0.4"/> differential exposure across the life course <pause dur="0.2"/> to the risks associated with socio-economic <trunc>permit</trunc> # position</reading> <pause dur="1.8"/> and it recommended <pause dur="0.6"/> firstly a need to intervene on a broad front <pause dur="2.1"/> it recommended the <trunc>n</trunc> # that it was important that poverty and income inequality were reduced <pause dur="3.0"/> it said that people's # people in poor <pause dur="0.3"/> social and material <trunc>ne</trunc> and <pause dur="0.6"/> <sic corr="circumstances">circumstanceses</sic> needed to have their material needs met <pause dur="1.7"/> it said that parents and children should be given priority <pause dur="1.7"/> and also that provision of equitable access to effective health care # <pause dur="0.3"/> # was important <pause dur="0.2"/> so i'm just going to talk about # some of these 
individually now <pause dur="1.2"/> so let's take the first recommendation which was the need to intervene on a broad front <pause dur="7.2"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> by this it <pause dur="0.4"/> meant <pause dur="0.2"/> that health inequalities need to be tackled at a number of levels <pause dur="1.1"/> that it's less effective <pause dur="0.6"/> to focus <trunc>s</trunc> <pause dur="1.5"/> purely on any one point <pause dur="1.9"/> that we need upstream and downstream approaches to tackling health inequalities <pause dur="0.9"/> we need upstream approaches which deal with the wider influences on health such as income <pause dur="0.4"/> benefits <pause dur="0.4"/> employment education housing childcare <pause dur="4.0"/> <trunc>a</trunc> and that we need these as well as approaches and this is the approach that's <pause dur="0.3"/> predominated in the past <pause dur="0.5"/> as well as the the <pause dur="0.2"/> the approach that only deals with the downstream aspects of health <pause dur="0.3"/> such <pause dur="0.2"/> aspects of health behaviour <pause dur="0.4"/> such as lifestyles <pause dur="0.7"/> smoking diet et cetera <pause dur="0.9"/> so we need to look upstream to find out why people are falling into the river <pause dur="0.4"/> as well as downstream approaches that pulls them out <pause dur="0.3"/> # and rescues them and gives them mouth to mouth <trunc>re</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.8"/> mouth to mouth as the we pull them out of the 
river <pause dur="0.5"/> so we need to look at why people <pause dur="0.4"/> are falling into the river that's what's meant by upstream approaches <pause dur="2.4"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> so what it means then is that we need to concentrate on <pause dur="0.7"/> different <pause dur="0.5"/> aspects # and different <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> influences on health <pause dur="0.2"/> that it's no point these are the downstream approaches here <pause dur="1.1"/><kinesic desc="indicates point on slide" iterated="n"/> that it's <pause dur="0.6"/> we won't reduce health inequalities by just trying to change aspects of individual lifestyle and health <pause dur="0.2"/> and health behaviour <pause dur="0.9"/> that we need to start to make changes and have policies that change the socio-economic the cultural <pause dur="0.5"/> # environmental and material conditions that affect people in their everyday lives and are clearly the main influence <pause dur="0.2"/> and main determinant <pause dur="0.3"/> of how long people live <pause dur="0.3"/> and of people's health experience <pause dur="2.9"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> okay the second recommendation <pause dur="0.3"/> was # reducing poverty <pause dur="0.5"/> and this # <pause dur="0.2"/> is # this was highlighted very clearly in the Acheson Report <pause dur="0.3"/> that we were not going to # we're not going to reduce <trunc>h</trunc> health inequalities <pause dur="0.4"/> unless we reduce poverty <pause dur="4.6"/> okay <pause dur="5.6"/> it drew attention 
to the need to reduce poverty in the U-K <pause dur="0.4"/> because there has been a significant rise in the proportion of people <pause dur="0.5"/> # who live in poverty in the U-K <pause dur="1.1"/> and the way that we <pause dur="0.2"/> measure poverty in the U-K <pause dur="0.4"/> # or the main way that we look at poverty <pause dur="0.4"/> # and i'll <trunc>tr</trunc> <pause dur="0.3"/> <trunc>t</trunc> <pause dur="0.5"/> draw a line between those if you like who # can be said to be living in poverty and those who are better off <pause dur="0.4"/> is by looking at the proportion <pause dur="0.2"/> of households <pause dur="0.5"/> or <trunc>th</trunc> or the proportion of individuals <pause dur="0.4"/> who have incomes <pause dur="0.2"/> which are below fifty per cent of average income <pause dur="1.1"/> and you can see here from these figures in nineteen-seventy-nine we had about <pause dur="0.4"/> nine per cent of the population <pause dur="0.4"/> who had incomes that were less than fifty per cent of average income and that was about four-point-four-million <pause dur="0.8"/> i'm <trunc>us</trunc> i'm going back to nineteen-seventy-nine because that's when # the figures are available from this it's from that date that this <pause dur="0.3"/> these kinds of figures were collected <pause dur="1.2"/> but we can see <pause dur="0.7"/> by two-thousand two-thousand-and-one 
we've had a substantial <pause dur="0.5"/> rise in the proportion of people <pause dur="0.4"/> who have incomes <pause dur="0.2"/> of fifty per cent <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.9"/> of less than fifty per cent of average income <pause dur="0.3"/> so the latest figure <trunc>m</trunc> figures we have from the government suggest that <pause dur="0.5"/> virtually a quarter of the population <pause dur="0.4"/> # live in poverty </u><gap reason="break in recording" extent="uncertain"/> <u who="nf0268" trans="pause"><kinesic desc="projector is on showing slide" iterated="n"/> we look at poverty in the U-K the figures that i've just shown you the national figures if you like <pause dur="0.6"/> hide the distribution of poverty between social groups <pause dur="0.5"/> # because different groups are at different degrees at risk of being in poverty poverty <pause dur="0.4"/> like health is not equally distributed <pause dur="0.4"/> between the population <pause dur="3.4"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> households with # people with disabilities are much more likely than other households to have low income <pause dur="1.3"/> # we also know that black and minority ethnic households <pause dur="0.2"/> are more likely to have incomes less than fifty per cent of average income <pause dur="0.3"/> than white households <pause dur="1.2"/> # and these are figures again from # the latest set of statistics on households below 
average income <pause dur="0.2"/> which are published by # the government <pause dur="0.3"/> and you can see <pause dur="0.2"/> that households that # where the head identifies # <pause dur="0.2"/> him or herself as as white <pause dur="0.3"/> # <trunc>a</trunc> <pause dur="0.7"/> about twenty-two per cent of those households <pause dur="0.3"/> have incomes less than fifty per cent <pause dur="0.2"/> of # average income <pause dur="0.5"/> but you can see when we look at # particular <pause dur="0.3"/> # ethnic minority groups <pause dur="0.3"/> # we can see how the proportions # for these groups are significantly higher <pause dur="0.3"/> than for those households that classify themselves identify themselves as as as <pause dur="0.3"/> as white <pause dur="0.2"/> and you can see that for some groups <pause dur="0.3"/> # the proportions with of <pause dur="0.3"/> households <pause dur="0.7"/> of <pause dur="0.2"/> with incomes of less than fifty per cent is very very high so if you look at the figure for example <pause dur="0.6"/> for black non-Caribbean households <pause dur="0.3"/> where it's half of all households have poverty level incomes <pause dur="0.7"/> and you look at Pakistani and Bangladeshi households <pause dur="0.3"/> # where sixty-nine per cent of those households have <pause dur="0.2"/> # what can be <trunc>ident</trunc> classified as # <pause dur="0.2"/> as living in poverty or having a poverty level income <pause dur="0.2"/> of 
less than fifty per cent of average income <pause dur="1.6"/> so some of those groups # are <pause dur="0.2"/> living with very very <pause dur="0.3"/> high levels of poverty <pause dur="2.4"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> if we look at # poverty levels by different kinds of family <pause dur="0.8"/> type <pause dur="0.5"/> you can also see <pause dur="0.2"/> that the type of <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="1.0"/> household that you are also increases your risk of being at poverty <pause dur="0.2"/> being in poverty and you can see <pause dur="0.4"/> that the group # <vocal desc="cough" iterated="n"/><pause dur="1.4"/> the largest group in poverty consists of <pause dur="0.6"/> # households with children so for example <pause dur="1.0"/> this is <pause dur="0.2"/> all people are in poverty you can see that <pause dur="0.3"/> over fifty per cent of all people in <trunc>povert</trunc> households in poverty is made up of <pause dur="0.4"/> # households with children <pause dur="0.3"/> so that's households where there's # <pause dur="0.4"/> two adults and children <pause dur="0.3"/> and also households where there are <pause dur="0.3"/> # a single adult with children so we've got about fifty-four per cent of households <pause dur="1.9"/> you can also see from this <pause dur="0.2"/> that <pause dur="0.3"/> # even <pause dur="0.2"/> though # <pause dur="0.5"/> for example when you look at pensioner households or pensioner couples households <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> they only constitute nine per cent <pause dur="0.5"/> of the total number of people the total # 
number of people in poverty <pause dur="0.3"/> but if you look at the the proportion <pause dur="0.3"/> of pensioner households who are in poverty <pause dur="0.3"/> then a quarter <pause dur="0.4"/> of all pensioner households have poverty level incomes <pause dur="5.3"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/><vocal desc="cough" iterated="n"/> okay so a key recommendation <pause dur="0.2"/> # and a key way to reduce health inequalities <pause dur="0.2"/> is to reduce poverty <pause dur="3.4"/> the Acheson Report also recommended very clearly that <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> policies should be aimed at <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> tackling and improving the health <pause dur="0.2"/> tackling health inequalities <pause dur="0.3"/> and improving the health of parents with children <pause dur="0.8"/> and this is because health inequalities in adult life are set in part in utero <pause dur="0.2"/> and in the first years of life <pause dur="0.5"/> and i think we've heard <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> talk about that and <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> Nick Spencer <pause dur="0.3"/> when he's talking about life course epidemiology <pause dur="0.2"/> documenting very clearly <pause dur="0.3"/> how # <pause dur="0.3"/> health inequalities and # poor <pause dur="0.3"/> poor health in adult life <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.8"/> is related to # <pause dur="0.6"/> things like low birth weight health in utero and in very very early life <pause dur="2.6"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> the government committed itself to eradicating child poverty in twenty years and 
halving it in ten <pause dur="0.2"/> it took seriously its recommendation to to <pause dur="0.3"/> # prioritize the parents and children and we'll see that later when we look <trunc>s</trunc> more specifically <pause dur="0.5"/> at # some of the policies that the government's put into place <pause dur="1.0"/> # and this is because # that households with children as we've just seen are the largest single group in poverty <pause dur="1.0"/> about a third of all children are living in households with incomes less than than fifty per cent of average income which is really quite high a third of all <pause dur="0.3"/> the country's children <pause dur="0.2"/> have poverty level incomes and also <pause dur="0.3"/> it's important because <pause dur="0.2"/> child poverty rates # in Britain have increased faster <pause dur="0.2"/> than those in other comparable countries <pause dur="4.8"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> so <pause dur="1.1"/> if <pause dur="0.3"/> if we're looking at <pause dur="0.7"/> this <pause dur="0.6"/> we need to tackle on a broad front to reduce poverty <pause dur="0.3"/> and to reduce <trunc>mater</trunc> # and to improve people's material conditions <pause dur="0.4"/> and improve <trunc>me</trunc> people's material conditions by <pause dur="0.3"/> giving them access to # <pause dur="0.4"/> incomes which enable them to # have access to the sorts of lifestyles <pause dur="0.2"/> and the material 
circumstances that they need for good health <pause dur="0.2"/> like access to healthy housing and healthy environments <pause dur="3.2"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> there are two <pause dur="1.7"/> main ways that you can reduce poverty and improve people's <trunc>li</trunc> living standard <pause dur="1.8"/> and these are <pause dur="0.2"/> through # <pause dur="1.7"/> initiatives and policies that improve <pause dur="0.5"/> people's access to income in kind <pause dur="1.4"/> and policies that improve access to income in cash <pause dur="0.5"/> so by income in kind i mean # <pause dur="1.5"/> not providing people with money in their hand but providing them with access <pause dur="0.2"/> to <pause dur="0.3"/> to <pause dur="0.4"/> income in kind if you like through services that have no cost attached to them <pause dur="0.7"/> so the N-H-S <pause dur="1.4"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> indirect taxes like V-A-T <pause dur="2.5"/> # education local government services <pause dur="3.2"/> as well as providing or improving <pause dur="0.6"/> access to income in cash through <pause dur="0.2"/> employment policies wage policies <pause dur="0.3"/> through regeneration programmes which i'm going to talk about in a minute <pause dur="0.4"/> and to # by improving <pause dur="0.3"/> income in cash through things like # <pause dur="0.4"/> increases in benefits and pensions <pause dur="1.4"/> just to show you why # <pause dur="0.4"/> access to <pause dur="0.4"/> income in kind is important <pause dur="1.4"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> if we look at 
this slide <pause dur="0.2"/> you can see that # <pause dur="1.3"/> this is an analysis <pause dur="0.2"/> by Shaw et al # and it's actually published in <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> the book The Widening Gap so those of you that have done the reading to prepare for today's session <pause dur="0.4"/> may well have looked at this # slide because the data's in the book this is a summary of the data that you see published in the book <pause dur="1.5"/> what they show here <pause dur="0.8"/> is the amount of income <pause dur="0.5"/> that # the poorest ten per cent of households <pause dur="0.3"/> as well as the richest ten per cent of households <pause dur="0.3"/> get from things like wages <pause dur="0.7"/> from cash benefits <pause dur="1.2"/> and also from benefits in kind <pause dur="0.3"/> and what it shows is that to those who are very poor <pause dur="0.5"/> and have poverty level incomes <pause dur="1.4"/> that benefits in kind <pause dur="0.5"/> make a substantial <pause dur="1.1"/> contribution <pause dur="0.4"/> to the overall incomes of <trunc>o</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> although it's not real money <pause dur="0.3"/> # but it was real money this is what it would <pause dur="0.4"/> contribute but it does make more of a <pause dur="0.2"/> has more benefit for those who are in the poorest ten per cent of households <pause dur="1.2"/> so if they didn't have that <pause dur="0.2"/> if you didn't have access to <pause dur="0.6"/> benefits in kind <pause dur="0.7"/> then this group of households would be substantially poorer <pause dur="0.8"/> so for example if we 
had # a health care system that wasn't free at the point of access <pause dur="1.7"/> # if we didn't have free education <pause dur="1.7"/> if <trunc>post-ta</trunc> <pause dur="0.5"/> tax income was structured differently <pause dur="0.3"/> or <trunc>indir</trunc> indirect <pause dur="0.3"/> taxes like # V-A-T <pause dur="0.2"/> were structured differently <pause dur="0.4"/> then this group <pause dur="0.4"/> would be <pause dur="0.2"/> much much worse off than they are now <pause dur="0.5"/> so that's why it's important that <pause dur="1.8"/> services like the N-H-S <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> are do remain free at access and are delivered in ways that are responsive to the needs of those who are the poorest <pause dur="0.8"/><vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.9"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> just before we finish <trunc>thi</trunc> think it's important <pause dur="0.2"/> to acknowledge that <pause dur="0.5"/> while the independent inquiry said very clearly about how we need to tackle health inequalities and the government has taken <pause dur="0.2"/> some of that on on board <pause dur="0.4"/> the <trunc>inde</trunc> the the independent inquiry can be criticized for a number of reasons <pause dur="0.4"/> # and it's # been criticized partly because <pause dur="0.2"/> it didn't adequately prioritize <pause dur="0.3"/> # its thirty-nine recommendations it made a huge number of recommendations <pause dur="0.3"/> and things like poverty <pause dur="0.2"/> # were easily lost in a sea of other recommendations <pause dur="0.5"/> many of the recommendations were too vague <pause dur="0.5"/> and the recommendations were not costed
