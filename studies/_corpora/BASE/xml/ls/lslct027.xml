<u who="nf0369"><kinesic desc="projector is on showing slide" iterated="n"/> right <pause dur="0.7"/> okay <pause dur="1.1"/> if we can settle down we need to <pause dur="0.3"/> dash on to the next one <pause dur="12.0"/> now again some of this is going to be <pause dur="0.3"/> revision for you <pause dur="0.8"/> because # we touched upon it briefly in musculoskeletal <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> that was last semester i think wasn't it <pause dur="0.8"/> and <pause dur="0.3"/> it comes up again in clinical pharmacology when we look at bone diseases <pause dur="1.6"/> so it's partly revision but we're looking at it from a different aspect today <pause dur="0.6"/> so i just want to have a look at what <pause dur="0.4"/> what's normal <pause dur="0.6"/> a very quick review of calcium homeostasis <pause dur="1.3"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> # look at the tissues that are involved but obviously particularly the kidney the kidney's what we're really talking about today so although there's a multitude of tissues involved in calcium homeostasis <pause dur="0.5"/> the kidney's the one i'm concentrating on <pause dur="0.9"/> and then have a quick look at vitamin D deficiency <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="1.0"/> because that's really important when we're considering renal disease <pause dur="1.8"/> so if we look at the physiological roles of <pause dur="0.2"/> calcium <pause dur="0.7"/> we went over this last semester <pause dur="0.5"/> and in that time we were particularly talking 
about <pause dur="0.2"/> bones <pause dur="0.5"/> and we're going to be <trunc>tic</trunc> particularly talking about bones in clinical pharmacology <pause dur="2.2"/> that obviously is a long term effect <pause dur="0.3"/> calcium homeostasis <pause dur="0.3"/> gone wrong <pause dur="0.6"/> will affect bones but it has a longer term <pause dur="0.5"/> # effect it's not going to happen overnight <pause dur="0.5"/> although you can see changes within a fortnight but <trunc>i</trunc> it's a long process more chronic <pause dur="0.8"/> whereas these functions that i've listed here <pause dur="0.5"/> are much more rapid and acute <pause dur="0.6"/> # in terms of the functions of the calcium <pause dur="0.4"/> obviously if you have changes in your nerve function and nerve signalling <pause dur="0.5"/> # or muscle contraction <pause dur="0.4"/> that'll happen rapidly <pause dur="0.5"/> so there are sort of kind of acute and chronic <pause dur="0.2"/> consequences of calcium homeostasis being messed up <pause dur="0.8"/> and this one i've just put here just to remind you <pause dur="0.4"/> # that one of the roles of calcium is in # blood clotting <pause dur="0.4"/> so if you've all your blood tubes or a lot of them have # E-D-T-A in that's simply to collate the calcium and stop the blood that you've taken clotting so that's why E-D-T-A's <pause dur="0.5"/> in blood tubes <pause dur="0.8"/> but 
the really important thing is that the levels need to be very tightly regulated <pause dur="0.5"/> in order to ensure that all these kind of acute problems don't happen <pause dur="0.4"/> and then longer term the chronic bone problems you need to regulate your calcium levels that are circulating quite closely <pause dur="1.6"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> so this is a slide you've had this one before <pause dur="0.4"/> but just to remind you <pause dur="0.3"/> these are the plasma concentrations <pause dur="0.4"/> and this is the normal range <kinesic desc="indicates point on slide" iterated="n"/> here or roughly <pause dur="0.7"/> now these numbers that i've put up and the numbers that i've put up on a lot of my slides <pause dur="0.3"/> depending on the book you look at they will vary very slightly <pause dur="0.9"/> i've got forty-five per cent ionized here and fifty-five per cent bound <pause dur="0.4"/> what i tend to do in my numbers is trying to match <pause dur="0.3"/> what the <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> students get <pause dur="0.3"/> but you will find books that'll give you anywhere between forty and fifty here # and alter this accordingly <pause dur="0.6"/> it doesn't matter too much again it's roughly fifty-fifty <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> but i'll give you the numbers as <pause dur="0.2"/> best i can as # to match <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/>'s but 
just bear in mind <trunc>thes</trunc> they're not absolute values <pause dur="0.4"/> so <kinesic desc="indicates point on slide" iterated="n"/> this is your normal plasma concentration <pause dur="0.4"/> that's the range and it's split like this <pause dur="0.4"/> and this is important because it's only the ionized calcium <pause dur="0.3"/> that actually has an effect <pause dur="0.4"/> what you're really interested in is the amount of ionized calcium that's free in the blood <pause dur="0.4"/> or in the plasma <pause dur="0.6"/> not the calcium that is bound <pause dur="0.6"/> although that has a role to play obviously it's a storage component <pause dur="0.5"/> and the flux between bound and <pause dur="0.3"/> and free is really important <pause dur="0.4"/> and there are issues there <pause dur="0.5"/> in terms of physical function it's the ionized calcium that has a role <pause dur="1.4"/> but in terms of the kidney it's important to note this is further subdivided you've got some of it bound to plasma proteins <pause dur="0.3"/> and this is predominantly albumin <pause dur="0.3"/> and you'll see that's important in a minute <pause dur="0.6"/> # but some of it's ions so anions you've got bicarb and phosphate and citrate <pause dur="1.3"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> and that's important because these get into the kidney <pause dur="0.8"/> but # <pause dur="1.2"/> forty-five per cent is bound to 
proteins and can't be filtered <pause dur="0.9"/> and this is what we need again figures i've given you already you need a gram if you're a normal person <pause dur="0.6"/> if you're pregnant or lactating you need a bit more because obviously you're building up the bones in the child and you need to make milk so you need more calcium <pause dur="0.5"/> and if you're old you need more <pause dur="0.4"/> and you need more if you're old because you can't absorb it from your gut <pause dur="0.3"/> as efficiently <pause dur="0.7"/> so although you're taking in more as an elderly person your absorption from the gut <pause dur="0.3"/> is decreased so your actual # <pause dur="0.6"/> levels usually they're they're deficient elderly people in calcium from what we would normally <pause dur="0.3"/> count as normal levels <pause dur="2.3"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> so if we look at plasma concentrations or plasma calcium <pause dur="0.4"/> that's what i've told you <pause dur="0.5"/> that's what we're really interested in regulating is the free calcium <pause dur="1.2"/> when you send blood off to a lab <pause dur="0.4"/> it'll send it back as a total calcium concentration you'll get <pause dur="0.4"/> two-point-four or two-point-five or whatever it back as as 
a number <pause dur="0.5"/> and that's your total calcium concentration <pause dur="0.5"/> and what they've done is they've corrected for albumin <pause dur="0.6"/> now okay don't get tied up this is exactly what happens <pause dur="0.5"/> # the calculation that's used but you can see they measure the the blood albumin <pause dur="0.3"/> as well as the blood calcium <pause dur="0.9"/> now this is taken something that any of you going into renal <pause dur="0.2"/> fields will find out about there's a renal registry <pause dur="0.5"/> renal medicine's quite tightly controlled in Britain <pause dur="0.4"/> and # they produce a renal registry which outlines # <pause dur="0.3"/> treatment standards how quickly you should be seen if you've got various conditions <pause dur="0.4"/> what your <pause dur="0.3"/> concentrations of various things should be et cetera it's standardized throughout the country <pause dur="0.4"/> and they also list things like <pause dur="0.3"/> how the measurements are done in different hospitals because calcium and albumin are measured differently <pause dur="0.4"/> depending on which hospital you're working in so there's different there's about three or four assays for them <pause dur="0.5"/> different hospitals use different ones <pause dur="0.6"/> and as 
a consequence <pause dur="0.3"/><kinesic desc="indicates point on slide" iterated="n"/> this correction equation <pause dur="0.3"/> will vary between hospitals <pause dur="0.5"/> now this is kind of like the U-K standard in the renal registry <pause dur="0.5"/> if you measure the calcium the way they suggest and the albumin the way they suggest <pause dur="0.3"/> then this is the equation they would use <pause dur="0.5"/> however the Walsgrave <pause dur="0.4"/> just uses a completely different formula it's slightly more complicated so if you see the correction from the Walsgrave from labs <pause dur="0.3"/> and it's different to this <pause dur="0.3"/> this is why <pause dur="0.4"/> but you don't need to know it all you need to know is that you're getting back the total calcium <pause dur="0.6"/> and that's important because it can skew your results <pause dur="1.0"/> you normally know <pause dur="0.3"/> if it's a total calcium and they've corrected for albumin <pause dur="0.3"/> in a normal person that's fine <pause dur="0.4"/> # it's going to be split in a forty-five fifty-five proportions so you know roughly what your free albumin is <pause dur="0.4"/> # free calcium whether normal or not <pause dur="0.8"/> if somebody has a disease or a condition where their albumin levels <pause dur="0.3"/> are grossly abnormal <pause dur="0.4"/> that may skew the results <pause dur="0.4"/> so for 
example if somebody has a very low albumin <pause dur="0.4"/> it may come back # <pause dur="0.4"/> the total may be <pause dur="0.2"/> normal <pause dur="0.4"/> but actually the amount you've got bound because your albumin's low <pause dur="0.4"/> is low so your free calcium could be significantly higher than you would <pause dur="0.3"/> normally expect <pause dur="0.5"/> so this happens with a couple of # <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> substances that you <pause dur="0.2"/> do lab measurements on <pause dur="0.3"/> so just bear in mind your total calcium <pause dur="0.4"/> may not a normal total calcium may not reflect a normal <pause dur="0.4"/> total # free calcium and sometimes you have to bear that in mind <pause dur="1.3"/> i've put here can we measure free <pause dur="0.2"/> we said you were interested in free why don't we measure free <pause dur="0.7"/> it's more difficult is the simple answer <pause dur="0.6"/> the assays are more variable between places and people are <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> seem to be very divided over this as to whether it actually gives you any great benefit in the average person <pause dur="0.3"/> if you think there's a reason why you need free particularly for that patient you might want to request it <pause dur="0.3"/> but on the whole <pause dur="0.3"/> people think for the time money and the variability it 
doesn't seem to be worth <pause dur="0.5"/> # it doesn't give you a significantly better result <pause dur="1.1"/> and i've just put this here <pause dur="0.6"/> this is very low remember most of the calcium <pause dur="0.2"/> isn't within a cell <pause dur="0.2"/> and the calcium that is in a cell <pause dur="0.3"/> is complexed to calmodulin and you must keep it very low <pause dur="0.5"/> so # <pause dur="0.3"/> that's just something to bear in mind that calcium normally is not in cells at all <pause dur="1.0"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> so what happens when it goes wrong <pause dur="1.4"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> obviously you can have too much or too little <pause dur="0.6"/> so <pause dur="0.2"/> if we look at hypocalcaemia first <pause dur="0.7"/> generally <pause dur="0.3"/> and this is a big generalization this tends to be the more serious condition because it tends to be more acute <pause dur="0.6"/> and that's a big they're they're generalizations <pause dur="0.4"/> but you'll see from the hypercalcaemia slide <pause dur="0.7"/> on the whole it has more chronic # less severe effects <pause dur="0.9"/> if you haven't got enough calcium <pause dur="0.4"/> it really affects your nerves and # your signalling <pause dur="0.3"/> and the muscle function and you get # muscle cramps and tetany <pause dur="0.7"/> and long term seizures <pause dur="0.4"/> and most of you will be aware of tetany but it's quite <pause dur="0.3"/> clear to see 
here in a wrist you see it in other # <pause dur="0.9"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> tissues but the the wrist and the hand are quite normal and that's the # form that it takes basically <pause dur="0.3"/> you're unable your muscles are # contracted and you're unable to <pause dur="0.8"/> uncontract <shift feature="voice" new="laugh"/>them <pause dur="0.2"/> for want of a better word <pause dur="0.5"/> <shift feature="voice" new="normal"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> and that's a symptom of low calcium <pause dur="0.5"/> but this is what's important <pause dur="0.4"/> you get cardiac arrhythmias <pause dur="0.8"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> and then if we look at hypercalcaemia <pause dur="0.2"/> in the contrast <pause dur="0.6"/> this tends to i said it tends to be slight and variable <pause dur="0.6"/> a lot of cases of hypercalcaemia are picked up on routine blood scans <pause dur="0.2"/> # tests <pause dur="0.4"/> so normally it sort of often occurs middle-aged women they go for a Well <trunc>wom</trunc> Well Women Clinic or Well Woman Clinic <pause dur="0.5"/> have a blood sample they measure calcium and find their calcium's quite high <pause dur="0.2"/> it is a consequence the symptoms <pause dur="0.2"/> obviously # are quite minor so <pause dur="0.4"/> you've got a <trunc>ole</trunc> whole range of G-I kind of problems <pause dur="0.4"/> they can be a bit depressed tired confused <pause dur="0.4"/> but as this is normally a # disease of middle-aged women <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> because they 
often have a parathyroid hormone tumour which we'll see about in a bit <pause dur="0.5"/> these sort of symptoms are very similar to menopause type symptoms so you wouldn't really <pause dur="0.3"/> # pick up on them <pause dur="0.4"/> muscle weakness <pause dur="0.6"/> this is <pause dur="0.2"/> a big one <pause dur="0.7"/> if it goes on for a long time <pause dur="0.3"/> or you're severely hypercalcaemic and you've got far too much calcium <pause dur="0.3"/> the calcium <unclear>will</unclear> deposit <pause dur="0.4"/> and form # solid lumps <pause dur="0.3"/> and this either happens in the kidney and forms kidney stones which we'll see about in the next session <pause dur="0.4"/> stones aren't only made of calcium there's lots of different types of stones <pause dur="0.4"/> but some of them are made of calcium <pause dur="0.4"/> and you get ectopic calcification <pause dur="0.4"/> so you can pick up little lumps of calcium on X-rays <pause dur="0.3"/> in all sorts of places where you wouldn't expect them throughout the kidneys <pause dur="0.3"/> or throughout the body <pause dur="0.3"/> so if it goes on for a long long time you're severely hypercalcaemic that's a problem <pause dur="1.0"/> but again <pause dur="0.5"/> very hypercalcaemic <pause dur="0.7"/> very suddenly <pause dur="0.3"/> and you have cardiac problems again <pause dur="1.0"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> so that's why it's really 
important if it's an acute <pause dur="0.4"/> # situation <pause dur="0.7"/> so what do you do the main aims <pause dur="0.4"/> if you've got a patient is you want to normalize their calcium <pause dur="1.4"/> so if they're hypercalcaemic and i've just put here <pause dur="0.4"/> if their levels remember the normal's about two-point-five if the levels are up here <pause dur="0.3"/> it's an emergency in terms of heart conditions <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> so what you do is you try to flush the calcium out of the system by giving them fluids and making them pee more <pause dur="0.6"/> and these treatments <kinesic desc="indicates point on slide" iterated="n"/> here basically refer to the bone conditions <pause dur="0.4"/> because <pause dur="0.3"/> if you're hypercalcaemic <pause dur="0.3"/> most of that calcium's coming from your bone if you remember i told you that in the second year and we'll look at that <pause dur="0.4"/> # second semester and we'll look at that in a couple of weeks' time <pause dur="0.5"/> so if you can stop the bones losing calcium that will help bring down the calcium level certainly long term <pause dur="0.4"/> so these are a more longer term treatment and they affect the bone <pause dur="0.4"/> but initially you're going to want to try and flush the calcium certainly flush it 
out of the system <pause dur="1.3"/> and as i said normally it's a parathyroid tumour <pause dur="0.5"/> # ninety per cent of the cases unless they're an emergency if it's a chronic hypercalcaemia <pause dur="0.4"/> are parathyroid tumours <pause dur="0.4"/> and then you may have to consider removing all or some of the parathyroid glands <pause dur="2.2"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> if it's <trunc>hypercal</trunc> hypocalcaemia sorry hypo <pause dur="0.7"/> again you've got an acute situation or a chronic <pause dur="0.6"/> if it's acute you can simply give them calcium I-V <pause dur="0.4"/> and you give them that as # <pause dur="0.3"/> calcium gluconate <pause dur="0.6"/> if it's chronic <pause dur="0.5"/> you want to make certain they've got enough calcium in their diet <pause dur="0.3"/> and they're able to reabsorb it or absorb it from their diet properly <pause dur="0.4"/> so you give them calcium <pause dur="0.3"/> and give them vitamin D and we'll see why they need vitamin D <pause dur="0.2"/> a little later <pause dur="1.0"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> and i've just put this in P-T-H-R-P <pause dur="0.4"/> it's nothing to do with the kidney really or at least not that we know of at the moment <pause dur="0.6"/> but because it acts exactly like parathyroid hormone <pause dur="0.3"/> and we'll see the effects of that in a couple of slides <pause dur="0.3"/> it can make people 
hypercalcaemic <pause dur="0.4"/> so <pause dur="0.2"/> but if often occurs when there's malignancy <pause dur="0.5"/> so hypercalcaemia and malignancy tend to go hand in hand <pause dur="0.4"/> and although there's a number of causes for that <pause dur="0.4"/> increased P-T-H-R-P can be one of them <pause dur="0.4"/> so you just bear in mind you you may need to look for this <pause dur="0.9"/> # the difference is <pause dur="0.4"/> # if you've got # <pause dur="0.2"/> hyperparathyroidism it won't affect your P-T-H-R-P production <pause dur="0.6"/> and likewise # <pause dur="0.4"/> you don't see a change in your vitamin D levels so if your vitamin D levels are normal <pause dur="0.3"/> but very high calcium <pause dur="0.5"/> # and you haven't got a parathyroid tumour it might be worth looking for a tumour elsewhere that's producing P-T-H-R-P <pause dur="1.7"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> so this is the slide i've shown you before <pause dur="0.5"/> low calcium <pause dur="0.4"/> you produce P-T-H that affects the bone <pause dur="0.2"/> and the kidney <pause dur="0.4"/> the kidney produces vitamin D <pause dur="1.5"/> which acts on the bone and the gut and the net effects are increased calcium and feedback to switch the whole system off <pause dur="0.4"/> and i've put the kidney in the middle <pause dur="0.4"/> not because i think it's the most important but it is quite pivotal to 
this system <pause dur="1.1"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> and if we're looking at calcium homeostasis and the kidney <pause dur="0.3"/> it's basically got three roles <pause dur="0.7"/> phosphate i've put here because phosphate and calcium go hand in hand one goes up the other goes down and we've <pause dur="0.4"/> talked about that and that's more apparent in the bone lectures <pause dur="0.6"/> # so we're not going to discuss it today <pause dur="0.5"/> but the other thing it does is it regulates your reabsorption from your filtrate you filter all your calcium more or less <pause dur="0.3"/> into your filtrate <pause dur="0.3"/> and you want to reabsorb most of it or regulate how much of that you reabsorb <pause dur="0.4"/> so the regulation of reabsorption from the filtrate or the occurrence of it <pause dur="0.3"/> happens in the kidney <pause dur="0.6"/> and it makes vitamin D and vitamin D <pause dur="0.3"/> is really important for calcium homeostasis <pause dur="1.0"/> so if we look at this <pause dur="0.5"/> # your filtered calcium again <pause dur="0.6"/> takes all the free calcium but it also takes the calcium that's bound to the anions <pause dur="0.3"/> not the protein-bound <pause dur="0.2"/> calcium because obviously that can't be filtered through if it's bound to a protein <pause dur="0.4"/> but it does take the 
ionic bound so you've got about fifty-five per cent getting into the filtrate <pause dur="0.8"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> and this is roughly what happens as you go across the nephron so here's a schematic nephron <pause dur="0.5"/> and this indicates your calcium concentrations as you go through <pause dur="0.4"/> so by the time you get into the thin <pause dur="0.6"/> descending loop of Henle nearly all of your calcium's been reabsorbed already <pause dur="0.4"/> and most of it happens here <pause dur="0.4"/> and you've got a little bit left to be reabsorbed <pause dur="0.2"/> throughout this part of the nephron <pause dur="1.0"/> so if we put that in context <pause dur="0.4"/> you've got at least sixty seventy per cent of your calcium's reabsorbed in the proximal tubule <pause dur="0.7"/> most of that happens by simple diffusion <pause dur="0.4"/> but there is some active transport <pause dur="0.2"/> but we're not going to look at that in great detail <pause dur="1.7"/> when we come down <kinesic desc="indicates point on slide" iterated="n"/> here we've got the # loop of Henle between it you get a bit more reabsorbed <pause dur="0.6"/> and the distal convoluted tubule now this is interesting because although it's only a small proportion that's reabsorbed here <pause dur="0.5"/> this is under active transport and is 
regulated <pause dur="0.4"/> so this is where the P-T-H has a role it can regulate the amount of calcium reabsorbed here <pause dur="0.4"/> but you can see you're only talking of regulating a very small proportion so it's <pause dur="0.3"/> quite a fine tuning exercise in terms of maintaining your calcium levels <pause dur="0.4"/> # from your kidneys <pause dur="0.5"/> and then a little bit goes into the collecting duct <pause dur="0.3"/> and <pause dur="0.4"/> only a small per cent out in urine one to two per cent in urine <pause dur="0.4"/> and you can see here you filter <kinesic desc="indicates point on slide" iterated="n"/> this much # per day <pause dur="0.3"/> but you reabsorb ninety-eight ninety-nine per cent of that <pause dur="0.6"/> so the kidney's really important if it stops reabsorbing calcium <pause dur="0.4"/> for any reason you're going to lose your calcium really rapidly <pause dur="1.2"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> so what about vitamin D i said the kidney makes vitamin D <pause dur="0.3"/> and the reason it's really important in terms of # <pause dur="0.6"/> calcium apart from the bones is that it regulates the uptake from the gut <pause dur="0.5"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> so i'm going to # go through this quite quickly 'cause it's not a G-I lecture but <pause dur="0.5"/> you've got three ways you can take up calcium from the gut <pause dur="0.4"/> simple <pause dur="0.3"/> # transport 
between cells <pause dur="1.2"/> secondly it gets absorbed in the brush border binds to binding proteins and then is extruded by this # <pause dur="0.5"/> A-T-P-ase <pause dur="1.4"/> also it goes across the brush border goes into vesicles <pause dur="0.3"/> and then # endocytosis gets rid of it at <kinesic desc="indicates point on slide" iterated="n"/> this end <pause dur="0.3"/> but the important thing to note is that <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> the calcium binding protein is involved in all three cases doesn't matter which mechanism's used you need a calcium binding protein <pause dur="0.4"/> to get it across the cell <pause dur="0.6"/> and this is regulated by vitamin D <pause dur="0.5"/> so vitamin D increases levels of calcium binding protein <pause dur="0.6"/> which will effectively allow you to take up more from your gut <pause dur="0.3"/> it also alters the permeability of the brush border <pause dur="0.5"/> # so it allows more <pause dur="0.3"/> # calcium to be <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> absorbed through the brush border of the G-I system <pause dur="0.5"/> and vitamin D has got some role to play in this regulation of the calcium-sodium exchanger <pause dur="0.5"/> so vitamin D regulates the calcium from your diet <pause dur="1.4"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> it also is important for bones we've talked about this before and we're going to <pause dur="0.3"/> so whether the 
calcium stays in your bones or is released in the circulation vitamin D has a role in <pause dur="0.7"/> and # <pause dur="0.6"/> it also regulates # you know when i said P-T-H regulates that small amount of # <pause dur="0.2"/> calcium reabsorbed in the <pause dur="0.2"/> the gut <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> vitamin D will also regulate calcium absorption to a small amount <vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.6"/> but its real importance is regulating bone <pause dur="0.3"/> and regulating calcium uptake from the gut <pause dur="0.7"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> so how do we make vitamin D and this is really important in terms of kidneys <pause dur="0.5"/> so sunlight produces <pause dur="0.5"/> somewhere between eighty and ninety per cent of our vitamin D in our sun that's why it's important to get some sunlight <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> while balancing that against the risk of skin cancer <pause dur="1.0"/> # we get some from our diet and here here the levels of bile salts have a role to play but again that's that's a topic beyond the urinary course <pause dur="0.7"/> and the liver activates both these precursor forms <pause dur="0.3"/> into twenty-five-hydroxy-vitamin-D-three which is largely inactive <pause dur="0.4"/> and you can store that for quite a long time <pause dur="0.6"/> and then the kidney <pause dur="0.4"/><kinesic desc="indicates point on slide" iterated="n"/> here has 
another enzyme that activates it into the active form which is one-twenty-five-<pause dur="0.3"/>dihydroxy-vitamin-D-three <pause dur="0.5"/> and as clinicians you'll get used to calling it calcitriol <pause dur="0.8"/> i try and use that but i i tend to use its real name 'cause obviously that's what i use in research all the time <pause dur="0.6"/> and these are the two enzymes that are involved <pause dur="0.5"/> they're both hydroxylases the liver has twenty-five-hydroxylase <pause dur="0.3"/> and the kidney has one-alpha-hydroxylase <pause dur="0.3"/> it's got a much longer name but that'll do for you <pause dur="0.7"/><kinesic desc="indicates point on slide" iterated="n"/> this one # is not regulated and depends on substrate concentrations <pause dur="0.5"/><kinesic desc="indicates point on slide" iterated="n"/> this one is very tightly regulated so you can see defects in either the liver <pause dur="0.3"/> or the kidney <pause dur="0.3"/> will affect your ability to make vitamin D <pause dur="2.7"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> so what's important <pause dur="0.3"/> i've just told you that the activity of the twenty-five-hydroxylase isn't regulated <pause dur="0.4"/> so if you want to see if somebody is deficient in vitamin D or not <pause dur="0.3"/> you can measure the twenty-five-hydroxy-vitamin-D-three levels the circulating substrate form <pause dur="0.5"/> and that'll tell you <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> their vitamin 
D status <pause dur="0.3"/> <vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/> <pause dur="2.6"/> the one-alpha-hydroxylase conversely <pause dur="0.3"/> very tightly regulated only works when you need the active form of vitamin D <pause dur="0.5"/> and that's because <pause dur="0.3"/> the vitamin <trunc>d</trunc> the active form of vitamin D <pause dur="0.3"/> is so good at <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> increasing levels of calcium in your blood <pause dur="0.3"/> if you have too much active vitamin D you become hypercalcaemic <pause dur="0.4"/> very rapidly <pause dur="0.5"/> and i do touch on this very briefly in the clinical pharmacology lecture <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="0.8"/> so it's very tightly regulated and i've just put here <pause dur="0.3"/> all the textbooks will tell you it's only in the kidney <pause dur="0.4"/> absolute rubbish couple of years ago we found out that this enzyme now <pause dur="0.6"/> all the tissues more or less in the body not <pause dur="0.3"/> not every single one but the vast majority are able to make vitamin D <pause dur="0.4"/> don't know why yet <pause dur="0.3"/> and we don't know what regulates it yet but # <pause dur="0.9"/> five years down the line textbooks will be different <pause dur="0.9"/> and that's just the normal ranges for your information i'm not going to dwell on that but you can see you've got far greater amounts of twenty-five versus 
one-twenty-five-D-three <pause dur="1.8"/> so what happens why is the kidney important <pause dur="0.4"/> apart from regulating the levels of calcium in your blood <pause dur="0.4"/> # people with kidney disease can't make vitamin D <pause dur="1.3"/> that's sometimes because their kidneys are not functioning at all # they have no effect whatsoever but if the kidneys are just not working quite as well as normal <pause dur="0.3"/> then their ability to make vitamin D will be attenuated <pause dur="0.4"/><vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/> <pause dur="1.3"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> if they can't make vitamin D <pause dur="0.3"/> obviously they become vitamin D deficient <pause dur="0.4"/> you don't absorb calcium from your gut <pause dur="0.5"/> you don't reabsorb it from your bone and you become hypocalcaemic <pause dur="0.6"/> this then activates the parathyroid glands to produce P-T-H <pause dur="0.8"/> the P-T-H <pause dur="0.6"/> then <pause dur="0.7"/> will act on bone to release calcium <pause dur="0.5"/> but it will also try and act on the kidney to stimulate vitamin D production <pause dur="0.2"/> but remember your kidneys are knackered for one reason or another <pause dur="0.4"/> so the vitamin D production doesn't go up <pause dur="0.7"/> so you're still hypocalcaemic <pause dur="0.2"/> because there's no vitamin D <pause dur="0.4"/> so the only place the P-T-H can act is on the bone <pause dur="0.6"/> so 
the bone P-T-H system kind of goes into overdrive <pause dur="0.3"/> you reabsorb more and more and more bone to try and normalize your calcium levels <pause dur="0.4"/> the consequences are <pause dur="0.5"/> you get really bad bone disease <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="1.2"/> and that <pause dur="0.2"/> if it's caused because of # <pause dur="0.2"/> kidney disease it's known as renal osteodystrophy <pause dur="0.4"/> in terms of phenotype it's very similar to osteoporosis <pause dur="0.6"/> # and this is a real problem <pause dur="0.4"/> this secondary hyperparathyroidism <pause dur="0.5"/> so the the <pause dur="0.3"/> parathyroid glands <pause dur="0.3"/> don't switch off 'cause there's no vitamin D to act as a negative feedback <pause dur="0.5"/> it's almost impossible to normalize your calcium plasma calcium levels <pause dur="0.3"/> so that doesn't feed back to switch off P-T-H production <pause dur="0.3"/> and the gland goes into overdrive producing more and more P-T-H <pause dur="0.3"/> which only acts on the bone <pause dur="0.4"/> so you get severe bone disease <pause dur="0.4"/> and this is a real problem with anybody with renal disease <pause dur="0.9"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> so these are the things to take home this is revision <pause dur="0.7"/> calcium homeostasis basically you've got three main hormones we haven't talked about calcitonin today <pause dur="0.4"/> <unclear>i'll</unclear> do 
in a couple of weeks <pause dur="0.5"/> and # <pause dur="0.6"/> three tissues <pause dur="0.3"/> # four tissues sorry you've got gut and bone put there together <pause dur="0.4"/> so four tissues three hormones <pause dur="0.9"/> this is important to remember later in the the module doesn't come up now <pause dur="0.5"/> but the most of the calcium that you eat <pause dur="0.4"/> we excrete <pause dur="0.6"/> whereas nearly all of the phosphate that you ingest <pause dur="0.2"/> we retain <pause dur="0.8"/> # or you absorb rather you don't <pause dur="0.2"/> retain it you absorb it so when you're looking at the <pause dur="0.2"/> G-I uptake <pause dur="0.4"/> most calcium <pause dur="0.5"/> is excreted straightaway in faeces whereas all the phosphate is absorbed <pause dur="0.3"/> and that will become apparent why that's important later on <pause dur="1.2"/> okay so the kidney's important 'cause it reabsorbs most of the filtered calcium and makes vitamin D <pause dur="0.7"/> and vitamin D we've just gone over <pause dur="1.5"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> a hyperparathyroidism <pause dur="1.0"/> now this is # <pause dur="0.5"/> something that comes up in the group work and something you'll get used to <pause dur="0.4"/> as you go through the module <pause dur="0.8"/> but there's three forms of hyperparathyroidism <pause dur="0.8"/> now remember i said most # <pause dur="0.2"/> hypercalcaemia presents with a sort of middle-aged 
woman <pause dur="0.5"/> # in a routine blood test and she's probably got a tumour <pause dur="0.9"/> now that's primary hyperparathyroidism <pause dur="0.4"/> the parathyroid glands <pause dur="0.3"/> are producing too much P-T-H on their own <pause dur="0.9"/> now in that case <pause dur="0.4"/> you have # <pause dur="0.4"/> too much P-T-H <pause dur="0.4"/> the kidneys respond normally producing more vitamin D <pause dur="0.5"/> # the bones respond to release calcium <pause dur="1.1"/> that all produces an increase in calcium in the plasma <pause dur="0.4"/> but because it's coming from a tumour there's no negative feedback system working <pause dur="0.6"/> so you go on and on <pause dur="0.2"/> producing more calcium <pause dur="0.5"/> # hence hypercalcaemia <pause dur="1.2"/> and that's <pause dur="0.2"/> relatively simple you can whip some of the parathyroids out <pause dur="2.1"/> secondary hyperparathyroidism was the one we've just talked about where the system can't work <pause dur="0.4"/> so there's no negative feedback so the parathyroid glands go on producing <pause dur="0.4"/> # P-T-H <pause dur="0.5"/> and eventually they # become desensitized as we'll see <pause dur="0.7"/> now this is i've put vitamin D deficiency here but it's usually is a consequence of renal disease it's not somebody who's just not <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> vitamin D deficient 
and developing rickets it's a renal problem really <pause dur="0.5"/> and in that case you've got low or normal plasma calcium whereas they're high here <pause dur="1.0"/> and the last one is tertiary hyperparathyroidism <pause dur="0.4"/> and this is really quite specialized <pause dur="0.5"/> # this is a # <pause dur="0.6"/> consequence of renal disease <pause dur="0.6"/> but it's a # <pause dur="0.2"/> a continuation of secondary hyperparathyroidism <pause dur="0.6"/> when there's no feedback <pause dur="0.3"/> # to switch the parathyroid glands off they go on producing P-T-H <pause dur="0.6"/> and they become insensitive to calcium levels and vitamin D the receptor levels drop <pause dur="0.6"/> they also sometimes become hyperplastic so you get more cells <pause dur="0.4"/> # bigger parathyroid glands <pause dur="0.3"/> producing more P-T-H <pause dur="0.4"/> so the consequences are completely unregulated P-T-H production <pause dur="0.6"/> remember you've got kidneys that can't respond normally <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> so you get # <pause dur="0.2"/> loads and loads and loads of reabsorption from your bone so you get really bad bone disease <pause dur="0.3"/> but in that case as well you usually 
have high plasma calcium <pause dur="0.7"/> but <pause dur="0.2"/> this <trunc>h</trunc> plasma calcium which would normally shut off P-T-H production can't because the gland's lost all its natural <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> mechanisms for feedback <pause dur="1.7"/> oh i'll leave that slide up at the end in a minute 'cause i realize you haven't got that one 'cause that was an addition <pause dur="0.6"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> this one at the end i'm not going through it's kind of a pictorial representation of secondary hyperparathyroidism <pause dur="0.5"/> and the problems associated with kidney disease <pause dur="0.6"/> it's # <pause dur="0.3"/> it's really important you know calcium homeostasis # goes up the creek if you've kidney disease <pause dur="0.7"/> so that's all i've got to say now # <pause dur="0.4"/> 'cause i know we're running slightly probably any questions either come and see me or see me in the group work <pause dur="0.5"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> and # i'll just leave that one up for you to copy down <pause dur="0.4"/> while i get <gap reason="name" extent="2 words"/> sorted out for the next lecture
