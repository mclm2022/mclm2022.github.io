<u who="nm5285">this is just a quick summary of what i'm going to go through # a little bit on what assessment is and # what we try and achieve by assessment and then i'm going to quickly review the evidence for the current system so what what how we assess the students at the moment then i'm going to explain # a new proposed continual assessment programme and the advantages and disadvantages of it as i see it and then # we'll have a little bit of feedback both from the people here in the room who've had a play with # the new <trunc>pr</trunc>  proposed new programme and all the rest of you to see what thoughts you've got and then hopefully we'll have a chat about it so first of all just a couple of # quite dry # definitions of what assessment is but i think this is quite useful because it kind of focuses our mind on the purpose of assessment the first one just says that assessment is the process of collecting synthesising and interpreting information to aid decision making and secondly that assessment should allow sound inferences about what learners know believe and can do and they're really just # reminding us that assessment should reflect the educational aims of the course so it's really as an integral part of your course should be how you assess it and there are three concepts # to be thought of in assessment and they are validity reliability and feasibility and i'm just going to quickly scoot through what they mean as a quick reminder # validity an assessment is valid if it provides accurate information about the subject being assessed so in the clinical methods course if our assessment's valid then it accurately identifies how good they are at consulting that's what it should show if it's a valid assessment a reliable assessment will <trunc>yied</trunc>  yield consistent results regardless of when it's used by whom and which item is assessed so again if we think about the clinical methods course our assessment will be reliable if you get the same results if you assessed it at different times or by different people that would be a reliable assessment and then feasibility it's things like time and training and money and what technology you use and in the clinical methods course as you probably realise one of the real issues at the moment is is providing external assessors for you so that's just a quick overview so just as a reminder for those of you who don't know i guess you all know i guess you all know # i was expecting some people to be here who weren't doing clinical methods but just let's just quickly skip through this at the moment the students are assessed twice they have a mid point assessment which is purely formative and then they have the end point assessment and the results in the end point assessment are those which come back to the med school and in both cases they have five consecutive consultations assessed by the Leicester assessment package both cases there's a session set aside by you and the G-P tutor or the internal assessor is there at both and an external assessor which is usually one of us # may be present at the end point assessment and i say maybe because that doesn't happen in every case okay so now i'm just going to quickly go through # some of the papers that have been published or some of the evidence for first of all the Leicester assessment package itself and then the actual system that we that we use at the moment nineteen-ninety-four Robin Fraser and his colleagues at Leicester had two papers in the British Journal of General Practice the first one # assessed the validity of the Leicester assessment package and it did this by sending a questionnaire to a hundred randomly chosen course organisers who thought it was alright and because they thought it was alright it was deemed that the L-A-P could be used in formative or summative assessment of consultation competence in general practice the bottom line i've put on there is just a reminder that that actually means that was then done in a postgraduate setting a second paper in nineteen-ninety-four saying the B-J-G-P was # Professor Fraser and his colleagues assessing the reliability of the Leicester assessment package and it did this by getting six randomly chosen course organisers to assess five doctors in with simulated patients and they were doctors of varying clinical experience and all six course organisers watched all of the consultations and then they collected all the data for their marks and assessed whether they thought their data was similar or not and it demonstrated what they report as fairly good <trunc>inter</trunc>  inter-assessor reliability so they were fairly similar they then did # some analysis and i apologise for the the statistics but i i come back to this later so i'm just going to quickly try and explain what it means they did something called generalizability analysis and they did that to try and predict the number of cases you would need to achieve acceptable reliability using two assessors # i'm not really sure how they do it but effectively they come back with a figure called a generalizability coefficient and it's generally accepted if the generalizability coefficient is point eight or greater then that is acceptably reliable and using their data they deemed that you would need to have two assessors in seven consultations to gain this level of reliability the other thing that they demonstrated that was quite interesting was that in that situation if you sit down and do successive consultations then the first consultation is unreliable and should be discarded which is quite interesting i'll come back to that later as well and the other point about this was because they're using simulated patients in this # case then you can ensure a good clinical case mix and case mix is really important for reliability # and he wrote that if you use real patients then it's not sure wasn't sure at that time how many patients you would need # for a reliable # assessment and he also commented that with increased training assessors become more calibrated without affecting reliability and actually it makes it more reliable the more trained the assessors are the more reliable the results are so that was his two initial # papers he then # evaluated the what the modified L-A-P now that's modified because it only uses the five criteria like we use with our students so the first two use all seven L-A-P criteria and this is what we use on our students so interviewing history taking i always forget them # examination problem solving management and behavioural relationship and this was in an undergraduate setting and this was published in Medical Education in two-thousand and in this study they observed medical students at Leicester medical school and this was very similar to our current end point assessment it was two assessors and it was watching <trunc>s</trunc>  or the aim was to watch six consecutive real patients # in truth in most cases they only actually got five and so they only analysed the first five that they saw so basically this is effectively exactly the same as what we're doing on our end point assessment the results were quite interesting they showed a fairly wide range of actual scores # half the time they were within two point five per cent of each other which looks quite good but ninety-one per cent and ninety-one per cent within seventy-five per cent but if you remember that our scores are quite a narrow band between Ds and Es and and C pluses then that's actually quite a wide level of of <trunc>va</trunc>  variation between the two assessors and they did this generalizability analysis again and this was this predicted that two assessors assessing six consultations and the reason they predicted six was because they only analysed five so they predicted what would happen with six and it gave a generalizability coefficient of only point six four in allocation of scores which if you remember i mentioned earlier that that it's normally accepted that point eight or above is is reliable so in this setting it's officially an unreliable allocation of scores but generalizability coefficient of point nine four in passing or failing students and that's probably the crux issue and that's what he refers to as being the crux issue from a summative point is does the student pass or fail and # he concluded that it was reliable at passing or failing students with some problems in in actually what score you give them now our end point assessments appreciate this and that's probably i'm guessing the reason why we don't give students a mark we tell them whether they're highly satisfactory satisfactory or failed # and it's because of this research i think so moderate to low inter-rater reliability # saying that lots of other consultation performances have very similar levels of inter-rater reliability if you look into it so it's not unusual and just to reiterate the critical decision from a regulatory viewpoint is whether the student passes or fails the other thing that he did in this report which is quite interesting is he asked the students what they thought of it and most of the students thought the mix of patients was good eighty-five per cent and then this bit i think is is very interesting ninety-eight or ninety-nine per cent of the students thought that the assessors identified their strengths and weaknesses gave them good advice and that their feedback would improve their performance so this really supports the undergraduate modification of L-A-P as a formative process it's a real support for that so why do we why are we thinking about changing i think Roger touched on it a little bit earlier but there's a few reasons why we've looked into changing the way we assess our students the first one is we don't have enough trained external assessors and so at the moment i think it's right that only about half of our assessments take place with two assessors and about half take place just with an internal assessor so we're not actually doing what we doing originally anyway also some practices report that they struggle to get five suitable patients in a single session now that can be that they can only get three of four patients or sometimes they don't get a good case mix in their five patients so there are certainly sometimes some problems in in doing that also the students # perceive the assessment process as a hurdle to be jumped they want to get in there they want to pass and they want to know that they've passed and it kind of takes away a little bit from the feedback and the formative element of it and i think that's a bit of a waste really # just following on from that as well the assessment is right at the end of the course and so you're giving your students recommendations for what to do and then they're finished and they're going off and doing something else and finally some of # the G-P's have reported back to us that that their students under perform in the assessment that they're a good student all the way through they get very very nervous in what they perceive to be an exam and they don't do as well and so it doesn't reflect how good a student they were there's quite a few reasons oh yeah and finally we assess five consultations and there's a question about whether or not we should do seven if you look at his initial paper something like that i think the whole process lends itself very nicely to being formative and that we don't fully utilise it so there's quite a few reasons why we're thinking about if we could change what we're doing so this is # my proposal for # how we would change it scrap the mid point and end point assessments they go and they get replaced by a continual assessment programme but still using the Leicester assessment package okay this is just a quick overview of this continual assessment package and then i'm going to go through each bit in a little bit more detail so you have a formative assessment of one consultation every week from week two to week six just in a professional session one consultation the student has regular formative feedback sessions on how they're getting on the student performs self-assessment of their consultations and the student keeps a learning portfolio throughout the eight-week course they then have regulatory assessment or summative assessment by their tutor during week seven over seven consultations at the end of those seven consultations they have feedback as if they would at the moment at the end of an end point assessment and then you have the chance to implement those recommendations you've made in week eight because the assessments all done and dusted by the end of week seven so in just a little bit more detail weeks two three four five and six the tutor will assess one consultation by the Leicester assessment package this be during a professional session that you would sit down watch the student do a professional session and then give them some formative feedback on how they're getting on by the Leicester assessment package it's an early introduction to lap to the student and it it can be used as a teaching tool for them so you were good at this you weren't so good at this not too formal not <trunc>co</trunc> the results aren't coming back from the med school and certainly to start off with i wouldn't be expecting you to be grading them necessarily but just to say right once a week we're going to sit down and we're going to assess one consultation after you you've decided which consultation you're going to to do the student also sits down <trunc>an</trunc>  and marks their own consultation # the reason that i've put this in is because it really just gives the student a bit more insight into what's going on and makes them realise that assessment's part of this whole educational process instead of it just being you pass or you fail # there's quite a lot of evidence that self-assessment increases motivation of students and also commitment of students and both of these assessments that you do and the student do go in the student's portfolio and nowhere else so it's purely formative this is a dreadful slide but # this is a little bit like i'll i'll just show you what it is this is effectively what the assessment things look like so on a side of A-four each of the five criteria and strengths and weaknesses and you just write down pick out a couple of things that they're good at so you're very good at introducing yourself you you might want to work on just a couple of things i want you to keep and then they've got a record after five weeks of of one consultation a week which might provide them with a little bit of continuity so just <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/></u>
<u who="sf5286">can i ask sorry can i ask a question</u>
<u who="nm5285">yeah</u>
<u who="sf5286">is would you do that on say we'll do the third consultation or would you let them choose and if they think they did a good one you'd do it on that one or would you do it on a bad one or</u>
<u who="nm5285">yeah i don't think it matters because it's purely it's purely formative it's just for process really and for teaching purposes so it doesn't really matter i mean you could just say let's let's mark the next one have a crack at it</u>
<u who="sf5286">because do we not do this anyway in sort of a in an informal way you say like in this one you've done this good and that bad over all the consultations</u>
<u who="nm5285">yeah you do yeah you do absolutely yeah no you do and i i i mentioned that in a bit i mentioned the fact that it's formalising what you're already doing there's no this is i don't think this is a change to what you're doing</u>
<u who="sf5286">okay</u>
<u who="nm5285">absolutely but they but they get to keep it in a portfolio the other thing that # that i've put in the portfolios the one's we've use so far is just that # not a tick box though because they've modified it slightly but like a just a marking pro forma i think the students that have used it have liked t just to pick out the criteria # the reason it's not tick box is because one of the criticisms you could say is oh i i've ticked six of the nine therefore i must have sixty-six per cent and it's not as we all know it's not that simple but just something for the students and the students quite like this very early on when they don't really understand the L-A-P this is quite a nice thing to have in their portfolio weekly feedback sessions again is something i think you're probably already doing but just to formalise it that you sit down and discuss # areas of strength and and and weaknesses <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> doesn't like me saying weaknesses so i've changed that to potential improvements # with appropriate L-A-P criteria if relevant and also to have these recorded in their portfolio and the purpose of this really is <trunc>i</trunc>  it can address things that aren't necessarily covered in their one-offf snapshot thing that you've seen with them and it can also talk about things that aren't necessarily covered by the L-A-P so this is just further enhancing the formative process of it all really but i think i mean this is again what you're already doing it's just making a couple of notes okay now the portfolio is i think an opportunity to encourage the students to keep a portfolio and there's a lot of evidence that that this a very good way for a student to learn it provides structure and focus to their learning and it means that they can start recognising and addressing their strengths and learning needs basically it's a step towards them being a life long learner and this is one of the things that Tomorrow's Doctors wants us to do in universities which is encourage the students into life long learning so it's an opportunity for us to do that with basically minimal effort here i think to do that so what should they put in their portfolios all of the formative assessment sheets that they've done and that you've done and their weekly feedback sessions and also # something which should i touch on briefly now # a logbook of professional sessions we're we're going to introduce this is going to happen anyway before this may or may not come in we're going to introduce them to keep a logbook of the professional sessions that they do for a couple of reasons one is # some students complain that they don't have they don't have enough professional sessions and they probably do they just don't realise and the other one is that we used to say have X number of sessions but but actually in real life you're all a lot more flexible than that and tend to slot in professional patients every now and then and actually you kind of tend to say to the students look you are seeing them and also i think if if you put into their portfolio it gives them a little record of what they're seeing what cases they're seeing # so we can touch on that again afterwards if you like but <trunc>th</trunc>  they're the three things i think we should definitely go in what else i think is a point which is up for discussion really but there's an opportunity to encourage them to be a bit innovative with it they can record anything else that they come across that's interesting so when they're in a basic session and they see somebody they something they don't know anything about make a note of it go away look it up put it in your portfolio any gaps in their knowledge if they if you get them to present cases to you get them to put that in the portfolio and also if they get any feedback from what we do at the university and from what they do in the hospital that can all get slotted into their portfolio as well so they can build up a record of what they've learnt in their eight weeks on the course and i think there's a few things we can put in there as well we can put in copies of the laminate of the L-A-P information about what happens to them and there's things like pharmacology we've had a few discussions about the fact that the students don't know very much pharmacology we could slot in a basic pharmacology thing some basic antibiotics and things like that which they can then refer to and add to if they want to details on clinical examination could go in there which they could get from the hospitals lots of different things we could we could put in anything i think that would encourage them to be more involved in self-directed learning so there's an opportunity to put lots of things in</u>
<u who="sf5287">sorry can i just say something there i thought we were not supposed to be teaching them # basic pharmacology et cetera i mean i know we all do</u>
<u who="nm5285">yeah yeah</u>
<u who="sf5287">but if you're starting to say that we ought to teach them basic pharmacology and put that in their portfolio then you're actually formalising that and asking us to teach it</u>
<u who="nm5285">yeah no # i don't think that you should be teaching that i think but if if they come across things that they want to look up that they should which is what they're doing and one of the feedbacks we've had from G-Ps is they don't know any pharmacology and this is an opportunity for them to and we we i'm just saying we could put into the folder a page three pages of all the common antibiotics and things and then when you say i'd give an antibiotic they can say i'd give one of these antibiotics or</u>
<u who="sf5287">right fair enough</u>
<u who="nm5285">but i'm not saying you should be teaching them pharmacology you've got enough to teach them anyway but it's encouraging them to learn things themselves which they're going to do anyway so just in summary i think the portfolio's an opportunity to improve their learning outcomes and it can tie in the three separate components of the C-M-C quite well so G-P stuff the hospital stuff and the university stuff then week seven they have seven consultations marked by their tutor in exactly the same way as they would be in the end point assessment so by this stage you're probably doing professional sessions # anyway so you sit you're sitting down and watching them and just mark the consultations until you've got to seven when you get to seven you can add up the marks and you can give them a pass or fail in the same way as you could when you'd got to five in an end point assessment and you can do it over the course of that week and it probably will take you more than one session you mark how many you've seen three or four in one session and when you get to seven stop add up your marks and then that's it then you've finished their assessment package and you can feedback to them either at the end of the seventh or at the end of that session in the same way as you would do at the end of their end point assessment so it's effectively it's exactly analogous to the end point assessment except it's done during your normal professional sessions until you've got to seven consultations so you choose the consultations live during their professional sessions you're sitting down someone comes in i i just need a repeat prescription of the pill well this one's not # i won't bother doing this one or and the other thing about that i think is this is kind of helps with case mix a little bit so if the first two are chest infections and someone else comes in with a chest infection you can decide quite early on i'm not going to mark this one because we're not going to get good case mix so you can choose them as you're going until you get to seven what you probably can't do is think he's not doing very well in this case i'm not going to mark this one you probably should mark the first seven apart from if there's case mix problems and i think doing it like should ensure a reasonable case mix probably more so than the way we do it at the moment</u>
<u who="sf5288">do you not think you may no over run in time to try and get # like seven with quite a few of them discarded that might be like a four hour surgery almost</u>
<u who="nm5285">yeah you don't have to do it in one session though you've got the whole of the week to do it</u>
<u who="sf5288">oh i see what you mean </u>
<u who="nm5285">so you don't set aside a session to do an assessment you just do your normal sessions like you're doing in week seven anyway </u>
<u who="sf5288">yes</u>
<u who="nm5285">but so the students in the chair doing a session </u>
<u who="sf5288">oh i see </u>
<u who="nm5285">and you just mark it</u>
<u who="sf5288">oh i see <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> sessions in week seven <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/></u>
<u who="nm5285">yeah yeah by this stage you're doing you're probably doing quite a lot of professional sessions by week seven anyway because they're preparing for the exam at the moment so effectively no different to what you're doing at the moment and you should be able to get seven in the week </u>
<u who="sf5288">yeah</u>
<u who="nm5285">so this is increasing the number of consultations they're assessed on giving better feedback hopefully and improving the formative process and also if you don't get seven sessions in week seven you've got week eight so you can spill over into week eight if you need to so if you find for whatever reason you haven't managed to do seven sessions in week seven patients in week seven you can spill over into week eight until you get to your seven because week eight is there purely for them to implement the recommendations you've given them at the end of their assessment so it's purely formative week eight so you've actually got two weeks to do the assessment if it if it takes that long it won't take that long but you have and at the moment there isn't an opportunity for them to implement recommendations because they're assessed right at the very end of the course so if i can just quickly back to the the # the principles of an assessment tool i think this is feasible for starters it doesn't rely on external assessors it does take a little bit more time and organisation but i think in reality what you were saying earlier it's just formalising what you're doing anyway in weeks two to week six week seven does take a bit of organisation but it shouldn't take much longer than your normal professional sessions because you're watching them and you're marking them so you're not feeding back after every consultation you're not saying you did this this well you're just saying well i that's part of the assessment so i've marked that one let's get the next one in you might have a break to collate the marks that's all and the good thing i think from a time view point is it frees up those two sessions so <trunc>y</trunc>  your mid point assessment and your end point assessment no longer exist so you don't have to block out two sessions so you're gaining a bit of time there so i think it's probably time neutral from your point of view hopefully and also the accent is on student self-directed learning so it's not that you're being asked to do lots more formal teaching it's up to them to look up things or there's an opportunity for them to look up things if they're interested as far as validity just a quick reminder validity is trying to we're trying to reflect day to day practice as closely as possible we need a valid measure of competence but we should also consider the mix of cases and the extent of the challenge well it's an adaptation of the current system and the face validity of the L-A-P has already been demonstrated and we're not changing that we're doing <trunc>exac</trunc>  we're using exactly the same assessment process as we were before so it <trunc>sh</trunc> it the thing has the same face validity and real consultations has face validity anyway and if we compare it to the current system we can choose the consultations live in week seven which improves the case mix we're seeing more consultations so in theory it should be more valid than the current system it should more accurately <trunc>re</trunc>  reflect real life it feels less like an examination to the student and hopefully this will mean they're less nervous and so they're more likely to perform like they would do or like they have been doing for the whole eight weeks so i think validity in my opinion is better reliability however # is a little bit more contentious but i'm i'm encouraged by Fraser's undergraduate <trunc>e</trunc>  evaluation because in his evaluation if you remember the reliability wasn't very good anyway at at assessing the marks but the pass-fail reliability was high this was his generalizability analysis for two assessors and five patients so what we're doing at the moment <trunc>poi</trunc>  the generalizability co-efficient for scores was point six four which is lower than point eight but the pass fail was point nine one now quite helpfully he had a table in his paper showing all the different connotations of patients and examiners including one assessor and seven patients which is what # which we're proposing now the reliability is a little bit lower the score reliability co-efficient is five one but again the pass fail reliability <trunc>co</trunc>  generalizability co-efficient is high it's nine one so if if you can take that data and transfer it across then you could assume that we're still going to accurately pass or fail the students which is the main thing the only one more problem with reliability is this is that the G-P tutor and the student have developed a relationship and in theory this can affect it and cause something called halo effect bias which is you think the student's good or you like the student therefore you might be more likely to do better or do worse for them <trunc>an</trunc>  and this is an issue i think but saying that it's an issue anyway because at the moment half the time there is only one assessor and that's you so this doesn't really change i don't think</u>
<u who="sf5286">it does in as much as you're choosing the several consultations over a week and a bit rather than just getting stuck with the five that you have on that particular morning</u>
<u who="nm5285">mm </u>
<u who="sf5286">so if you've got you know if you're choosing your seven you might have the bias to choose ones that they do well which obviously you wouldn't hope not to do or</u>
<u who="nm5285">yeah in theory you shouldn't mark a whole consultation and then decide to discard it you would discard you would choose whether to mark it from right at the start really right this is they've come in and said i've got this right i'm going to mark this one so you only really discard them on you can only really discard them on what the case is not on whether they're doing very well or not</u>
<u who="sm5289">how can you be sure that's not going to happen though </u>
<u who="nm5285">i think we've i think we've got to trust you haven't we really i mean at the moment there's there's no reason i mean you could send in an assessment you've done on your own and completely fabricate the marks we don't know that you so </u>
<u who="sm5289">but when you've got an external assessors you've got some point where you <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/></u>
<u who="nm5285">when you've got external assessor i agree </u>
<u who="sm5289">where you can compare your two your now saying right we're not going to have we're going to go along and how are you then going make sure that you're kept up to date in assessing fairness</u>
<u who="nm5285">sorry i'll come to i'll come to that in a moment i i do have an answer for that </u>
<u who="sf5290">does the external assessor got to be from the university when the tutors G-P are more G-P tutors who didn't we assess each other still do two assessors</u>
<u who="nm5285">yeah yeah can i can i just i'm literally finished and then i'll we'll discuss because there's lots of points i think come up so this is basically an emphasis towards it being more formative it gives them an opportunity to develop a portfolio it's more feasible than what we're doing at the moment arguably i'd argue improve validity at the cost of less reliability in the overall scores but still having reliable pass fail decisions a few practices have had a play with it so far to see if it works if it if it feasibly works if it's possible to do <trunc>an</trunc>  and i think it's been fairly popular with both the tutors and the students who've played with it although it was run along side the current system because we can't they had to still be assessed in the same way and i think it was generally felt it would be it more would be gained when or if it just replaced the current system because the <trunc>G</trunc>  the G-P tutors could put more into it without having to worry about the other things so the proposal is that it has to be changed at the cross over of the year of a year which would be March # and it needs to be formally assessed and a way of actually assessing whether it's working would be by videoing the assessments to start off with and having them cross referenced and having a second person mark them and see if they see if there is reliability between the marks until you prove that the system is as good as what we're doing you don't have to prove it's better we just have to prove it's as good # and then we would need to think more about all the other things like the portfolio and then we would get you to video occasional assessments as quality control so to make sure that we're all still calibrated we would get you to send in a video or maybe once a year of a couple of the assessments and we would also get someone else to mark them and see if we're all still marking the same # and collect feedback from you all and see how we were getting on so that's it really # there's lots we can talk about i think # i'm quite keen on just opening it up and getting you all to talk and especially there's a few people here i know Brian and Gareth are G-P tutors not lecturers who've had a play with it and most of the lecturers <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> have had a play with it as well so i'm quite keen on seeing what anyone thinks</u>
<u who="su">can i just ask if you're videoing it something that's going on for the whole of week seven </u>
<u who="nm5285">yeah </u>
<u who="su">what are you going to do are you going to video every surgery and then </u>
<u who="nm5285">yeah no that's no that's difficult but that's that's not something which will have to be ongoing that would have to just be until we've got enough data to and that's that's still at the idea stage that's the only idea i've had for how we would formally assess it but i think effectively it would have to be leave the video running and i mean you can <trunc>rewi</trunc>  if you think well we didn't assess that one you could rewind but yeah that's a pain to start off with but that shouldn't hopefully be for too long</u>
<u who="sf5287">that actually takes quite a lot of time doing that when you've got to consent every patient </u>
<u who="nm5285">yeah </u>
<u who="sf5287"># that is going to take an awful lot more work than what we're doing at the moment # </u>
<u who="nm5285">that wouldn't be forever that would just be probably for one assessment or two assessments </u>
<u who="sf5287">would you be just talking about videoing one or two assessments or would you be talking about videoing the whole seven for that particular student </u>
<u who="nm5285">to start off with yeah there'd probably one or two assessments for the student so yeah it would be until we </u>
<u who="sf5287">one or two assessments not the whole seven </u>
<u who="nm5285">no it would be it probably be the whole seven for the first two </u>
<u who="sf5287">the whole seven so then you're going to have to video it nearly a whole week then aren't you </u>
<u who="nm5285">yeah yeah</u>
<u who="sf5287"># the other thing i was going to discuss in my surgery # there's actually three of us teaching a medical student and # you know on week seven all three of us might be teaching them # in which case would it be acceptable for all three of us to assess them in other words you might have two assessments done by one doctor another one done by another doctor and the rest done by the other one or would it have to be the same G-P that did them all </u>
<u who="nm5285">yeah yeah i i don't see why not i i don't see i mean i don't see any problem with that <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> </u>
<u who="su">that might increase reliability i was going to say but yes that might increase reliability i would have thought </u>
<u who="nm5285">yeah i i certainly don't see a problem with that </u>
<u who="su">b-, because </u>
<u who="nm5285">as long as you all sat together and decided what feedback you were going to give</u>
<u who="sf5291">well that yes from a very practical point of view there are two that again in our practice there are three of us who do it two of us who work part time and we cannot guarantee that in week seven three of us would physically all be in the building at the same time to then discuss the assessments and plan feedback just looking at it logistically like that that's actually going to be quite a difficult thing to do if we're hoping to get all that done in week seven before week eight for them to improve on the feedback you've given them </u>
<u who="sm5292">what we did in our practice is we're # five partners so the way to try and # improve the way that we did our assessments is that that i'd do all the assessments and <trunc>be</trunc>  because i i think we're going back to the original research work the people who were doing it were doing them more frequently and when you start bringing to you're bringing into play people who are doing assessments less frequently i think there are problems with potential problems with reliability because it was a a you know doing a <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> was quite a threat for me at the stage that we were to say this is you know what we're going to pilot do you want to do it and they're going you know oh my god i've forgotten you know all of that and we know that there is huge variation in # so i'll admit i'm a i'm a hawk and we've got a <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> as well and there's a massive difference between between # you know how we do it so i i <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> a lot of positive things i think</u>
<u who="sf5293">but but the biggest problem just taking it expanding out we have is that currently there's a huge number of assessments taking place over five # consultations with one assessor now on the reliability sort of studies that that have been done <trunc>th</trunc>  that would be dreadful so Martyn's ways can only improve on that the only thing </u>
<u who="sm5292">i'm not saying that that isn't the case <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> </u>
<u who="sf5293">no i know you're not but but what i'm saying is i really think although you've quite done yourself down on your reliability actually what we're doing at the moment is pretty dicey i think because we're not discarding the first consultation we're taking five consultations and in a huge number of cases no-one else is looking at the students and often it is the bonded person the one who's taught them # and so i would think that actually if you look cold and hard at our current reliability we're not reliable at all </u>
<u who="nm5285">the current system should be two assessors eight consultations discard the first </u>
<u who="sf5293">nowhere close are we nowhere close to that </u>
<u who="sf5294">acting as devil's advocate though if you've got three people assessing </u>
<u who="sf5293">yeah </u>
<u who="sf5294">and you're meant to disregard the first one in a session </u>
<u who="nm5285">no you're not no you only have to disregard the first one if it's five consecutive in an exam situation if you're doing them over the course of a week you don't have to disregard the first one </u>
<u who="sf5294">yeah but that's assuming there's no research saying that is there </u>
<u who="nm5285">well yeah but <gap reason="inaudible" extent="2 secs"/> </u>
<u who="sf5294">yeah </u>
<u who="sf5293">and and it's with two assessors together that you're doing that not with a single assessor because the the <trunc>pro</trunc>  problem was that the two weren't reliable <trunc>b</trunc>  it was the first one that the two didn't agree on </u>
<u who="sf5294">mmm</u>
<u who="sf5293">so you're looking at a different set up altogether and you know it's very hard to sort of you know we've don't know we've got no research we don't know if your system works yet but i think that there's a huge feeling that it's going to be a better educational process with a number of advantages which you've really gone through it's a better educational process and the students are now more and more consumerist and more and more you know damning practices if you like in the <trunc>s</trunc>  same way that post graduate <trunc>re</trunc>  registrars do we're now going to have written evidence just like we are with our registrars keeping their log portfolios and saying oh yeah we gave them that you know tutorial on that day they can't possibly say we didn't teach them well there's no chance that a student can go through this process without having a record of their teaching and no chance they can say that they didn't have a chance to say this is not going right i want some extra help here so on that process i think it's absolutely great and i think as a learning thing generally it's much much better we will be much less performing for the end yeah week seven is i don't know what it's like in your practice but with the best will in the world it's a bit of a rush around to get them up to speed but there's no chance that's going to happen with your system i mean i'm one of the one's who've piloted it # alongside the other one and i think it's a far better system personally i think it works better for me as a teacher i think it's a better educational process i think it is definitely more valid for the reasons you've said and i suspect in the long term more reliable but we we have to study it to be sure</u>
<u who="sf5286">can i ask <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> anybody that failed and what did they do in week eight </u>
<u who="sf5293">well i hadn't i personally my one did not fail no on either system on either system that's all i can say so i've no experience of that </u>
<u who="sf5286">having had a very negative experience </u>
<u who="sf5293">sure </u>
<u who="sf5286">of somebody who failed and to then think of having them for the whole of the next week </u>
<u who="sf5293">yeah well that's no but that's</u>
<u who="sf5286"><gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> there can't be another one but you know it was awful </u>
<u who="sf5293">no but what i was going to say about actually is that's something i think we should discuss here because there are very few failures and that's one of the things i'd like to know about because i think it's something we could think through because there will be more failures an- and all of us are as likely to get one and i know it was a bad experience for you and i know i he was the student in my group so i do know the problems </u>
<u who="sf5286">oh right</u>
<u who="sf5293">that you that you had yeah i mean in a sense i had the failure in that he was in my group but not that i you know was sort of there doing it # so i think it is something and i think he would have been a lot better to have a week afterwards because he brought where has Liz gone he brought a lot of angst into the department that actually Liz sorted out for us # because no-one else was around and she gave him plenty of opportunity to come to any of us to discuss it i mean i offered my services because i'd been his his group teacher # other people offered to see him but he didn't actually come to us i think Liz dealt with it but it obviously is a difficult process and it is going to happen again but also that is going to have been picked and fed back to him on the way through </u>
<u who="su">but it was done anyway </u>
<u who="sf5286">to be fair it was we did we did make lots of effort to to feed back to him on the way through </u>
<u who="sf5293">but if <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> i mean i had him every week for six weeks and you know i know what the problems were and so it it i mean it's a very difficult situation</u>
<u who="sm5295">i think i mean one of the things is if you if i mean you'll know as you said before hand if a student's likely to fail and using Martyn's system that's the one time more than any that you need to be videoing some of the consultations <trunc>i</trunc>  in in week seven so that then you have got a point of reference in case the student says look i don't think this was fair then you can say there are videos that people can look at and other assessors can judge if you know if there was a discrepancy in the assessors views </u>
<u who="sf5286">i mean the only other good thing about that was there were two of us and i think had i been on my own assessing him with the reaction that we got it would have been very very difficult </u>
<u who="sf5293">if it's any consolation to you three of my students said to me you really tried you know and that bit wasn't <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> i wouldn't even have dreamt of talking about another student with them but three of them came up to me in the corridor and said you really tried you know and i just felt awful then walked away but so so the other students see it so i think some you know sometimes it's not you're not as on your own as you think there's the whole rest of the medical school and their colleagues who see what's happening</u>
<u who="sf5286">but i was just thinking in a practice situation for for a whole another week i'm not sure you know well there probably will be another one if <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> but # you know that that would be very difficult </u>
<u who="sf5293">it wouldn't be easy but then it's adult learning it's what we do it's adult teaching <trunc>th</trunc>  you know it a part of jobs to deal with the the bad bits as well as the good bits it's lovely when your students pass and it's really great and i i do suffer from the bonding process and i do find that really difficult and i think what you do is really a good idea in <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> is to have a kind of assessor and teachers and i think that's a good way of dealing with it we're trying to do that in our practice as well </u>
<u who="sm5292">i mean one one thing i'd be interested to hear of people who've done it is that we we've focussed on students with that yes there is a problem getting # externals that equally with the increasingly number that are going to come through you're going to have problems getting practices am i right </u>
<u who="nm5285">mm yeah yeah </u>
<u who="sm5292">and the way that this is this model will be perceived by saying well you've got to have a video and you've got to be doing this i just wanted to throw that out if the if that's creating an extra barrier or perceived barrier even if it isn't in reality that could be a a block to new practice i'm just going to throw that out to people with some experience </u>
<u who="sf5293">they've got to have a video anyway because you've got to have videos to bring in to to the two week </u>
<u who="sm5292">not to the same extent though </u>
<u who="sf5293">no</u>
<u who="sl">from my experience from the very the first time i did an assessment it's quite scary and to actually have someone else sitting there with you giving you feedback as well that's really nice because you know that you're on a <trunc>y</trunc>  you're doing it right it was very reassuring to me to know that the other assessor got a very very close mark to me then i was doing the assessment <trunc>pro</trunc>  properly do you know what i mean and i think if it's your first assessment for example it would be it would be maybe nice to still be able to offer external assessors to that group of people so that they are sure that they are getting they're doing it correctly</u>
<u who="sf5296">i think it's very important to remember what happens to your student if they fail all they all that actually happens to them if they fail clinical methods is they have to see another two cases in their intermediate clinical exam it really doesn't have much consequence to them apart from later on they have two more patients to prove their worth as it were so it's not a disaster to fail this so you know if it's #</u>
<gap reason="inaudible" extent="uncertain"/>
<u who="sm5297">for them it's an utter disaster <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> </u>
<u who="nm5285">well it is at the moment it is at the moment because they think they have an exams where as this is less examined </u>
<u who="sf5298">could # i i just my kind of this practice's this problem with with a student that seems as though he may well have been failing from a fairly early stage and it was sort of fairly obvious he would fail the ultimate bit # that maybe there should be some kind of informal mid point assessment even if you don't want to do it in quite the same way you currently do so that practices could reserve the right to request an external examiner to come in </u>
<u who="su">yeah under this new system though that's what's going to happen anyway </u>
<u who="sf5298">or else or else that yeah or else that # there could be # you might call a random thing where by the university would send external examiners to certain practices and you could sort of tip the wink to Liz that you know this might be a good time to send an external examiner </u>
<u who="nm5285">but the only problem is the only problem is you do them through the week </u>
<u who="su">well yeah but </u>
<u who="sf5287">excuse me i i mean i just think here it that it's very important to support the people who are doing the examiners # the examinations if you've got a new assessor then they're going to feel very anxious about assessing somebody and if you're just going to ask people who are coming in # learning to be teachers and then just expecting them to assess with no back up i think they're going to feel very anxious about that that's point one point two is if you've got a student who you think is probably going to fail then you're going to be in this kind of situation which is a difficult situation you need as much as possible to back it up and i think that your system of actually writing up assessments through the early weeks not doing as we do now at the end of every teaching session we feed back and give them learning points and everything but we don't write it down and i think the actual making it formal and writing it down is very useful for your failing student as well as your good students but that's going let us know we think this one's probably going to fail it's good to have that down to have evidence for why they're failing but also i think that means that you're going to know which student's liable to fail and i think it would be really useful to have an external-er even if it's for only one surgery where you think you might get a couple of assessments to say yes i think this patient you know this particular student's going to fail so that you're not the only person who's failing them i know we know it's not that important it's only another couple of patients and they get extended I-C-E but to the student it's a huge thing and lots of these people are people who have been high flyers and passed everything before but they take it really badly if they don't do well in these assessments </u>
<u who="su">the other thing</u>
<u who="nm5285">act-, actually it would be do able thinking about it wouldn't it because we can still come out to you on a Thursday because they don't know how many you've assessed so far so you can still come out <trunc>an</trunc>  and they also don't know that that it hasn't been videoed and it hasn't been watched so so actually i take your point and that that's actually quite easy to do by getting someone to come out on a Thursday </u>
<u who="sf5287">but selectively not everybody you could just say you know </u>
<u who="nm5285">yeah yeah </u>
<u who="sf5296">you can request an external examiner if you're worried </u>
<u who="nm5285">yeah no absolutely that would be actually very easy to do </u>
<u who="sf5287">yes yes you're worried or you're not not a confident assessor because you've just started </u>
<u who="nm5285">yeah yeah yeah it <trunc>wo</trunc>  it would be very easy to do actually </u>
<u who="sf5296">and we'd have enough external assessors to do that </u>
<u who="nm5285">we we'd easily be able to do cover that for new assessors and people who thought they were failing and be able to come out on Thursday mornings or afternoons and sit in for a normal surgery in which you assess two or three of them and then have a chat together and we could also if you were videoing the first couple of days worth we could watch the video in theory as well its to say look i'm really worried about this person they're doing very badly we could watch the video then we could sit in then we could do a joint feedback to them so yeah that i think that would be i don't know in a sense that would work quite easily i think </u>
<u who="sf5291">we would have to do randoms though as well otherwise you're reintroducing an end point assessment because the student will know that they're a failing student because <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> </u>
<u who="su">you might as well put them in flat caps </u>
<gap reason="inaudible" extent="uncertain"/>
<u who="nm5285">yeah yeah yeah you would you would yeah okay </u>
<u who="sf5299">can i just look at look at a few technical points one is that # we in the university seminars we introduced L-A-P third week onwards so in second week the students may not be aware of what is L-A-P and all those of kind of you know marking so can we introduce L-A-P a bit earlier in the seminars instead of being a structured thing </u>
<u who="su">i i don't see why not </u>
<u who="su">it's introduced in <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> isn't it </u>
<u who="nm5285">i mean yeah they have they have it introduced in first year </u>
<u who="sf5299">yeah but # we formally introduce around third week </u>
<gap reason="inaudible" extent="uncertain"/>
<u who="nm5285">yeah but they they come across L-A-P in this so <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> </u>
<u who="su">it is actually in the introductory lecture on on week one as well isn't it </u>
<u who="su">yeah it is</u>
<u who="nm5285">they know they know about L-A-P usually </u>
<u who="sf5299">right and secondly is that # week seven they're not too many professional sessions so when we formally set basic and professional this week that week can we make sure that more professional sessions in week seven rather than it's throughout the </u>
<u who="su">well we have them for longer so you and you can organise professional sessions to suit yourself </u>
<u who="sf5299">yeah but it's very formalised # the way it goes now </u>
<u who="su">i think it's suggestion rather than # </u>
<u who="sf5299">you can change it but can we put more <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> </u>
<u who="nm5285">i think if if this was going to come in we would we would certainly recommend that you did virtually all professional sessions in week seven </u>
<u who="sf5299">and why from five to seven i know that Sarah said it would increase the reliability but it</u>
<u who="nm5285">why why what sorry </u>
<u who="sf5299">from five patients to seven patients </u>
<u who="sf5293">it's the reliability </u>
<u who="nm5285">it's because the the initial study # # showed that you needed to have seven consultations for it to be reliable </u>
<u who="sf5299">right </u>
<u who="sf5293">it was eight consultations and drop the first one </u>
<u who="sf5299">right </u>
<u who="sf5293">that's what it says in Robin Fraser's reliability study</u>
