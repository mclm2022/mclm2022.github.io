to someone <pause dur="0.2"/> what's the most important thing about <pause dur="0.9"/> such and such <pause dur="0.4"/> and they answer you <pause dur="0.4"/> they're a simplex thinker <pause dur="2.0"/> if you say <pause dur="1.3"/> hang on Alec <pause dur="0.3"/> what's <pause dur="0.3"/> the most important thing in your life and he says <pause dur="0.3"/> just a minute there isn't a most important thing it depends where i am <pause dur="0.3"/> sometimes it's this and sometimes it's that <pause dur="1.7"/> and <pause dur="1.1"/> you have several axes on which you can go and you can find interesting things off those <pause dur="2.2"/> and most of you i'm pleased to say because we've been <pause dur="0.2"/> trying very hard to make you do this are complex thinkers <pause dur="0.7"/> but few of you are multiplex thinkers and a multiplex thinker according to <pause dur="0.8"/> Chip Delany is someone <pause dur="0.2"/> who not only takes into account what is <pause dur="0.3"/> and the different <pause dur="0.4"/> axes <pause dur="0.3"/> but also what could be the whole range of possibilities <pause dur="0.4"/> around what is <pause dur="1.4"/> and i suspect i'll be doing a lot of talking with you individually about this <pause dur="0.4"/> but i'm talking about the <trunc>fa</trunc> space of possibilities around what actually happens <pause dur="0.8"/> if you go to an historian an American historian <pause dur="0.2"/> and you 
say tell me about Abraham Lincoln and what happened in the theatre <pause dur="0.5"/> and he says <pause dur="0.6"/> the bullet the calibre of the bullet was so and so the the assassin was called such and such <pause dur="0.3"/> this is what happened <pause dur="1.2"/> that's simplex <pause dur="1.5"/> if he says but the same time there were twelve other <pause dur="0.4"/> people trying to <pause dur="0.4"/> assassinate <pause dur="0.6"/> him <pause dur="0.4"/> and the security arrangements had been bunked up and the theatre had this <pause dur="0.3"/> you think okay that's pretty complex <pause dur="0.9"/> but if he then goes on to say <pause dur="0.4"/> but if Abraham <trunc>lin</trunc> if it had not been Abraham Lincoln who had been elected <pause dur="0.6"/> but somebody else <pause dur="0.3"/> this would have happened <pause dur="0.5"/> if Abraham Lincoln had not been shot <pause dur="0.3"/> then this <pause dur="0.2"/> is what i think would have happened to American history <pause dur="1.2"/> that's a bit of multiplex thinking <pause dur="2.2"/> i'm going to suggest to you <pause dur="0.4"/> that what we are talking about here <pause dur="0.7"/> is <pause dur="0.2"/> multiplex thinking about ecology <pause dur="1.3"/> and it's difficult <pause dur="0.2"/> and enormous fun as so many difficult things are <pause dur="0.6"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> now don't pretend to understand everything about biology and you don't need to <pause dur="0.7"/> when <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> and i went 
to Neufchâtel we saw <pause dur="0.2"/> in the <pause dur="0.3"/> museum there <pause dur="0.2"/> this which i thought was a myth <pause dur="0.7"/> the <distinct lang="fr">roi des rats</distinct> <pause dur="0.9"/> the king of the rats you've heard about it in in your <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.8"/> fairy stories <pause dur="0.8"/> rats found with all their tails tied together <pause dur="1.8"/> sometimes three <pause dur="0.3"/> sometimes fifty <pause dur="1.3"/> most of them starving some of them having been eaten by others <pause dur="0.6"/> now whether this is a peculiar cult that does this has been and has been doing it <pause dur="0.2"/> since <trunc>nineteen-twen</trunc> since # <pause dur="0.2"/> sixteen-twenty <pause dur="1.0"/> i have no idea <pause dur="0.6"/> but it is a terribly puzzling thing <pause dur="0.2"/> and i have no idea <pause dur="0.3"/> where to begin to ask questions about it <pause dur="0.4"/> so a lot of things that really happened that <pause dur="0.3"/> i don't have any <pause dur="0.6"/> i can't put it in any context at all <pause dur="1.6"/> that's called science <pause dur="0.4"/> you have <pause dur="0.6"/> contexts of ways of working <pause dur="0.9"/> and you know what to exclude <pause dur="1.7"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> that's a frog <pause dur="0.6"/> at the bottom of a seven-four-seven <pause dur="0.6"/> and <pause dur="0.8"/> for me exemplifies ambition <pause dur="2.6"/><vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" n="ss" dur="2"/> even though there's lots i <shift feature="voice" new="laugh"/>don't know about <shift feature="voice" new="normal"/><pause dur="0.3"/> i'm nevertheless going to try and take on <pause dur="0.2"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> 
what are other ecologies like even though i don't understand our ecology <pause dur="2.2"/> because i have one trick <pause dur="0.2"/> and the trick i invented back in the sixties <pause dur="0.2"/> and it seemed very persuasive to people and it goes like this <pause dur="0.9"/> here again is the history of our planet <pause dur="1.5"/> oldest rocks about four-and-a-half-thousand-million years ago and they've got life traces in <pause dur="1.4"/> i'm going to suggest to you therefore that <pause dur="0.4"/> because of <pause dur="0.2"/> our changed minds about chemistry <pause dur="0.3"/> life is downhill to chemistry <pause dur="0.6"/> and if you like i'll show you a B-Z reaction but i'm not going to do it now <pause dur="0.3"/> you've seen it before haven't you the the <pause dur="0.8"/> this <pause dur="0.4"/> self-complicating chemical reaction invented by Belousov and Zhabotinsky <pause dur="0.4"/> and refined and made robust by Winfree and me <pause dur="0.2"/> have you seen it have i shown it to you <pause dur="0.7"/> now i should have brought it down but it there isn't time in this lecture <pause dur="0.2"/> we'll do it <pause dur="0.7"/> perhaps i'll come down before lunch and and show it to you <pause dur="1.2"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> it is <pause dur="1.6"/> <trunc>n</trunc> unlike all the chemistry you did at school all the 
chemistry you did at school had to finish in two hours <pause dur="0.7"/> yes <pause dur="1.2"/> God is not limited like that <pause dur="0.3"/> and nearly all of the chemistry that God does <pause dur="0.2"/> like ozone layers and clays <pause dur="0.3"/> takes millions of years and is very recursive <pause dur="0.7"/> it it is autocatalytic <pause dur="0.5"/> even something as simple as reacting hydrogen and oxygen together <pause dur="0.2"/> requires <pause dur="0.3"/> autocatalysis <pause dur="0.5"/> unless there's some water there it doesn't work <pause dur="0.8"/> and there are twenty-seven molecules on the way <pause dur="0.3"/> from H <pause dur="0.2"/> and O <pause dur="0.2"/> to water <pause dur="0.2"/> things like H-thirteen-three-O <pause dur="0.6"/> and lots of missing electrons <pause dur="0.4"/> it's a very very complicated recursive reaction <pause dur="0.3"/> even something that appears so simple <pause dur="1.2"/> and the living recursive reactions <pause dur="0.3"/> are <pause dur="0.4"/> it seems quite easy to get going the last three issues of nature <pause dur="0.3"/> have had <pause dur="0.3"/> big steps on the way <pause dur="2.1"/> what i want to talk about however is something different <pause dur="0.6"/> i want to say that <pause dur="0.4"/> many <pause dur="0.2"/> different <pause dur="0.3"/> creatures <pause dur="0.2"/> prokaryotes at this time <pause dur="0.4"/> invented photosynthesis <pause dur="0.3"/> now you know that three-quarters of the history of our planet <pause dur="0.6"/> has been <pause dur="0.6"/> prokaryote <pause dur="0.3"/> eukaryotes <pause dur="0.2"/> with nuclei <pause dur="0.2"/> 
only appeared <pause dur="0.2"/> about a thousand-million years ago <pause dur="1.4"/> and <pause dur="1.0"/> that's to say if you say an Earth-like planet to a science fiction author <pause dur="0.3"/> what you're talking about is a planet with almost no life on the land <pause dur="0.2"/> just a few seaweeds <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.8"/> no not much oxygen in the atmosphere <pause dur="1.6"/> take the point <pause dur="0.8"/> for three-quarters of its life Earth has been like that <pause dur="3.7"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> only in the last <pause dur="0.4"/> six-hundred-million years or so has there been this great efflorescence <pause dur="0.7"/> of <pause dur="1.1"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> the # # has Earth been polluted by life <pause dur="2.0"/><vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" n="ss" dur="1"/> now bear in mind this biggest <pause dur="0.5"/> distinction <pause dur="0.5"/><kinesic desc="indicates point on slide" iterated="n"/> these are my cheek cells <pause dur="0.2"/> and on them are bacteria <pause dur="0.6"/><kinesic desc="indicates point on slide" iterated="n"/> these are the nuclei <pause dur="0.2"/> of the cheek cells <pause dur="0.5"/> there is a contrast for you between <pause dur="1.0"/> a prokaryote <pause dur="0.5"/> a reasonable-sized <trunc>proka</trunc> a reasonable-sized eukaryote <pause dur="2.5"/> that <pause dur="1.0"/> thing that happened <pause dur="0.4"/> about <pause dur="0.3"/> a <trunc>thousand-mill</trunc> no probably longer two-thousand-million years ago <pause dur="0.4"/> the getting together of several prokaryotes into a symbiosis <pause dur="1.5"/> didn't happen only once <pause dur="0.3"/> 
actinomycetes are another go <pause dur="0.3"/> several protozoa like giardia <pause dur="0.2"/> are other attempts to do this <pause dur="0.6"/> it isn't something that happened only once <pause dur="0.3"/> photosynthesis isn't something that happened only once <pause dur="0.4"/> therefore and this is the argument <pause dur="0.9"/> if you ran evolution again on this planet you'd get photosynthesis <pause dur="2.3"/> you'd get <pause dur="0.2"/> life because it's downhill to chemistry <pause dur="0.7"/> that's one kind of argument <pause dur="0.5"/> but having got <pause dur="0.5"/> chemical systems with the properties of living systems <pause dur="0.7"/> you will then get photosynthesis because <pause dur="0.4"/> there have been at least twelve attempts there are twelve attempts still with us <pause dur="0.9"/> never mind how many <pause dur="0.3"/> were <pause dur="3.1"/><event desc="tries to change slide" iterated="y" dur="1"/> oh great <pause dur="2.6"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> were tried and failed # sorry i can't go backwards on this machine <pause dur="3.3"/> now <pause dur="0.2"/> we have a picture of an ecology <pause dur="0.8"/> and i want to <pause dur="0.3"/> take you away from having <pause dur="0.2"/> this kind of picture the picture of <pause dur="0.2"/> man managing it of all the organisms <pause dur="0.4"/> being so beautifully together <pause dur="0.4"/> i'm not talking about that <pause dur="0.4"/> i'm talking about the real 
ecology as it is <pause dur="0.3"/> systems which rely on <pause dur="0.3"/> eating each other's babies <pause dur="1.9"/> we're talking the real nasty world here <pause dur="1.2"/> and in the real nasty world <pause dur="0.3"/> there are lots of attempts at <trunc>photos</trunc> photosynthesis <pause dur="0.4"/> there are lots of attempts <pause dur="0.2"/> at many of the things that have happened during <pause dur="0.2"/> our <pause dur="0.4"/> evolution <pause dur="1.2"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> # <pause dur="2.1"/> we don't have to worry <pause dur="0.7"/> about the <pause dur="0.2"/> origin of life i think and i can argue this with you separately it's an hour's lecture by itself <pause dur="0.9"/><vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" n="ss" dur="1"/> the whole idea of it being a miracle <pause dur="0.4"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> is in the past because of reactions like this one the B-Z reaction <pause dur="0.7"/> you shake it up but it does it again you shake it up it have you not seen this <pause dur="0.8"/> oh well i'll bring it down after the talk <pause dur="0.3"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> can film it as well <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="3.4"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> now one of the things that's been invented a lot of times <pause dur="0.5"/> is sex <pause dur="1.9"/><vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" n="ss" dur="1"/> this is God saying to <pause dur="0.8"/> Noah <pause dur="0.3"/> never mind the other amoeba <pause dur="0.2"/> and you know why don't you because <pause dur="0.6"/> amoeba porn <pause dur="0.3"/> flicks only have one actor <pause dur="2.1"/><vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" n="ss" dur="1"/> yes <pause dur="1.0"/> # <vocal desc="laugh" iterated="n"/><pause dur="1.3"/> # <pause dur="1.4"/> sex 
has been invented many independent times the ascomycete fungi the red algae have all got <pause dur="0.2"/> odd variations <pause dur="0.8"/> it seems to be very important and we don't understand why <pause dur="0.2"/> i think in general <pause dur="0.3"/> the argument for sex <pause dur="0.6"/> despite Graham <pause dur="0.5"/> Bell <pause dur="0.9"/> has not been well argued <pause dur="3.2"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> but it's happened a lot of times <pause dur="0.2"/> another thing that has happened a lot of times is that creatures <pause dur="0.9"/> eukaryotes have become multicellular <pause dur="0.2"/> there's an example with volvox <pause dur="0.6"/> but there are other examples <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> the the multicellular seaweeds <pause dur="0.3"/> the <pause dur="0.3"/> animals <pause dur="0.2"/> are all different attempts at going multicellular <pause dur="0.8"/> so <pause dur="0.2"/> and this is the argument <pause dur="0.4"/> the default is that if i ran the system again <pause dur="0.3"/> you would get oxygen in the atmosphere because something will invent photosynthesis <pause dur="1.3"/> you would get <pause dur="0.4"/> eukaryotes <pause dur="0.2"/> because <pause dur="1.2"/> the symbiosis is driven by the presence of oxygen <pause dur="0.4"/> people try and cuddle up to mitochondria which are using a lot of oxygen <pause dur="0.6"/> because it's # a much more comfortable place than <pause dur="0.2"/> where there aren't any mitochondria <pause dur="0.3"/> and where 
there's a lot of oxygen in the water <pause dur="1.2"/> and cuddling up to mitochondria you're very soon <trunc>in</trunc> having a <pause dur="0.7"/> eukaryote cell <pause dur="1.9"/> that will happen <pause dur="0.5"/> again if you ran evolution again on this planet <pause dur="0.3"/> therefore <pause dur="0.4"/> here's the jump <pause dur="0.4"/> on other aqueous planets it's going to happen <pause dur="1.7"/> i hope you <pause dur="0.4"/> take that argument <pause dur="0.3"/> something that happens many times here <pause dur="0.2"/> i call a universal <pause dur="1.2"/> universal meaning <pause dur="0.3"/> wherever <pause dur="0.7"/> life starts that is on every aqueous planet <pause dur="1.6"/> you're going to get photosynthesis <pause dur="0.2"/> flight <pause dur="1.2"/> well what i call the four Fs <pause dur="0.3"/> photosynthesis sorry about that <pause dur="0.4"/> flight <pause dur="0.5"/> fur <pause dur="0.2"/> fur on plants fur on bumblebees fur on mammals <pause dur="0.5"/> and mating <pause dur="2.6"/><vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" n="ss" dur="2"/> right <pause dur="3.9"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> now <pause dur="1.9"/> before the Burgess Shale <pause dur="0.3"/> some seven-<pause dur="0.8"/><trunc>thou</trunc> seven-hundred-million years ago <pause dur="0.3"/> there were a lot of <pause dur="0.2"/> Ediacarian <pause dur="0.4"/> Ediacaran <pause dur="0.3"/> creatures <pause dur="0.4"/> do you know about this <pause dur="0.5"/> people told you about the history of life no perhaps not <pause dur="0.4"/> which <pause dur="0.8"/> probably have resulted in today's coelenterates <pause dur="0.2"/> lots and lots of <pause dur="0.2"/> two layered

seeds and little snails <pause dur="2.4"/> now the stick insect didn't know that it didn't think i'm going to get the ants to do this for me <pause dur="0.3"/> but it turned out that ones that the ants could <pause dur="0.2"/> mistake for seeds or snails <pause dur="0.3"/> got and then if they ate the odd stick insect egg it didn't matter did it it was the tree that was paying for it <pause dur="3.7"/> all right <pause dur="1.1"/> now that's a bit of <pause dur="0.4"/> ecology which <pause dur="0.3"/> i was completely ignorant about for a long time <pause dur="0.7"/> therefore it says to me i'm ignorant about most of <pause dur="0.4"/> adaptation of ecology on this planet <pause dur="0.8"/> nevertheless <pause dur="0.3"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> i can talk about things on other planets <pause dur="0.6"/> because <pause dur="0.5"/> i can <pause dur="0.2"/> make a distinction <pause dur="0.2"/> i've talked to you about universals <pause dur="0.8"/> now i'm going to talk to you about the things that have happened in our evolutionary story which are the opposite of that <pause dur="0.4"/> parochials <pause dur="0.5"/> P-A-R-<pause dur="0.2"/>O-C-H-<pause dur="0.2"/>I-A-L <pause dur="0.3"/> only in this parish <pause dur="0.2"/> only local <pause dur="0.9"/> things that are <pause dur="1.9"/> simply <pause dur="0.8"/> here <pause dur="0.8"/> once only <pause dur="0.4"/> and won't happen again <pause dur="0.5"/> and the classic one <pause dur="2.3"/> is <kinesic desc="indicates point on slide" iterated="n"/> this fish that came out of the water <pause dur="1.8"/> whose descendants were 
the reptiles the amphibians the birds and the mammals <pause dur="1.4"/> all of whom cough <pause dur="1.8"/> because this <pause dur="0.4"/> fish <pause dur="0.3"/> is enormously badly designed its airway crosses its foodway <pause dur="1.6"/> there were lots of other fish out there in the sea <pause dur="0.6"/> whose airway didn't cross their foodway <pause dur="0.8"/> who had dorsal lungs <pause dur="0.5"/> and a separate pathway <pause dur="0.5"/> but it happened that <kinesic desc="indicates point on slide" iterated="n"/> this one came out <pause dur="1.4"/> i'm sure if you ran the <pause dur="0.2"/> # <trunc>f</trunc> <pause dur="0.8"/> evolution again for a start you wouldn't get fishes <pause dur="0.2"/> but you might get something like that <pause dur="0.7"/> and you probably would get things coming out on land because <pause dur="0.3"/> twenty-five different groups of animals have invaded the land so <pause dur="0.2"/> that's a universal <pause dur="0.9"/> certainly some groups would invade the land <pause dur="1.5"/> but <pause dur="0.8"/> no no stupid not that way i said she's telling him <pause dur="0.6"/> and i was asked at a <pause dur="0.4"/> science fiction convention by one of these ladies in a long dusty dress <pause dur="0.3"/><shift feature="voice" new="mimicking an other's voice"/> how do you know that it's <pause dur="0.8"/> her that's telling him <shift feature="voice" new="normal"/><pause dur="0.8"/> i waited just the right amount of time and said <pause dur="0.2"/> experience <pause dur="1.5"/><vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" n="ss" dur="1"/><vocal desc="groan" iterated="n" n="sf0243"/><vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.6"/> and i didn't think they had an answer to that <pause dur="1.6"/><vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" n="ss" dur="1"/> 
the other thing about this fish <pause dur="0.2"/> the other parochial thing as well as the very bad bit of design <pause dur="0.4"/> that its airway crosses its foodway <pause dur="0.4"/> and ours does because it did <pause dur="1.9"/> is that <pause dur="0.3"/> it mixes up its genital tract <pause dur="0.2"/> and its excretory system <pause dur="2.0"/> there are a lot of things out there the the teleosts and the <pause dur="0.2"/> elasmobranchs <pause dur="0.2"/> which have them pretty well separated <pause dur="0.2"/> different holes anyway <pause dur="1.6"/> but we mix them up and this fish mixes them up <pause dur="0.2"/> therefore its descendants who became extelligent <pause dur="0.6"/> like us <pause dur="1.2"/> have dirty books <pause dur="1.9"/> we wouldn't call them dirty books <pause dur="1.0"/> if we didn't think there was something dirty about sex <pause dur="0.3"/> because we mix up our excretory system <pause dur="0.5"/> with our <pause dur="1.1"/> sexual system <pause dur="0.4"/> yes <pause dur="1.2"/> that's unlikely to happen again aliens aren't likely to have novels that we would like reading <pause dur="3.1"/> you see the point <vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" n="ss" dur="1"/><pause dur="4.7"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> now <pause dur="0.9"/> that fish had very peculiar limbs <pause dur="1.2"/> it probably had eight digits <pause dur="0.4"/> it wasn't the fish that it <pause dur="0.2"/> that <pause dur="0.3"/> you start off from that it used to be thought to
