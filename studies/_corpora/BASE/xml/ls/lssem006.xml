<u who="nm5250">the way we've structured this afternoon is we're going to consider a couple of cases prepared from a clinic and # a case on the ward # from the unit at Warwick and use that to discuss one of the two common problems # in rheumatology that you need to understand for your level <trunc>a</trunc>  <trunc>a</trunc>  at this stage in your career so the sort of clinical problems that you'll face in finals # will be relatively straightforward and that means that you need to have a a clear understanding of the # basic differential diagnosis of a polyarthritis a monoarthritis and then some understanding of generalised systemic disease like S-L-E but you don't really need to know a great deal about S-L-, # the details of S-L-E but you need to have a a good understanding of things like osteoarthritis rheumatoid arthritis spondyloarthropathies and things like gout given that this is taught at the end of the day i think we can reasonably cover a proportion of that # now and so what what i'd like to do is start off with a description of a a case presented by # # one one of you which will describe someone with polyarthritis and we can then briefly # discuss the clinical aspects of that which pointed towards a diagnosis and briefly discuss the sort of investigations which were helpful we won't be dealing with a great deal of information it's largely to give you a flavour of the pattern of two or three # of the main diagnoses in my subject so that you have a good flavour of those and that should act as a foundation to build up a clinical skill in making a <trunc>rou</trunc>  in making a a stab at a diagnosis when you do a clerking # we're not expecting you to be rheumatologists but the sort of skill that we'll be assessing in I-C-E the sort of skill that we would assess in finals would be to make a diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis the skill that we'd expect at I-C-E is to make a diagnosis of an inflammatory arthritis as distinct from # osteoarthritis et cetera # and then to have some sort of <trunc>outli</trunc>  # idea of the management for instance we wouldn't expect you to know about anti-tumour necrosis factor alpha antibodies but you might need to know about anti-inflammatories and physio's and O-T <trunc>an</trunc>  <trunc>an</trunc>  and those sorts of elements so we'll try and cover some of that this afternoon so i i'd like to hand over now to</u>
<u who="sf5251">Gail</u>
<u who="nm5250">Gail Gail do you want to present the first case</u>
<u who="sf5251">hi Aimie and i are going to present the first case which is one of # chronic polyarthritis and we chose patient B who is a sixty-seven year old woman with a twenty-four year history of rheumatoid arthritis and the presenting complaint we saw her at the clinic # and the presenting complaint was pain in the groin which was dull and continuous she'd had the pain for over a month it was worse on the right side but was present on both sides and sort of radiated around the whole pelvic area it was associated with stiffness and intensified by movement but relieved by simple analgesia in nineteen-seventy-nine # this patient was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis after she presented with hot and fiery joints and it's a progressive disease with increasing joint involvement deformity and disability and she's previously been treated with # gold injections and sulphasalazine and these are disease modifying drugs her current painful joints include knees elbows neck and her jaw and she has <trunc>pa</trunc>  morning stiffness that lasts over an hour but she's only had that for the last six months and so for twenty-three and a half years or whatever she's reported no morning stiffness which is which is quite unusual and she often suffers from tiredness and fatigue this patient also has extra articular involvement so she has had an and has presently several rheumatoid nodules on her knees and elbows and she also has vasculitis and there was an ulcer on the anterior surface of her left leg and there's also a possibility of having secondary Sjogren's syndrome # which is associated with rheumatoid arthritis and she has a dry mouth and eyes which are symptoms of this and occasionally # the eyes become gritty and red past medical history of our patient is that she's <trunc>un</trunc>  undergone carpal tunnel <trunc>s</trunc>  surgery and she had a forefoot arthroplasty of the right foot # she also has osteoporosis and this has resulted in a fracture of of the humorous the wrist and  a comminuted of the pelvis and it's i think it's important to keep that in mind because that was sort of what they were investigating with the the pain in the in the groin and radiating around around the pelvis i think that maybe you know she she might have a a fracture there this time as well she also has osteoarthritis and has had type one diabetes for the last forty-eight years functionally she enjoys keeping as as fit and active as possible and # she enjoys gardening she has reduced mobility so it's difficult to for her to sort of get out and about too much but she does manage and she has difficulty in dressing as Aimie will discuss later she has some quite marked # ulnar deviation which makes buttoning things and tucking things in difficult and # she has difficulty in showering so she's what happens now is she has stool that she places next to the bath tub and she has to sort of climb on top of this to get into the into the bath and that's really dangerous for her with her osteoporosis and her history and her unsteadiness so she's applying for a grant # to have that renovated and because she has difficulty in meal preparations she relies on a microwave for her meals she lives alone in a bungalow and she receives daily social service's support # two ladies come in and help her get ready in the morning and she has one daughter in Germany that # comes back if there's a a flare up of the rheumatoid arthritis and she has many friends and family # that come by and visit and take her out places her mother had rheumatoid arthritis and that's actually how she sort of when she had these hot and fiery joints she sort of knew that she probably had rheumatoid arthritis and # her mother and sister died of breast cancer</u>
<u who="sf5252">okay # her current drug history is that she takes # methotrexate which is a disease modifying drug along with folic acid which you have to take in combination she's on fosamax for her osteoporosis meloxicab for pain # if her pain's severe she can also take either co-proxamol or paracetamol # as required and she's also found that glucosamine has helped # some of her movement problems in the past she's also taking insulin and rinitidine # on examination # there was marked ulnar deviation of the M-C-Ps of the hand she had flexion of the elbow joints at rest and # she had gross deformity of the joints of the feet she actually had to wear specially made shoes # there was visible rheumatoid nodules on her P-I-P's of the hand elbow and knee joints and there was also the ulcerated area on the the leg she also had erythematous skin around the ankles a swollen right knee and she was obviously # suffering from generalised muscle wasting # examination of her left knee and right elbow found them to be warm they weren't tender to the touch # but the whole joint was swollen and it felt boggy to the touch # there was no crepitus with regards to her movement # she had decreased range of movement and on hands elbows shoulders knee and ankle joints # there was tenderness on extension internal and external rotation of her right hip and tenderness on movement of the left knee and right elbow the investigations # were performed just purely on attendance at the clinic so this isn't a diagnostic investigation but # a full blood count's performed to check for the anaemia that can go along with rheumatoid arthritis and # C reactive protein is used to monitor the disease # it's often raised in rheumatoid arthritis and it can indicate if there's flares or if the disease is # progressing aggressively # kidney and liver functions predominantly assessed just for # drug side effects and she also # had a pelvic x-ray ordered to investigate the pain in her hip the management carried out in the clinic was that she had an intramuscular steroid injection now normally if you've got # joint pain they'll actually inject directly into the joint but because she had an elbow and knee involved they used # the intramuscular action so that it could get to both joints at once without # increasing her dose of steroid it was also discussed that # if she wanted to she could increase her methotrexate dose in two weeks if she didn't notice improvement and she would be followed up # in the rheumatolology clinic in six months time she also had access to a rheumatolology helpline and that means that she can phone them up without actually attending her G-P to increase her methotrexate and also if there's any change in her symptoms at present okay </u>
<u who="nm5250"># i think that's a case that's worth discussing in a little bit of detail and thought i'd just go round what we want first of all when you see a case like that # is a problem list so from the audience what are the problems that this lady has <gap reason="inaudible" extent="uncertain"/> so first of all her mobility and what's the main problem affecting her mobility yes anybody well there's her in fact is this # bright enough i'll get a let me just get a darker pen  better still a pen better contrast i think black would be better so with her mobility there's an acute problem and a chronic problem isn't there so what's the chronic problem </u>
<u who="su">rheumatoid arthritis</u>
<u who="nm5250">yeah her R-A for twenty years what else</u>
<u who="su">osteoporosis </u>
<u who="nm5250">there's her osteoporosis now in terms of her rheumatoid in terms of the chronic disease # there's there's two elements that you need to consider in terms of that effect on her mobility there's the damage that's been done and it's whether that it's active so even the rheumatoid arthritis # has an acute and a chronic component which you'll need to consider what's the acute component to her loss of mobility what did she actually present with okay what was the main presenting problem right so she had groin pain was actually what she complained of was groin pain # so would anybody like to say what they think the most likely diagnosis of the groin pain is considering the examination findings so just to remind people what people found on examination was that her right hip was painful on internal and external rotation what do you think the most likely finding on that pelvic x-ray is anyone stick hands up or what would be the critical thing when you're doing # investigations is that it's a series of questions and answers and so the clinical symptoms the problems the problem list are the questions some of them are straightforward # the patient may just tell you their rheumatoid is active and then it's a matter of deciding what you're going to do # but but # <trunc>i</trunc>  it's not always straightforward and sometimes you do a test and the test is asking often a very simple question what was that pelvic x-ray what question was that pelvic x-ray asking so in other words what would be the what could be the findings if you # it was covering in a sheet stuck up on # # a a light box what would be the three possibilities that you would find </u>
<gap reason="inaudible" extent="uncertain"/>
<u who="nm5250">a fracture because she's got osteoporosis pelvic fractures are actually very difficult to see # <trunc>o</trunc>  <trunc>o</trunc>  on x-ray but people with significant osteoporosis particularly people with rheumatoid arthritis particularly people on steroids meloxicam analgesics et cetera # can fracture their necks of femur # and have relatively little pain it's not terribly likely but even a fractured neck of femur is possible what's the most likely diagnosis would you say </u>
<gap reason="inaudible" extent="uncertain"/>
<u who="nm5250">osteoarthritis and here it's osteoarthritis partly related to her age but mostly related to her rheumatoid so it's a final common pathway so i think you're right i i'd expect to see # right hip O-A what do you think the most likely solution to that's going to be</u>
<u who="nm5250">yeah i i suspect what we're looking at there is a hip replacement so that's her mobility her osteoporosis is treated and they've x-rayed the pelvis looking for a O-A maybe just seeing erosions or an effusion as part of her rheumatoid that's possible because the rheumatoid was quite active now what were the features of her history that would tell you that the rheumatoid was # active what were the key features that distinguished the rheumatoid for instance from other disease </u>
<gap reason="inaudible" extent="uncertain"/>
<u who="nm5250">say again at the back</u>
<gap reason="inaudible" extent="uncertain"/>
<u who="nm5250"># yeah that they're they're good descriptions of inflammation but that's not what she complained of</u>
<u who="su">morning stiffness</u>
<u who="nm5250">yeah how long did that morning stiffness last for</u>
<gap reason="inaudible" extent="uncertain"/>
<u who="nm5250">sort of an hour and a half # in fact after # a C-R-P or # after the pressure that you can exert by compressing # # a little actuator the len-, the length the number of minutes of morning stiffness correlates very well with the degree of activity of this disease and we use morning stiffness and <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> as sort of the key features to distinguish inflammatory joint failure from mechanical joint failure mechanical typically being worse with exertion and she does say that some of her pains were worse with exertion the mechanical element but more than twenty minutes of morning stiffness you would regard as moderate # disease activity i must admit # i think if her C-R-P was elevated i wouldn’t hesitate to increase her methotrexate # so that’s one problem was her mobility # any other problems her pain i to some extent that could be <trunc>c</trunc> considered separately # again that needs to be addressed either through analgesia or treating her illness so that’ll be treating the rheumatoid arthritis itself and perhaps query a hip replacement # any any any other problems</u>
<u who="su">activities and daily living <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> showering</u>
<u who="nm5250">there’s the consequences # and although we won’t i won’t dwell on this case too long # what you get actually people with chronic illness # is they get used to having things which are present for a long time the patient gets sort of # used to them # what you find is that the the world constricts around their symptoms and they get used to the idea that they use the microwave she might even have been quite a good cook at some time # so they start buying food that can be microwaved # but they are not able to wash find washing and things very difficult they get round it my various precarious # # stools and climbing in and out of # showers # and often they can recruit the carers around them to adapt to those circumstances that’s why it’s very important in these circumstances to actually get something like an occupational therapist some external profession allied to medicine to go to the house and in someone with a chronic disease like this once a year or twice a year to just stand back as an external judge and view what’s going on and see if it makes any sense and often what you’ve found is there’s a drift into a corner and what this lady might well require is a hip replacement some quite aggressive physiotherapy some # devices # into her house like a chair in the shower et cetera that can then transform her life it may be that she actually needs to be seen in the upper limb clinic to sort out her hand function so that she’s able to return to washing herself and cooking for herself # in terms of the degree of disability that she has that really reflects her diagnosis and when it was made in the nineteen-seventies # when it was originally made # gold was the only substantial therapy for which there was evidence of disease control and in the Empire rheumatism trial it really depended on four or five patients we hardly use gold at all now although you know # not to be intending to be a pun it was the gold standard then it’s a pretty useless therapy really less than seven per cent of people will truly respond forty fifty per cent of people will their inflammation will get better but in terms of true disease control # it really doesn’t offer a great deal these days we would use methotrexate in combination with other agents # as one of the main line # therapies and the aim now really is complete disease control by which we mean no abnormal blood tests no erosions # and complete # normality for the patient apart from taking medication # so there’s been an enormous improvement really in the last ten to fifteen years and the success of treating this disease although we’re no quite at the point where we’re claiming to have cured it # there’s one other point what # significance do you think # was her family history there was two elements to her family history</u>
<gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/>
<u who="nm5250">so there was her breast disease and her rheumatoid arthritis # what did you make of that in terms of your problem list how this lady what’s her # least probability of getting breast cancer has anybody any idea i mean the girls in the audience ought to know what the i think that’s something that you should have a # personal interest to some <trunc>ex</trunc> some extent what’s the background risk of getting breast cancer a life time risk for any lady</u>
<gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/>
<u who="nm5250">yeah about eight per cent about one in eleven if you have a strong family history with two first degree relatives how much does it increase by anybody</u>
<u who="su">is it one in three </u>
<u who="nm5250">it’s probably not quite # # as much as one in three it’ll depend upon the age if the age is less than fifty # it’s about one in six if it’s less than thirty yes it’s one in two to one in three it almost a proteus autosomal dominant almost a proteus mendelian # # # genetic # behaviour but but this lady’s # # breast cancer risk should be two to three times the background risk so that’s probably of the order of maybe one in twenty or one in thirty her lifetime risk becomes # and i can’t remember how old was she <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/></u>
<u who="sf5252">sixty-seven</u>
<u who="nm5250">sixty-seven so actually in the clinic with with that you ought to just make sure that she’s having mammography because with her disability is she getting to the mammogram because this lady getting into hospital is probably a bit of a tor-, # # # # a difficulty for her what about the rheumatoid’s influence on # # cancer risk do you know about that</u>
<gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/>
<u who="nm5250">yeah what would you say the all cause cancer ratings in someone with rheumatoid arthritis who’s active compared to the background risk at any given age it’s about two to three times the standardised age related risk if it’s active if it’s inactive it drops back to normal and that’s data we’ve only recently # # understood # long term follow up trials on methotrexate because # at one time there was immense debate about giving someone a chemotherapy agent for an agent that at the time wasn’t thought to kill you it was regarded as perhaps # aggressive therapy that can be justified what’s emerged is that if you don’t get side-effects on methotrexate there don’t seem to by any long term problems and the cancer risk drops back to the background risk in addition there’s some anti # endothelial action and being having rheumatoid arthritis and being on methotrexate has survival advantage you have a reduced heart attack and stroke risk that’s very small but never the less it’s it’s sort of reassuring # very reassuring to to people like myself with several hundred people on the drug that we’re not # adding to their problems # but <trunc>tr</trunc> active rheumatoid arthritis and that’s probably true of most active autoimmune disease you’ll slightly increase your cancer risk # if you have a family history of rheumatoid arthritis does that increase your risk at all anybody know the the risk is very marginally increased so although when you read your text books about rheumatoid arthritis it talks about class two antigens H-L-A-D-R1 and D-R-4 # because there’s a particular motif # that # represents a particular peptide particular class two antigens # # in in those two groups that i mentioned they’re susceptibility markers whereas they’re very common in the population and if you look at the population risk those markers don’t increase your risk of rheumatoid arthritis # and therefore genetic studies are probably never going to be # # helpful # what i’d like to do before we do the next case is just show you some slides of someone with rheumatoid arthritis different cases to just talk through the characteristic features of rheumatoid arthritis i know these aren’t as crystal clear as they should be <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> scan them in but # the number of images that without a couple of C-D burners i wasn’t going to be able to bring all all of these along today # what can people see on that slide what would be the features that you’d see so chap there what can you see</u>
<gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/>
<u who="nm5250">yes characteristic feature of rheumatoid arthritis synovitis and this lady would present with morning stiffness # relative sudden onset of swelling of the wrists which would be painful they would be warm and swollen those sorts of features that would indicate an inflammatory disorder and the other thing about this is that it’s symmetrical so PIP’s and MCP’s and wrists on both sides and for the vast majority # of cases that will # represent rheumatoid arthritis tests which are most useful in these circumstances # are plain X-rays and what you see commonly with that degree of synovitis is periarticular osteopenia and here is an early erosion and well i don’t think that comes out at all we’ll pass that that on that’s just to show the development of erosion the second thing # about this is rheumatoid arthritis is a systemic disease so # this is a chap who presented with rheumatoid arthritis # swelling of the joints swelling of an ankle # he’s developed anaemia marrow involvement and he’s got a very high ESR and CRP and when it presents aggressively it can give you fever although rarely is the reason for the fever not # fairly clear cut so inflammatory disorders # are typically have external features in addition to the # # joints and that’s particularly so of rheumatoid arthritis # the involvement of the disease is quite # <trunc>wi</trunc> widespread so it’s a multi-system disorder so when you assess someone with rheumatoid arthritis # there’s there isn’t an organ really apart from the central nervous system # and what i mean by that is the central part you can get peripheral neuropathy that doesn’t require some degree of assessment and in essence the characteristic features really are # synovitis affecting joints serositis affecting # pleura pericardium potentially vasculitis can affect the gut # and as a result of chronic illness you can getting thinning and wasting of the skin muscle wasting # et cetera amyloidosis is a very rare feature of chronic inflammatory disease and as a consequence of chronic persistent inflammation over many many years in which you can get deposition of proteins # in <trunc>rheuma</trunc> in rheumatoid arthritis typically AA amyloidosis the commonest amyloidosis in fact being # a manifestation of # myeloma # # not normally # associated with this disease what you see here really is # this is meant to be even pink # cartilage which is the surface # on which your bones are meant to move and underneath here is bone and here you can see chondrocytes little double cells and what is happening is that palisades of inflammatory cells are digesting this away and in addition # after digesting the articular surface they’ll digest the bone underneath so behaviour which has some features in common # with with malignancy and many of the # processes that are involved # were originally discovered in in examining tumours hence one of the agents that we block in severe disease is tumour necrosis factor alpha it’s primarily a an inflammatory marker but discovered # # in the field of oncology and this is a feature just showing joint destruction # the final common pathway of that erosion # is complete destruction of a joint but it isn’t only joints which are attacked so anywhere where these is a synovial surface rheumatoid arthritis can act and so the tendons these are tendons which have ruptured # are also a target so rheumatoid arthritis characteristic features are synovitis and that synovitis isn’t confined to the joint the other feature that’s characteristic is the formation of rheumatoid nodules not everyone with rheumatoid arthritis gets rheumatoid nodules # but a good proportion do and we would regard it as a severity marker so the first severity marker is erosions the next is the presence of rheumatoid factor # and then presence of nodules and this is a post-mortem specimen from someone with rheumatoid arthritis and vasculitis who who died and this is to show the <trunc>extr</trunc> extensive # fibrinoid # material over the surface of a <trunc>m</trunc> of a heart this is a whole heart preparation # and <trunc>pericard</trunc> pericarditis was part of the mode # that led to this patient dying although not the single # # problem but just to illustrate the serositis # here’s someone with small blood vessel vasculitis with rheumatoid arthritis so that’s the third characteristic so synovitis serositis vasculitis that’s small vessel vasculitis so this would be the lesions similar to the one that Gail described before on a lady’s leg # when you get lesions of this size # # we would regard that as quite a serious problem because that sort of vasculitis distinct from the previous vasculitis this vasculitis is small blood vessel vasculitis # the tissues that are involved will typically recover here is large vessel vasculitis necrotising vasculitis this has a high morality and is one of the triggers for more aggressive therapy including cyclophosphamide so vasculitis is a feature # here is a post-mortem specimen # from a decade or so ago before our more aggressive # treatments were used widely # and when not every person with rheumatoid arthritis was under a specialist # here’s someone was to a DGH with an illness very similar to the one that that slide of a man so a joint with a PUO with weight loss with a very high fever and the worry that the # physicians had with looking after him the diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis wasn’t made pre-mortem # # they thought he might have SPE they were treating him # with antibiotics and so forth # and he died very quickly # with haemorrhage into his bowel as a result of his necrotising vasculitis that’s a rare feature of rheumatoid very rare these days because of the way we treat them # but was once a common mode of death prior to # modern therapy rheumatoid arthritis had the same mortality as grade three Hodgkin’s # in other words treat modern treated grade three Hodgkin’s in that there was a twenty per cent five mortality so these systemic diseases are quite nasty another manifestation of the vasculitis is involvement of the eyes and here’s someone with # scleritis so you can see inflammation in the scleral layer which is largely the vein the v-, veins and venulitis in the eye is a really a form of vasculitis so if you see someone with scleritis they should be assumed to have vasculitis till proved otherwise and that’s true of whatever sort of scleritis you’re dealing with and this can lead to thinning of the # scleral membrane # here’s someone with a more aggressive # form of that # sorry i beg your pardon # that could lead to thinning of the membrane and occasionally even to to blindness although that’s now extremely rare there’s a condition called the corneal melt syndrome where the scleritis is so aggressive that we’ll use chemotherapy similar to Hodgkin’s therapy and very high dose steroids treatment now here’s a more common # # a # a slide to just talk around dry eyes what’s happened to this eye is rose bengal dye has been dropped into the eye so it’s looking nice and red and then what’s happened is then you wash it out and what you’re left with is little rim of the rose bengal down here and what you can see is little patches of # keratitis where the rose bengal has been taken up and rose bengal is a non-vital dye basically it doesn’t touch things that are alive it gets taken up into bits that are dead and there shouldn’t be anything on the surface of the eye that’s in that condition you know the surface of your skin # is meant to have a lot of dead material on it as a protective layer the surface of your eye is meant to be alive and transparent and these are keratitic precipitates so where the eye is dried out the surface has dried out the skin has keratinised tried to become more like normal skin and as that eye lid passes over it peels that layer off giving that gritty horrible dry # symptom that the patient complains upon of and if this continues it can lead to scarring on the cornea an-, and a a number of difficulties and so that syndrome dry eyes as sometimes described in your text books is keratoconjunctivitis sicca so there is the keratoconjunctivitis the sicca being the pathology the dryness of of of the eye and you’d expect the majority of people with rheumatoid arthritis who are seropositive # to have that problem this lady did indeed have dry eyes here’s someone with some # pulmonary nodules # but there are other problems that can occur in the lung there’s a nodule # # in a lung that’s a post-mortem specimen there’s also some pleural # damage there as well now with a single nodule in a lung remember what we were talking before about rheumatoid arthritis that it increases your risk of cancer so a single nodule in a lung is still more likely to be a cancer then it is a rheumatoid nodule even if you have rheumatoid # arthritis # and so in general the a single nodule should be biopsied # as any other single nodule in the lung should be # on it’s own merits an example of serositis pleural effusion and here’s an example of a a different manifestation of lung disease # fibrosing alveolitis where you’re getting honeycombing and loss of volume of both lung bases again a mode of death in rheumatoid arthritis and any sort of involvement would indicate interstitial lung disease is an indication to increase therapy to a more the next aggressive level steroid with the trexate cyclophosphamide and a consequence of synovitis is initially deformity # and then  loss of of function and here’s someone with muscle wasting who’s losing their mobility because of this disease which hasn’t been # controlled in in that case now neurological involvement in additional to peripheral neuropathy is largely a consequence of mass effects # on neurological structures and the most the the only one that you’d be expected to know in any detail is atlanto-axial subluxation and although this is rare why it’s very important <trunc>i</trunc> is that it’s often asymptomatic until it’s at quite a late stage and therefore if you encounter someone with rheumatoid arthritis # as a house officer in say surgery it’s important to have their neck X-rayed before they go to theatre et cetera so awareness of the problems in the neck is very important # because although it’s rare it’s a major problem so here’s a lady who had # i’ll tell you just about ten millimetres of atlanto-axial subluxation so because the transverse ligament around the front of the axis had been eroded by rheumatoid arthritis her skull slipped forward about just over a centimetre when she nodded forwards and as you know the spinal cord passes up a little canal here to then loop into the foramen magnum about there and # there’s an odontoid peg climbing up here that’s not such a good thing to occur so the odontoid peg at the back can be pulled forward onto the spinal cord as it tries to do a loop through here in fact this lady had no symptoms and we did an MR scan of here there was still # two or three millimetres to go and it was decided to treat her conservatively but a very small change in her atlanto-axial subluxation is very likely then to have give-, taken her across that threshold and it wouldn’t be you wouldn’t want to be the anaesthetists who flexed her neck forward and back trying to get a difficult # # during a difficult intubation and what this lady that we described is likely to come to here’s in fact someone with an elbow with elbow damage # and even if you hopefully less often these days don’t win with the drugs there’s joint replacement # to consider but unfortunately joint replacement has it’s own problems this lady has thin bones # there’s a risk of infection and a percentage of them about three or four per cent of them become infected i’m going to show you a discitis there right and really just to go back over though so rheumatoid arthritis is a paradigm probably the one inflammatory arthritis you need to know in some detail so we’ve just gone over that in # a broad outline and remember you know you need to educate the patient there are drugs there’s their activities of daily living there’s protecting the joints surgical treatment and remember to you know treating the patient # # as far as possible holistically so <trunc>th</trunc> this this lady with her active rheumatoid arthritis requires a whole host of interventions with her long problem list she needs some aids at home she probably needs an O-T to see her she might need her osteoporosis assessed her rheumatoid is active and that probably requires more treatment the rheumatoid treatment will require monitoring her hip has probably failed and she’s likely to need to see the surgeons before that happens we need to assess her neck you probably might need to even assess her lung function although there’s no symptoms of of of lung involvement she might have some marrow problems if the disease remains active that might need to be corrected before # surgery her pain needs to be treated and also if she’s become trapped in her house and her activities are are restricted if life is becoming a smaller encompass for her people get depressed with this illness as you might expect so her psychological well-being might need to be # considered # very good what we’d do now is dis-, discuss the next case and then what i’ll do is i’ll take you through a series of slides # discussing differential diagnosis # # # in rheumatology so who is it who’s next </u>

<u who="sf5251"> can i just ask when you were saying about the increased cancer risk was that due to the treatment or the condition itself</u>
<u who="nm5250"># no it worried us that was a a very important question about the cancer risk of rheumatoid arthritis it’s worried rheumatologists for years that we are the cause of the increased cancer risk but in fact with with now careful follow up studies properly controlled # it looks to be it’s the active disease which is the main risk # now there is a slight caveat to that in that if you combine about a third of our patients are on combination therapy so what we know is that methotrexate alone in reality doesn’t increase your cancer risk in rheumatoid arthritis in fact it brings your cancer risk back to where it was before overall there might be in very large populations a small increased risk of lymphoma but that appears to be a very low risk we know from treating transplant patients that when you combine chemotherapy your cancer risk starts to go up again and so in people on double agents like leflunomide and  methotrexate cyclosporine and methotrexate i think we can’t yet say that we’re not potential causers of trouble # because certainly the lymphoma risk in transplant patients on similar regimes are increased however they have a very much more aggressive # # immuno induction and we don’t know whether it’s exactly the same we are sort of approach maintenance # # treatments # in transplantation so the sort of d-, combination of <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> and cyclosporine that you might get but you don’t have the induction therapy so i think there’s a slight question mark over it okay any other questions about rheumatoid arthritis pathology treatment i mean i i really just wanted to give you a a broad outline of the pattern of the illness yeah</u>
<u who="sf5252"> # in terms of the <trunc>d</trunc> deformity is there anything apart from treatment with drugs that can sort of slow it down or #</u>
<u who="nm5250">pretty much not no # people have come up with all sorts of fancy the reason the deformity occurs is purely anatomical so the ul-, well the joints become damaged but why you get ulnar drift is largely because your flexor compartment is seven or eight time stronger than your extensor compartment and so the balance between the extensors and the flexors is such that the flexors just pull fingers across so a great deal of the deformity is a consequence of joint destruction and the balance of forces in your your limbs <trunc>a</trunc> and essentially the stopping the disease is the only way proper way of stopping deformity that’s not to take away from the surgeons and what they can do to clear up the mess that that we’ve not been able to stop forming <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/></u>
<u who="sf5252">okay # we saw Mr M who’s eighty-three # and he presented with trouble in his joints # he had a three month history of intermittent swollen painful and inflamed hands knees and elbows which started suddenly # he also had reduced movement of the hands which Mui’s going to talk about in a minute # he had stiffness in the morning and at rest # which didn’t last that long and he had swelling and tenderness of the right big toe by and large for the past three months as well # in terms of past medical history he’s got # left ventricular failure chronic renal impairment # which i’m not sure what was it was caused by but he was given V-I-O-X-X # as pain relief and that sort of exacerbated it so that was stopped # he’s also got # atrial fibrillation and ischaemic heart disease he’s a sufferer of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and he’s had three # M-Is # and he also had an episode of spondylous of the neck four months ago # which i think is sorted out now # in terms of functional history he’s got reduced mobility he uses a walking stick or a frame # he was recently taken into an intermediate care facility because he had problems sort of looking after himself and he was in there for a week # he has difficulty opening jars with his left hand but his right hand’s fine and he also has difficulty tying his shoe laces # again because of his left hand # social and family history he lives alone in a  bungalow so he doesn’t have to worry about stairs or anything he’s a retired marker researcher # he has good support from his son daughter and his ex-wife who although they don’t live with him they live locally # he’s got no significant family history he’s an ex-smoker and stopped smoking fourteen years ago but has got a fifty year pack history # and he doesn’t take any alcohol any more # and hasn’t done so for a while # drug history he’s on quite a few but the important ones are the prednisolone # which he was given to sort of reduce the inflammation and allopurinol # which is for the long term control of gout # and the others just for sort of his heart and things # Muireann’s going to talk about the examination and what investigations have been done</u>
<u who="sf5252">his right knee and his left hand were slightly swollen he said they did they used to look like big sausages so when we saw him it had he had gone down quite a lot # his ankles were also swollen but there was no # <trunc>gro</trunc> gross deformity so there’s no ulnar deviation or anything like that # there was some erythema on the skin and both of his legs # no tophi was seen which # are collections of urate crystals we were looking for these on the ear lobes on the feet and the hand and it’s a clinical feature of of gout # # feeling he had a warm right knee and warm left hand # the proximal interphalangeal # proximal yeah proximal interphalangeal joint where # there was mild swelling in the left hand # and but there was no tenderness when we palpated it on either the hand or the knee # there was some crepitus on both knees and there was some # pitting oedema and tenderness on both ankles # movement well # on his left hand at the wrist there was decreased movement # and also he couldn’t make a fist so couldn’t make he couldn’t grip your finger with his left hand but his right hand was perfectly normal # there was also pain when you tried to extend the left hand # and there was some tenderness when he moved his right knee also his neck # there was some decreased movement and his neck was slightly # <trunc>fe</trunc> flexed and fixed # so our differential diagnosis were polyarticular gout rheumatoid and ankylosing spondylitis we did some do you want me to go onto the investigations okay</u>

<u who="nm5250">right so the story really is a short history the # two of the drugs were mentioned were only been started this morning in fact after a test result came back so the the story is of a chap with extensive ischaemic heart disease previous # # myocardial infarction a degree of renal impairment who’s now developed a rapid onset oligo arthritis oligo being # less than six joints so what tests would you want the results of</u>
<u who="su">C-R-P</u>
<u who="nm5250">right CRP is about sixty what’s the value of the CRP here so what question does that answer it’s a reasonable reasonable it’s a reasonable thing to ask for that’s a good it’s a <trunc>g</trunc> good thing to suggest but what what questions is it answering in this situation # not a lot actually what what it does is it it confirms that it’s inflammatory and it says that it’s probably quite a lot rather than very little # but diagnostically it doesn’t take you on any further really why is that the description really isn’t it is of a oligo arthritis with warm painful swollen joints with stiffness in the morning that’s come on relatively suddenly it’s not in the pattern that would suggest a mechanical joint failure so you’re really dealing with an inflammatory arthritis what forms of inflammatory arthritis do you know that might do this so the first thing what you you know what’s the differential diagnosis one’s been suggested i mean one’s been suggested as polyarticular gout rheumatoid arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis</u>
<u who="su">osteoarthritis</u>
<u who="nm5250">yeah <trunc>o</trunc> osteoarthritis could do that you’d expect really a a longer period of symptoms and a much smaller number of joints and also you wouldn’t expect the pain to move around in quite the way that it did so inflammatory osteoarthritis can certainly occur but it wouldn’t quite be in this distribution so the pattern of joints argues against inflammatory cause of O-A any other ideas</u>
<gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/>
<u who="nm5250">yeah the the other thing is in fact we discussed this case earlier so # uric acid was measured and it was eight-hundred and eighty-nine micromoles per litre and we would expect anything in this <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> above we’d expect it to be four-hundred and twenty or less so do you think that’s significant it is it’s a record in my personal experience # the solubility product of uric acid is only three-hundred and sixty and you find it physically difficult to get much more than about seven-hundred micograms into a biological solution and eight-hundred and eighty-nine so is is close to a record i think people have seen thousands why do you think this chap has got gout </u>

<u who="nm5250">yeah he’s recently had a myocardial infarction and he’s been put on diuretics that’s one one answer one contribution what else</u> 
<gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/>
<u who="nm5250">well he’s got renal failure absolutely the renal failure itself directly why do you think he’s had renal failure in a chap like this what are the causes of renal failure that you consider</u> 
<gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/>
<u who="nm5250">in very very simple terms</u>
<u who="su">drug induced</u>
<u who="nm5250">so you think of drugs so what are the drugs that he’s on that might have done it</u>
<gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/>
<u who="nm5250">well the N-S-A-I-Ds the N-S-A-I-Ds converted mild renal failure to acute renal failure with a creatinine of about five-hundred i think three or four-hundred anyway so non-steroidals in this situation especially dangerous</u>
<gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/>
<u who="nm5250">yeah non-steroidals and ACE inhibitors are a nasty combination because the ACE inhibitors decrease renal blood flow and then non-steroidals decrease it further so prostacyclin’s are particularly important for capillary and papillary blood flow and so if you have any degree of renal artery stenosis that’s induced by the ramipril that he was put on for his last heart attack and then in addition you drop the plasma volume by putting him on a diuretic you dry him out a bit because he’s developed an illness he’s developed gout and his renal function’s getting worse and then you throw a non-steroidal on top # that’s quite quite a dangerous combination and why i particularly point that out is that in most people who develop very acute gout # with diuretics far far safer to put them on steroids everyone tells you about how dangerous steroids are are much safer in this situation than non-steroidals which are dangerous difficult tablets to use in people with chronic heart or renal disease so if you see heart failure put the non-steroidals to one side because the next thing is there’ll be a you know a proportion of them will end up being admitted with an exacerbation of their heart failure and they are # in the right circumstances quite strongly sodium retaining # so i would say that this chap’s polyarticular gout is probably mostly iatrogenic although i would suspect that with that he has a degree of hyperuricemia and then on top of it he developed <trunc>chr</trunc> acute renal failure which was drug induced plus he had reduced renal blood flow because of his previous treatments and he developed what’s actually although at the top of the differential diagnosis here # polyarticular gout actually that’s # # an uncommon presentation of gout # but never the less # # an important one are there any other differential diagnoses that you would consider in a chap like this any other arthritis’s you know at all</u>
<u who="su">septic</u>
<u who="nm5250">septic arthritis </u>
<u who="su">yes</u>
<u who="nm5250">when you mean septic do you mean an infection in the joint itself yes i mean that that’s a reasonable thing to consider with a CRP of sixty in fact your C-R-Ps a hundred and fifty-seven # however you would expect a septic arthritis really to involve one or two joints and for him to be systemically unwell so it’s certainly something to consider but i would say that the pattern here of a septic arthritis # # it would be an unlikely presentation but infection and arthritis you’re on the right track does anyone know of any other yeah</u>

<u who="su"><gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> been any recent trauma <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/></u>
<u who="nm5250">yeah what would you expect with gout </u>
<u who="su">alcohol</u>
<u who="nm5250">alcohol brilliant who said alcohol very good # a decent alcohol history’s a rare thing in history taking because # doctors as a bunch tend to be a sort of polite group on the whole and rather than you know getting down to the nitty gritty # and really getting a proper alcohol history the only way to get an alcohol history is to really get the patient to describe what they drink over two or three days and you often come to a surprising conclusion do it yourselves just on a piece of paper don’t or not if you’re too frightened but but alcohol as a predisposition to gout is quite important # so high alcohol intake family history the previous history with other forms of arthritis like rheumatoid arthritis the length of the history when a joints involved tends to be weeks or months what’s the typical length of history with gout of a swelling like that how long’s that likely to last for any idea hands up anybody anyone with personal experience family members no life time risk is one in a hundred someone here has got a family member with gout # typically it’s only a few days and in fact the polyarticular gout is unusual in that that chap’s had illness over several weeks and that’s just a manifestation of the severity # of the illness # typically only a few days and how if you get an attack of gout how typically if you say your first attack how long would you say it’s likely to be before you get your next attack hands up anybody</u>
<gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/>
<u who="nm5250">typically up to a year so one of the things that's critical is just ask them if they've ever had it again and what you ought to try and see is what would you expect the natural history of multiple attacks of gout to do you know the background pathology is hyperuricemia so there's a number of # # # processes which lead to accumulation of uric acid in the body so your total body uric acid slowly rises what would you expect to do because what you expect i guess is what happens is you get an attack and then the period before the next attack is quite long we call that the inter-critical period and what happens is that the inter-critical period gets shorter and shorter and shorter until eventually you'd be <trunc>get</trunc>  into the realms of polyarticular gout at which point you're often getting tophi and so forth so the pattern of gout is of attacks which are isolated short-lived typically ignored even though they must be they're dreadfully painful but you know going to see your doctor particularly in the N-H-S is even more painful i think so people often ignore these things for quite a while so typically you'll get a history of at least three or four attacks often over a two or three year period but the gap between the attacks getting less and if there's a major alcohol component then that's all accelerated right so acute monoarthritis trauma bacterial arthritis crystal arthropathies reactive arthritis they're the four things that you need to remember there are other things that do it but that's if you want to get honours and things of that sort or want to be # a rheumatologist but four things to remember trauma and crystal arthropathy being very common bacterial arthritis being very rare but you mustn't miss it now what are you going to do here's someone else with a monoarthritis what what are you going to do you've got a history the history has told you it's an inflammatory arthritis and # there isn't any trauma they're not an alcoholic they don't think it's happened before what might you do next </u>
<gap reason="inaudible" extent="uncertain"/>
<u who="nm5250">well you don't you haven't got a diagnosis at this point so probably you've examined them you've not found any tophi if you've found out that they're on diuretics you might then be suspicious of gout but how are you going to prove the diagnosis so at this point you've got a differential diagnosis what are you going to do to nail the diagnosis </u>
<gap reason="inaudible" extent="uncertain"/>
<u who="nm5250">absolutely most people say do an x-ray so here's a normal x-ray # mostly useless in acute monoarthropathy and absolutely right you'd aspirate the joint # we do x-rays of these acutely swollen joints but they're pretty useless just a waste of the country's money generally speaking the most important thing is a needle in and here's pus from a joint and importantly although we've put joint sepsis at the top that appearance could be caused by gout pseudo gout rheumatoid arthritis virtually any inflammatory disorder and so what would you do next to try and make a diagnosis microscopy and if it's gout the thing that's most helpful really is # light this is # polarised light microscopy and what you see is these these are # gout crystals about # a hundred microns along and to make the absolute diagnosis what's nice to see is a gout crystal in a neutrophil and strictly speaking that's the way you make the perfect diagnosis you demonstrate the gout crystal in the cell because a few background gout crystals are quite common and here's how difficult it is to see without light microscopy so you'd just see a smudge with a bit of a bar across it i don't think unless you were very very skilled down a microscope you'd be particularly # # taken with that appearance and there's the polarised # # view with the crystal clearly seen within the cell so not using polarised light microscopy makes seeing the crystals very very difficult probably the commonest reason the crystals are not often picked up # and as we've described here's someone with gout and it can look like cellulitis when it's very severe here's a little old lady with some renal impairment who had been put on diuretics bashed her hand # and got this very severe appearance which was in fact treated with antibiotics for a couple of days because everyone assumed that it had to be cellulitis here's someone else with chronic renal impairment who's got swelling of the toes and bilateral swelling of the M-T-P's but in fact was polyarticular gout so although gout is a form of monoarthritis # it is one of the differentials of polyarthritis and so i'm sort of rather # labouring the polyarticular presentation here these are tophi and they're typically present really only after # two three four years of hyperuricemia but they're very distinctive there's a white appearance underneath red typically not at all painful # and it's best not to stick a needle into them because # you can get chronic # sinuses forming # and infection and here is a tophus on an ear and here is the sort of nineteenth century version of severe gout in someone who felt that they were allergic to the treatment and didn't try any other medications # so gout is a fairly nasty disease and i suppose untreated has a mortality because they tend to get worsening renal failure and # then heart failure which can be quite so the gout itself with a uric acid of eight eight-hundred nine-hundred can itself # add to renal failure by a urate nephropathy which is both affecting the glomerulus and # # caused by some crystallisation within the tubules and it can mimic rheumatoid nodules # # whereas this is in fact a tophus rather than a rheumatoid nodule and if you feel it it feels quite different # what i want to show you here really before we move onto # # something else # is the distribution of uric acid in normal people and also in people with # # gout and there's one bar <trunc>mi</trunc>  this is a normal distribution which is meant to go down to here so a small proportion of people with gout don't try and read the numbers # have uric acids of only three or four-hundred sort of five per cent the average level here is around about three-hundred and eighty to four-hundred that's where most of us lie and up to # fifteen per cent of people with gout have value # of uric acid when you measure them at that length and this value here is six-hundred basically virtually no-one goes above six-hundred because of the physio-chemical properties of uric acid normal people without gout also drop up into the level up to here so you can have people with # levels of uric acid of four-hundred and forty four-hundred and fifty who've never had an attack of gout so those distributions cross over and the range of which they cross over will encompass almost fifty per cent of people with gout which is why uric acid is a very poor discriminator which is why # we you cannot use the presence of hyperuricemia # # <trunc>t</trunc>  to diagnose gout although you can say that if you have a level of gout # a level of of uric acid below three-hundred and twenty gout becomes very very unlikely now here's someone else with a a monoarthritis which isn't gout and that was seen from their shoulder so does anybody know what the diagnosis is here yeah any i've heard the i've heard it mentioned in the audience anyone got an idea what that is so it was a monoarthritis affecting the shoulder someone who is systemically quite well # an elderly person about sixty-five # pus essentially was removed from their shoulder stuff very yellow high neutrophil count with a negative Gram stain so no infection and there were the crystals that were seen and it is yeah come on <gap reason="inaudible" extent="uncertain"/> pseudo gout and these are little rhomboidal crystals that you see in pseudo gout and here's a sort of scanning electron microscope it's they're they're much smaller they're about a quarter of the length of gout and they have positive birefringence rather than negative birefringence and what can sometimes be seen on x-rays is a very faint line it's # probably faint on this projection to the point where it vanishes can you see a little line there maybe that's chondrocalcinosis and one of the hallmarks which on plain x-ray may give you a clue as to the presence of pseudo gout and i've just shown this in as # a monoarthritis in a young boy with a very high fever the one discriminating feature for septic arthritis normally is a fever and typically you get spiking temperatures above thirty-seven so not a low grade fever but a decent fever and that's a very marked indicator of septic arthritis and again it becomes critical that you aspirate the joint # critical that you aspirate the joint and do blood cultures before you put people # on antibiotics # here on this side is the result of joint destruction from a staphylococcal # arthritis compared to the relatively normal x-ray on that side someone we'd missed now chap in the blue shirt #
