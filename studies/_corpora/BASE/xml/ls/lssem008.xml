<u who="nm5266">we're going to # start off # by talking about # venous thrombosis this evening # the # you won't be able to read the # slide up up there but it says # didn't you tell sister that you're only just visiting and # we do need to be clear sometimes why we're here and what we're actually doing and # we're going to talk about # pulmonary embolism and venous thromboembolic disease i think the first thing to say is that # venous thromboembolic disease is not necessarily an acute problem it's better really to think of it as a chronic condition because many patients having had an acute episode of venous thrombosis have a further event and some of the long term sequelae of # having a venous thrombosis can be long lasting and effect patients throughout their life clearly the thing that we're concerned about is patients who have an extensive deep vein thrombosis embolising and that clot ending up in the lungs causing a pulmonary embolism # pulmonary embolism clinical presentation you may have seen but # # for a significant percentage of patients it may just be that # the only they have is that they have an acute fatality and that is one of the presentations more commonly of course they present with pleuritic chest pain or hemoptysis or just simply increasing breathlessness and # it is part of the disease of # venous thromboembolic disease if you actually look in patients who've had a deep vein thrombosis for evidence of a # pulmonary embolism then you will find if you look hard enough and use enough radiological techniques that the majority of them do have some evidence of pulmonary embolism so # we need to remember that # venous thromboembolism is a serious problem and # it can present without signs and symptoms # it's also a common problem in hospital because many patients are obviously immobile and once you put people to bed and # keep them in hospital for significant periods of time then their risk of developing developing a pulmonary embolism increases # the good thing to say about it is that most patients # most cases of pulmonary embolism are preventable and # with the use of prophylactic measures for patients particularly in the post-operative period but also acutely ill medical patients # should be receiving some form of thromboprophylaxis to prevent them having # a pulmonary embolism so most events are preventable and venous thromboembolic disease is a chronic problem alright we have lots and lots of patients nowadays who are put on anticoagulant treatment and you do need to know quite a bit about anticoagulant management because when you're a houseman one of the things that you're guaranteed you're going to have to do is to manage patients in terms of their anticoagulant therapy in terms of # the numbers of patients on oral anticoagulants well the numbers increase year-by-year large numbers of patients are now put on oral anticoagulants because of atrial fibrillation patients with venous thromboembolic disease are in general kept on longer and longer periods of anticoagulation compared with even a matter of a few years ago and we will go through that now # this a picture of the mother-in-law and it's probably her most appealing # aspect # but the problems that you get with acute venous thrombotic events do become chronic and here you can see the typical lady who has bilateral swollen # legs with chronic venous congestion these legs are at risk of ulceration and # it leg ulcers account for an incredible amount of morbidity and if you actually # cost out the amount of money that the N-H-S spends on leg ulcers from people who've got chronic venous problems it is a major major problem and it's something which you don't really see unless you're in # primary care because you see the patients who come in with an acute venous thrombosis they're treated you think that's all fine they've gone away but in fact there are lots of problems with chronic post-phlebitic syndrome and chronic venous congestion right the other thing to say is that there are certain clinical states that are associated with an increased risk of venous thrombosis and clearly a number of these will be well known to you but pregnancy particularly in the post-partum period # throughout pregnancy there is a slight increase risk of # venous thrombosis but that increase increases particularly after thirty weeks and is at the highest in the six weeks in the post-partum period so when we give prophylaxis in pregnancy # inevitably we're going to use anticogulate patients in the six week's post-partum and then depending on other factors whether we would do it antenataly or not the thing we don't do nowadays # is put patients to bed because we're worried about the clot moving # it used to be # the situation whereby people and particularly some of the older nursing staff would be terrified that patients if they moved would end up throwing a bit of clot off and in point of fact all that did was help extend the clot # so it's important that patients are mobilised at the earliest opportunity however extensive their clot is so don't think that a little bit of clot that's moving around # is going to be more at risk by mobilising people it's much worse if you leave them and let them just sit so venous thrombosis is a problem that's particularly associated following trauma to the legs particularly associated with # post-surgical period particularly associated with orthopoedic surgery well how do we actually # <trunc>sc</trunc> screen and examine for a start patients with # suspected venous thrombosis well there are a number of clinical screening tests that you need to be aware of and depending on what the # system is in the local hospital it could be any combination of some of these but perhaps one of the commonest practices is to perform a clinical probability score in other words i'll go through that but it means actually carrying out a proper clinical examination and actually scoring the patient # as to whether they would be at high moderate or low risk # sometimes # ultrasonography is used as a screening test there's impedence plethysmography # and although less commonly used venometry is less commonly used now whereby you inject a dye into the leg it's certainly not used very commonly as a screening test but may be used as a diagnostic test commonly used is the D-Dimer test now the D-Dimer is a fragment of cross-linked fibrin and is raised in probably ninety-nine per cent patients who've got evidence of venous thromboembolic disease it is however not specific for venous thrombosis and can be raised in a variety of other acute medical problems so in acute infection it's raised almost inevitably in pregnancy so just having a raised D-Dimer is not a reason to investigate someone further for venous thromboembolic disease unless you have some clinical probability score to go with it so we don't want you ordering a D-Dimer on anybody who comes in with chest pain just because it's next to the box where you tick cardiac enzymes if somebody comes in with a myocardial infarction the D-Dimer's almost inevitably going to be raised as well what it's detecting is the presence of new clot formation a negative D-Dimer however is helpful because if you've got a negative result then it really is unlikely that you've got evidence of venous thrombotic disease so you need to be careful how you interpret it so it has a very good negative predictive value it has a low positive predictive value # just to go through some of the diagnostic techniques used in # the diagnosis of # deep vein thrombosis historically venography has been the gold standard that # has been used whereby you inject a dye into the dorsal # venous arch and # you look for evidence of filling defects the other thing you have to remember with venography is that a small percentage of patients if you inject a dye into their leg will develop a D-V-T as a result of it impedence plethysmography i won't spend any time on but it's a useful screeing test the ultrasound is much more commonly used and doppler ultrasound # is perhaps the most commonly used # screening technique # and diagnostic technique now # in the United Kingdom certainly diagnostic technique the disadvantage of using an ultrasound is that clots below the calf are often not apparent on ultrasound now you may argue that that isn't that important because it's clots that are above the knee are the one's which extend particularly and embolise but if you carry out serial doppler scans of calf vein thrombosis then a substantial number of them will actually extend above the knee so overall we would recommend that patients who have calf vein thrombosis also receive anticoagulant treatment now when you're assessing these patients you need to do a clinical pre-test probability and as i've said there are major minor scoring systems so this is sort of a a scheme that you might adopt if you've got somebody with a suspected # deep vein thrombosis you would carry out the probability score # you would carry out a D-Dimer measurement if the D-Dimer is raised if you have a high clinical probability score then these patients # should have some further diagnostic technique such as a venous compression ultrasonography for patients in whom # the ultrasound is negative and you have a still have a high clinical probability then you may go on and look at other techniques in particular perhaps then venography so these are some of the clinical criteria for major scores for deep vein thrombosis and really # when you're clerking these patients in it'd be important to have this score in front of you so most hospitals would have some pathway with these sort of scoring systems on them as you'll see if patients have cancer they're at significantly higher risk of having a deep vein thrombosis sixteen per cent of all patients with deep vein thrombosis have cancer have known cancer at the time of presentation obviously if patients are paralysed or immobilised for substantial periods of time that's an important factor if they're bedridden and had recent surgery if they have clinical signs of localised tenderness if they have measurable differences in the diameters measured at the calf or at the thigh then that's a significant factor also if they have a strong family history of venous thrombosis or if they've got previous venous thrombotic events themselves then clearly they're that much more at risk and then there are some minor points which are less important # # mild erythema if they've been hospitalised within the previous six months so there are some minor scores there which have some slight relevance and basically using these sort of clinical # algorithm you can come to some conclusion as to the probability of whether they're got a venous thrombosis this is very useful it's very important that if you're going to use a D-Dimer score that you do this in conjunction with it right well there are different methods of measuring D-Dimer's some of which you can do at the bedside there are some near patient tests that you can # use there's a test called a simply red score and this test # could be used in primary care it doesn't actually give any specific quantitation it just gives a positive or negative result there are more specific techniques in the laboratory whereby you can measure the # D-Dimer which are better in many respects but they do take longer to perform i won't spend too much time on the rest of that okay so there are a number of factors in terms of managing <trunc>v</trunc> venous thrombosis # it's important that if you've got a patient with suspected venous thrombosis that # these patients are commenced on the low molecular weight heparin # there may be time some delay sometimes in getting # diagnostic procedures performed but if you've done a clinical probability and a D-Dimer score there and then you're pretty well on the way to making a a reasonable conclusion we would normally suggest you use low molecular weight heparin # unfractionated heparin is dangerous if it were had came to the situation now where it had to be approved by the F-D-A i don't think unfractionated heparin would actually get a license it's difficult to monitor and invariably you never get it right so it's much easier to use low molecular weight heparin it's given on a weight adjusted basis doesn't require monitoring there are factors which clearly affect # patients # how long they're actually # in hospital or how they're treatments going to be <trunc>man</trunc> monitored # depending on the patients age mobility and # concurrent medical illness the vast majority of patients i would think well over ninety per cent of our patients in South Warwickshire don't actually get admitted to hospital they actually are treated on an outpatient basis alright well i think that's probably as much as i want to say about the management of # venous thrombosis at present # other than to reiterate it's a chronic problem and this is the sort of chronic mess that patients can get into here you can see some really gross venous congestion in a lady who's got a history of recurrent venous thrombosis i think the only other thing to say is how long do you actually anticoagulate somebody for if it's a first venous thrombotic event then for patients who've got clots certainly above the calf i think a minimum of six months anticoagulation for a new case of venous thrombosis and for pulmonary embolism again a minimum of six months anticoagulant treatment there is increasing evidence however that # because the recurrence rate is something like six to seven per cent per annum so in other words by five years thirty per cent of patients would have had a further venous thrombotic event that many of these patients may require longer periods of treatment and what we need to do is somehow to be able to identify those patients that are at greater risk of recurrence patients who have persistently high D-Dimer levels at the end of the period of anticoagulation would appear to be those among those who are at increased risk of # <trunc>re</trunc> recurrent thrombosis those who on repeat scanning have evidence of persistent clot also would appear to be at increased risk and it may well be in the not too distant future that the first venous thrombotic event may be required to be treated for longer than six months and certainly we'll have a better idea soon as to which of the patients who require longer term anticoagulant treatment and are at more risk of thrombosis just to finally say that if present with a deep vein thrombosis you're much more likely to have a further deep vein thrombosis if you present with a pulmonary embolism and you have a recurrence it's much more likely that there'll be a pulmonary embolism these legs break down and as i said venous thromboembolic disease is a chronic problem here's a chronic venous ulcer this could take anything up to twelve months to heal if it ever heals at all # so just to re-emphasise it is a medical problem that needs to be addressed properly thank you any questions quickly before we move on all seen lots of D-V-T's and patients with pulmonary emboli if you the best people to get hold of in your hospitals are to see the D-V-T nurses because you know they would see several patients # in a week with venous thrombosis and it's probably worth spending a day with them and seeing how they actually manage these patients because you might not actually see too many of them actually being admitted to the hospitals because they're mainly managed as outpatients right no questions fine well we're going to now talk about # thrombocytopoenia and # i'll hand over </u>
<u who="sm5268">hello there hiya good afternoon # today i'm going to be talking about purpura and # Emma's supposed to be doing it with me but she's sitting down at the moment so no it's cool okay firstly to <trunc>d</trunc> define purpura it's defined as a skin rash resulting from bleeding into the skin from small blood vessels and the individual small spots that we can see are known as petechaie i hope i've pronounced that right # they're part of the bleeding disorders they result they are a result of # blood vessel defect platelet defect or defect in the coagulation pathway and they can be classified as part of one of these groups now blood vessel defects can either be hereditary or acquired # the hereditary one's include hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia which is pretty rare and # other connective tissue disorders such as Ehlers-Danlos Marfan's syndrome and # osteogenesis imperfecta # the <trunc>acqui</trunc> acquired # blood vessel <trunc>defec</trunc> defects are due to severe infections such as meningococcal and typhoid # drugs such as steroids # allergic reactions such as Henoch-Schonlein purpura which occurs mainly in children and it's a type three hypersensitivity reaction # others include scurvy senile purpura and easy bruising syndrome now # another part of the classification is a <trunc>pla</trunc> platelet defect thrombocytopoenia # # decreased platelet number or decreased function that's one that we're going to be # focussing mainly on today and the third lot is a coagulation defect again that can be hereditary or ac-acquired the hereditary is haemophilia A or B or von von Willibrand's disease and the acquired is # via anticoagulant treatment liver disease or D-I-C # our current case presentation we saw Mr C he's a fifty-five year old he <trunc>c</trunc> was saw his G-P for bleeding gums he had a four-day history of bleeding gums and on further questioning he also said that he had a rash on his lower legs for many months but he he didn't you know take much notice of it he'd recently being taking diclofenac for back pain as well # he's asthmatic and has type two diabetes which he says is controlled mainly by diet and he also has a family history of type two diabetes # the drugs that he's on he's on # beclomethasone dipropionate for his asthma and salbutamol disc inhaler again # for his asthma he was taking diclofenac for back pain and # erythomycin he wasn't sure why he was put on them but i'm sure he had some kind of infection # social history he lives at home with his wife and he looks after the speedway track at Coventry he smokes # ten cigarettes per day and he has been doing for thirty years so he's got a fifteen pack year history of smoking and # he drinks sixteen units of alcohol per week on examination for a markedly obese gentleman # he had widespread petechiae on arms trunks and legs on his trunk and legs he had active gum bleeding # no lymphadenopathy or <trunc>hepatosp</trunc> splenomegaly however abdominal # examination was difficult and # B-P was one sixty over a hundred investigations # a full blood count showed a very low platelet count # # four times ten to the nine # it's usually above a hundred and fifty to four hundred # white cell count was normal and haemoglobin was normal # bone marrow examination showed normal cellularity and megakaryocytes which are precursors to the platelets they were normal as well # therefore based on these two tests there's more likely to it's more likely to be a peripheral destruction of the platelets # so we thought it <trunc>w</trunc> # the patient had chronic autoimmune thrombocytopenic purpura and # the consultant thought it was secondary to him taking diclofenac # treatment of this # # the first line of treatment is to give prednisolone sixty milligrams # once daily and he also prescribed <trunc>lansoprazo</trunc> lansoprazole for to protect the stomach and # thought it'd good to monitor his blood sugar levels as the steroids can have an effect on these # a follow-up one week later the bleeding had stopped and platelet count had increased to eighteen but it's not # it's not really a significant increase but we could see that the blood glucose was out of control it's fifteen millimols and # so the consultant decided to reduce the prednisolone gradually and add danazol which is a non-virulizing androgen # two weeks later platelet count again had risen to eighty-eight times ten to the nine and the haemoglobin was thirteen point five but as the blood sugars were still high # the the # consultant decided to add a hypoglycaemic agent for adequate control of this # Emma will carry on and talk a bit more about what will you talk about autoimmune thrombocytopenic purpura there we go </u>
<u who="sf5269">okay # yes i'm going to talk about autoimmune idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura it's # A-I-T-P which as the name suggests is an autoimmune disease # in which the platelets are destroyed by immune complexes # it's characterised by spontaneous bruising and # there's two clinical presentations which are the acute presentation and the chronic presentation # acute A-I-T-P # is usually seen in children # often after a viral infection # and it's thought that # destruction is due to the immune complex <trunc>d</trunc> deposition onto the platelets # but the # development of platelet auto antibodies is # responsible for the shortened lifespan # of the platelets # in chronic A-I-T-P # adult women are usually # affected # and it may occur in association with other autoimmune diseases such as lupus and thyroid diseases # but it may occur after viral infections particularly # those infected with the H-I-V virus # auto antibodies for the glycoproteins on the cell membrane of the platelets are found in sixty to seventy per cent of people # but it's thought that # in the remaining thirty to forty per cent there are actually auto antibodies they're just # not detected # the clinical features # include major haemorrhage although this is extremely rare and really only occurs in people # that have severe # thrombocytopenia # purpura easy bruising epistaxis and menorrhagia also can occur along with splenomegaly but # again that's # quite rare # for investigations # the only abnormality on the full blood count would be thrombocytopenia and # you could expect a platelet count of between thirty and a hundred # in people with # mild to moderate thrombocytopenia # a bone aspirate may reveal normal or increased # <trunc>megaka</trunc> megakaryocytes and of course # the auto antibodies to the glycoproteins on the platelet cell membrane # may be present # for the treatment # acute A-I-T-P # fortunately # usually it remits spontaneously # but this isn't the case for chronic A-I-T-P and # it's usually treated with prednisolone # which works by reducing the production of the auto antibodies # and it also removes antibody coated platelets from the system # with twenty per cent of people who # undergo prednisolone treatment # it's a they have a complete response and they don't require any other other # form of treatment # sixty per cent # have a partial response and have of these # may not require a treatment or if they do they have a maintenance dose of prednisolone about five to fifteen milligrams daily # the remaining half # may require a splenectomy # and ninety per cent of people who undergo a splenectomy have # a successful remission # some of the remainder may also respond to # other immunosuppresive drugs such as cyclophosphamide or danazol which # our patient Mr C was on # there's also a # high dose infusion of immunoglobulin which has the effect of blocking F-C receptors on the macrophages in the spleen # and # therefore there's a # transient increase in platelet count # and this can be used for people who have # had a recent haemorrhage or in preparation for surgery that's it</u>
<gap reason="inaudible" extent="uncertain"/>
<u who="nm5266">fine so we're going to talk about # thrombocytopenia and particularly # immune mediated thrombocytopenia # in terms of your differential diagnosis # when a child in particular turns up with increased bruising and purpura usually the parents have already made a diagnosis in that they already think that they've got a child who's got leukaemia and # you do need to be # careful as to # what you actually say to these patients and to the relatives bearing in mind that immune thrombocytopenic purpura is much more common than leukaemia and # it is a not uncommon # problem that # paediatricians have to manage the usual clue of course is that in these patients they usually have a normal haemoglobin and they have a normal white count with quite a marked reduction in platelet count where as in leukaemias you usually have abnormalities in several of the cell lines so the patient is usually anaemic and thrombocytopenic the white count might be low or it might be significantly raised so # just by looking at the blood count you can get a pretty good idea so an isolated thrombocytopenia in a child who's otherwise pretty well and has a normal haemoglobin and white count would very much be in # make the diagnosis of # I-T-P # for the majority of children if that was the blood picture you got you probably wouldn't feel justified in doing a bone marrow i think you would only feel justified in doing a bone marrow in a child in this situation if you felt you had to treat the child in other words you were going to give them steroids and the reason that you would need to do a bone marrow in that situation is that if you did have an acute leukaemia the common type of childhood leukaemia of course does respond to steroids and you might # make the diagnosis extremely difficult and # the child might go into a temporary remission and of course it'd be that much worse when they relapsed a few weeks later so as long as you haven't got # other abnormalities in the blood count i think you can be fairly confident you've just got an isolated thrombocytopenia that that's the most likely cause of thrombocytopenia in a child there is one other condition you need to be aware of in children and in these children they have a prodromal illness of bloody diarrhoea # and they have a haemolytic anaemia with fragmented red cells and they have a degree of renal impairment together with thrombocytopenia and who can tell me what that is well the condition is called the haemolytic uremic syndrome and if you think of Mr Barr you know Mr Barr in Scotland who sold dodgy pasties to his clientele and # several of the clientele went down with food poisoning with diarrhoea bloody diarrhoea a number of these patients went on to develop chronic renal problems and this is due to ingestion of e-coli and a <trunc>pers</trunc> specific serotype of e-coli O-H-one-five-seven and this serotype of O-H-one-five-seven produced an exotoxin called verocytotoxin and it's the verocytotoxin in conjunction with cytokine release that causes the haemolytic uremic syndrome that is a much more significant and it is important to be part of your differential diagnosis in a child so a child with thrombocytopenia and bloody diarrhoea you do not just assume it's I-T-P a child with an abnormality in the haemoglobin or white count you do not assume it's I-T-P those'd be the common presentations of thrombocytopenia in in childhood # it does spontaneously remit in children in the majority of cases so often time just tells # a very small percentage do go on and get chronic I-T-P the adult situation as we've heard already is different because the majority of adults who develop I-T-P it is a chronic problem # and really a differential diagnosis in a adult with a particularly low platelet count is is it due to increased platelet consumption as we've heard with I-T-P where by the antibodies sorry the platelets are covering in antibody and the spleen removes the antibody coated platelets more quickly than normal or is it due to a problem in terms of marrow production so # you're more likely to end up doing a bone marrow in adult patients with # suspected chronic I-T-P and as we've heard the management is difficult in that there is no really # simple and easy way of improving the platelet count can you do with steroids but you don't want to put young patients on steroids for the next twenty thirty years of their life # and some of these patients would come to splenectomy splenectomy would result in round about eighty per cent of patients being cured with round about twenty per cent still having chronic problems and as we've heard patients coming in bleeding with significant clinical problems and I-T-P you would give them an immunoglobulin infusion because that would the quickest way of actually in getting the platelet count up okay right we're going to move on now to # anaemias unless anybody's got any desperate questions that they want to ask </u>
<u who="sm5267">oh how do i get it up on the screen okay great # okay Rena and i are going to present two patients with anaemia and # anaemia's defined as low haemoglobin concentration it's normally characterised or # put into three different groups microcytic normocytic and macrocytic and those terms refer to the actual volume of the red cell so in microcytic anaemia the the volume of the average red blood cell is reduced <trunc>w</trunc> along with the haemoglobin in normocytic # anaemia the volume of the red blood cells stay the same and in macrocytic anaemia the volume of the red blood cell increases even though the haemoglobin concentration has come down which is the definition of anaemia # just add a bit of tangential thinking into this talk # the aim is that you try and work out the association between the city in the background and microcytic anaemia and there is a link and there's just going to be two clues and the first clue is that the fountain is the tallest fountain in the world the one that you can see there so going to present a eighty-one year old female M-L who is a former shop assistant we saw her in the haematology clinic in the outpatient clinic and she presented with shortness of breath fatigue and headache which # had been going on for two days two days prior to her presentation at the clinic she'd been venous sected # for a condition known as hereditary haemochromotosis and i'll mention that in a in a minute after the venous section she had collapsed in the clinic but she hadn't lost consciousness since that time after she'd gone home she had been constantly short of breath she felt very tired and had had a persistent headache that normal analgesia hadn't done anything about and exactly the same # pattern of of events had occurred three months earlier when she had previously been for her venous section treatment # hereditary haemochromotosis it's # an inherited disorder of increased iron absorption and it leads to deposition of iron in lots of different organs and it's worth knowing something about because it's the commonest recessive autosomal # condition in Northern Europe so it does present quite frequently in Ireland the U-K Scandinavia and Germany the treatment is venous section which basically means that the person goes along to the clinic and # they're bled they're bled # a unit of of blood or one to two units of blood she also # had osteoporosis she'd had her both her hips replaced in nineteen-eighty-eight but there was no other significant history of of illness or operations from systems review her only medication she was on taking calcium tablets aspirin and she didn't have any allergies her family history wasn't particularly significant her father died at fifty-seven from an M-I her mother had died in her eighties from old age and # her brother also had this condition hereditary haemochromotosis she lives with her husband she has good support from her three children and she doesn't have any significant smoking or alcohol history examination on the whole was unremarkable # she did have pallor in the conjunctivi and her shortness of breath was very evident # when she was moving around in in the room and as she was actually walking in into the room where we saw her significant negative findings related to anaemia there was no koilonychia nail spooning which is associated with iron deficiency # anaemia no glossitis a swelling of the tongue another sign to look out for in anaemia normally in microcytic anaemia it's painless but in macrocytic anaemia it's normally painful that's glossitis # no angular <trunc>sto</trunc> stomatitis that's ulceration in the mouth normally beginning on the corners of the mouth and also no telangiectasia # the small dilated capillaries that occur in little red spots and in some people in this condition hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia they can occur in the mouth and bleed leading to anaemia so it's worth looking out for those particular signs but they weren't found in her # examination of her cardiovascular system respiratory system and abdomen were all unremarkable we next # took a look at # some of her blood values and these showed us that her haemoglobin level was down which wasn't surprising i mean we'd we had thought initially about anaemia shortness of breath headache are quite common presenting complaints associated with anaemia her urethra sites were down as well her mean <trunc>m</trunc> # corpuscular volume that's the M-C-V that's the actual volume of the red blood cell and that's what <trunc>differ</trunc> differentiates anaemia into microcytic normocytic or macrocytic that was reduced indicating a microcytic anaemia the two # last # parameters the mean corpuscular haemoglobin is the average amount of haemoglobin in the average red blood cell it's in picograms that was reduced and the mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration the concentration of haemoglobin in in a known # # <trunc>conce</trunc> in a known volume of blood that was also reduced as well because of her # reduced M-C-V or mean corpuscular volume which is indicative of a microcytic anaemia we looked at her iron levels because iron deficiency is the <trunc>c</trunc> one of the commonest causes if not the commonest cause of microcytic anaemia we saw that her serum iron was reduced her serum ferritin which is one of the # # proteins that's which # stores which is # bound to iron which stores iron that was reduced but the actual capacity to # bind iron was increased so we've got here a lady who presented with shortness of breath headache we we noticed that she had pallor in in her conjuctivi we know that her # haemoglobin is definitely reduced and it looks like a microcytic anaemia and as i said for that reason we looked at the iron # levels so as i said they're the common presenting features of anaemia shortness of breath tiredness headache there was nothing else really in the history or examination that indicated a cardiovascular or pulmonary # cause the onset of the symptoms had been related we they were related to this venous section that had occurred two days prior to her presentation and # the haemotological investigations indicate that it was a microcytic anaemia what i'd like to do now just go through the main causes of microcytic anaemia with the reduced M-C-V the first one as i said is iron deficiency that's the most common cause alpha and beta thalassemias and the traits of those that also can cause microcytic anaemia and something called congenital sideroblastic anaemia Rena's going to mention another form of that but that's very rare indeed because of her reduced iron levels we were looking more towards her anaemia being caused by # iron deficiency which if you think about it is kind of paradoxical given that she's got this hereditary haemochromotosis which is iron overloading you have to remember that the whole point of venous secting somebody for hereditary haemochromotosis is actually to make somebody slightly iron deficient because they've got this iron overload but you don't want them to necessarily become anaemic the main causes of iron deficiency anaemia the first one is blood loss most common certainly # in women that are menstruating in menorrhagia G-I bleeding particularly be aware of occult G-I bleeding the second clue to the # the tangential thinking by the way is that hookworm globally is the commonest cause of # iron deficiency anaemia due to the bleeding that it causes the G-I bleeding but in this case it seemed it is was quite an unusual presentation because it seemed that the lady's venous section treatment was almost like an iatrogenic anaemia it had actually been caused by her venous section the other causes of # iron deficiency are decreased absorption for example in celiac disease and also in partial and total gastrectomies and also # poor diet poor iron intake and that's especially in children so the # diagnosis of of this patient which isn't particularly common but it's worth bearing in mind is that although she was iron overloaded she went for treatment to reduce the iron by venous section and paradoxically became so iron deficient that she ended up with a microcytic anaemia and # that's the end of the talk oh yeah does anybody know what the connection is</u>

<u who="nm5266">i i i think if anybody had actually worked out that connection they should leave the room actually because # they're obviously # mentally unstable so # it's important really to be aware of the common conditions that cause # iron deficiency and # we've had a very good presentation to tell us about those # haemochromotosis is is an interesting condition as we've heard the gene frequency is really quite high and really # these patients can go on and develop quite severe liver problems # and many of the patients will present at a time when # it's all a bit too late so patients anybody presenting with liver disease liver failure # unexplained jaundice # is somebody who you would actually # look for the presence of iron overload and many of these patients at presentation will have ferritin levels of several thousand # so they'll have very high ferritin levels and # the iron can get deposited in a variety of different organs not only just the liver it can get deposited in the in the myocardium and can get deposited in a variety of endocrine <trunc>organism</trunc> organs so that they can present with # hypopituitarism they can present with # # problems that are # secondary to the # pancreas as well okay any questions about # iron deficiency for a start remember common things are common as we've heard children don't eat very much vegans don't eat very much iron take very much iron # there's a lot of iron in red meat if you don't take red meat # be suspicious that # there may be a dietary cause and of course the commonest reason in females relates to menorrhagia so you do need to be aware of that older patients # you do need to be aware that a male let's say in their forties presenting with iron deficiency anaemia without other obvious reason you would be suspicious of some pathology within their G-I tract and that would clearly be an indication to investigate them for a variety of conditions and in particular to exclude the presence of a neoplasm in the bowel okay right thank you very much we'll # move on and # we're now going to have something on macrocytic anaemias</u>
<u who="sf5270">how is everybody alright okay # thanks Mike # i'm going to talk about anaemia # and that's just a picture of Victoria where i live i just thought i'd add to the entertainment today # right i saw P-K it's a sixty year old year old female # in the haematology clinic and she presented actually to her G-P with shortness of breath she was feeling tired and was lacking in energy for the past few months # so <trunc>bas</trunc> and then the other symptoms that she didn't have which are tend to be associated with anaemia since this is a talk on anaemia are dizziness # palpitations and headache which are the cardiac response to lack of oxygen # ringing in the ear anorexia dyspepsia bowel disturbance and sometimes in elderly patients you can get angina and intermittent <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> and confusion but she didn't have any of those # the past medical history # there was nothing really relevant # she had # venous surgery D-V-T's # no history of # blood loss or iron deficiency # nothing relevant in her drug history or family history she was a non-smoker and a non-drinker on examination # it was actually a follow-up appointment but there are no specific signs were found actually # her cardiovascular and respiratory and abdomen # examinations were all normal # yeah # signs that you might see in an anaemic patient are pallor of the mucous membranes hyperdynamic circulation which is # tachycardia bounding pulse cardiomegaly systolic flow murmur and congestive heart failure and there's also specific signs that you can find with different types of anaemia # for example the first one that i've mentioned there the spooning nails painless glossitis and the <trunc>sto</trunc> stomatitis as with iron deficiency that's what Mike spoke about you can get jaundice with haemolitic or <trunc>meglobas</trunc> megloblastic anaemia and with sickle cell or other haemolitic anaemias you can get leg ulcers and # sometimes with thalassemia and # haemolitic anaemia you can get bone deformities and you might also see hepatosplenomegaly and those are pictures out of Epstein right so this patient # the blood results were actually done at their G-P's and as you can see the patient is clearly anaemic # with low haemoglobin and if you look at the M-C-V # she's got a macrocytic anaemia so what are we thinking macrocytic anaemia differential diagnosis # B-twelve or folic deficiency it could be caused by alcohol or liver disease # cyotoxic drugs such as # hydroxyurea # myodysplastic syndromes <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> infiltrations haemolysis and # other drugs it can also be caused by hypothyroidism haemolysis and aplastic # conditions but that's also sometimes shows in normocytic anaemia so that's why it's starred so further investigations that were done in this patient # serum B-twelve was fine serum folic was fine antibodies to gastric parietal cells and intrinsic factor were negative so that rules out your # B-twelve or folic deficiency LFT's were normal E-S-R was fine and thyroid function tests were normal so what do we do next do a bone marrow biopsy bone marrow biopsy's can show four things it can show that you can have a megaloblastic anaemia a normoblastic erythropoiesis increased erythropoiesis or an abnormal erythropoiesis and in this patient the patient was found to have sideroblastic anaemia from the bone marrow biopsy right what is <trunc>b</trunc> # sideroblastic anaemia it is characterised by the <trunc>in</trunc> incorporation of iron into <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> you get iron overloading and you get ring sideroblasts causes it's a bit confusing here because the congenital type you actually get a microcytic anaemia but the acquired type which is what this patient has is a is a macrocytic anaemia and those can be caused by myeloid stem cell disorders toxic toxins drugs alcohol and sometimes it can be idiopathic features that you can see in sideroblastic anaemia it tends to occur in older adults it's a progressive anaemia and you get hepatosplenomegaly sometimes you can get neutropenia and <trunc>thrombocy</trunc> cytopoenia may develop and # the bone marrow that you might see is that ninety per cent of red cell precursors are destroyed and you get a high rate of erythropoiesis and you'll see ring sideroblasts and ring sideroblasts are red cell precursors with iron deposits around the nucleus and they look that that so you see the little ring yeah alright # so management it's okay Gavin # is to remove the precipitating factor so if it's caused by alcohol or something or drugs that a patient's taking stop those # treat the underlying disorder if there is one and supportive care so blood transfusions antibiotics and iron chelation for the iron overloading # because that can have effects as well back to this patient # this patient has a mild dysplastic condition so there's no way to improve the anaemia they are considering to do thalidomide and erythropoietin injections to help that but it's not sure if whether that will work she's been prescribed folic acid because the bone marrow's in hyperdrive so you want to make sure that you have enough nutrients and she's been given two units of blood and at this point the patient's just going to be given supportive care so just treat the symptoms as they come so and that's Victoria as well so</u>
<u who="nm5266">right so if you've got somebody with a macrocytic # anaemia to start with # perhaps the commonest cause # that you would # find in this country probably relates to alcohol alcohol # more often than not will produce a macrocytosis it doesn't always produce an anaemia unless you've got one or two other features to go with it but if you had folate deficiency which you can have in association with # alcoholic liver disease or if you had a big spleen and hypersplenism so that the cells are being gobbled up in your spleen that also could be associated with an anaemia # but # an elderly lady presenting with a macrocytic anaemia without a history of # increased alcohol intake i think your first thought would really be does this lady have pernicious anaemia and pernicious anaemia as # we've heard # is an disease whereby you have # an absence of production of intrinsic factor or reduced production of intrinsic factor and as you remember # intrinsic factor is produced in the <trunc>s</trunc> </u>
<gap reason="inaudible" extent="uncertain"/>
<u who="nm5266">stomach yes where in the stomach</u>
<u who="su">parietials</u>
<u who="nm5266">parietal cells good that's excellent somebody's awake and alive good # so you need intrinsic factor to bind to vitamin B-twelve before it's absorbed and it's absorbed where again</u>
<gap reason="inaudible" extent="uncertain"/>
<u who="su">terminal ileum</u>
<u who="nm5266">terminal ileum excellent good okay so # bound B-twelve will be absorbed now in pernicious anaemia you get # often antibodies to intrinsic factor or a failure of <trunc>an</trunc> intrinsic factor production and # the # test that you can do are to measure the intrinsic factor antibodies and gastric parietal cell antibodies now gastric parietal cell antibodies are not particularly specific so round about eighty to eight round about about eighty per cent of patients with pernicious anaemia would have gastric parietal cell antibodies intrinsic factor antibodies are much more specific but round about only fifty per cent of patients with # pernicious anaemia would have intrinsic factor antibodies so there's still a significant number of patients who've got pernicious anaemia who would have negative intrinsic factor antibodies and in these patients you would probably wish to carry on further investigation and i wonder if anybody can tell me what further investigation you might wish to do so you've got somebody with a low B-twelve and they've got # no intrinsic factor antibodies and you want to know whether they've got pernicious anaemia</u>
<gap reason="inaudible" extent="uncertain"/>
<u who="nm5266">a schilling test right excellent now can anybody tell me about the schilling test</u>
<gap reason="inaudible" extent="uncertain"/>
<u who="nm5266">it is good excellent so basically what you do is you have a label of radioactive B-twelve which you take orally and measure the radioactive radioactivity in the urine following the subsequent twenty-four hour collection # and you can repeat this in the presence of intrinsic factor to see if it actually corrects and that's probably the best diagnostic test in terms of # # confirming # the diagnosis of pernicious anaemia it's one of the very few things in medicine that you can actually treat of course most things in general medicine you can't you can look at and # they can have chronic problems but it's very treatable and you treat them with hydroxocobalamin injections perhaps if they have five injections over a period of a fortnight and then go onto a three-monthly # long term # replacement injection there's one group of patients that sometimes get lost particularly the surgeons manage to lose that end up with B-twelve deficiency i wonder if you could just remind me which group of patients they are</u>
<u who="su"><gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> ileum</u>
<u who="nm5266">yes well certainly if you've had any surgery to the terminal ileum that would certainly put you at risk and what other surgery a bit further up</u>
<u who="su">gastrectomy</u>
<u who="nm5266">gastrectomy yes it's very easy to # forget that these patients will develop # B-twelve deficiency and # it's something that # needs to be identified and they need to go onto some maintenance B-twelve support again on a long term basis okay you can anybody tell me the let's have something a little bit on the clinical presentation of somebody with pernicious anaemia # if you have what would make you let's say clinically consider that the patient has pernicious anaemia you're in your surgery and a little old lady comes in</u>
<u who="su">her poos are black</u>
<u who="nm5266">if her poos are black well # i i think i'd be more concerned that she's bleeding if she's got black poos if she got melena # so # good effort but # nil points yeah okay</u>
<gap reason="inaudible" extent="uncertain"/>
<u who="nm5266">well # with iron deficiency # you could # # as i say if you've got blood loss you would certainly look to see if they've got black stools # common causes of iron deficiency in females are clearly if they've got menorrhagia # once you get over a certain age however you don't # have periods a little old lady pernicious anaemia well there is an association with # blue eyes white hair they often have a lemon tinge because there is a mild degree of haemolysis that will accompany the presence of pernicious anaemia and the other thing to be # wary is that patients with pernicious anaemia don't necessarily just have an anaemia they can also sometimes have a pancytopenia so it will actually effect also the white cell production and the platelet production so anybody with a pancytopenia really and a macrocytosis should also have a B-twelve and a folate checked right any questions that # anybody's got on anything to do with anaemias anything to do with venous thrombosis anything to do with iron overload all happy i think just that just the final thing to say is that for patients with thrombocytopoenia we didn't say or i didn't mention is that you need to be careful what drugs you give them so don't go round giving them anti-platelet agents or if they're on anti-platelet agents and they've got thrombocytopoenia then do stop them the first case that we had we had somebody with diclofenac which is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent and it would clearly be sensible that that was stopped rarely diclofenac can cause thrombocytopoenia but it's much more likely that cause additional bleeding in anybody with thrombocytopoenia because # of it's # <trunc>a</trunc> anti-platelet activity so aspirin in particular clopidogrel # and all the other <trunc>anti</trunc> non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents you need to really think about stopping if you've got somebody with severe thrombocytopoenia right okay well i'd like to thank all our speakers # who've all given us a very good talk and # thank you very much for your attention</u>
