one of the other <pause dur="0.2"/> important <pause dur="0.3"/> aspects of this and <gap reason="name" extent="2 words"/> <pause dur="0.3"/> raised it right at the beginning <pause dur="0.2"/> was about evaluation <pause dur="0.4"/> who is evaluation for <pause dur="0.3"/> and we do have a system of <pause dur="0.2"/> evaluation at the moment and <pause dur="0.4"/> one of the questions we've been asking is what do we do with it <pause dur="0.4"/> how can we improve the quality <pause dur="0.2"/> of evaluation <pause dur="0.3"/> and the Q-A Q-A-A is going to hit <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> very shortly <pause dur="0.4"/> and with the evaluation that we're getting we're going to be seen to have to do <pause dur="0.4"/> something <pause dur="0.2"/> with it that may change <pause dur="0.3"/> the way the course is run at the moment <pause dur="0.5"/> and <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> has run # <pause dur="0.7"/> a project in relation to evaluation <pause dur="0.2"/> our students on the Clinical Methods course <pause dur="0.4"/> where students are attached in general practice to learn <pause dur="0.2"/> consultation competencies <pause dur="0.2"/> in clinical medical practice but in <pause dur="0.2"/> the general practice setting <pause dur="0.4"/> so <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> is going to explain this to us so i'll <pause dur="0.2"/> <vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" n="nf0350" dur="1"/> hand over to <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> thank you </u><pause dur="0.3"/> <u who="nf0350" trans="pause"> 
i'm sorry this is not going to be as long or as exciting as <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/>'s would have been but it'll fill a little gap in the agenda <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> just to give you some history # i think generally # <pause dur="0.3"/> it's accepted that feedback from students # using the questionnaire <pause dur="0.5"/> is # <pause dur="0.4"/> is not always working <pause dur="0.2"/> <vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/> simply because the students don't always return their questionnaires 'cause there's no incentive for them to do so <pause dur="0.7"/> # so <pause dur="0.3"/> myself and my colleague from <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> University <gap reason="name" extent="2 words"/> went on a course in London <unclear><trunc>lames</trunc></unclear> led by # Professor <gap reason="name" extent="2 words"/> <pause dur="0.5"/> to learn about how to gather and respond to student feedback in other ways other than using a questionnaire <pause dur="1.1"/> and the reason for making sure that we do get this feedback <pause dur="0.5"/> is <pause dur="0.3"/> that <pause dur="0.4"/> mainly <pause dur="0.5"/> there are <pause dur="0.3"/> there are two issues the the quality assessment assurance agency <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.8"/> which will be coming to <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> in March <pause dur="0.4"/> # and <pause dur="0.4"/> also because the White Paper that was released by the government in January <pause dur="0.5"/> 
# in <pause dur="0.3"/> # one of their sections chapter four that <pause dur="1.0"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> underlines the fact that they want information from students the feedback to become more transparent <pause dur="0.4"/> and they want this information out into the public domain <pause dur="0.3"/> as already happens in Australia and the U-S-A <pause dur="0.5"/> # which is a little bit worrying because # as soon as that information gets into the public domain students will start making their choices on what other students have said so <pause dur="0.4"/> we need to make sure that the information we're getting in <pause dur="0.3"/> if it's # <pause dur="0.2"/> if it's not so great we're actually acting on that and and following it through <pause dur="1.3"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> so <pause dur="0.4"/> the system <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> <gap reason="name" extent="2 words"/> proposes <pause dur="0.7"/> is called the # student <pause dur="0.3"/> consultation process <pause dur="0.5"/> # it's not to take away from the value of using questionnaires which does have its place for gathering <pause dur="0.2"/> qualitative information <pause dur="0.4"/> but we still need to think of a way of getting students to make sure they complete those forms and fill them back and a good way of evaluating that information 
when it's in <pause dur="1.5"/> and over this <pause dur="0.2"/> # consultation period i'm going to cover the the principles of the the consultation how that information's fed back and and conclusions and suggestions <pause dur="1.5"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> so the the way we do this is we get the students together halfway through their course so that and it's always after a lecture they know that we're taking them seriously <pause dur="0.4"/> they think that we're listening to them and we are <trunc>gon</trunc> we're going to <trunc>re</trunc> form a report and we're going to act upon what they've said <pause dur="0.8"/> and the question that we're always asking them is that <pause dur="0.6"/> that we're interested in in what's affecting their learning <pause dur="0.4"/> which has a more positive # thought process if you were to phrase a question such as # <pause dur="1.8"/> what <trunc>i</trunc> what is <trunc>i</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> good or bad about your teaching they will automatically start thinking of negatives this teacher's <pause dur="0.3"/> this teacher's not teaching us this or <pause dur="0.2"/> we're not getting this <pause dur="0.4"/> # whereas this gets them thinking more in terms of the whole course <pause dur="0.4"/> and you will get negative stuff coming out 
but <pause dur="0.4"/> it's what tends to happen and from experience they will say <pause dur="0.3"/> well this isn't so good have you thought about doing this so they're making positive recommendations for change <pause dur="0.3"/> themselves <pause dur="7.8"/> <kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> so <pause dur="0.2"/> basically # it's an opportunity for the students and the staff to work together in processing ideas and opinions <pause dur="0.6"/> to <pause dur="0.2"/> to <pause dur="0.7"/> come together as a collective to work on ways forward <pause dur="0.7"/> and the idea is that <pause dur="0.2"/> because the students are <pause dur="0.2"/> # aware that it's confidential the <pause dur="0.2"/> the sessions are run by somebody who's not involved in the teaching whatsoever <pause dur="0.4"/> so in the case of the Clinical Methods course <pause dur="0.3"/> i normally run them because i i <pause dur="0.3"/> don't have any influence one way or another <pause dur="0.3"/> and the students aren't afraid just to tell me what they think <pause dur="0.4"/> # and they do tell me <shift feature="voice" new="laugh"/>what they think <vocal desc="laugh" iterated="n"/><shift feature="voice" new="normal"/> <pause dur="0.8"/> # and <pause dur="0.8"/> after that # process has happened the evaluation is built up in the form of a report <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.9"/> that <pause dur="0.2"/> is broken down into sections and from this 
the student will liaise with me afterwards to to confirm that the report's okay and that they're happy with the report <pause dur="0.8"/> from then on the process is taken to the next level which is almost the most difficult because <pause dur="0.4"/> with the feedback that you get some of it is negative and that has to be fed back to the tutors or the hospitals or the G-Ps concerned <pause dur="0.6"/> but there is a way of feeding it back with again the <pause dur="0.2"/> the highlighting the positive <pause dur="0.3"/> recommendations <pause dur="0.7"/> and the worst for us is always the hospital feedback <pause dur="0.6"/> but # <pause dur="0.3"/> we're we're slowly # <pause dur="0.3"/> making changes and meeting with the undergraduate coordinators so <pause dur="0.2"/> so things are moving along <pause dur="2.3"/> <kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> # <pause dur="0.9"/> one of the things <pause dur="0.2"/> that he # says is to make sure you know how you're going to address a situation should the should they arrive so <pause dur="0.6"/> are you going to discuss it with individuals alone <pause dur="0.2"/> or or in a group and we've been meeting as a G-P group and then # feeding out the information <pause dur="0.4"/> to the hospitals once we've agreed how we're 
going to feed it back thereafter <pause dur="3.2"/> <kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> # <pause dur="0.9"/> it's important to have the whole team involved <pause dur="0.2"/> in this and to take on board what is coming back <pause dur="0.4"/> and to all work forwards to <pause dur="0.3"/> to improve the course for in all aspects departmental teaching G-Ps hospitals <pause dur="0.8"/> # and making sure that all the reports that we're building up along the way have these actions closed off so that should anybody <pause dur="0.2"/> from the Q-A-A ever come and look at those reports they're always closed off or we can say that they're in action so we're thinking about doing this <pause dur="0.4"/> we're trialling this <pause dur="0.4"/> # and and so on <pause dur="0.6"/> so <pause dur="0.3"/> that's <pause dur="0.2"/> basically how the student consultation process works and we've just trialled it # in two Clinical Methods blocks <pause dur="0.2"/> for the moment <pause dur="0.5"/> # and the feedback we've had has been very very productive <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> and very qualitative and full of suggestions and actually we've taken on board a lot of the <trunc>s</trunc> the students' suggestions so far <pause dur="0.5"/> # and we're trying to work together with the hospitals and the
