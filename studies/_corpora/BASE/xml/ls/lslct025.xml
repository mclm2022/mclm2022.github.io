education <pause dur="0.8"/> especially for postgraduates <pause dur="0.5"/> and looked very much into personal development plans for G-Ps <pause dur="0.3"/> in the area and that's where my sort of <pause dur="0.5"/> area of research lay <pause dur="1.0"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> i was very aware when i was asked to talk that A this was an <trunc>u</trunc> undergraduate <pause dur="0.5"/> research symposium <pause dur="0.4"/> # and that not everybody here would be a G-P <pause dur="0.3"/> and i didn't know how interesting my research would be to people <pause dur="0.6"/> so what i thought i'd do <pause dur="2.0"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> is this basically <pause dur="0.3"/> discuss the history of portfolios where they've come from <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> different methods of using portfolios <pause dur="0.3"/> in different <pause dur="0.3"/> # career areas especially medicine really <pause dur="0.3"/> and i apologize to those people that aren't from medical backgrounds <pause dur="1.1"/> obviously when discussing portfolios we do need to bring in an element of reflection <pause dur="0.9"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> so i'm going to discuss that as well <pause dur="0.4"/> and then finally move on to the problems and the benefits of using portfolios in medicine <pause dur="0.3"/> and then i can touch on my research if <pause dur="0.7"/> anyone's desperate to go home at that point <pause dur="2.1"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> right <pause dur="0.6"/> so <pause dur="1.0"/> # i wanted everyone to think of something that 
reminds them of <pause dur="0.3"/> Italy <pause dur="1.4"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> it may seem a bit of a strange question <pause dur="0.9"/> # i thought of a few myself <pause dur="0.7"/> obviously food came first <pause dur="1.2"/> # <pause dur="0.9"/> basically the reason why i put this slide in <pause dur="0.5"/> is the word portfolio actually originates from Italy <pause dur="1.1"/> # it started in the eighteenth century <pause dur="0.7"/> and it can be split into two components and i apologize for pronunciation as i don't speak Italian <pause dur="0.5"/> but the first is <distinct lang="it">portare</distinct> <pause dur="0.6"/> which is to carry <pause dur="0.8"/> and the second is <distinct lang="it">folio</distinct> <pause dur="0.4"/> which i'm <trunc>sh</trunc> # sure there is a proper Italian pronuncation for that <pause dur="0.3"/> meaning leaf or sheet <pause dur="0.9"/> and so really <pause dur="0.2"/> in its basic basic # meaning <pause dur="0.7"/> portfolio means a case for carrying loose sheets of paper <pause dur="0.9"/> and obviously <pause dur="0.4"/> in the artistic world that <pause dur="0.5"/> definition still carries and often you see people going for job interviews with their big portfolios <pause dur="1.0"/> # containing all their <trunc>leash</trunc> <pause dur="0.3"/> loose sheets <pause dur="0.5"/> of artwork they they've done <pause dur="1.6"/> basically since this time the definition and the word portfolio has been picked up by lots of 
different # occupations <pause dur="0.5"/> the commonest one's the government <pause dur="0.8"/> # they basically have developed the word portfolio to mean a case containing official documents for certain departments within the government <pause dur="0.6"/> and that's led to job descriptions such as Minister with Portfolio <pause dur="0.3"/> and Ministers without Portfolio for those people that do have the responsibilities for looking after these cases of documents <pause dur="1.7"/> in the N-H-S or in the educational field in general <pause dur="0.9"/> # the definition of portfolio has really taken on two main <pause dur="0.2"/> areas <pause dur="0.9"/> and that's what i'm going to discuss today <pause dur="1.0"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> starting with the first one of a scrapbook <pause dur="0.7"/> a very basic definition <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> it's a collection of written material or evidence of skills <pause dur="0.4"/> # a person possesses <pause dur="1.4"/> basically <trunc>y</trunc> years and years ago what used to happen is you used to finish school <pause dur="0.5"/> used to go and get a job down the road where you'd stay really until you retired you'd get married have two children <pause dur="1.2"/> et cetera et cetera things have changed very much so <pause dur="0.7"/> we're now 
expected to do <pause dur="0.2"/> extra qualifications we're expected to actively move round get different jobs different experiences <pause dur="0.5"/> even specialize in different specific areas within the occupation that we've actually chosen <pause dur="1.5"/> obviously we need to demonstrate to people the expertise and experience that we have <pause dur="0.4"/> so what we use <pause dur="0.7"/> are best doing is collecting certificates <pause dur="0.4"/> evidence of work that we've done <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> in order to prove where we've been <pause dur="2.4"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> # couple of people that looked into <pause dur="0.3"/> scrapbook type portfolios was Pendleton and Hasler <pause dur="1.0"/> basically they should said that you should be as imaginative as you can be <pause dur="0.2"/> with your portfolios put in anything you think of <pause dur="0.6"/> so that includes videotapes now <pause dur="0.4"/> audits research as we've been discussing today <pause dur="0.3"/> everything to prove <pause dur="0.2"/> where you've been and what you've been doing <pause dur="0.7"/> since you sat <pause dur="0.2"/> your first basic exams <pause dur="3.9"/> right so if we go back to the previous one <pause dur="1.2"/> portfolios can also be used as educational tools <pause dur="0.5"/> # and that's really what i'm going to concentrate on more now 
because it's what <pause dur="0.3"/> the government want us to do and what's being used most in the field of continuing medical education <pause dur="1.2"/> basically using portfolios <pause dur="0.2"/> as an educational tool you start with your basic scrapbook <pause dur="0.6"/> but you add in the additional dimension of reflection <pause dur="0.5"/> and reflective learning <pause dur="2.2"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> so what is reflection <pause dur="1.5"/> # here's a definition by <pause dur="0.3"/> Brown <pause dur="1.2"/> basically if we think of reflection <pause dur="0.3"/> it throws up images of mirrors <pause dur="0.4"/> and seeing ourselves how other people see us <pause dur="0.8"/> # in education this extends to visualizing or thinking about experiences that we've had courses we've been on <pause dur="0.4"/> making sense of them and perhaps seeing them in a different way or a constructive way <pause dur="1.2"/> # we've all got the ability to look at things we do and make changes to how we do those things in the future <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> even from when we're born <pause dur="0.3"/> if you think of a small child who puts their hand on a hot radiator <pause dur="0.4"/> they soon learn that <pause dur="0.2"/> it's best not to do that again <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> and that's really reflection in its very basic form <pause dur="1.4"/> it's been a 
topic of interest really to lots of educational writers <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> probably one of the most famous ones is John Dewey <pause dur="0.7"/> as you can see by the black and white photo <pause dur="0.5"/> he was born in eighteen-fifty-nine <pause dur="0.7"/> he actually became head of Philosophy and Psychology in <trunc>s</trunc> Chicago <pause dur="1.2"/> # and his main interest really lay in educational systems in different countries <pause dur="0.4"/> and he actually did considering the year that he was born did quite a lot of travelling to different countries looking at the educational systems that <pause dur="0.4"/> were growing in each country <pause dur="1.4"/> he also felt that education resulted in people fitting reacting in different ways and fitting into different niches within society and taking on different roles within society <pause dur="0.4"/> and he felt that was all educational based <pause dur="1.4"/> # he basically described two main types of learning <pause dur="1.3"/> the first was trial and error <pause dur="0.6"/> type learning <pause dur="0.8"/> # he felt <pause dur="0.3"/> that skills could be developed <pause dur="0.5"/> after <pause dur="0.5"/> practising a task over and over again <trunc>resert</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> resulting in a more of a learned behaviour <pause dur="1.0"/> # 
that could be used in just special circumstances only <pause dur="0.5"/> the commonest one is <pause dur="0.2"/> if someone came to you and said <pause dur="0.3"/> how do you ride a bike <pause dur="1.3"/> # we all know how to ride a bike <pause dur="0.4"/> we've all practised it when we were <pause dur="0.2"/> children with stabilizers and <pause dur="0.3"/> we now know how to ride a bike but try and describe that to someone it's very very difficult <trunc>w</trunc> because it's a learned behaviour <pause dur="1.3"/> he also felt there was a second type of learning <pause dur="0.4"/> and that was reflective learning <pause dur="1.0"/> he where information and feedback from previous experiences <pause dur="0.5"/> could then be used to draw conclusions which if ever you came across that experience again <pause dur="0.3"/> could be used <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> and basically he <pause dur="0.2"/> <trunc>fi</trunc> was the first one to introduce the concept of learning cycles <pause dur="0.7"/> and learning loops <pause dur="0.8"/> where conclusions from previous experiences could be fed back <pause dur="0.5"/> and used to manipulate <pause dur="0.3"/> the experience when you <pause dur="0.3"/> have it again <pause dur="2.6"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> he's <pause dur="0.2"/> very well known for something called his pedagogic creed <pause dur="0.6"/> and i just put that in <pause dur="0.3"/> really for the people who are interested in education 
the Master's students in education <pause dur="0.4"/> and as he said he felt education began unconsciously at birth <pause dur="0.5"/> and went throughout life and shaped that individual <pause dur="0.4"/> and it's that that fitted them into a certain area and function in society <pause dur="3.4"/> <kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> so after <pause dur="0.4"/> Dewey had <pause dur="0.2"/> had developed this learning loop David Kolb and i don't think that's the most flattering photo that i found of him <vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" n="ss" dur="1"/><pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> he was another educationalist <pause dur="0.6"/> and he was Professor of Organizational Behaviour <pause dur="0.9"/> and he had a special interest not just in the way that people fitted into social society <pause dur="0.4"/> due to their education he felt <pause dur="0.3"/> that due to your education <pause dur="0.4"/> that made you more likely <pause dur="0.2"/> to pick specific careers <pause dur="0.3"/> and fit within certain organizations <pause dur="0.2"/> and often meant <pause dur="0.5"/> # that's where people ended up working <pause dur="1.3"/> in nineteen-seventy-one he joined together with <pause dur="0.2"/> Rubin and McIntyre who were also interested in education <pause dur="0.4"/> and 
developed Dewey's <pause dur="0.3"/> learning loop a bit further <pause dur="2.2"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> they produced this <pause dur="1.7"/> and it's well known as <pause dur="0.4"/> Kolb's <pause dur="0.3"/> loop <pause dur="1.7"/> he felt that a learner had to be competent in all of these different areas <pause dur="0.5"/> # and stated the cycle in order for to be an effective learner <pause dur="0.3"/> the whole cycle had to keep turning <pause dur="0.9"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> if a person was inadequate in any of the areas they were just unable to learn at all <pause dur="4.0"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> so moving on to <pause dur="0.2"/> from this <pause dur="0.4"/> # the final person that i'm going to talk about today is Donald Schon <pause dur="0.8"/> he's also well known # <pause dur="0.2"/> for his techniques of reflection <pause dur="1.2"/> he like Kolb was very interested in individuals and the way they functioned within their working organizations and their working environment <pause dur="1.2"/> he really wasn't that interested in Kolb's <pause dur="0.2"/> cycle <pause dur="0.7"/> he <trunc>wan</trunc> went back to Dewey's original concept of the fact of <pause dur="0.2"/> # task learning <pause dur="0.5"/> and reflective type learning <pause dur="0.8"/> he felt that # Dewey had got it slightly wrong <pause dur="0.6"/> and instead of being two different ways of learning that <pause dur="0.2"/> it was actually one type of learning <pause dur="0.7"/> and that <pause dur="0.3"/> people 
actually performed a task <pause dur="1.0"/> and then while they were performing that task <pause dur="0.4"/> they were able to reflect <pause dur="0.6"/> # think about what they were doing <pause dur="0.2"/> and make alterations to their behaviour during the time that they were doing that <pause dur="0.9"/> he also felt that <pause dur="0.7"/> people were also able after they'd <pause dur="0.4"/> finished the task to look back <pause dur="0.6"/> and think about what they'd actually done <pause dur="1.8"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> from this he developed these <pause dur="0.3"/> three terms <pause dur="0.8"/> reflection in action <pause dur="0.3"/> is where you're doing a task and you actually think about what you're doing at the time <pause dur="0.3"/> and you can alter and modify your behaviour accordingly <pause dur="0.8"/> reflection on action <pause dur="0.5"/> he felt was the ability to look back at what had happened <pause dur="0.3"/> and again <pause dur="0.2"/> make changes for the future <pause dur="0.5"/> and both of those came together <pause dur="0.2"/> in order to provide individuals that had a knowledge in action <pause dur="0.5"/> so they're able to perform both these tasks <pause dur="0.5"/> in order <pause dur="0.2"/> to perform a function <pause dur="2.0"/> it's quite complicated and i think the easiest way for me to describe it and again i apologize to the <trunc>m</trunc> non-medical ones <pause dur="0.3"/> people here <pause dur="0.7"/> is <pause dur="0.7"/> someone taking 
out an appendix <pause dur="1.0"/> if a surgeon goes in and takes out an appendix there is the typical way <pause dur="0.3"/> of an appendicectomy if you read the textbook it's the sheet make the incision here <pause dur="0.3"/> find the appendix here <pause dur="0.3"/> remove it as such <pause dur="1.3"/> if the surgeon goes in and the appendix is in a slightly different position <pause dur="0.5"/> for example behind the secum <pause dur="0.5"/> then the whole process has to be modified the surgeon has to look somewhere else for the appendix <pause dur="0.3"/> take it out in a slightly different way <pause dur="0.3"/> extend the scar slightly <pause dur="0.3"/> and that's reflection in action the surgeon has seen while he's doing a function <pause dur="0.8"/> that modifications need to be made <pause dur="1.4"/> afterwards <pause dur="0.2"/> when the surgeon's stitched up and he's sitting down having his cup of coffee <pause dur="0.3"/> he can actually think <pause dur="0.2"/> about that patient <pause dur="0.4"/> was there any clues <pause dur="0.2"/> when he took the history from the patient <pause dur="0.3"/> on examining the patient <pause dur="0.4"/> that he wasn't going to find a typical appendix when he went in there <pause dur="1.9"/> if he does find evidence that there were some differences <pause dur="0.4"/> he 
can actually use that information in the future to be more prepared <pause dur="0.5"/> for the next operation that he comes across and that's more of a reflection <pause dur="0.4"/> on action <pause dur="5.8"/> <kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> right so basically reflection's a very complex process <pause dur="0.5"/> there's diferent influences that reflect <pause dur="0.5"/> what we # <pause dur="1.3"/> take home <pause dur="1.2"/> and basically what we choose <pause dur="0.5"/> to take from a situation depends on our personal aspirations <pause dur="0.4"/> our past experiences <pause dur="0.6"/> and where we feel our personal needs or inadequacies lie <pause dur="1.5"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> and all of these result in modifications hopefully in our behaviour <pause dur="1.7"/> going back to the internal and external influences <pause dur="1.0"/> if you provide <pause dur="0.3"/> a group of delegates with the same lecture <pause dur="0.3"/> and provide them with a sheet <pause dur="0.3"/> where they're able to write home one take-home message <pause dur="0.7"/> the take-home message probably will be very different for everybody in the room <pause dur="0.8"/> # that's because each of us <pause dur="0.7"/> will find part of the talk slightly more interesting than another depending on our experiences <pause dur="0.6"/> # and that's really <pause dur="0.4"/> the element of the 
internal and external influences on reflection <pause dur="2.1"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> so what we need to do now is put all those <pause dur="0.5"/> all that information about reflection back into the use of portfolios <pause dur="1.0"/> so if we return to our scrapbook <pause dur="0.7"/> what we're doing now is we're using our reflective techniques to look at each learning experience that we've had so <pause dur="0.3"/> as we mentioned before the scrapbooks can be full of certificates and achievements <pause dur="1.0"/> so <pause dur="0.3"/> when you came today <pause dur="0.6"/> # you might have thought oh well i might have a certificate at the end of the day that i can put in my scrapbook and people will see that i've been to this interesting course at <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> <pause dur="1.0"/> # however if we're going to use <pause dur="0.2"/> that to reflect <pause dur="0.9"/> hopefully some people after they look at that certificate will think <pause dur="0.7"/> oh i know a bit more about education now <pause dur="0.4"/> or <pause dur="0.7"/> i know perhaps that i'm inadequate in knowledge in this area of education and i'll go and find out more <pause dur="1.1"/> some people <pause dur="0.2"/> might have just come <pause dur="0.6"/> and actually found out where <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> is and that it's actually got a medical school
