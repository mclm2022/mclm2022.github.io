today by talking about <pause dur="0.7"/> two normal conditions <pause dur="0.4"/> that occur <pause dur="0.5"/> which <pause dur="0.2"/> elevate <pause dur="0.4"/> P-C <pause dur="0.3"/> the hydrostatic pressure in the capillary <pause dur="0.6"/> and therefore <pause dur="0.4"/> you can see from this equation elevate <pause dur="0.5"/> the flux of water out of the blood into the tissue <pause dur="1.3"/> and the first one is one that you've studied <pause dur="0.5"/> in your practical class and that is standing up <pause dur="0.9"/> because when you stand up <pause dur="2.2"/> the <pause dur="0.2"/> pressure <pause dur="0.4"/> in your feet <pause dur="0.5"/> is much higher than it is when you're lying down we have the normal blood pressure that's being provided by the heart all the time <pause dur="0.4"/> when you stand up you have in addition <pause dur="0.4"/> the hydrostatic pressure <pause dur="0.4"/> from that column of water or column of blood more accurately <pause dur="0.3"/> between the heart and your foot so there's somewhere between <pause dur="0.4"/> a metre and two metres <pause dur="0.4"/> extra hydrostatic pressure of water there <pause dur="0.4"/> and that's a lot compared to the blood pressure <pause dur="1.1"/> and that's # in the arteries <pause dur="0.5"/> but # some of this pressure is transmitted through to the capillaries as well the pressure goes up <pause dur="0.5"/> in the capillaries <pause dur="1.4"/> so when you stand up <pause dur="0.6"/> there is an extra 
flux of water out of the capillaries in your feet <pause dur="0.4"/> into the tissue <pause dur="0.5"/> in your feet <pause dur="1.4"/> and the question is what does the body do about this <pause dur="2.7"/> how do we prevent that from happening <pause dur="2.2"/> well <pause dur="0.3"/> to a certain extent we can't do anything about it and if you do stand up for a long time your feet will swell <pause dur="0.9"/> # <pause dur="1.1"/> <trunc>i</trunc> <pause dur="0.3"/> it's not often that you do stand still for very long periods of time but you sit still for very long periods of time <pause dur="0.6"/> # in an aeroplane for instance if you're on a eight hour aircraft ride you would definitely notice <pause dur="0.5"/> that your feet swell if you take your shoes off at the beginning of the flight it's difficult to get them back on at the end and that is because <pause dur="0.4"/> you've been sitting immobile for many hours <pause dur="0.4"/> and <pause dur="0.3"/> although when you're sitting the hydrostatic pressure isn't <pause dur="0.4"/> as great as when you're standing it's still a lot more than when you're lying down <pause dur="0.4"/> and that forces fluid <pause dur="0.4"/> out of the capillaries <pause dur="0.4"/> into the tissue <pause dur="2.3"/> the <pause dur="0.2"/> body tries to compensate and what it does <pause dur="0.4"/> is to increase the 
resistance of the arterioles <pause dur="4.7"/> so the arterioles constrict the <trunc>s</trunc> muscle cells in the arterioles constrict <pause dur="0.8"/> and this does <pause dur="0.3"/> three things <pause dur="3.2"/> first of all it reduces <pause dur="0.9"/> the pressure in the capillaries it reduces <pause dur="0.6"/> P-C <pause dur="1.4"/> remember that <pause dur="0.2"/> pressure <pause dur="0.4"/> is connected to the potential energy of a fluid <pause dur="0.6"/> and if we have to force that fluid through a higher resistance <pause dur="0.3"/> more energy is dissipated <pause dur="0.5"/> so if if the arterioles constrict <pause dur="0.4"/> more of that pressure the energy that's represented by that pressure <pause dur="0.4"/> will be used up forcing the fluid through the arterioles <pause dur="0.4"/> and the pressure in the capillaries <pause dur="0.3"/> will be lower so that's the first thing that happens <pause dur="0.4"/> and obviously we can't shut the arterioles down completely <pause dur="0.4"/> otherwise your feet wouldn't get <pause dur="0.4"/> the oxygen that they require <pause dur="3.7"/> so the <trunc>r</trunc> that <pause dur="0.3"/> also gives us a reduced flow <pause dur="0.3"/> in the capillary <pause dur="6.3"/> and because there's a reduced flow in the capillary <pause dur="0.5"/> we're getting <pause dur="0.4"/> the filtration <pause dur="0.4"/> that is the water is being removed <pause dur="0.4"/> from a smaller volume of blood than normal <pause dur="5.1"/> we're 
reducing the amount of blood throwing flowing through the capillary <pause dur="0.3"/> and therefore all this water that's coming out of the blood is coming from a relatively small volume of it <pause dur="1.1"/> and that <pause dur="0.6"/> concentrates the blood we're losing water <pause dur="0.4"/> but we're not losing solutes <pause dur="0.4"/> and we get an increase <pause dur="0.4"/> in the oncotic pressure of the plasma <pause dur="0.5"/> so because we're losing a lot of fluid from a small volume of blood <pause dur="0.4"/> the oncotic pressure goes up the blood is becoming concentrated essentially <pause dur="0.7"/> and if you go back to the Starling equation <pause dur="0.4"/> you will see that having <pause dur="0.3"/> a high oncotic pressure in plasma <pause dur="1.0"/> opposes more water leaving it tends to pull water back into the plasma <pause dur="0.8"/> so that also helps <pause dur="9.2"/> the final thing <pause dur="0.4"/> is that we may <pause dur="0.8"/> shut down some capillaries <pause dur="7.0"/> remember that <pause dur="0.4"/> capillaries are opening and closing all the time well 
that's not <pause dur="0.2"/> that's not strictly accurate <pause dur="0.4"/> it's the arterioles that are opening and closing all the time <pause dur="0.4"/> and allowing blood either to perfuse the capillary or not to <pause dur="0.2"/> perfuse it <pause dur="0.4"/> and i've mentioned that this is called vasomotion <pause dur="3.0"/> and if we <pause dur="0.3"/> increase the resistance of <pause dur="0.4"/> arterioles <pause dur="0.3"/> that means that more of the capillaries will be shut down more of the time <pause dur="0.7"/> so <pause dur="0.6"/> they have <pause dur="0.4"/> no flow going through them <pause dur="0.2"/> there's no there's no blood in them <pause dur="3.2"/> and then <trunc>he</trunc> <pause dur="0.4"/> and hence <pause dur="0.5"/> no filtration while they're <pause dur="0.3"/> closed down <pause dur="2.4"/> so those are three ways in which the body <pause dur="0.2"/> tries to combat this effect <pause dur="0.5"/> but as i've said <pause dur="0.3"/> the body can't <pause dur="0.5"/> prevent it completely and our our feet certainly do swell if we stand <pause dur="0.5"/> for a long period of time <pause dur="3.6"/> you 
can see from this <pause dur="0.4"/> that <pause dur="0.3"/> exercise is also going to <pause dur="1.6"/> cause problems <pause dur="3.8"/> i've <pause dur="0.4"/> talked about the control of arteriole <unclear>return</unclear> <pause dur="0.5"/> and i've said that when our <pause dur="0.3"/> tissue is metabolizing more <pause dur="0.5"/> as it does during exercise <pause dur="0.4"/> that causes arterioles to dilate <pause dur="1.5"/> so during exercise <pause dur="0.4"/> our arterioles dilate <pause dur="0.8"/> and that is <pause dur="0.4"/> to provide the tissue with more blood <pause dur="2.7"/> but you can see from what i've just said <pause dur="0.4"/> i mean that that is of course <trunc>equiv</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> equivalent to a decreased resistance in the arterioles <pause dur="2.0"/> that this will have the opposite effect of all these <pause dur="0.8"/> protective mechanisms that i've just talked about <pause dur="0.7"/> for the <pause dur="0.3"/> effects of posture <pause dur="0.8"/> by <pause dur="0.2"/> when we exercise we decrease <pause dur="0.4"/> the resistance in our arteries <pause dur="0.3"/> and that will do the opposite of points one two and three <pause dur="0.8"/> so it will tend to increase <pause dur="0.2"/> filtration <pause dur="1.5"/> it's exactly the opposite effect <pause dur="9.1"/> and again <pause dur="0.6"/> you may very well have noticed that if <pause dur="0.3"/> you do exercise <pause dur="0.3"/> there is a lot of movement of water from the blood into tissue <pause dur="0.5"/> if you wear rings for instance and they come off easily <pause dur="0.4"/> if you do a 
lot of exercise with your arms or hands you'll find that the rings won't come off <pause dur="0.6"/> and that's because <pause dur="0.5"/> the <pause dur="0.2"/> arterioles supplying blood to the arm muscles have dilated <pause dur="0.6"/> reduced the resistance and more fluid has filtered out into the tissue and swollen your fingers <pause dur="0.4"/> you can sometimes feel this if you exercise <pause dur="0.4"/> your skin will feel tight over the muscles compared to normal <pause dur="0.4"/> and that's due to this tissue swelling <pause dur="4.1"/> are there any questions about this so far <pause dur="2.7"/> okay <pause dur="0.4"/> well these are two cases <pause dur="0.3"/> where <pause dur="1.5"/> things <pause dur="0.5"/> go wrong for the Starling balance but there <pause dur="0.4"/> # we can cope with it the body can # # <pause dur="0.4"/> put up with this sort of level of increased filtration <pause dur="1.2"/><kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="25"/> but it's not always the case <pause dur="1.4"/> and i said last week i apologize for leaving a <pause dur="0.5"/> a a figure behind that is <pause dur="0.5"/> an extreme clinical case of <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> movement of <pause dur="0.2"/> fluid from <pause dur="0.6"/> the blood vessels into the tissue it's affected <pause dur="0.4"/> one leg in this patient <pause dur="0.4"/> and not others and not the other <pause dur="4.8"/> and this <pause dur="0.4"/> inappropriate this pathological movement of water <pause dur="0.7"/> we call oedema <pause dur="0.9"/> and i'm going to 
say <pause dur="0.5"/> quite a bit about oedema <pause dur="2.3"/> again if you're using American textbooks that will be spelled <pause dur="0.3"/> without the O <pause dur="0.3"/> spelled just E-D <pause dur="0.4"/> E-M-A <pause dur="8.0"/><kinesic desc="writes on transparency" iterated="y" dur="5"/> and <pause dur="1.0"/> oedema is <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> fluid accumulation <pause dur="0.4"/> in the interstitium <pause dur="0.7"/> pathological # accumulation of fluid in the interstitium <pause dur="0.6"/> and it occurs <pause dur="0.5"/> when this flux of water out of the blood that i've talked about <pause dur="0.4"/> is greater <pause dur="0.4"/> than the flow of lymph <pause dur="1.2"/> so this is the net <pause dur="1.6"/> flux of water out of the <pause dur="0.3"/> capillaries <pause dur="0.9"/> is greater than the lymph flow <pause dur="0.4"/> which returns <pause dur="0.3"/> water from the interstitium back to the blood system <pause dur="7.1"/><kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="9"/> and if you go back to this <pause dur="2.7"/> to the Starling equation <pause dur="1.8"/> you can see <pause dur="0.3"/> the various factors that will cause this to be too high <pause dur="3.4"/> so i'm going to give you a list of <pause dur="0.6"/> factors that are of clinical importance that can cause <pause dur="0.4"/> oedema <pause dur="0.4"/> and the first one is the one we've just been talking about <pause dur="0.4"/> to do with posture and exercise <pause dur="0.3"/> that's when <pause dur="0.3"/> the pressure in the capillaries is too high <pause dur="0.5"/> so that's the first cause <pause dur="0.5"/> of oedema <pause dur="1.4"/> it's when P-C is too high <pause dur="7.3"/> and this tends to occur <pause dur="0.6"/> 
if <pause dur="0.3"/> the <pause dur="1.0"/> if there's a problem with the veins <pause dur="0.4"/> and in particular <pause dur="0.4"/> if there's a high pressure in the veins <pause dur="3.0"/> because of course the capillaries empty into the venules and then thereby into the veins <pause dur="0.4"/> and if there's a high pressure <pause dur="0.4"/> in the veins <pause dur="0.4"/> that pressure will back up into the capillaries the capillaries won't be able to <pause dur="0.3"/> move fluid into the veins until their pressure also <pause dur="0.3"/> has become elevated <pause dur="0.6"/> so the main cause of having too high <pause dur="0.3"/> a capillary pressure <pause dur="0.4"/> is to have too high a venous pressure <pause dur="0.4"/> it prevents the fluid coming out of the capillaries <pause dur="0.5"/> and so it's venous problems <pause dur="0.3"/> that tend to <pause dur="0.7"/> to # <pause dur="0.6"/> cause this <pause dur="0.4"/> and particularly <pause dur="0.4"/> # thrombosis <pause dur="0.3"/> blood <trunc>co</trunc> clots <pause dur="0.2"/> forming <pause dur="0.3"/> inside the veins <pause dur="0.4"/> or other kinds of venous failure <pause dur="1.1"/> such as varicose veins <pause dur="0.4"/> when the valves in the veins <pause dur="0.2"/> # are reversed <pause dur="0.9"/> and i i'm sure you've seen <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> people <pause dur="0.5"/> it seems particularly to affect elderly women <pause dur="0.5"/> who've got <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> varicose veins or problems with the veins in their legs <pause dur="0.3"/> and also swollen <pause dur="0.2"/> legs swollen ankles and those two 
go together <pause dur="0.5"/> it's because <pause dur="0.5"/> these venous problems are causing a high pressure in the veins <pause dur="0.4"/> that's causing a high <pause dur="0.2"/> <trunc>pro</trunc> pressure in the capillaries <pause dur="0.4"/> and the high pressure in the capillaries is forcing fluid out <pause dur="0.4"/> into the tissue <pause dur="11.0"/><kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="10"/> again if we go back to this <pause dur="0.3"/> equation <pause dur="1.8"/> you can see that <pause dur="0.8"/> another <pause dur="0.3"/> cause of problems <pause dur="0.3"/> could be if we had something wrong with the oncotic <pause dur="0.4"/> pressure <pause dur="0.3"/> in plasma <pause dur="0.6"/> so i'll talk about that <pause dur="3.7"/> if the oncotic pressure in plasma is too low <pause dur="1.4"/> we will get <pause dur="0.4"/> problems <pause dur="0.4"/> <trunc>s</trunc> remember that these work in the opposite directions that's why <pause dur="0.6"/> the hydrostatic pressure has to be too high <pause dur="0.4"/> and the oncotic pressure has to be too low to cause problems <pause dur="0.4"/> if the oncotic pressure is too low <pause dur="0.5"/> that will stop water being attracted to the blood <pause dur="6.3"/> what is the <pause dur="0.3"/> oncotic pressure in blood caused by <pause dur="0.6"/> what is it <pause dur="0.2"/> that gives us the <pause dur="0.6"/> this osmotic pressure this oncotic pressure <pause dur="4.5"/> plasma proteins <pause dur="3.8"/> and particularly albumin <pause dur="2.9"/> which is made in the liver <pause dur="1.9"/> it's the plasma proteins <pause dur="0.6"/> that <pause dur="0.2"/> draw water towards 
the blood <pause dur="0.8"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> that's particularly the role of albumin which is about three-quarters of the total protein mass in the plasma <pause dur="3.9"/> so <pause dur="0.6"/> the first thing that will cause <pause dur="0.9"/> oedema <pause dur="0.4"/> is malnutrition <pause dur="0.7"/> because <pause dur="0.7"/> we need <pause dur="1.3"/> amino acids we need protein in our diet in order to manufacture <pause dur="0.6"/> proteins and if we don't <pause dur="0.5"/> have enough <pause dur="0.2"/> intake then we can't make the proteins <pause dur="0.7"/> and <pause dur="0.5"/> when you see these <pause dur="0.4"/> pictures of starving <pause dur="0.2"/> children <pause dur="0.7"/> in the developing countries <pause dur="0.3"/> with very swollen stomachs that's a form of oedema <pause dur="0.4"/> that's caused by <pause dur="0.5"/> malnutrition they're not able to make enough protein <pause dur="0.5"/> and that allows fluid to leak into the <pause dur="0.4"/> abdominal cavity <pause dur="6.1"/> we can also <pause dur="0.5"/> get <pause dur="0.2"/> oedema <pause dur="0.4"/> if we have poor <pause dur="0.6"/> gut absorption of protein <pause dur="2.1"/> even if you have a normal diet <pause dur="0.4"/> and your gut is not working properly it doesn't absorb the amino acids <pause dur="0.4"/> then again <pause dur="0.4"/> you will not be able to make <pause dur="0.2"/> enough plasma proteins <pause dur="0.4"/> to keep the water in the plasma <pause dur="6.3"/> even if you do synthesize the protein <pause dur="0.3"/> you can <pause dur="0.8"/> that that won't be enough if you lose it again so if you have some 
condition <pause dur="0.5"/> that causes protein loss <pause dur="0.8"/> then again <pause dur="0.3"/> you can be <pause dur="0.2"/> prone to oedema <pause dur="0.4"/> and protein loss can occur <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> by the kidney <pause dur="0.4"/> this is a common complication of pregnancy <pause dur="0.4"/> for example <pause dur="0.6"/> # protein urea is when we get <pause dur="0.5"/> a large quantity of protein in the urine <pause dur="0.8"/> or again if <pause dur="0.3"/> one has problems with the gut <pause dur="0.3"/> then protein can be <pause dur="0.4"/> can be lost <pause dur="0.5"/><vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.2"/> excuse me <pause dur="0.4"/> can be lost through the gut <pause dur="3.8"/> and finally <pause dur="0.3"/> if we have liver problems <pause dur="2.1"/> then we can <pause dur="0.3"/> have <pause dur="0.5"/> oedema <pause dur="0.3"/> because it's the liver that synthesizes the plasma proteins <pause dur="0.6"/> the albumen is synthesized in the liver <pause dur="0.4"/> and if you have <trunc>lime</trunc> liver damage <pause dur="0.5"/> # alcoholism for example <pause dur="0.6"/> causing cirrhosis of the liver <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> protein production will be lowered <pause dur="0.7"/> and # <pause dur="1.6"/> oedema will result <pause dur="15.2"/><kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="11"/> 
another <pause dur="0.2"/> way in which we can get <pause dur="0.4"/> oedema <pause dur="0.8"/> is if <pause dur="0.6"/> the <pause dur="1.0"/> permeability of the capillary to water its hydraulic conductivity <pause dur="0.4"/> becomes too high <pause dur="24.0"/> so again <pause dur="2.2"/> if we get an increase in capillary permeability we will get a swelling <pause dur="0.3"/> because <pause dur="0.4"/> fluid leaks from the capillary <pause dur="0.7"/> into the <pause dur="0.4"/> tissue <pause dur="0.4"/> where did you see this in your practical </u><pause dur="4.9"/> <u who="sm0229" trans="pause"> when you scratch a little bit of you </u><u who="nm0228" trans="latching"> good <pause dur="0.3"/> scratching the skin <pause dur="0.4"/> you got a weal <pause dur="0.3"/> a raised <pause dur="0.2"/> area of redness <pause dur="0.5"/> because the capillaries had been damaged <pause dur="0.4"/> and leaked water into the tissue <pause dur="0.5"/> so this is a form <pause dur="0.4"/> of inflammation <pause dur="7.0"/> and of course any other kind of inflammation will do the same if you have a local <pause dur="0.4"/> infection <pause dur="0.7"/> or local tissue damage <pause dur="0.3"/> you get leaky capillaries <pause dur="0.3"/> and the area swells you know that from personal experience if you have a <pause dur="0.3"/> a local injury the tissue around it will swell up <pause dur="11.7"/><kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="7"/> and the final point <pause dur="0.5"/> and i said at 
the start <pause dur="0.4"/> that oedema occurred <pause dur="0.4"/> if the movement of fluid out the net movement i say net movement here because there's water moving backwards and forwards into the capillaries <pause dur="0.3"/> so we're concerned with <pause dur="0.4"/> the net <pause dur="0.3"/> flux out of the capillaries <pause dur="0.6"/> if this is <pause dur="0.4"/> greater <pause dur="0.4"/> than lymph flow then we get accumulation in the tissues <pause dur="0.4"/> so <pause dur="0.3"/> even if this stays normal even if J-V stays normal <pause dur="0.3"/> we can still get oedema <pause dur="0.5"/> if something happens to the lymph <pause dur="0.6"/> if our lymph flow goes down for some reason <pause dur="0.4"/> so <pause dur="0.4"/> a final <pause dur="0.3"/> group of causes <pause dur="0.3"/> are concerned with lymphatic problems <pause dur="9.8"/> and <pause dur="0.7"/> we can have problems with our lymph <pause dur="0.5"/> # through developmental problems if the lymph vessels aren't <pause dur="0.2"/> formed properly <pause dur="4.3"/> through <pause dur="0.4"/> damage <pause dur="0.2"/> to lymph vessels and lymph nodes <pause dur="0.4"/> and that's the case in this # <pause dur="3.1"/><kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="4"/> rather <pause dur="0.3"/> revolting picture what's happened here <pause dur="0.5"/> is that this is <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> a patient who's had surgery <pause dur="0.4"/> and the surgery has damaged the lymph nodes in the groin <pause dur="0.4"/> on one side <pause dur="0.4"/> and so this leg is being inadequately <pause dur="0.3"/> drained of lymph <pause dur="0.5"/> while this leg is being drained

and local tissue problems but it's <pause dur="0.2"/> unlikely to be <pause dur="0.2"/> a life-threatening <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> a life-threatening problem <pause dur="4.4"/> the second <pause dur="0.8"/> place in which you can have oedema though is very dangerous <pause dur="0.8"/> and that's when it's in the lungs <pause dur="7.3"/> which we call pulmonary oedema <pause dur="8.1"/> i've said <pause dur="0.5"/> that <pause dur="0.4"/> one of the causes <pause dur="0.4"/> of <pause dur="0.4"/> oedema <pause dur="0.3"/> is when we get a high <pause dur="1.4"/> pressure in the veins <pause dur="0.9"/> and that's the usually the case for pulmonary oedema <pause dur="0.4"/> and it occurs when we get a failure of the left ventricle <pause dur="5.1"/> remember that the <pause dur="0.3"/> blood from the lungs <pause dur="0.5"/> comes back to the heart <pause dur="0.2"/> through the pulmonary veins <pause dur="0.4"/> comes back into the left side of the heart first into the atrium <pause dur="0.5"/> and then into the left ventricle <pause dur="0.4"/> where it's pumped around the body <pause dur="2.2"/> if the left ventricle is damaged <pause dur="0.4"/> then it cannot pump the blood away around the body so effectively <pause dur="0.6"/> the the left ventricle if its pumping action is damaged <pause dur="0.4"/> tends to be filled with blood <pause dur="0.6"/> and that backs up into the left atrium <pause dur="0.3"/> and that backs up into the pulmonary veins <pause dur="0.2"/> and that backs up into the capillaries of the lungs 
themselves <pause dur="0.3"/> so if the heart can't pump the blood away from the lungs <pause dur="0.4"/> the pressure <pause dur="0.4"/> in the lungs <pause dur="0.2"/> will increase <pause dur="0.4"/> so left ventricle damage <pause dur="1.6"/> gives us <pause dur="0.2"/> an increased <pause dur="0.2"/> P-C capillary pressure <pause dur="0.4"/> in the lungs <pause dur="0.4"/> and that's a common # effect of <pause dur="0.2"/> a heart attack <pause dur="0.7"/> because it's it's extremely common for heart attacks to damage <pause dur="0.5"/> the muscle of the <pause dur="0.4"/> left ventricle <pause dur="5.0"/> now when this happens <pause dur="0.5"/> the lung starts to <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> fill with water <pause dur="1.4"/> and initially <pause dur="0.3"/> that makes the lungs very stiff <pause dur="1.6"/> that would be the first thing <pause dur="0.4"/> that would be noticed it would be hard to breathe <pause dur="6.6"/> that would be the first step just a a stiffening of the lungs due to <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.8"/> to <pause dur="0.3"/> water accumulation <pause dur="1.4"/> but also <pause dur="0.3"/> the <pause dur="0.5"/> <trunc>w</trunc> extra water there increases the diffusion distances <pause dur="5.7"/> i've talked about <pause dur="0.3"/> how the lungs are very carefully designed to bring the gas as close as possible to the blood <pause dur="0.7"/> the gas in the blood is separated only by a fraction of a micron <pause dur="0.5"/> and diffusion takes place over that distance <pause dur="0.5"/> but if the lungs are filled with fluid <pause dur="0.4"/> then the gas has to diffuse through the fluid before it can get into the blood <pause dur="0.5"/> and so <pause dur="0.3"/> we get an increase in diffusion distances <pause dur="0.3"/> and that gives us <pause dur="0.4"/> poor gas exchange <pause dur="4.5"/> 
so <pause dur="0.9"/> it seems unusual <pause dur="0.6"/> i mean it seems <pause dur="0.3"/> not unusual it seems <pause dur="0.7"/> strange that when somebody's had a heart attack <pause dur="0.4"/> they start to have problems with breathing and you often see people with <pause dur="0.3"/> chronic heart complaints they have to use <pause dur="0.3"/> oxygen masks they will have oxygen cylinders at home <pause dur="0.5"/> and it's not easy in your mind to see <pause dur="0.4"/> what the connection is between the breathing and the heart attack but it's this <pause dur="0.5"/> that if the heart can't pump the blood away <pause dur="0.4"/> then the lungs the <pause dur="0.2"/> capillary pressure goes up in the lungs <pause dur="0.3"/> lungs will fill with fluid <pause dur="0.3"/> and that makes it harder to breathe <pause dur="3.4"/> and this is a dangerous condition <pause dur="0.4"/> meaning that it can easily be <pause dur="0.4"/> fatal you can just have inadequate <pause dur="0.4"/> gas exchange <pause dur="0.6"/> and # <pause dur="0.6"/> this is the death rattle that's referred to in Victorian melodramas that <pause dur="0.2"/> the the death rattle was <pause dur="0.4"/> the gases in the lungs bubbling through the fluid that has accumulated in the lungs <pause dur="0.4"/> in pulmonary oedema <pause dur="9.1"/><kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="38"/> are there any questions about <pause dur="0.5"/> what i've said so far <pause dur="2.3"/> no <pause dur="0.4"/> okay <pause dur="23.6"/> i'm going to finish up <pause dur="0.4"/> with two short 
topics <pause dur="0.8"/> the the first is the return how how the <pause dur="0.6"/> water and solutes are returned to the heart <pause dur="0.7"/> and the second is <pause dur="0.2"/> on the control of blood pressure <pause dur="0.6"/> so let's start with <pause dur="1.1"/> the return of <pause dur="0.7"/> water and solutes <pause dur="0.8"/> to the heart <pause dur="17.2"/> and <pause dur="0.6"/> you know already from what i've said that there are two <trunc>rou</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> two routes back to the heart <pause dur="0.5"/> one through the blood system <pause dur="0.3"/> and one through the lymphatic system <pause dur="0.4"/> so let's start with the <pause dur="0.6"/> blood system <pause dur="0.6"/> and it's of course the veins <pause dur="0.3"/> the venous system <pause dur="0.6"/> which is involved in this <pause dur="5.3"/> and i've mentioned already <pause dur="0.7"/> that as the <pause dur="0.3"/> capillaries converge as they come out of tissue beds <pause dur="0.4"/> they converge to form vessels called venules <pause dur="1.0"/> and then the venules converge <pause dur="0.5"/> to form the veins <pause dur="0.5"/> and the veins also <pause dur="0.5"/> converge <pause dur="0.4"/> and the largest veins are called vena cavae <pause dur="4.2"/> and there are three of these <pause dur="0.4"/> which enter the <pause dur="0.5"/> right side of the heart <pause dur="13.3"/> and the veins <pause dur="0.4"/> have <pause dur="0.7"/> the <pause dur="0.3"/> function not only of <pause dur="0.4"/> moving the blood back to the heart <pause dur="0.4"/> but they are also where we store our blood <pause dur="0.7"/> they are the <pause dur="0.2"/> the body's reservoir for 
blood <pause dur="0.5"/> and at any particular time about two-thirds of the blood <pause dur="0.4"/> will be in the venous system <pause dur="4.3"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> i <trunc>th</trunc>  i think i mentioned in the first lecture that we call <pause dur="0.4"/> veins capacitance vessels <pause dur="7.4"/> because they have this capacity to store blood <pause dur="0.4"/> and it's a variable capacity it's under control <pause dur="3.4"/> the veins are <pause dur="0.4"/> very <pause dur="0.7"/> stretchy <pause dur="1.1"/> they are very compliant <pause dur="4.0"/> that means that it doesn't take <pause dur="0.2"/> a big change in pressure to get a big change in volume even a little change in pressure <pause dur="0.4"/> will increase the volume substantially <pause dur="2.4"/> the reason for that <pause dur="0.4"/> is that the veins are very <pause dur="0.8"/> floppy <pause dur="0.3"/> structures and if you look at them in <trunc>c</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> cross-section <pause dur="0.4"/> they can collapse very easily <pause dur="0.4"/> so we might have a normal round vein <pause dur="0.4"/> but if we decrease the pressure in it it will become <pause dur="0.4"/> oval in cross-section <pause dur="0.3"/> and if we decrease the pressure even more <pause dur="0.3"/> it will collapse completely <pause dur="0.4"/> to look something like <pause dur="0.5"/> a dumbbell shape like that <pause dur="0.5"/> and obviously the amount of blood that can be stored has dropped dramatically <pause dur="0.4"/> as you go from the round shape to the dumb-bell 
shape <pause dur="0.4"/> but it doesn't need much pressure <pause dur="0.5"/> to inflate the veins again so they're very compliant <pause dur="11.3"/> and the <pause dur="0.8"/> the veins <pause dur="0.3"/> have <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> smooth muscle cells in the walls <pause dur="0.4"/> and their smooth muscle cells are under nervous control <pause dur="0.5"/> so the the diameter of the veins <pause dur="2.0"/> is under nervous control and i'll come back to that when i talk about <pause dur="1.6"/> blood <pause dur="0.2"/> the control of blood pressure <pause dur="7.5"/> now the other peculiarity about the veins <pause dur="0.5"/> is that there isn't enough pressure <pause dur="0.4"/> to bring the blood back to the heart <pause dur="0.6"/> when the blood comes out of the capillaries it has a very low pressure <pause dur="0.6"/> certainly not enough <pause dur="0.4"/> to drive the blood <trunc>f</trunc> say from your feet <pause dur="0.4"/> back to your heart <pause dur="0.4"/> so there's a problem there the body has to work out some <pause dur="0.2"/> additional way <pause dur="0.4"/> of getting that blood to <pause dur="0.6"/> <trunc>t</trunc> <pause dur="0.3"/> to # <pause dur="1.4"/> to to elevate that blood though that metre or two metres <pause dur="1.5"/> and <pause dur="0.8"/> it does this by <pause dur="1.2"/> having valves the veins have valves in them <pause dur="2.4"/> and they get squeezed the veins <trunc>ge</trunc> get squeezed from the outside so supposing we have a vein like this <pause dur="2.2"/><kinesic desc="writes on transparency" iterated="y" dur="9"/> and it has two <pause dur="2.1"/> 
valves in it <pause dur="3.5"/> so that's supposed to be a cross-section through a vein and there's <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.9"/> a <trunc>se</trunc> a segment of the vein enclosed <pause dur="0.5"/> by <pause dur="0.4"/><kinesic desc="writes on transparency" iterated="y" dur="32"/> valves and there's blood in here <pause dur="1.5"/> then if that vein gets squashed from the outside <pause dur="2.0"/> so if there's a pressure applied from the outside <pause dur="0.5"/> then the blood can only move in one direction <pause dur="0.6"/> it has to move back towards the heart <pause dur="0.4"/> so every time a vein gets squeezed from outside <pause dur="0.4"/> even though the blood pressure is normally low <pause dur="0.4"/> that <pause dur="0.2"/> is what moves the blood back towards the heart <pause dur="0.5"/> and this kind of squeezing <pause dur="0.7"/> can occur <pause dur="0.6"/> when you use your muscles <pause dur="1.1"/> and # <pause dur="1.2"/> this is a trick that's taught to soldiers when they stand on parade <pause dur="0.5"/> because if you stand completely still for a very long period of time <pause dur="0.4"/> there isn't any muscular action bringing the pressure back to the heart <pause dur="0.5"/> and you can easily faint because the blood pressure will drop <pause dur="0.5"/> as a result of there being a low <pause dur="0.3"/> cardiac output and i'm sure you've seen these pictures of a <pause dur="0.5"/> of a row of soldiers standing at attention and <pause dur="0.4"/> one of them was 
lying on the ground horizontally because he's fainted <pause dur="0.6"/> and and soldiers on <pause dur="0.2"/> parade are taught to twitch their calf muscles <pause dur="0.4"/> and their feet <pause dur="0.3"/> from time to time <pause dur="0.3"/> to squeeze their veins <pause dur="0.9"/> and this <pause dur="0.3"/> pushes the blood back to the heart <pause dur="0.4"/> by the Frank Starling mechanism that we've talked about <pause dur="0.4"/> that will increase the cardiac output <pause dur="0.4"/> and hence keep the blood pressure up <pause dur="1.3"/> but it's not just this voluntary <pause dur="0.2"/> sort of muscle use that # <pause dur="0.2"/> does this <pause dur="0.4"/> it's also <pause dur="0.3"/> when you breathe <pause dur="2.0"/><kinesic desc="writes on transparency" iterated="y" dur="3"/> and also <pause dur="0.5"/> to a smaller extent the peristaltic movements of the gut <pause dur="0.3"/> so it's not just your voluntary muscles but also these # <pause dur="0.8"/> automatic things that are going on <pause dur="0.6"/> and in particular when you breathe <pause dur="0.7"/> when you <pause dur="0.3"/> inflate your chest you reduce the pressure <pause dur="0.4"/> in the thorax <pause dur="0.2"/> and also in the abdomen as well because they're connected via the diaphragm <pause dur="0.5"/> and as you <trunc>incr</trunc> <pause dur="0.3"/> # decrease the pressure when you inflate your chest <pause dur="0.3"/> that will tend to draw blood up <pause dur="0.8"/> the veins and towards the heart <pause dur="0.3"/> and if you look at a blood pressure recording which 
shows the blood pressure beat by beat <pause dur="0.5"/> then # <pause dur="7.0"/><event desc="puts on transparency" iterated="n"/> you might expect a blood pressure trace <pause dur="2.8"/><kinesic desc="writes on transparency" iterated="y" dur="15"/> to look like this oscillating with each heartbeat but it doesn't look that it looks like this <pause dur="6.5"/> it has an extra longer wave superimposed on it and that's your breathing rhythm <pause dur="0.5"/> this is the heart beating <pause dur="0.4"/> and this slower wave <pause dur="0.5"/> is the breathing rhythm every time you breathe in <pause dur="0.4"/> more blood is drawn back towards the heart and the blood pressure goes up a little bit <pause dur="1.7"/> and conversely <pause dur="0.5"/> if you increase the pressure in your chest that reduces the blood flow back to the heart <pause dur="0.3"/> so if you cough <pause dur="0.2"/> for example <pause dur="0.4"/> that will reduce the the pressure during coughing <pause dur="0.4"/> in the chest gets extremely high <pause dur="0.4"/> and if you have a prolonged coughing fit <pause dur="0.5"/> that will stop the blood coming back to the heart long enough for you to faint <pause dur="0.5"/> so # babies that have whooping cough for instance one of the diagnostic features is that they lose consciousness <pause dur="0.4"/> during a coughing fit they go blue and lose consciousness <pause dur="0.5"/> and that's because <pause dur="0.4"/> the 
increased pressure in the thorax <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> <trunc>s</trunc> <pause dur="0.6"/> prevents the blood from coming back up the veins <pause dur="0.5"/> and # <pause dur="0.6"/> therefore the cardiac output goes down and not enough blood gets to the head <pause dur="9.6"/> 
so let's move on the other way of getting fluid <pause dur="0.3"/> and solutes back to the heart <pause dur="0.5"/> is through the lymphatic system <pause dur="4.4"/> and i introduced this system <pause dur="0.5"/> last week <pause dur="0.6"/> remember that i said that they were blind-ended capillaries this system lies parallel only to the venous side of the circulation <pause dur="0.5"/> there's a lymphatic equivalent to <pause dur="0.3"/> capillaries and venules and veins but not to <pause dur="0.3"/> arteries and arterioles so this is <pause dur="0.4"/> lying parallel just to the venous side <pause dur="0.6"/> and # remember that i said it has valves in it <pause dur="0.8"/> both at the <pause dur="0.2"/> capillary end where the endothelial cells act like flaps but also further up the lymphatic system it has <pause dur="0.3"/> proper valves <pause dur="0.4"/> and that it <trunc>ac</trunc> acts just like the venous system if it gets squeezed from outside <pause dur="0.4"/> that forces blood along the along the network of <trunc>lym</trunc> lymphatic vessels <pause dur="1.5"/> but the lymphatic system also <pause dur="0.3"/> has its 
own pump <pause dur="1.8"/> there is smooth muscle in the walls of the larger lymph vessels <pause dur="0.4"/> and it contracts rhythmically it's rather like the sort of primitive heart that you get in <pause dur="0.4"/> worms <pause dur="0.4"/> in in lower invertebrates <pause dur="0.7"/> that <trunc>f</trunc> it forces blood back # <trunc>f</trunc> shouldn't say blood it forces lymph back along the lymphatic system <pause dur="0.4"/> and as i mentioned last week it can generate <pause dur="0.4"/> high pressures <pause dur="1.2"/><kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="10"/> though what i didn't mention last week was where <pause dur="0.8"/> all that lymph ends up <pause dur="0.5"/> and this diagram is in your handout <pause dur="3.2"/> and it just shows the large scale anatomy <pause dur="0.4"/> of the lymphatic system <pause dur="0.7"/> and most of the lymph comes up this large vessel <pause dur="0.7"/> called <pause dur="0.2"/> the <pause dur="0.4"/> thoracic duct which i've underlined in green here <pause dur="0.5"/> and that lies very close to the aorta and the vena cava along the backbone <pause dur="0.4"/> so <pause dur="0.3"/> most of the lymph from your body <pause dur="0.4"/> tends to <pause dur="0.5"/> collect into this large thoracic duct <pause dur="0.7"/> and then it's # returned into the subclavian vein <pause dur="1.4"/> that duct joins onto the left <pause dur="0.3"/> subclavian <trunc>de</trunc> vein <pause dur="0.8"/> and that's how we return the lymph into the blood <pause dur="0.3"/> system the 
water just simply pours into one of the veins <pause dur="0.9"/> that's about eighty per cent of the lymph about twenty per cent comes <pause dur="0.4"/> through <pause dur="0.2"/> another vessel on the right side of the body <pause dur="0.8"/> and this is lymph that's collected from the right <pause dur="0.3"/> thorax the right arm and the right side of the head <pause dur="0.7"/> it enters into <pause dur="0.4"/> another vessel which i've also lined in underlined in green here that's the right <pause dur="0.3"/> lymph duct <pause dur="0.4"/> that's about twenty per cent of the lymph comes in that <pause dur="0.4"/> route <pause dur="0.3"/> and that enters into the right subclavian vein <pause dur="0.3"/> instead of the left subclavian vein <pause dur="15.7"/><kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="15"/> are there any questions about <pause dur="0.2"/> veins or <pause dur="0.2"/> the lymphatic system <pause dur="2.9"/> no <pause dur="0.2"/> good <pause dur="0.4"/> okay <pause dur="0.7"/> well i'll move on to the final topic <pause dur="0.2"/> a brief topic <pause dur="3.0"/> and that is <pause dur="0.4"/> the control of blood pressure <pause dur="20.7"/><kinesic desc="writes on transparency" iterated="y" dur="8"/> # the reason that i've had to leave this topic until the end we've i i <pause dur="0.3"/> hope you've noticed that i've gone around the circulation starting with the heart going around the arteries to the capillaries <pause dur="0.4"/> and then back to the heart <pause dur="0.8"/> and # <pause dur="0.2"/> the reason i've left the control of blood pressure 
till the end <pause dur="0.4"/> is that it involves just about every aspect of the circulation so i couldn't introduce that until <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="1.5"/> # until i've discussed everything else <pause dur="2.4"/> and you should note that when people talk about <pause dur="0.2"/> blood pressure <pause dur="0.5"/> they are generally talking about arterial <pause dur="0.4"/> blood pressure when you go and have your <pause dur="0.5"/> blood pressure measured or as you measured it in the practicals <pause dur="0.5"/> that's the blood pressure in the large arteries near the heart <pause dur="0.5"/> usually the brachial artery <pause dur="8.0"/> as well as involving all the vessels that i've talked about <pause dur="0.8"/> this involves a specialized set of receptors <pause dur="1.1"/> that are called baroreceptors <pause dur="0.6"/> and you should have come across these when you <pause dur="0.7"/> wrote up your <pause dur="1.4"/> # <pause dur="1.4"/> wrote up your practical <pause dur="1.3"/> and the baroreceptors <pause dur="0.5"/> the <pause dur="0.2"/> prefix the baro here comes <pause dur="0.5"/> # means pressure <pause dur="0.3"/> in the in the same way as you find it in barometer for instance so these are pressure <pause dur="0.2"/> sensors <pause dur="1.0"/> and they're found in two locations in the arterial system <pause dur="0.9"/> one is the <pause dur="0.5"/> carotid sinus <pause dur="4.2"/> at <pause dur="0.3"/> two main locations i could say i should say there 
there are other <pause dur="0.5"/> less important locations too <pause dur="0.5"/> the first one is in the carotid sinus the carotid artery's the large artery <pause dur="0.4"/> coming up either side of the neck <pause dur="0.4"/> and it splits into two <pause dur="0.4"/> one side helps to feed the brain and the other side <pause dur="0.3"/> feeds the face and the scalp <pause dur="0.7"/> and <pause dur="0.4"/> where the artery splits in two <pause dur="0.4"/> there's a kind of swelling at that bifurcation that's the carotid sinus <pause dur="1.6"/> and the other location <pause dur="0.4"/> is the aortic arch <pause dur="3.7"/> so that's as the <pause dur="0.5"/> # aorta is <pause dur="0.3"/> coming out of the heart it comes up and turns <pause dur="0.2"/> curves in two dimensions before it goes down <pause dur="0.3"/> along the backbone <pause dur="0.4"/> and at the <pause dur="0.2"/> top of the arch there are more of these receptors <pause dur="0.9"/> which are not to be confused with chemoreceptors <pause dur="0.5"/> remember that i talked to you about chemoreceptors when i was talking about the control of ventilation <pause dur="0.4"/> and the chemoreceptors are in the same place <pause dur="0.4"/> that's a separate system so don't get these two <pause dur="0.4"/> confused <pause dur="3.6"/> so if we have <pause dur="0.4"/> an increase in pressure <pause dur="0.6"/> or an increase <pause dur="0.2"/> in pulse pressure <pause dur="2.2"/> and by pulse pressure <pause dur="1.2"/> is meant the difference 
between systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure <pause dur="0.3"/> so it's how much the blood pressure <pause dur="0.3"/> jumps each heartbeat <pause dur="2.2"/> if these increase <pause dur="0.6"/> then we get <pause dur="0.3"/> an increase in firing <pause dur="0.5"/> of the baroreceptors <pause dur="8.0"/> and this is sent to the medulla <pause dur="6.1"/> where there's something that used to be called <pause dur="0.3"/> the cardiovascular centre <pause dur="0.4"/> but it's unfashionable to call it that these days <pause dur="0.6"/> it used to be thought that <pause dur="0.5"/> each <pause dur="0.3"/> physiological system had a centre in the brain there'd be a cardiovascular centre and a respiratory centre <pause dur="0.4"/> and that's now believed to be too simplistic but you'll probably still see that in textbooks <pause dur="0.5"/> it will be referred to as the medullary cardiovascular <pause dur="0.3"/> centre but it's in the brain stem a set of neurones in the brain stem that are <pause dur="0.5"/> concerned with regulating <pause dur="0.5"/> # blood pressure <pause dur="1.7"/> and <pause dur="1.0"/> the <trunc>m</trunc> medulla reacts <pause dur="0.4"/> by <pause dur="0.3"/> # changing the <pause dur="0.4"/> firing of the <pause dur="0.9"/> parasympathetic and the sympathetic nervous system <pause dur="0.4"/> so in this case we'd get an increase <pause dur="0.4"/> in the parasympathetic <pause dur="0.5"/> nervous system firing <pause dur="0.3"/> and a decrease in the 
sympathetic <pause dur="0.4"/> nervous system firing <pause dur="1.5"/> these are the two components of the autonomic nervous system <pause dur="3.9"/> and these changes <pause dur="0.6"/> decrease pressure <pause dur="2.1"/> and we'll see how in a moment <pause dur="2.9"/> so we have a nice little negative feedback loop here a reflex <pause dur="0.5"/> and it's called the <trunc>baro</trunc> <pause dur="0.6"/> baroreceptor reflex <pause dur="0.4"/> or the baroreflex <pause dur="0.4"/> for short <pause dur="1.7"/> and i hope you've come across this when you wrote up your <pause dur="0.6"/> cardiovascular practical that's the baroreflex <pause dur="2.6"/> now before i say what this does <pause dur="0.3"/><kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="9"/> i just want to say <pause dur="0.7"/> a few <pause dur="0.2"/> words about <pause dur="1.1"/> what <pause dur="0.5"/> blood pressure actually is <pause dur="1.8"/> and remember that we've got these variables <pause dur="1.5"/> blood flow <pause dur="0.7"/> blood pressure <pause dur="0.6"/> and <pause dur="0.5"/> resistance <pause dur="1.0"/> and who can tell me <pause dur="0.2"/> how i arrange those <pause dur="1.0"/> into an equation what's the relationship this is so important to remember this equation <pause dur="5.5"/><vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" dur="1"/><pause dur="1.2"/> please learn this <pause dur="9.9"/> in fact it's it's more strictly written <pause dur="0.2"/> delta-P equals Q-R <pause dur="0.6"/> that is the difference in pressure that drives the flow <pause dur="0.3"/> to drive flow round a pipe we have to have a a higher pressure at one end <pause dur="0.4"/> than another please please <pause dur="0.4"/> do learn this <pause dur="0.6"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> 
as i've pointed out several times already it's the same <pause dur="0.4"/> as Ohm's law if you know Ohm's law you shouldn't have any trouble remembering this <pause dur="7.1"/> now <pause dur="0.7"/> in the circulation <pause dur="0.5"/> if we take apply this equation to the circulation as a whole <pause dur="0.7"/> we can say that this is the blood pressure <pause dur="0.6"/> coming out of the heart <pause dur="9.5"/> minus the blood pressure <pause dur="1.9"/> coming into the heart <pause dur="5.0"/> that's the pressure gradient that drives <pause dur="0.3"/> blood flow around the whole circulation <pause dur="0.3"/> the pressure generated by the heart <pause dur="0.3"/> minus the pressure of the blood when it returns to the heart <pause dur="1.6"/> and that equals <pause dur="0.5"/> the flow rate but the flow rate for the whole circulation <pause dur="0.3"/> is the same as the cardiac output <pause dur="5.1"/> that is the flow of blood around the circulation <pause dur="0.3"/> the flow of blood around the whole circulation is obviously the blood that's been pushed out by the heart <pause dur="0.4"/> so we can say that the flow rate is the cardiac output <pause dur="0.5"/> and cardiac output equals <pause dur="1.7"/><vocal desc="laugh" iterated="n"/><pause dur="1.2"/> come on guys <vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" dur="1"/></u><pause dur="4.5"/> <u who="sm0232" trans="pause"> five litres </u><pause dur="0.4"/> <u who="nm0228" trans="pause"> sorry </u><pause dur="0.2"/> <u who="sm0232" trans="pause"> five litres per minute </u><pause dur="0.5"/> <u who="nm0228" trans="pause"> yes <pause dur="0.2"/> right <pause dur="0.5"/> five litres per minute but <trunc>w</trunc> <pause dur="4.0"/> what <pause dur="0.2"/> i said </u><pause dur="0.3"/> <u who="sm0232" trans="pause"> stroke volume times heart rate </u><u who="nm0228" trans="latching"> 
stroke volume times heart rate <pause dur="3.0"/> stroke volume <pause dur="0.8"/> times heart rate <pause dur="0.8"/> and then we have <pause dur="0.4"/> the resistance <pause dur="0.4"/> and where does the resistance of the circulation lie <pause dur="1.4"/> in the arterioles and we call it we have a <pause dur="0.3"/> a name for it <pause dur="1.4"/> total peripheral resistance <pause dur="0.3"/> T-P-R <pause dur="1.5"/> now <pause dur="0.4"/> the blood pressure coming into the heart i've just told you is very low <pause dur="0.3"/> there's almost no pressure in the blood <pause dur="0.5"/> by the time it gets to the heart it has to be sucked back up by our breathing muscles and something <pause dur="0.3"/> so i'm going to cross that out <pause dur="1.6"/><kinesic desc="writes on transparency" iterated="y" dur="1"/> and call that zero <pause dur="0.8"/> so the blood pressure coming into the heart is zero <pause dur="0.4"/> and the blood pressure coming out of the heart into the large arteries <pause dur="0.3"/> i've just told you is what we call <pause dur="0.3"/> blood pressure <pause dur="0.3"/> when you measure the blood pressure in a large artery <pause dur="0.3"/> that's effectively the pressure just outside the heart <pause dur="0.3"/> so we can simplify this whole thing <pause dur="0.4"/> as the blood pressure <pause dur="0.7"/><kinesic desc="writes on transparency" iterated="y" dur="16"/> yeah <pause dur="0.3"/> what we <pause dur="0.4"/> conventionally call blood pressure <pause dur="0.5"/> equals cardiac output <pause dur="0.6"/> that is <pause dur="0.3"/> stroke volume times heart rate <pause dur="1.6"/> multiplied by the resistance 
in the arterioles <pause dur="0.4"/> which we call <pause dur="0.4"/> total peripheral resistance and please do <pause dur="0.5"/> learn how to arrive at that point <pause dur="2.9"/><kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="11"/> and that's all i want to say <pause dur="0.4"/> about blood pressure except to show you on your <trunc>di</trunc> on your handout <pause dur="1.8"/> that you have <pause dur="0.2"/> the baroreflex here <pause dur="0.3"/><vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/><pause dur="6.2"/> here you have <pause dur="0.3"/> at the top <pause dur="0.8"/> the <pause dur="0.2"/> arterial pressure <pause dur="2.3"/> and its being detected by the baroreceptors <pause dur="1.4"/> and the baroreceptors <pause dur="0.9"/> have to alter the blood pressure to bring it back to normal <pause dur="0.4"/> if if say <pause dur="0.3"/> this this example <pause dur="0.3"/> is given in the case of a fall in arterial <pause dur="0.2"/> pressure which would happen <pause dur="0.3"/> if you had a bad accident say and lost a lot of blood <pause dur="0.3"/> through haemorrhage <pause dur="0.7"/> or if you stood up quickly <pause dur="0.3"/> and a lot of your blood remained in your feet and didn't return to the heart <pause dur="0.4"/> then your blood pressure would drop <pause dur="0.4"/> and that would be picked up by the baroreceptors <pause dur="0.4"/> and the baroreceptors would have to do something about it <pause dur="0.5"/> and from this <pause dur="0.3"/> equation <pause dur="0.4"/> you can see exactly what they have to do <pause dur="0.4"/> if you want to increase blood pressure <pause dur="0.4"/> you have to increase 
cardiac output <pause dur="0.4"/> that is you increase the stroke volume <pause dur="0.3"/> and the heart rate <pause dur="0.9"/> and you increase total peripheral resistance you constrict the arterioles <pause dur="0.4"/> so if you want to <pause dur="0.4"/> to raise blood pressure <pause dur="0.6"/> you have to make the heart beat faster <pause dur="0.5"/> make it beat stronger <pause dur="0.3"/> and constrict your blood vessels <pause dur="2.9"/> now i've asterisked <pause dur="0.2"/> here <pause dur="0.7"/> those three <pause dur="3.4"/> parts of the feedback loop <pause dur="0.3"/> the increase in heart rate <pause dur="0.3"/> the increase in stroke volume <pause dur="0.3"/> and the increase in peripheral resistance where did you see the increase in heart rate <pause dur="3.1"/> in the practical <pause dur="0.8"/> when you stood up you measured blood pressure <pause dur="0.5"/> which stayed more or less constant that's because the baroreflex was working <pause dur="1.2"/> but the heart rate went up <pause dur="0.6"/> went up a lot ten or fifteen beats per minute a big percentage increase <pause dur="0.5"/> that's this part of the loop the baroreflex increasing the heart rate <pause dur="0.4"/> to try and keep your blood pressure up <pause dur="2.8"/> # i just want to point out here <pause dur="0.4"/> that it's not just your arterioles that constrict <pause dur="0.5"/> but also your veins that constrict i've just 
talked about your veins being under control <pause dur="0.5"/> here we have constriction of the veins <pause dur="0.3"/> and what that does is to squeeze blood towards the heart <pause dur="0.6"/> and <pause dur="1.1"/> makes the heart beat faster <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> beat stronger <pause dur="0.6"/> and what i want you to do <pause dur="0.8"/> some time between now and the exams <pause dur="0.4"/> is to go through this diagram we've covered all the bits individually <pause dur="0.3"/> in different lectures <pause dur="0.4"/> throughout the <pause dur="0.3"/> lecture course so far <pause dur="0.3"/> and i want you to make sure <pause dur="0.4"/> that you understand what's going on <pause dur="0.5"/> at each <pause dur="0.6"/> at each # step <pause dur="0.4"/> so if for instance if i point out to you here <pause dur="0.5"/> that an increase in end-diastolic volume <pause dur="0.4"/> makes the heart <pause dur="0.2"/> <trunc>pr</trunc> pump out more blood <pause dur="0.4"/> that's something we've already covered can anybody remember what that's called <pause dur="0.9"/> an increase in end-diastolic volume increase in <pause dur="0.3"/> the stroke volume <pause dur="1.7"/><vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" dur="1"/><pause dur="0.8"/> i've obviously left a deep impression <pause dur="0.4"/> that's the 
Frank Starling mechanism <pause dur="0.2"/> <unclear>at the out</unclear> <pause dur="0.3"/> the <pause dur="0.3"/> heart pumps out <pause dur="0.5"/> what is returned to it <pause dur="0.3"/> so i want you to go through this diagram and make sure that you can do that for each step in the diagram <pause dur="0.4"/> because we have covered all the individual bits <pause dur="2.7"/> okay <pause dur="0.9"/> the next two lectures the next two weeks will be on <pause dur="0.4"/> much broader topics next week i'm going to be talking about some specialized circulations which are rather interesting <pause dur="0.5"/> and the week after that i'm going to talk about how the <trunc>circuli</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> <trunc>s</trunc> how the circulation <pause dur="0.3"/> adapts to special <pause dur="0.2"/> conditions and i'm going to be <pause dur="0.4"/> taking the aviation world as an example of that <pause dur="0.8"/> # and i have <pause dur="0.2"/> # the marked practicals <pause dur="0.4"/> if you want to come and collect your practicals that were handed in last week i have them here
