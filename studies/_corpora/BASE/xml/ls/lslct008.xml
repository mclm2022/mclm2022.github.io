<u who="nm0239"> yesterday i started by talking or i finished i should say <pause dur="0.5"/> by talking to you about the different classification schemes that are available <pause dur="0.7"/> clinical classification schemes that are available for AIDS diagnosis <pause dur="1.0"/> and for monitoring the progression in the disease <pause dur="0.7"/> and you remember i said to you that there were two schemes there was one developed by the Centre for Disease Control in Atlanta <pause dur="1.0"/> and then there was a second scheme developed by the Walter Reed Hospital in Washington <pause dur="0.8"/> the <trunc>atla</trunc> the the C-D-C scheme <pause dur="0.6"/> was <pause dur="0.4"/> based primarily on clinical observation <pause dur="0.2"/> so it was not terribly laboratory based <pause dur="0.8"/> whereas the Walter Reed <pause dur="0.4"/> scheme <pause dur="0.3"/> was more based on measuring <trunc>clinic</trunc> you know measuring clinical parameters in the laboratory <pause dur="0.7"/> over the years since these two schemes <pause dur="0.6"/> came available <pause dur="0.4"/> it's the C-D-C scheme <pause dur="0.3"/> that has gained <pause dur="1.7"/> common usage <pause dur="0.7"/> and you remember that it's divided into four stages <pause dur="1.0"/> one through four <pause dur="3.1"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="5"/> 
and that i <pause dur="0.6"/> finished yesterday by talking about stage one which is the <pause dur="0.3"/> acute or primary infection stage <pause dur="0.7"/> and i said to you that <pause dur="0.5"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="1"/> during this period <pause dur="1.3"/> that people were seroconverting they were they'd been infected <pause dur="0.4"/> they were seroconverting the important thing to remember about this stage <pause dur="0.5"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="2"/> is there is a large viremia <pause dur="1.9"/> and so that at this stage the people <pause dur="0.4"/> are probably <pause dur="0.4"/> at greatest <pause dur="0.7"/> # chance of passing on the infections to others <pause dur="0.8"/> but in fact in the majority of cases <pause dur="0.3"/> they will not themselves at that point know that they are actually infected <pause dur="1.0"/> so the point at which they constitute the greatest risk to society in terms of passing on the infection <pause dur="0.6"/> they are probably completely unaware that they are infected themselves <pause dur="1.2"/> okay <pause dur="0.9"/> stage one is of course followed by stage two <pause dur="0.6"/> stage two is the <pause dur="1.1"/> asymptomatic infection phase <pause dur="1.1"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="3"/> so that's the phase along here <pause dur="0.3"/> in terms of time <pause dur="1.0"/> 
and whereas stage one <pause dur="1.1"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="12"/> is measured in terms of <pause dur="0.3"/> weeks <pause dur="2.3"/> so really anything up to about <pause dur="0.3"/> sixteen to twenty weeks that sort of period <pause dur="2.1"/> stage two <pause dur="0.6"/> is measured in years <pause dur="2.2"/> and its <pause dur="0.2"/> its length <pause dur="0.3"/> is unpredictable <pause dur="3.2"/> okay so <pause dur="0.5"/> it's difficult to predict how long stage two is going to be for an individual <pause dur="1.5"/> the key thing about stage two <pause dur="0.4"/> is during stage two <pause dur="0.3"/> although the people are infected <pause dur="1.0"/> they are well <pause dur="0.2"/> they are <trunc>ge</trunc> in general terms <pause dur="0.3"/> healthy <pause dur="2.4"/> now clearly if you are someone that who is infected <pause dur="0.7"/> the thing that you want to know more than anything else <pause dur="0.5"/> is how long am i going to be in stage two <pause dur="1.5"/> if you're going to be in stage two for thirty years <pause dur="0.8"/> you're probably not going to worry too much about being infected <pause dur="0.3"/> 'cause you're probably going to die of something else before you come down with AIDS <pause dur="0.9"/> but if someone 
says to you <pause dur="0.3"/> well you're likely to be in stage two for about two-and-a-half years <pause dur="0.6"/> given that you've almost certainly been infected in mid-adult life in the in the period <pause dur="0.4"/> twenty to forty <pause dur="0.7"/> then if somebody tells you that you're going to come down with AIDS in two-and-a-half years that's clearly <pause dur="0.5"/> much more profound effect on your life <pause dur="0.3"/> than if they'd said to you you were going to come down in <trunc>a</trunc> with AIDS in in thirty years <pause dur="1.7"/> so <pause dur="0.2"/> clearly one of the things that that <pause dur="0.3"/> people have looked for <pause dur="0.6"/> in <pause dur="1.4"/> trying to study this infection <pause dur="0.3"/> is prognostic indicators <pause dur="0.3"/> of the length of period <pause dur="0.7"/> of stage two <pause dur="1.4"/> so are there any indicators are there any clinical indicators of the infection <pause dur="0.4"/> that allow you to predict for an individual <pause dur="0.4"/> how long they are likely to be in stage two <pause dur="2.4"/> well what can we say about the length of <pause dur="0.5"/> stage two i've said it's in years <pause dur="4.0"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="3"/> what do we know about the numbers <pause dur="0.7"/> well <pause dur="0.3"/> in the early days there was a <pause dur="0.3"/> study done of <pause dur="1.4"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="2"/> 
six-thousand-seven-hundred <pause dur="0.9"/> homosexual and bisexual men in the United States <pause dur="0.6"/> over a period of eighty-eight months <pause dur="1.2"/> now that's about seven-and-a-half years <pause dur="1.3"/> these people were all infected <pause dur="0.2"/> they were all <pause dur="0.2"/> H-I-V positive <pause dur="0.4"/> at the point when they were taken into the study <pause dur="1.3"/> and in that seven-and-a-half years thirty-six per cent of them <pause dur="0.9"/> had developed AIDS <pause dur="2.7"/> forty-four per cent of them <pause dur="0.6"/> had developed a condition called <pause dur="0.5"/> ARC <pause dur="1.2"/> ARC stands for AIDS related complex <pause dur="14.6"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="14"/> and ARC is a series of opportunistic infections it's not full-blown AIDS <pause dur="1.5"/> but it's <pause dur="0.3"/> it's a <pause dur="0.5"/> it's <pause dur="0.4"/> what happens <pause dur="0.4"/> at the end <pause dur="0.2"/> of the asymptomatic period <pause dur="0.4"/> when people are starting to go into AIDS <pause dur="1.0"/> so forty-four per cent of them were <pause dur="0.8"/> in ARC <pause dur="0.7"/> twenty per cent of them were <pause dur="0.3"/> asymptomatic so <pause dur="0.2"/> twenty per cent of them after seven-and-a-half years <pause dur="0.4"/> were still <pause dur="0.2"/> completely well <trunc>c</trunc> still in stage two <pause dur="6.6"/> what about prognostic indicators <pause dur="1.2"/> well <pause dur="3.2"/> one of the <pause dur="0.6"/> best prognostic indicators still <pause dur="1.2"/> is the level of your C-D-four <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="3"/> count <pause dur="3.7"/> you will all remember i hope that <pause dur="0.3"/> T-cells <pause dur="0.4"/> in 
the blood can be divided into a number of <pause dur="0.4"/> subsets depending upon the <pause dur="0.4"/> antigens being expressed on their outer surface <pause dur="0.7"/> the two major divisions of <pause dur="0.9"/> T-cells are into C-D-four-positive cells <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="2"/> and C-D-eight-<pause dur="1.1"/>positive cells <pause dur="0.5"/> the C-D-eight positive cells are the <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="2"/> so-called <pause dur="0.5"/> cytotoxic T-lymphocytes <pause dur="0.7"/> so those are the affector cells <pause dur="0.3"/> of the cell mediated immune response <pause dur="0.8"/> whereas the C-D-four cells are predominantly the T-helper cells <pause dur="1.3"/> and it's C-D-four cells <pause dur="0.8"/> that H-I-V targets <pause dur="0.4"/> predominantly C-D-four cells <pause dur="0.8"/> that H-I-V will infect <pause dur="0.3"/> that's not solely the case but that's the predominant population <pause dur="0.4"/> of cells <pause dur="0.3"/> that H-I-V infects <pause dur="1.5"/> and what you can <pause dur="0.3"/> show <pause dur="0.5"/> is that <pause dur="0.5"/> if you have a C-D-four count <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="2"/> of less than two-hundred <pause dur="1.9"/> per ml <pause dur="6.0"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="1"/> then in a twenty month period in a study over 
a twenty month period with where people were entering the study <pause dur="0.5"/> with less than two-hundred <pause dur="0.8"/> C-D-four positive cells per ml <pause dur="0.4"/> in their bloodstream sixty per cent of them <pause dur="2.1"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="5"/> at the end of the <pause dur="0.6"/> twenty month period <pause dur="0.6"/> sixty per cent of them had AIDS <pause dur="2.4"/> whereas for those with <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="9"/> greater than two-hundred<pause dur="1.3"/> C-D-four cells per ml <pause dur="0.6"/> only ten per cent of them <pause dur="3.6"/> were in AIDS <pause dur="2.7"/> so you can see that is a fairly good prognostic indicator <pause dur="1.5"/> if the if you measure the level of C-D-four cells in the bloodstream and you find that it's greater than two-hundred per ml <pause dur="0.7"/> then <pause dur="0.4"/> you have a <pause dur="0.4"/> relatively <pause dur="0.2"/> low chance of proceeding to AIDS <pause dur="0.5"/> in the <pause dur="0.2"/> next two-and-a-half years <pause dur="0.3"/> twenty months <pause dur="0.3"/> <trunc>two-and-a-b</trunc> <pause dur="0.3"/> # # under two years <pause dur="0.4"/> next two years just under two years <pause dur="1.2"/> whereas if your C-D-four count in the blood is less than two-hundred <pause dur="0.9"/> then you have a significantly higher chance of progressing to AIDS in the next twenty-odd months <pause dur="3.8"/> 
there is one slight complication <kinesic desc="indicates point on board" iterated="n"/> in this measurement and that is that C-D-four cells undergo a <pause dur="0.6"/> diurnal rhythm <pause dur="0.2"/> that is to say they're there's a </u><gap reason="break in recording" extent="uncertain"/> <u who="nm0239" trans="pause"> if you measure them <pause dur="0.4"/> at different times of the day you get different numbers <pause dur="0.3"/> so you have to measure them at a specific time in the day because there's a natural biorhythm <pause dur="1.6"/> of C-D-four level cells in the bloodstream <pause dur="5.7"/> what about other indicators <pause dur="1.2"/> of <pause dur="1.6"/> progression out of asymptomatic phase into # <pause dur="0.9"/> into AIDS <pause dur="1.1"/> well <pause dur="0.9"/> you can look at the <pause dur="0.2"/> proliferative response <pause dur="0.2"/> induced by <pause dur="0.2"/> general antigens you will all have had <pause dur="0.4"/> the Mantoux test <pause dur="0.5"/> for T-B where <pause dur="0.2"/> some antigens are spotted on your skin <pause dur="0.3"/> and you you <pause dur="0.3"/> come up in blebs <pause dur="0.4"/> as a proliferative response to those antigens <pause dur="0.5"/> whether you've got an immune response to those antigens <pause dur="0.4"/> well you can take general antigens like that and you can test <pause dur="0.7"/> people who are H-I-V positive <pause dur="0.3"/> and ask how good is their response to such general antigens <pause dur="0.5"/> if they give a poor response to general antigens <pause dur="0.4"/> that's a bad sign <pause dur="1.5"/> okay <pause dur="1.1"/> if they 
have <trunc>decr</trunc> decreased natural killer cell activity <pause dur="0.6"/> that's also a bad sign <pause dur="4.6"/> other factors that seem to affect progression <pause dur="0.4"/> out of the asymptomatic stage two <pause dur="0.5"/> into the later stages <pause dur="2.6"/> well <pause dur="1.4"/> other infectious agents <pause dur="1.3"/> there is some suggestion that <pause dur="1.1"/> if you are infected for example with treponema <pause dur="0.3"/> syphilis if you have syphilis remember <pause dur="0.5"/> H-I-V is predominantly a sexually transmitted disease globally as you'll see in a minute when i come on to the global figures <pause dur="1.2"/> and <pause dur="0.9"/> a coinfection <pause dur="0.7"/> with <pause dur="0.5"/> other <pause dur="0.2"/> sexually transmitted diseases <pause dur="0.3"/> seems to be bad news <pause dur="6.5"/> there is a suggestion although it's never been quantified <pause dur="0.3"/> that there may be a genetic component <pause dur="0.9"/> to <pause dur="1.1"/> susceptibility to <pause dur="0.3"/> to <pause dur="1.0"/> progression into AIDS <pause dur="1.2"/> now that's probably almost certainly got to do with the quality of your immune response how good is the immune response that you start out with <pause dur="3.3"/> the better it is <pause dur="1.3"/> the better your chance of remaining for a longer period <pause dur="0.4"/> in the asymptomatic phase <pause dur="3.0"/> when you come out of the asymptomatic phase into 
stage three <pause dur="2.3"/> stage three is <pause dur="4.5"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="2"/> sometimes associated with this <kinesic desc="indicates point on board" iterated="n"/> AIDS related complex <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="2"/> stage four <pause dur="1.4"/> is full-blown AIDS <pause dur="1.4"/> now in the last few years stage stages three and four <pause dur="0.3"/> have tended to be conflated together <pause dur="3.7"/> because once people start to show ARC <pause dur="0.5"/> they relatively rapidly progress into <pause dur="0.9"/> into AIDS <pause dur="4.3"/> now what are the symptoms of stage four <pause dur="0.7"/> what sort of things do you <pause dur="0.6"/> do you suffer from in stage four <pause dur="1.4"/> well there's a variety of symptoms <pause dur="1.3"/> chronic fevers <pause dur="0.3"/> night sweats <pause dur="0.3"/> diarrhoea <pause dur="0.6"/> dramatic weight loss <pause dur="1.4"/> herpes zoster shingles <pause dur="1.4"/> oral thrush <pause dur="1.8"/> # <pause dur="1.4"/> athlete's foot <pause dur="0.6"/> a whole series of opportunistic infections that normally your immune system <pause dur="0.4"/> would deal with relatively straightforwardly <pause dur="0.6"/> become major problems for you <pause dur="0.9"/> quite often for example AIDS sufferers have athlete's foot that comes up to the knee <pause dur="1.7"/> okay <pause dur="0.5"/> it's a very unpleasant disease <pause dur="1.1"/> once you get into full-blown AIDS <pause dur="2.0"/> what is the <pause dur="0.8"/> in order to <pause dur="0.2"/> be categorized as in 
<trunc>gra</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> in stage four <pause dur="0.7"/> you have to have fevers for <trunc>pers</trunc> persisting for more than a month <pause dur="3.6"/> involuntary weight loss at greater than ten per cent of baseline <pause dur="1.3"/> so in other words if you weighed ten stone <pause dur="0.6"/> you've got to have lost more than a stone in a short period of time if your natural <pause dur="0.2"/> body weight <pause dur="0.4"/> is ten stone <pause dur="0.3"/> and you've gone down below nine stone <pause dur="0.4"/> then you're in then <pause dur="0.2"/> you're in <pause dur="0.3"/> full-blown AIDS by definition <pause dur="0.7"/> you need to have had diarrhoea for more than a month <pause dur="3.2"/> untreated <pause dur="0.5"/> now you should appreciate and i mean i'll come on to say something about this later on there are now of course <pause dur="0.4"/> quite a lot of antiviral agents that are being used <pause dur="0.6"/> at least in some parts of the world to treat <pause dur="0.2"/> AIDS infection <pause dur="1.0"/> but untreated <pause dur="0.2"/> the median time from entering stage four to death <pause dur="0.6"/> is about ten months <pause dur="3.5"/> it doesn't differ <pause dur="0.2"/> very much from one part of the world to the other it tends to be <pause dur="0.3"/> slightly shorter <pause dur="0.4"/> in the developing world and that's probably got simply to do with the <pause dur="0.2"/> fact that people are generally more 
malnourished <pause dur="0.9"/> in the developing world so <pause dur="0.3"/> in other words you know their general state of health <pause dur="0.4"/> is poorer to start with <pause dur="0.8"/> so once they go into AIDS they die quicker basically <pause dur="0.6"/> than do people <pause dur="0.2"/> in the developed world but we're only talking about a matter of <pause dur="0.4"/> two or three months either way <pause dur="0.5"/> it is a very unpleasant death <pause dur="1.5"/> you know <pause dur="0.8"/> i mean it's a lingering death <pause dur="0.6"/> you're ill for several months you have massive weight loss <pause dur="0.4"/> people end up <pause dur="0.4"/> bleeding often from all the orifices of the body <pause dur="0.4"/> they've got all these opportunistic infections it's a very unpleasant way to die there's no doubt about that <pause dur="1.0"/> okay <pause dur="1.5"/> all right let's <pause dur="0.2"/> move on then from a description of the disease <pause dur="0.4"/> to say something about the current situation globally <pause dur="0.8"/> okay <pause dur="0.5"/> now remember <pause dur="0.3"/> i've handed you out all these handouts <pause dur="0.7"/> so the slides i'm about to show you don't need to copy down <pause dur="0.7"/> but you do need to be aware <pause dur="0.8"/> of <pause dur="0.5"/> these figures <pause dur="0.4"/> and how they're derived <pause dur="0.3"/> once H-I-V once AIDS became clearly an important <pause dur="0.3"/> progressive 
<trunc>ecidem</trunc> <trunc>e</trunc> <pause dur="0.3"/> epidemic <pause dur="1.3"/> the World Health Organization set up <pause dur="0.7"/> a task force <pause dur="0.4"/> to <pause dur="0.5"/> measure the impact to measure the epidemic and its impact globally <pause dur="0.5"/> and this task force now produces a <pause dur="0.6"/> a global report <pause dur="0.2"/> annually in December <pause dur="0.9"/> and so what i'm going to show you <pause dur="0.2"/> are the figures from December nineteen-ninety-seven <pause dur="0.5"/> and in a month's or so's time <pause dur="0.3"/> there will be figures coming out for December nineteen-ninety-eight <pause dur="17.1"/> <kinesic desc="turns on projector showing slide" iterated="n"/> right this gives you an indication <pause dur="0.7"/> of the W-H-O's estimate <pause dur="0.5"/> of the number of adults and children <pause dur="0.8"/> estimated to be living with H-I-V infection <pause dur="0.8"/> at the end of nineteen-ninety-seven <pause dur="2.0"/> let me stand here it's easier <pause dur="0.9"/> now the first thing that you can see is the global figure at the bottom <pause dur="0.6"/> thirty-point-six-million the W-H-O estimates thirty-point-six-million people <pause dur="1.1"/> globally living with H-I-V <pause dur="0.9"/> at the end of nineteen-ninety-seven what does that mean in terms of the global population <pause dur="0.5"/> it means about one in 
<trunc>ha</trunc> one in one-hundred <pause dur="0.4"/> adults <pause dur="1.8"/> so one in a hundred adults round the world is H-I-V positive <pause dur="2.1"/> now remember that the median time <pause dur="0.4"/> between infection <pause dur="0.9"/> and full-blown AIDS <pause dur="1.4"/> is now established in developed countries such as North America to be about ten years <pause dur="0.5"/> right around about ten years <pause dur="1.8"/> in the developing countries <pause dur="0.8"/> the median time between infection <pause dur="0.5"/> and full-blown AIDS is about eight years <pause dur="0.3"/> it's not that much <pause dur="0.4"/> less <pause dur="1.6"/> in untreated remember <pause dur="2.2"/> you're going to die in about a year just under a year <pause dur="1.5"/> so what do these figures mean these figures mean that in sub-Saharan Africa <pause dur="0.4"/> we can expect <pause dur="0.5"/> somewhere in the excess of twenty-one-million deaths <pause dur="0.4"/> in the next ten years </u><gap reason="break in recording" extent="uncertain"/> <u who="nm0239" trans="pause"> okay <pause dur="1.1"/> in Latin America <pause dur="0.5"/> one-point-three in the Caribbean three-hundred-thousand in North America approximately a million <pause dur="0.9"/> people <pause dur="1.2"/> northern Africa two-hundred-thousand Europe half-a-million <pause dur="0.7"/> eastern Europe central Asia <pause dur="0.2"/> two-hundred-thousand <pause dur="0.8"/> eastern Pacific four-hundred-and-twenty-thousand <pause dur="1.0"/> south-east Asia six-million <pause dur="0.6"/> Australasia

countries <pause dur="5.0"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> here's a similar thing for <pause dur="0.3"/> South America and the Caribbean area <pause dur="1.0"/> you can see that the values are much lower <pause dur="2.7"/> but they're still in some countries quite <pause dur="0.4"/> profound i mean two to eight per cent of your population in Guyana for example <pause dur="1.2"/> if you lose eight per cent of your adult population in a ten year period that's going to have pretty dramatic social consequences <pause dur="3.9"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> this is <pause dur="1.3"/> # <pause dur="1.0"/> spread of H-I-V <pause dur="0.7"/> throughout <pause dur="0.4"/> south-east Asia <pause dur="1.4"/> and the key thing to pick up here <pause dur="0.5"/> is the very rapid spread <pause dur="0.4"/> in the latter part of the nineties <pause dur="0.8"/> in <kinesic desc="indicates point on slide" iterated="n"/> India <pause dur="0.6"/> and the countries here <pause dur="1.1"/> Thailand <pause dur="1.0"/> <trunc>miran</trunc> Miranmar or what we used to know as Burma <pause dur="1.1"/><kinesic desc="indicates point on slide" iterated="n"/> Bangladesh <pause dur="1.7"/><kinesic desc="indicates point on slide" iterated="n"/> you can see the figures are between half a per cent and eight per cent <pause dur="0.2"/> prevalence <pause dur="2.1"/> i'll throw you out a statistic from <pause dur="0.7"/> from last year's <pause dur="0.6"/> # report and i i will put <pause dur="0.3"/> copies of these reports <pause dur="0.3"/><kinesic desc="holds up report" iterated="n"/> which can actually be downloaded from the W-H-O web site but i'll put copies in the library of the nineteen-ninety-<pause dur="0.6"/>seven <pause dur="1.0"/> end of ninety-seven figures 
so that you can read through it it's about a <pause dur="0.4"/><kinesic desc="holds up report" iterated="n"/> thirty or forty page report and it gives much more detail <pause dur="0.4"/> than i am able to give in this lecture about the numbers in different parts of the world <pause dur="1.1"/> but for example in India <pause dur="2.3"/> the main route of spread <pause dur="0.8"/> of <pause dur="0.4"/> H-I-V in India is by heterosexual contact <pause dur="3.6"/> in the area around Bombay <pause dur="0.7"/> the W-H-O estimates that there are a hundred-thousand prostitutes <pause dur="1.0"/> with an average a five <pause dur="1.1"/> clients a night <pause dur="0.9"/> and greater than twenty per cent of them are <trunc>H</trunc> of the prostitutes that is are H-I-V positive <pause dur="1.2"/> now if you just think about the implications of that in terms of a <pause dur="0.8"/> explosive spread of disease <pause dur="0.9"/> okay and you'll see in a minute something about <pause dur="0.7"/> some some figures about the number of people using condoms in some of these areas that are undergoing explosive spread of the disease <pause dur="3.8"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> this is this is a a table that's important to look at because this gives <pause dur="1.9"/> some idea of <pause dur="0.2"/> of the picture now what this is telling you <pause dur="0.9"/> is the proportional increase <pause dur="0.6"/> in <pause dur="0.2"/> 
prevalence rates <trunc>bet</trunc> in the last three years <pause dur="1.7"/> so this tells you where things are <pause dur="0.6"/> spreading <pause dur="0.5"/> where the disease is spreading most rapidly <pause dur="2.4"/> not surprisingly some of the <trunc>s</trunc> countries of sub-Saharan Africa come into it <pause dur="0.9"/> but look at this <pause dur="0.9"/> i mean this is a very worrying thing <pause dur="0.6"/> in the former Soviet Union <pause dur="0.4"/> they've seen a greater than hundred per cent increase <pause dur="1.1"/> in prevalence rate <pause dur="0.4"/> in the last three years <pause dur="1.7"/> okay <pause dur="5.2"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> so i've already given you this figure <pause dur="0.8"/> more <trunc>tha</trunc> about a hundred-and-sixty-thousand <pause dur="1.5"/> new infections a day <pause dur="1.8"/> more than ninety per cent of the infections are in developing countries <pause dur="1.2"/> the important point about that <pause dur="0.6"/> is that whereas <pause dur="0.2"/> as i'll come on to in later lectures <pause dur="0.7"/> there are now <pause dur="0.8"/> AIDS therapies available <pause dur="0.7"/> A-Z-T various protease inhibitors <pause dur="0.4"/> these are all expensive <pause dur="0.6"/> and there's just no chance whatsoever in the foreseeable future <pause dur="0.5"/> that these therapies are going to be used in these developing countries they simply cannot afford to do it <pause dur="3.5"/> about sixteen-hundred of this 
hundred-and-sixty-thousand are children under the age of fifteen that's per day we're talking about <pause dur="1.7"/> fourteen-thousand <pause dur="0.4"/> about <pause dur="0.3"/> this is the important point that i haven't alluded to before because i've <pause dur="0.6"/> talked when i was talking yesterday <pause dur="0.4"/> about the initial phase of the <pause dur="0.3"/> the epidemic in North America <pause dur="0.5"/> where the high risk group <pause dur="0.4"/> were <pause dur="0.2"/> homosexual males <pause dur="0.5"/> you remember i said to you that there was a profound change in their social behaviour <pause dur="0.6"/> associated with <pause dur="0.5"/> the <trunc>o</trunc> the spread of the <trunc>epi</trunc> epidemic <pause dur="0.4"/> from one of <pause dur="0.5"/> high promiscuity <pause dur="0.2"/> I-E high risk <pause dur="0.5"/> to one of essentially monogamy they became married <pause dur="0.2"/> more or less <pause dur="0.8"/> and as a result <pause dur="0.3"/> the infection rates in homosexual males <pause dur="0.3"/> in North America dropped dramatically <pause dur="1.5"/> but <pause dur="0.5"/> it is a sexually transmitted disease globally <pause dur="0.3"/> forty per cent of the people being infected are women <pause dur="1.2"/> fifty <trunc>f</trunc> per cent are in the fifteen to twenty-four age group <pause dur="0.2"/> they're in your <kinesic desc="indicates audience" iterated="n"/> age category <pause dur="1.7"/> okay globally <pause dur="2.3"/> i should just say in passing in case case i forget to mention it again <pause dur="0.6"/> for women who get infected <pause dur="0.6"/> if 
you're infected with H-I-V <pause dur="0.2"/> about the worst thing that can happen to you is to get pregnant <pause dur="1.6"/> and the reason why that's a problem is because <pause dur="0.3"/> one of the consequences of pregnancy <pause dur="0.4"/> is a natural immunosuppression <pause dur="2.2"/> so <pause dur="0.3"/> as a result of becoming pregnant <pause dur="0.3"/> a woman will naturally immunosuppress <pause dur="0.5"/> that is a question of <pause dur="0.6"/> preventing rejection of the foetus of course <pause dur="0.6"/> now if you're suffering from an immunosuppressive disease <pause dur="0.3"/> if you naturally immunosuppress yourself <pause dur="0.6"/> that's bad news <pause dur="0.6"/> and a very common scenario <pause dur="0.5"/> for <pause dur="0.3"/> H-I-V infected women <pause dur="0.2"/> who become pregnant <pause dur="0.5"/> is the <pause dur="0.4"/> the becoming pregnant <pause dur="0.2"/> tips them over from being asymptomatic <pause dur="0.4"/> into <pause dur="0.2"/> suffering from AIDS <pause dur="2.0"/> they're suffering from AIDS so at the time of delivery <pause dur="0.3"/> there'll be a lot of virus around <pause dur="0.5"/> high chance of infecting the child <pause dur="1.0"/> or a common scenario is <pause dur="1.3"/> the child is born <pause dur="0.2"/> is infected <pause dur="0.2"/> the mother dies within <pause dur="0.3"/> a few months three or four months of birth <pause dur="0.4"/> you're left with an infected baby that's orphaned <pause dur="0.9"/> and is itself going to die <pause dur="0.8"/> before the age of ten 
almost certainly <pause dur="0.3"/> who's going to look after it <pause dur="0.8"/> who's going to want to foster <pause dur="0.5"/> an H-I-V infected child it's not <pause dur="0.3"/> not a thing that's <pause dur="0.4"/> you know these are <pause dur="0.5"/> these are <pause dur="0.3"/> # facts that have profound social consequences like i've <pause dur="0.3"/> tried to emphasize over and over again <pause dur="3.6"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> now this is just a reiteration of the tables i showed you before cumulative numbers <pause dur="2.5"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> and also for children <kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> i'll pass over those relatively quickly <pause dur="2.0"/> here are some figures for <pause dur="0.6"/> southern Africa <pause dur="0.9"/> looking at prevalence rates <pause dur="0.5"/> in different <pause dur="0.3"/> states different provinces of southern Africa <pause dur="1.1"/> and look at the tracking since the early nineteen-nineties since nineteen-ninety <pause dur="0.7"/> through to nineteen-ninety-seven <pause dur="1.7"/> <unclear>just</unclear> look how fast <pause dur="0.7"/> the epidemic is spreading <pause dur="1.1"/> you've gone from <pause dur="0.4"/> you know <pause dur="0.2"/> about one per cent one or two per cent <pause dur="0.3"/> in Kwazulu and Natal <pause dur="0.7"/> in nineteen-ninety one to two per cent of adults being infected which itself is bad enough <pause dur="0.7"/> to now <pause dur="0.5"/> greater than twenty-five per cent <pause dur="0.4"/> adults infected <pause dur="0.4"/>

Russian Federation and Ukraine <pause dur="0.2"/> for syphilis <pause dur="0.8"/> from nineteen-seventy-six to nineteen-ninety-seven <pause dur="0.9"/> what you can see is nothing much is happening pretty low levels <pause dur="0.7"/> to nineteen-ninety-one <pause dur="0.8"/> and then up it starts to come <pause dur="6.4"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> this is an interesting figure <pause dur="2.0"/> for a number of countries of southern Africa <pause dur="0.9"/> this is a life expectancy <pause dur="1.9"/> calculated life expectancy value <pause dur="0.6"/> now what you can see is that <pause dur="0.5"/> from the nineteen-fifties <pause dur="1.2"/> through to the middle eighteen middle nineteen-eighties <pause dur="0.6"/> the life expectancy <pause dur="0.7"/> in <pause dur="0.6"/> Africa <pause dur="0.2"/> was increasing <pause dur="0.8"/> this is a mark of <pause dur="0.6"/> man being able to combat infectious diseases <pause dur="0.5"/> improvements in combating infectious diseases <pause dur="0.4"/> and general malnourishment is resulting for example in Botswana <pause dur="0.6"/> in an increase of in the average life expectancy from about forty-three <pause dur="0.8"/> up to <pause dur="0.4"/> over sixty <pause dur="0.5"/> not too different from what the life expectancy was in <trunc>dev</trunc> is in developed countries <pause dur="0.8"/> in the upper sixties i think it's sixty <pause dur="0.6"/> sixty-seven for man and seventy-three for woman if i remember rightly <pause dur="1.3"/> but you can see in the last <pause dur="1.4"/> 
ten years <pause dur="0.7"/> it's dropping back again <pause dur="0.7"/> in all of these countries some more quickly than others <pause dur="0.5"/> the ones it's dropping back in most quickly are the ones with the highest prevalence rate <pause dur="0.7"/> for H-I-V infection <pause dur="1.6"/> so <pause dur="0.6"/> you know not to put too fine a point on it this is almost like a biblical plague here in these countries i mean this isn't just <pause dur="0.4"/> capping off <pause dur="0.9"/> your life expectancy it's actually reducing life expectancy in the population as a whole <pause dur="3.5"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> by contrast <pause dur="1.2"/> in western Europe <pause dur="1.0"/> what you can see is that <pause dur="0.3"/> it looks like in western Europe <pause dur="0.8"/> the <pause dur="2.2"/> infection is <pause dur="0.6"/> being got under control in the sense that the number of new AIDS cases <pause dur="0.3"/> is now actually dropping <pause dur="2.8"/> now that's a combination of <pause dur="0.8"/> a reduction in infection rates <pause dur="0.8"/> and also <pause dur="0.4"/> the <pause dur="0.2"/> increasingly widespread use <pause dur="0.3"/> of antiviral chemotherapy <pause dur="0.4"/> holding people <pause dur="0.6"/> in the asymptomatic phase <pause dur="1.4"/> so it's not solely due to changes in the infection rate <pause dur="5.4"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> well this is just another i mean you can i mean i won't go through this this is 
just impact of AIDS on under child <trunc>fi</trunc> under <pause dur="0.2"/> under five child mortality rates in a number of African countries <pause dur="0.7"/> that <trunc>d</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> with and without AIDS you can see that of course <pause dur="0.4"/> AIDS have a <pause dur="0.3"/> AIDS has a dramatic effect <pause dur="1.9"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> mother to child transmission <pause dur="1.3"/> you can see <pause dur="1.0"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> how it's rapidly gone up transmission <pause dur="0.9"/> by <pause dur="1.9"/> # mother to child transmission direct transmission of H-I-V or transmission through <pause dur="0.3"/> breastfeeding they both go up you can <trunc>trans</trunc> <pause dur="0.4"/> transmit H-I-V by breastfeeding <pause dur="6.0"/> well this is just another way of depicting the graph i showed you earlier this is <pause dur="0.3"/> increased mortality rates <pause dur="0.2"/> among men in the fifteen to sixty age group <pause dur="1.0"/> based on whether or not whether or not <pause dur="0.8"/> there is <pause dur="1.0"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> high levels of H-I-V <pause dur="4.0"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> proportion of <pause dur="1.2"/> adult mortality <pause dur="0.5"/> attributable to H-I-V <pause dur="0.8"/> well you can see that in a small Ugandan town <pause dur="1.2"/> it's about <pause dur="1.1"/> two-thirds to three-quarters of it <pause dur="1.4"/> so this has become a really major killer <pause dur="7.2"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> well <pause dur="0.7"/> you can take from this what you will i'm not 
going to go through all of these in great detail <pause dur="1.2"/> this is an interesting one that i alluded to earlier <pause dur="2.2"/> the percentage of sexually active men using condoms <pause dur="0.7"/> by age and group and type of partner <pause dur="0.8"/> in nineteen-ninety-six for <pause dur="1.1"/> couple of countries where there is a big H-I-V problem despite the fact <pause dur="0.9"/> that they've got a big H-I-V problem and it's due to heterosexual spread <pause dur="0.4"/> look how <pause dur="0.4"/> you know in Malawi <pause dur="2.1"/> where there'll be fifteen to twenty per cent of the adult population is infected so your chance <pause dur="0.5"/> with unprotected sex of being infected is very high <pause dur="0.4"/> nevertheless still only <pause dur="0.4"/> twenty-odd per cent of males <pause dur="0.5"/> are using condoms <pause dur="1.8"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> and just to show you that i'm not sexist <pause dur="1.1"/> okay <pause dur="0.3"/> this shows you the figures for women <pause dur="1.7"/> okay <pause dur="0.8"/> same thing i mean very low levels of women <pause dur="0.2"/> using condoms <pause dur="2.3"/> and what's the <pause dur="3.2"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> # <pause dur="2.8"/> i alluded earlier to the fact that if you're H-I-V positive as a woman <pause dur="0.7"/> about the worst thing that can happen to you <pause dur="0.5"/> is that you get pregnant <pause dur="1.5"/> look at the pregnancy rates <pause dur="0.8"/> for by 
the age of nineteen in a selection of these countries that are most highly affected <pause dur="1.5"/> okay <pause dur="0.6"/> i mean <pause dur="1.4"/> in virtually all case well in all cases including Senegal it's greater than forty per cent <pause dur="2.6"/> so that would mean <pause dur="0.5"/> that you know forty per cent of you in this room if you were in these countries forty per cent of the women that is would have already had a child by now <pause dur="1.0"/> okay <pause dur="1.1"/> and of course with high prevalence rates of H-I-V infection <pause dur="0.8"/> this is a real problem <pause dur="2.4"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> okay we'll we'll pass over that <pause dur="0.2"/> and come back to that later <pause dur="4.9"/><event desc="turns off projector" iterated="n"/> what i've tried to give you then in those handouts and in the slides i've gone through <pause dur="0.6"/> is a picture <event desc="turns on lights" iterated="n"/><pause dur="1.0"/> globally of the disease as at the end of nineteen-ninety-seven <pause dur="1.4"/> the numbers are very large of course <pause dur="0.7"/> yeah <pause dur="1.1"/> and <pause dur="0.3"/> the disease is having profound social consequences around the world <pause dur="1.3"/> the reason i've laboured in going through this is because as i said to you <pause dur="0.3"/> when you go out of here with a degree in microbiology and virology <pause dur="0.3"/> and you 
tell somebody you know something about viruses <pause dur="0.6"/> almost certainly the virus that they will ask you about is H-I-V <pause dur="0.7"/> and they will expect you to be reasonably informed and what they won't want to know from you <pause dur="0.3"/> is how tat and rev works <pause dur="0.6"/> okay what they'll want to know from you is <pause dur="0.7"/> what's the sort of number of people who are suffering from this <pause dur="0.7"/> where is it the biggest problem <pause dur="1.4"/> what are your chances of being infected <pause dur="0.5"/> okay <pause dur="0.6"/> now on the end of the handout i've <pause dur="0.3"/> tacked out given out to you <pause dur="0.4"/> i've tacked on <pause dur="0.4"/> the last two monthly reports <pause dur="0.4"/> from the Public Health Laboratory Service <pause dur="0.4"/> of the situation in the United Kingdom <pause dur="1.6"/> and <pause dur="0.4"/> the best one <pause dur="1.2"/> to look at <pause dur="1.7"/> is actually the one from the end of August because that gives you some breakdown <pause dur="0.9"/> by region <pause dur="1.2"/> as to <pause dur="0.2"/> the numbers involved <pause dur="4.1"/> and the important point <pause dur="0.9"/><event desc="looks through notes" iterated="y" dur="5"/> i can't i can't find the table i'm looking for in the <pause dur="0.2"/> sheets i brought with me <pause dur="0.5"/> yeah oh yeah it's it's <kinesic desc="holds up sheet" iterated="n"/> this table here it's actually in the September one 
not i think it's the very last page <pause dur="1.4"/> of the handout i gave you <pause dur="3.1"/> what you can see <pause dur="0.3"/> is that <pause dur="0.8"/> there's something like thirty-thousand <pause dur="0.3"/> <unclear>well</unclear> just over thirty-thousand <pause dur="0.5"/> H-I-V positive people <pause dur="1.5"/> in Britain <pause dur="0.7"/> somewhere over three-and-a-half-thousand of them have died of AIDS so far <pause dur="0.7"/> it's not a uniform distribution <pause dur="0.6"/> across the country <pause dur="1.4"/> # <pause dur="1.1"/> the West Midlands there are about a thousand people thousand H-I-V positive people in the West Midlands which compares to something like fifteen-thousand as you can see <pause dur="0.3"/> nearly sixteen-thousand <pause dur="0.5"/> in North Thames which is north London <pause dur="1.4"/> so the infection in the United Kingdom <pause dur="0.2"/> is <pause dur="0.5"/> pretty localized <pause dur="2.7"/> there is <pause dur="0.3"/> it's still the case <pause dur="0.5"/> that <pause dur="0.2"/> the epidemic in the United Kingdom <pause dur="0.6"/> the highest risk <trunc>f</trunc> risk factor is still <pause dur="0.3"/> homosexuality <pause dur="1.3"/> it's still true that more homosexuals many more homosexuals than heterosexual <pause dur="0.4"/> spread <pause dur="1.3"/> but <pause dur="0.2"/> as you can see from one of the tables <pause dur="0.4"/> heterosexual spread is starting 
to <sic corr="occur">incur</sic> <pause dur="0.9"/> so there is depending again on the area in the country where you are there is a finite risk of heterosexual spread of this disease <pause dur="1.2"/> if you start having large numbers of sexual partners <pause dur="1.6"/> and just as it was the case in the homosexual spread in North America that i talked about yesterday <pause dur="0.6"/> the same is true in heterosexual spread <pause dur="0.8"/> in unprotected sex <pause dur="0.4"/> the more partners you have <pause dur="0.3"/> the greater is your risk of contracting the disease <pause dur="0.6"/> it's a straightforward <pause dur="0.3"/> linear relationship one against the other <pause dur="1.4"/> okay <pause dur="0.9"/> all right i <pause dur="0.3"/> i'll stop a little bit early because i've reached a natural break point <pause dur="0.5"/> and i'll continue tomorrow <pause dur="1.3"/> when i shall start talking about the virus that causes this disease <pause dur="0.4"/> rather than the disease itself <pause dur="0.9"/> thanks very much indeed
