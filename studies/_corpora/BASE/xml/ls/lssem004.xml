<u who="nm5231">i don't know about you but when i was a student the earlier we started the earlier we were in the pub so # there'll be minimal delay here are we happy everyone's here</u>
<u who="ss">yes</u>
<u who="nm5231">okay well good afternoon my name's Doctor <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> i'm one of the sonsultantanaesthetists over at the University Hospital # i've been asked to come along this afternoon and go over a couple of topics with you just to sort of give you the basics and have a discussion with all of you about the # the framework they're in what i'd like to do there are two groups who are going to present to us i'd like to structure this that we have a presentation from your colleagues first and then a couple of slides from me on the topic and then we throw it open to the floor for a discussion how does that sound yeah i think the legal maxim is qui tacet consentire silence gives consent so in the first instance we are going to look at pre-operative assessment so i'd like to my colleagues <trunc>he</trunc>  colleagues over there to come down and give us a presentation of a patient they saw along these lines</u>
<u who="sf5235">good afternoon # while Doug is setting up # i'm just going to introduce our topic as Doctor Furlong said we're going to talk about pre-operative assessment and the lady we're going to talk to you about today is Mrs P and she's a lady that we saw # who was referred to the breast surgical team at Walsgrave Hospital where Doug and I are currently attached # she's eighty-two years old well i'm just going to run through the history and then Doug is going to talk briefly about what her pre-operative assessment involved # she's a retired desk clerk and she presented to what okay sorry she presented to the breast clinic with a six week history of a bloody discharge from her right nipple # she had no tenderness and she found no lumps on self-examination at the clinic # following examination of her breast a # firm well-defined mass was identified about one centimetre from her right nipple at about three o'clock if you can picture it # a biopsy was carried out which was inconclusive and a mammogram and an ultrasound were carried out as well which later confirmed an elongated lobulated mass about ten millimetres in diameter # there are no changes # since the breast clinic and there are no new developments in her left breast either now in terms of questions directly related to breast disease # she is currently in the menopause and has been since she was fifty-tw-, fifty-four she has two children who # she did not breast feed and she has not been on H-R-T now before i go into the past medical history # diagnosis of breast cancer like other cancers involves # what's called a triple diagnosis and that's based on the clinical impression which is # designated P and radiological appearance of the lump which is R and tissue biopsy which is B now this lady based on the clinical impression # it was designated P-three from a scale from one to five where one is a benign lesion and five is cancerous three would be sort of like suspicious but not probably not cancer # and she was designated R-three as well and based on the fact that the biopsy was inconclusive it was designated B-one so the most probable diagnosis in her case is a ductal carcinoma in situ # in terms of her past medical history she suffers from osteoarthritis and osteoporosis she has had four hip <trunc>op</trunc>  hip operations in the past three on her right side and one on her left # she has hypertension which is currently controlled by medications and she had a hernia operation six years ago she is currently taking medication for her hypertension as i mentioned and those are atenolol lisinopril and bendrofluazide and she's allergic to penicillin she has no family history of breast or ovarian cancer so there's no genetic pre-disposition there in terms of her social history she lives alone in a bungalow and her son lives across the street so he comes over and visits quite frequently # she doesn't drink or smoke and she's a fairly independent lady # but she has limited mobility due to the fact that she's had her four hip operations and she requires a stick to walk so basically due to the fact that she has this ductal carcinoma in situ she # was going to have a wide local excision with auxiliary sampling so Doug is just going to briefly highlight what pre-operative assessment involved in this particular case</u>
<u who="sm5232">pre-operative <trunc>assess</trunc>  assessment is done for anybody undergoing surgery basically # but the clinic that we went to was specific for breast care and patients undergoing breast surgery # i think it's okay that we say now that her breast surgery that was going to be done or is done already is a wide local excision which is basically taking out a lump out of the breast with a two centimetre peripheral breast tissue excision as well so in the past it would just be <trunc>cal</trunc>  it would just it would be just called a lumpectomy whereby you just take the lump out and no surrounding breast tissue round the lump but because of a high level of remittance and just a therapeutic strategy they just take about two centimetres two to three centimetres of the normal breast tissue surrounding the lump to prevent recurrence anyways # the pre-op assessment is quite similar regardless of what surgery you do # the heart rate is taken your blood pressure is taken and for Mrs P was forty-eight beats per minute and a hundred and sixty-three over eighty-one and a whole list of different types of physical assessments were done which is standard throughout all pre-o-, pre-operative assessments for example safety issues such as if the patient is fit for doing surgery # that has implications for putting her under whether it's general anaesthetics or local anaesthetics pain is assessed in her case she has osteoarthritis and nutritional status is also taken her weight her height and as well her mobility and her appetite is taken as well as we discussed before her mobility is also assessed for obvious reasons because you know once you do surgery you're not able to move round as much and that has implications for discharge her breathing is also assessed in terms of how far she can go before she undergoes shortness of breath so in this case it was three flights of stairs before she has the minimal shortness of breath her sleep is okay and she's also independent in terms of her hygiene as we discussed before she'd also assessed orally meaning they want to check if her teeth are okay if she has false teeth because as you know a lot of times when they go into surgery they take the false teeth out in order to put the <trunc>t</trunc>  put the tube in and her elimination is also assessed just as just for # to make sure everything is covered i guess i don't really know why her vision and hearing and language is also assessed # language is important because when you explain to the patient what her situation is the diagnosis and also the different type of treatments that she can undergo you might need an interpreter if she doesn't speak the language very well or you might need to call a family member in to help her understand so she can make a good decision on what type of treatment she wants and as well of course the psychological assessment # it's <trunc>esp</trunc>  it's especially important in this case because things such as body image is very pertinent factor in in this type of surgery whether or not the person wants to just take the lump out or take the entire breast out there's obvious body image issues here and there are specialised nurses breast care nurses that take care of this and help the person go through the process of grief and loss and and what not # as well the emotional state of the patient is is noted and is in this case Mrs P was slightly anxious but she has quite an understanding of what was involved a general physical examination is done as would be with any patient and there are really no signs that were that were worth noting other than the fact that she had Heberden nodes because of her osteoarthritis i mean her chest was fine her heart was fine an investigation's also done # based on each patient for example # an E-C-G is done for her because she's on betablockers and they found out she has sinus bradycardia # blood tests are done basically your normal F-B-C's L-F-T's and depending on the patient if she has lung problems if she has C-O-P-D they might do a lung function test and things of that sort but that's basically it for the pre-op assessment</u>

<u who="nm5231">yeah go on give them a clap</u>
<event desc="applause" iterated="y" dur="2"/>

<u who="nm5231">okay well done thank you the pre-operative assessment that was excellent of a patient is multi-factorial you'll have heard a lot of stuff there that if you imagine how long it took these two people to go through one patient you could never get everything done for a whole operating list the nursing team themselves go through half of it so they tend to do # social support at home expressing your sexuality things like this and the surgical team will go through the scar they're going to produce and should activate prosthesis support and things like then the anaesthetist will come along and look after the rest of it now i put that up just out of interest # anaesthesia's bizarre it's all postgraduate you don't get to do much as an undergraduate i think i did two weeks and that was it most of that was spent in the pub when # you talk to the public they don't really know who the anaesthetist is and a friend of mine told me that # she'd been to patient pre-operatively and she said can i just ask my son tried to get into dentistry and didn't so he thought he'd be an anaesthetist now i can't tell you the rude words that produced from my colleague but what exactly is an anaesthetist any offers silence we all watch Holby City no sign of an anaesthetist we all watch Casualty no sign of an anaesthetist but in the real hospital we're everywhere what is an anaesthetist is it the surgeon's assistant or some bloke reading the paper at the top of the table now again if you watch some of the # current dramas # the surgeons start shouting numbers and fluids and things and this little mouse of a person at the top goes okay squeezes it in that's not quite how it happens seriously though the role of the anaesthetist # is actually the perioperative physician okay there is a pre-op a per-op and a post-op element to this at the end of the day i never thought i'd end up being a physician but you end up looking after the medical conditions of these patients for the duration of the operative period and you'd be surprised how involved you have to get sixty per cent of hospital activity is the responsibility of the anaesthetist so beware be very aware of what you're going to be in for in the future let's have a quick look at # the pre-operative assessment then that we would use oops whatever you're asked in an exam situation the answer is always history examination and special investigations and let's have a look at the history some people do actually display a history of severe post-operative nausea and vomiting there is a significant proportion of the population who have an enzyme deficiency and something called <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> and there are other problems they've been failed intubations difficult airways and this is the chance for the patient to say ooh last time # i had an operation the doctor said afterwards i nearly died # and they go into a great gory description of whatever they're proud of and you can have # a long chat to them get to the bottom get the facts and then hopefully be safe during your anaesthetic my colleagues have already drawn from the patient the # relevant past medical history this is important the population is increasingly old six per cent of forty year olds and a hundred per cent of sixty year olds have aschemic heart disease that is at post-mortem even if they deny symptoms when you are asking them about chest pain exercise tolerance you may not get an overt history or something that's been picked up by a GP this is either due to i'm sorry to say poor attendance at the General Practice or lack of exercise there are a lot couch potatoes who don't do enough exercise to expose the symptoms we're also interested in the respiratory side of things because that's going to be the main vector through which we keep the patient asleep in most cases we look at the drug history and the allergies because we're interested in interactions between what we're going to give as the anaesthetist to keep them asleep and also keep them comfortable afterwards when looking at the patient's total body we ask about # whether they have caps crowns dentures classically in the text books it says you ask because the nurse will take them out when you go down to the theatre # i assume you're all reasonable young and none of you actually have a full set of dentures but when you talk to the patients most of the old women # with dentures are mortified at the thought of taking their dentures out my colleague actually mentioned expressing sexuality and all the rest of it these ladies are terrified they won't open their mouth they won't speak because they don't want anybody to see them without their teeth in it's only a small point but it's worth paying attention to so what i've gone full circle now and i say to them leave them in come down that way you will answer the questions give appropriate answers and tell us if you're worried if they need to come out i will take them out while you're asleep and put them back in when you wake up or just before you wake up and the issue of the dominant hand we're going to need intravenous access in these guys that is for the anaesthetic episode but the drip will probably stay in post-operatively for fluids and it's all about the thought that goes into it if you're right-handed and they put a drip in your right hand when you go to sleep when you've woken up and you're feeling a bit better you're going to want a drink you've got a a big drip hanging off the arm so you'll end up using the wrong hand attention to detail # we are interested in regurgitation dyspepsia because there is a phenomena of aspiration of acidic gastric contents into the pulmonary tract when the gag reflex is suppressed by anaesthesia that can cause a terrible chemical <trunc>bronchi</trunc>  bronchiolitis basically and we can be in a an extreme arrest situation if we're not careful right the examination day surgery is a very new and evolving sub-speciality # to decide whether somebody is fit in inverted commas it's looking at it statistically so the statistics game aims towards the the # body mass index if you put the weight over the height squared # you will come up with a figure now # we can say it because we're Coventry now Birmingham where i did a lot of work # you'd have to move things down a little bit normal for Birmingham is probably about thirty-five and further over it it's actually clinically important because the higher your fat content peripherally the more you will <trunc>s</trunc>  # store and slowly re-anaesthetize yourself with there are factors in vessels there are factors in metabolic rate there are factors in regurgitation so the weight is incredibly important at the end of it some patients we've dealt with have been too heavy for the standard surgical table it's to be thought about so take a good measurement of the <trunc>wei</trunc>  weight and the height the nursing staff should do that for you now when assessing the cardio-vascular system # we've already alluded to the blood pressure and the pulse the nurse is going to take it and say to you is this normal so # the nurse took my blood pressure and it's one sixty-five over ninety is that normal one sixty-five over ninety would you tell the nurse that was normal </u>

<u who="sm5236">a bit high</u>

<u who="nm5231">a bit high which bit and why</u>

<u who="sm5236">#</u>

<u who="nm5231">there's lots of whispering go on who's whispering someone want to stick a hand up anyone brave it's usually a girl go on let's have a girl put their hand up no any offers sorry sorry</u>

<u who="su"><gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/></u>

<u who="nm5231">it is # the systolic element is they're both actually up okay ball park when you read the text books blood pressure should be a hundred and twenty over eighty when you join the real world the systolic is usually age plus a hundred okay now there are trends in everything in medicine # the German's have actually started to treat blood pressure if you're too low as far as they're concerned so if your systolic is too low they will give you an agonist to increase it we are aware classically hypertension is the diastolic up and we've got American # cardiac guidelines on that which we all follow does anybody understand why that's dangerous no i can hear lots of whispering come on it's only me sorry</u>
<gap reason="inaudible" extent="uncertain"/>

<u who="nm5231">it's to do with the mean pressure or the flow pressure and the tissues it's going through okay it can be damaging you're also looking at perfusion pressure for the rest of the tissues around the blood supply okay and also the work that the ventricle's having to do to provide the pressure you're seeing so there are three aspects to it and at the end of the day it's a balancing trick so the pressure of one sixty-five over ninety i am not sixty-five even though i feel it sometimes and ninety is a little high so we pay attention to that the heart rate does everybody have the same influence of their physiology on their heart rate that's a terrible question it's obviously loaded no they don't both extremes of age you are very rate dependent because you can't produce a difference in your ventricular outflow okay in the middle which hopefully i am you should be able to respond with a ventricular response so taking a heart rate if i've got a seventy-five year old lady whose heart rate is fifty because of betablockers i'm actually quite worried about her i don't think she will mount a tachycardic response if she has a problem so i may look at the degree of blockades she's got okay let's move on a bit because you want to get out of here hydration we need background fluids if they haven't had any because they've been fasting they're going to be intravascularly empty and they may have more hypotension way to assess it skin turgor urine and pulse and respiration some of the most fun i ever had was giving a lecture to surgeons on respiratory rate and i asked a surgeon who was outrageously arrogant what the normal rate was and he said the normal rate's twenty-eight and i said are you sure and he said course i'm sure i'm a surgeon and i thought right okay and i got the person next to him to get their watch out and i said you time him you breathe at a rate of twenty-eight and see how you do within about three minutes he was knackered there was just no way he was going to continue and this is important if there are the patient's respiratory rate is high it's for a reason and it's a massive clinical indicator and it's one of the few things that's often missed at examination so be very aware of that you can look at rest of the tree air entry and wheeze i'm trying to speed up a bit now access yes where are the veins the investigations bloods at the end of the day there will be a sheet of just about everything the houseman's done when most senior medics come to assess the patient there will be a small number they're really interested in # i personally am looking for the haemoglobin to make sure they've got optimum oxygen carriage and next to that i'm looking for the haematocrit to see how accurate that haemoglobin is we've all watched # the American medical # films and they're always asking for the 'crit doctor aren't they the 'crit what's the 'crit if you ask most English medics for the 'crit they'll look at you blankly this is an idea of the dilution if you've got the haemoglobin and the dilution together you've got a better idea of what exactly the oxygen carrying capacity of this patient is all the membranes are excitable potassium is part of that and so i want to know the potassium in the sick patient i might want urea and creatinine to look at renal function and there are other specific entities right on the E-C-G again it's going to be age # dependent i'll be looking for signs of aschemic heart disease or abnormal rhythms but again you don't need me to tell you about those if the basics are abnormal or i'm concerned on the basis of history then yes we move on to more <trunc>a</trunc>  advanced investigations such as an echo or a vitalograph and to be honest they should have been picked up by a a chat by the nurse pre-operatively the difficult ones should be flagged up to a consultant and you should be able to have a meeting about them with the staff and tell them what you need to be done so you can assess them properly that's a very quick whiz through or there any questions is everybody happy just ball park roughly going over the patient any questions no okay let's have a look so i would ask my other colleagues to come and give us a short presentation on shock </u>

<u who="sm5233">hiya # Fiona and myself are going to talk for a few minutes about shock the patient that we're going to present is a gentleman who came into hospital for an entirely different reason but later on became a really good example of of hypovolaemic shock this is mister S he's a fifty-nine year old man a retired industrial cleaner and was admitted to Walsgrave on the twelfth of March this year his presenting complaint on admission was parasthesia pins and needles in his arms and legs this began suddenly three weeks prior to his admission and progressed and gradually became so bad that his neurological deficit which was both sensory and motor meant that he couldn't even walk he'd had a couple of consultations with his G-P and then eventually he was <trunc>admit</trunc>  admitted to hospital presently he's still a patient at Walsgrave and his neurological symptoms haven't changed and he's bedridden because of it # on the twenty-fourth of April this year he was started on warfarin for a possible D-V-T in his past medical history there's not really anything of note except for a left inguinal hernia repair in ninety-five his drug history he's not normally taking any drugs or any prescription medication and he's got no known drug allergies he's got no relevant family history and normally he lives with his wife and six children from whom he has great social support # he's got a a strong history of smoking he has a forty pack year history and he's a non-drinker Fiona's now going to talk a little bit about what happened to Mr S while he was in hospital</u>

<u who="sf5234">okay Mr S had been in hospital for about six weeks # until the twenty-sixth of April which was a very big day for him # very early in the morning he started # passing lots of blood P-R # it was a painless P-R bleed # lots of fresh blood # lots of clots and he had no history of melaena any passing mucus and he'd had no previous change in his bowel habits # at that time his blood pressure dropped about ninety over sixty and his pulse went up to a hundred and ten his I-N-R was seven # related to the fact that he'd had # he'd been on Warfarin treatment # for a possible D-V-T it since turned out that he didn't have a D-V-T # so obviously there was too much Warfarin kicking about which is bad # and his C-V-P went down to minus two centimetres of water # to correct that he was given vitamin K and fresh frozen plasma which # consequently brought the I-N-R to # two # later on in the day his haemoglobin dropped to three point six # and he had to be given twelve units of blood and four units of fresh frozen plasma just to try and # keep his blood pressure up basically # because of the urgency of the situation that he was continuing to pass a lot of blood P-R there wasn't # time to do all the normal investigations that you'd want to do for somebody with a P-R bleed so he didn't have the urgent O-G-T as you'd expect # as we all learnt last week # and he went straight to theatre to do an exploratory surgery it was found during the surgery that he had masses of blood fresh blood in the colon but nowhere else # and it was decided to perform a sub-total colectomy # at that time # just for your information # he had to have a further six units of blood four units of F-F-P and six units of crystalloid during the operation so he was pretty sick really # the next day things stabilised quite a lot # after his colon was been taken out and his blood pressure was one-hundred-eight over fifty-three his pulse had gone back down to ninety and his C-V-P had # gone up to a sort of more respectable three centimetres of water # and he remained stable and quite well with an I-N-R for quite some time after that # the pathology on his colon actually revealed # a vasculitis which is # thought to be # polyarteritis nodosa # where basically lots of # micro-aneurysms have ruptured causing the bleed and that may actually be related to his neurological problems although that's not been # diagnosed yet he actually had # a bit of a blip in his recovery process he had a repeat bleed on the nineteenth of May # and his haemoglobin dropped at that time # and he also started passing faecal fluid P-R which you might think is a bit odd seeing as he doesn't have a colon and it's thought that he might have formed a fissula with the small bowel but that's not known yet # our examination of Mr S is really not an awful lot of value because we saw him quite a lot of time after time after he was in shock so i'm just going to briefly run through what we saw # in him when we when we spoke to him and when we examined him and then Gerry's going to talk a little bit more about # what signs you would expect in somebody that's in hypovolaemic shock # so he was a pale man # he was very cachexic although he's comfortable at rest # no jaundice and # clubbing cyanosis oedema or lymphadenopathy his chest was clear his heart sounds were normal and his pulse's were all # regular at about ninety # just generally on his on his abdominal exam there was an obvious scar where he had his # sub-total colectomy and a stoma present also # he wasn't tender and palpation there were no masses to be found he was a bit tender and percussion but with resonance throughout # and it was really located to where his scar was and he had # some abnormal bowel sounds but that's really not that abnormal when you consider he doesn't have a colon so # Gerry's just going to talk a bit more about signs you would expect to see in somebody in hypovolaemic shock</u>

<u who="sm5233">this is just very quickly # in a patient with hypovolaemic shock the things you'd normally expect to see because of hypovolaemia you've lost volume and as a consequence you lose blood pressure and you get inadequate tissue perfusion so in the skin you'd expect the patient to be cold and pale to be cyanosed and to have an increased capillary refill time that's greater then two seconds which is generally taken to be the normal time to be less than two seconds because of poor kidney perfusion you'd have a lower urine output and also because of cerebral ischmeia you'd have confusion and restlessness in the patient as well # the drop in blood pressure and blood volume leads to a reflex increase in sympathetic tone and as a consequence you get a tachycardia which is # one the important things to note in hypovolaemia and also as was mentioned earlier you get because of the ischemia metabolic acidosis which are a consequence as a consequence you get a compensatory increase in respiratory rate and i'll hand over to Doctor Furlong</u>

<u who="nm5231">well thanks very much guys that was an excellent presentation well done </u>
<event desc="applause" iterated="y" dur="2"/>

<u who="nm5231">i think shock is one of the most important clinical situations that you will come across there are very few times where you are called upon to use what little physiology you remember from medical school to actually save somebody's life this is one of them so it's worth remembering what is shock any offers</u>

<u who="sm5237">it's me it's inadequate # circulation <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> the # tissues such as vital organs</u>

<u who="nm5231">yeah there are lots of actual definitions thank you that was well done at the end of the day the final one you you appertain to failure of oxygen delivery to the tissues okay you get all sorts of weird # statements like # shock is what happens when i walk on the ward wearing a pink shirt shock is what happens when you say how big your overdraft is those of things and there are physiological similarities what is oxygen delivery to the tissues now this is where it starts to get grown up what factors do you think actually influence he says with the formula behind him on the wall anybody think about what things are measured in cardiac output's in litres isn't it haemoglobin is in grams per decilitre hence the ten is just to normalise things the one point three four is called the Hufner Constant and it's the amount of oxygen that one gram of haemoglobin can carry in normal atmospheric pressure so that particular formula i won't bore you with the rest of it but if you ever come and play in anaesthesia this will be your bread and butter basically and it gives you an idea of the factors that may be able to influence the actual oxygen delivery if you have the drop in heart rate what's cardiac output heart rate by</u>

<u who="nm5231">thank you so if either of those fall cardiac goes down so does oxygen delivery if the haemoglobin falls so therefore does the ability to carry oxygen and the saturations so they're the factors that's why i it's worth putting it up what sort of classification of shock are you aware of # let's start on the left sorry i don't know your name Tim what sorry</u>

<u who="sf5239">anaphylactic</u>

<u who="nm5231">anaphylactic yeah sorry</u>

<u who="su">neurogenic</u>

<u who="nm5231">neurogenic fantastic hypovolaemic so we've basically got a situation where you've lost volume don't forgot it's not always blood in a patient with profound burns your skin is a water-proof bag you are sixty to seventy per cent water if that bag's not working you can lose the water and become just as hypovolaemic i spent the morning trying to educate people about various fluids and we were discussing the fact that are three litres of water in your five litres blood volume you could lose that very quickly if you are not exactly water-tight right septic we touched on cardiogenic the pump just won't work very common post-infarcted and then the rest of them are bagged together really # anaphylactic things like adrenacortical insufficiency # until you see it you'll never believe it but there are mechanisms that mimic shock for endocrine and pharmacological reasons nice little table here to try and can everybody see that is it clear just to try and describe how it actually looks and the different types of shock differ in their clinical presentation right so the most common is which one do you think </u>

<u who="su"><gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/></u>

<u who="nm5231">excellent what happens to the heart rate increased # stroke volume no change or decrease cardiac output no change or decreased and then the S-V-R that is the systemic vascular resistance that's how tight you are peripherally now if i was sitting where you were i'd have twigged this is probably the only important bit of the lecture if you make a note of this you can probably fall asleep what i'm going to do i'm going to copy this and give it to your lecturer and i'll make available some handouts in the next day or two so don't worry too much # what i'd like to do is show you the difference between that and the one underneath septic which is perhaps the most common second most common if you think about # the clinical situation where a microbiological episode has got out of control and you have septicemia in inverted commas your normal mechanisms have been turned round and you can see the big difference is at the end here the S-V-R rather than being increased in a compensatory attempt it's actually decreased this has massive consequences if you look at the top you can see that your haemorrhage the others are fairly similar and that one is up absolutely totally the opposite septic shock can be catastrophic absolutely catastrophic so if you think about it this is a good model to remember and work round you can understand the mechanism of cardiogenic # if heart's not working well of course the stroke volume's going to be down and in compensation the S-V-R will go up in an effort to try and maintain the cardiac output but it doesn't always do it so it's down a little bit and this final type of thing you've essentially taken off all the neurological efference afference i should say and so you've stripped it of all the drives and you get a picture as you see are there any questions about this one thing i would say i don't know how you all learn but i find learning a table rote learning a table pointless the way to do this is to understand the pathology and then be able to describe the table yourself so rather than sort of regurgitate that if you take a step back and work out why from understanding the pathology you stand a better chance of being able to get it right and do something about it right the clinical side of things let's have a bit of background history we've got a seventy kilo male roughly seventy mils per kilo of total body blood we're looking at five litres and let's look at these i've put these up deliberately we're a small country and America's much bigger # if you meet people abroad the English are # reasonably loud but the Americans and i i know there's probably some Americans here they do tend to talk a lot louder so we tend to listen to them now in medicine # the Americans like protocols they like books they like something to point at for medical legal reasons to say i'm covered i did what it says in the book you can't sue me over here we don't get sued quite as much so we're not as focussed on the books which i think at the moment's not a bad thing A-T-L-S the Advanced Trauma Life Support course was brought in # after a pilot had a crash and his family were in the hospital with him he was quite badly injured but he was so appalled at the immediate care the rest of his family got he got off the bed in A and E and went round and started looking after his family after this he he went to work with generating this this idea of having the the A-T-L-S these are the sort of ball park figures that they use and within reason flexibly they're true what i'm trying to get at is the last bit here the systolic if you say to most people what does shock mean they say oh drop in blood pressure look how far down that is with fifteen per cent loss all you might find is a slight tightening of the tree systemic vascular resistance will go up to compensate but at that stage you've lost three-quarters of a litre that's fairly impressive the heart rate will go up by the time you this is from nought to fifteen then from fifteen to thirty so on their way up to thirty per cent the heart rate goes up there's still no drop in blood pressure but just before you get the drop in blood pressure you can see you can still lose one and a half litres considerable loss appears hidden to people who aren't in tune with the symptoms and this i think is one of the important things about shock by the time you do get a drop in the blood pressure you're talking two litres okay and you really are in trouble by then is everybody reasonably happy with that i think that's why the one of the more important clinical aspects to take away what are you going to do about it again let's be # exam orientated about this it doesn't matter what the question is what exactly we're going to treat in all critical situations it could be shock it could be anything else it could in an infarct whatever the answer is always A-B-C because that's the safe way of addressing a critical situation A for airway B for breathing C for circulation this gives you a moment to get your thoughts together while you structure the answer to the best of your abilities so what are you going to do about the airway let's let's have some offers where did we get to we got to you're looking particularly bored young lady with #

<gap reason="inaudible" extent="uncertain"/>

<u who="nm5231">sorry a hundred and forty sometimes depending whether they've had a feed a pee or you've just whalloped them heart rate of an old dear sitting there reading the Daily Telegraph or something sixty seventy what do you think the most important part of the cardiac cycle for these patients is sorry it's diastole let's go back to the physiology i don't know what your course is structured like and i'm not entirely sure where the i'm sure you know all of this but where you've touched base with this coronary artery blood flow only occurs during diastole during systole the pressures are so high in the actual myocardium there is no pressure gradient okay as the heart rate is increased the period that is shortened is diastole so the period available for coronary artery perfusion is also shortened hence there's a maximum above which you are unable to perfuse your myocardium at that age so if you've got a sixty year old you don't really want to put them up over about a hundred and sixty really do you but if you've got a twenty year old i i'm sure some of you have had heart rates in excess of that if you've been whatever so it's worth knowing if you are therefore looking at a patient in recovery and they say the heart rate's a hundred and twenty doctor if you've got two next to each other you've got a twenty year old and an eighty year old totally different ball game you're a bit worried about the eighty year old because you're thinking mm mm mm touching base you are looking at slowing that patient down but you're also aware that at that age they are rate dependent what are you going to do call <trunc>Gho</trunc>  <trunc>Gho</trunc>  Ghostbusters get one of us down and we'll increase the the preload increase the ventricular output # BP when you're assessing the blood pressure i put down the mean arterial pressure why do you think i've made a point of that it's because looking at the physics that is responsible for the majority of the pressure the mean okay two thirds of it when you look at the actual pulse wave the shape of it can be controlled by the pliable nature or not pliable depending on age of the vascular tree if you've got an incredibly <trunc>i</trunc>  uncompliant vascular tree in the old patient due to atherosclerosis it's very hard and that just makes the spikes very high and sometimes the troughs very low but the mean is still the same so that is a true reflection of what the blood pressure is so when somebody says to you oh but the systolic's a hundred and sixty doctor you say well yeah how old's the patient okay be sensible look at the real points we touched upon capillary refill # if you have hypovolaemia your capillary refill times erupt because you're periphery veins are constricted stands to reason really all of these # first three are very quick to assess they're indirect measures of how you are achieving perfusion end organ perfusion is something like urine output are you actually getting enough blood at the right pressure to the <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> to produce urine that is a true end point but there is a lag in seeing that so we rely on the top three in the first instance hoping to god that the end organ backs us up on our management of the top three so what are you going to give they open the cupboard and they go well there you go # what do you want to give you've decided you're hypovolaemic and you've said oh we need to give some fluids any offers </u>

<u who="nm5231">right basically there are several classes there is no right or wrong answer each class you can make an argument for okay some of the arguments are very tenuous to say the best let's just have a look at how most junior doctors make their decision okay when asked how to give # the fluids let's go back one i think this is the end you can split them into crystalloid colloid blood products the crystalloids it's five per cent dextrose normal saline or dextrose saline the colloids you've got starches you've got gelatines you've got albumen and on the blood side you've got blood blood products like F-F-P platelets and those sort of things this is a mine field i spent two hours this morning trying to educate # some anaesthetists to be sensible in their choice i'm not expecting you to be experts at this at all what i'm going to say to you is that # any fluid is better than no fluid i'll put it in context if you're dealing with shock a as a junior you shouldn't be on your own with that patient and B # you're looking for quick volume expansion aren't you if you remember the fact that for every # unit of blood in inverted commas volume of blood you want to replace if you use crystalloids you've got to give three times the volume you will then understand that you are going to cause three times the side effects of crystalloids and take three times as long which is why in hypo # volaemic states most people give a volume expander of the colloid or # blood product variety now we can go in for hours into the colloids and say they're split into the starches and the gelatines most people end up giving # gelafusin have you all heard of gelafusin a standard colloid now i put up # a lecture this morning about the gelatines and basically gelafusin and haemaccel are the two common ones gelafusin is a boiled cow basically that's where they get it from they break down the carcass of of cows and the same for haemaccel now the gelafusin begins with a G and therefore is good and is succinilated it's link with <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> # entity the haemaccel starts with h and is horrible and is therefore urea linked so the haemaccel is a boiled cow that someone has pissed up i don't want that in my veins i don't know about you the other aspect is that it has calcium in it and if you are in the process of replacing blood for these patients the calcium has a nasty habit of clotting everything off because you've got citrate in the blood products to stop them clotting and you can be in real trouble this is a separate lecture the administration of fluids what i'm trying to get across to you are the basics of hypovolaemia and the other types of shock any questions not one so you're all entirely happy with what shock is and how to deal with it </u>
