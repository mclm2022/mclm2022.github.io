<u who="nm5253">right # <trunc>c</trunc> can i welcome you to this # academic # half day we've got some # very good # talks that # some of your colleagues have prepared and basically in # the time of well less than two hours we're meant to cover # most of the haematological malignancies so we're really going to be talking about patients with leukaemias and patients with lymphomas and i think # as part of your biological training to date you should have covered some of the molecular aspects of # malignancy # some of the aspects you'd have covered i believe in some of the basic science courses so today we're really going to concentrate on some of the clinical aspects of patients with leukaemias and lymphomas and see how that ties in and # builds together with what you've learnt from the biological sciences # so really i'm going to start off with # leukaemias and leukaemias are conditions whereby you have an abnormal proliferation of primitive # cells in the bone marrow the bone marrow's the site where different blood cells are made and there are a whole variety of different leukaemias acute and chronic would be the main types of leukaemias that we're going to be looking at and for a start we're going to have a presentation on # a patient who's recently been at Warwick Hospital presenting with # an acute leukaemia and i think we'll just go straight into that and have the presentation for a start and then we'll have a little bit of discussion about that afterwards so shall we have # candidate number one</u>
<u who="sf5254">okay # i'm presenting acute myeloid leukaemia # it's not a classical presentation # but it's quite interesting # a female student from Stratford and she was admitted to Warwick Hospital on the twenty-eighth of May and # she was in for several weeks right up until the first of # July her presenting complaint was # anorexia and weight loss and she went from sixty-five kilograms to forty-eight in two months # she had fatigue and lethargy for five to six weeks and # abnormal blood results her haemoglobin was down white cell count was up and platelets down her history of the presenting complaint was a five week history of fatigue and lethargy # she was unable to socialise with her peers after school # which her mum said was unusual and participate in # sporting activities she'd sleep immediately after getting home from school # and started skipping meals and her appetite was reduced she had weight loss that we previously # discussed her mum booked a holiday to go to # Greece and the day that they the day before they were going her mum was really concerned that she hadn't actually got out of bed for several days and thought that she might have an eating disorder and took her to the # G-P who # did blood tests and they came abnormal and she was # admitted to Warwick Hospital # with suspected # leukaemia since she's been in # Warwick Hospital she had several complications # nausea vomiting and diarrohea predominantly with fever she also had candidiasis in the mouth and vagina and also quite bad mouth ulcers # she'd also had a severe candida-like infection # which was really hard to treat they couldn't get rid of this # and a maculopapular rash over the trunk and limbs and completely covered ninety per cent of her body # but we we'll talk about that a little bit more later and also hair loss # and these are mainly from chemotherapy and also her neutropenic state # she had no past medical history to note and a family history of diabetes and a cousin who died of leukaemia # who had it for fifteen to twenty years social history she was born in California and has lived here for four years attends Stratford High School a non-smoker non-drinker # she lives alone with her mother who's having financial difficulties at the moment # and they have to move out of their house at the end of August and they're in and out of hospital # quite frequently now Social Services have become involved and they're # looking for some sponsorship and # raising money to sort of help them through it # drugs and allergies she's on chemotherapy which is done in several rounds # it's goes on for ten days and then she has three weeks where she's in hospital in a neutropenic state so they give prophylactic # antibiotics <trunc>Metro</trunc> # Ciprofloxacin and also # prophylactic sort of anti-fungals Fluconozle # after the three weeks she's allowed home for <trunc>s</trunc> a couple of days and then back in for the next round # she had no drug allergy on physical examination on admission she was pale there was no jaundice cyanosis clubbing no palpable lymph nodes temperature was thirty-seven pulse ninety-eight B-P one oh three over sixty-eight her abdo was soft # non-tender no organomegaly and all of the systems were normal and now Will's going to tell you about rashes and things</u>
<u who="sm5256">up there is an example of a maculopapular rash # this is the kind that you might see in children who have Rubella in this case # # Miss MM had it as a reaction to one of the drugs she was being given # and as you heard in this case it covered ninety per cent of her body and even after it cleared up it the this was about a couple of weeks two or three weeks ago the skin is still # sort of coming off # it's called desquamation afterwards # other skin conditions you might get in children # suffering from # leukaemia # here's an example of a seven year old boy who's got # petechiae # which is sort of pin pin prick # haemorrhages into the skin # they're not raised it's the kind of thing you might get in <trunc>menigo</trunc> # meningococcemia # and # basically # they're very small less than two millimetres but # haemorrhages into the skin larger than two millimetres are called purpura # here are some examples there # looking quite # quite # raw but they're actually flat lesions and don't break the skin and # when they're larger it's the same as bruising it's called ecchymoses and in this child it was actually the way they the twelve year old boy presented with acute myeloid leukaemia # <trunc>diff</trunc> differential diagnoses # actually it's difficult this was a a child of fifteen # and normally patients with A-M-L are you'd normally see them only in people over twenty # so some of the differentials might well be different in a child of this age but # in a normal case of A-M-L # other things that you might be thinking of # if there was lymphadenopathy as well you might me thinking of infections such as # infective mononucleosis or lymphoma # if the liver and spleen are enlarged you might be thinking of myeloproliferative disorders # or myelodysplasia # that's something you wouldn't get in a younger child # could have metabolic storage or autoimmune disorders and also rarely tropical disorders such a leishmaniasis # it says no peripheral leukaemic blasts # but there is pancytopenia # it might indicate there's # aplastic anaemia or infiltrated bone marrow involvement and in <trunc>lymph</trunc> if it's lymphoblastic lymphoma # you get lymphomatous presentation # with less than twenty-five of blasts in the marrow # the definition of A-M-L which # # Doctor Rose is going to talk about more in # later on # talking briefly # acute leukaemia is a clonal malignant disorder # which affects # any age groups from infancy to old age in fact children can be born with leukaemia # but # like most cancers it # predominantly affects older ages # it's <trunc>charac</trunc> characterised by accumulation of abnormal white blood cells in the bone marrow which replace the normal tissue # which is why you get some of the effects # it's also replacing the haemopoietic precursor cells which is causing the anaemia et cetera it results in bone marrow failure # and peripheral blood involvement and it can infiltrate into various organs # the symptoms as i say # due to the <trunc>bo</trunc> bone marrow failure so anaemia because you can't make the red blood cells # infections because there's no white blood cells around to fight and haemorrhage due to platelet deficiencies and you can also get hyperleuccocytosis yeah so you can get an increase in white blood cells but they tend to be quite useless white blood cells # investigations for A-M-L # # i'll go through these in a bit of detail its full blood count obviously we're looking for a normochromic # normocytic anaemia so just because there's less red blood cells being made also thrombocytopoenia # you may also find that the white cell count is either decreased or significantly increased # differential white cell count is also often abnormal # with neutropenia and the presence of blast cells coagulation screening # could be abnormal # particularly in promyelocytic leukaemia # such as A-M-L type M-three which we'll go onto later # when granules from the <trunc>leukaplast</trunc> <trunc>lu</trunc> from leukaemic blasts # can have <trunc>co</trunc> coagulent activity biochemical screening can also be important # might # imply there's some renal impairment # chest x-ray # can also show that there's a mediastinal mass # which you might find of patients # with T-cell A-L-L # and in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia can actually cause # bone olysis which you might see in the chest x-ray # bone marrow aspiration is # essential to confirm # the acute leukaemia # it's usually hypercellular with a predomination of the blast cells which are the immature cells # immunophenotyping # is basically the way they determine whether the leukaemia is lymphoid or myeloid # cytochemistry can also be useful to confirm myeloid or monocytic origin # cytogenetics and molecular studies will be talked about more later but they can # have a great impact on the prognostic and diagnostic values and also lumbar puncture # in acute leukaemias this isn't so useful in in chronic it might imply there's some involvement of the central nervous system by the leukaemic cells # incidence as i say this only accounts for about ten to fifteen per cent of childhood leukaemia most childhood leukaemia is A-L-L # it's the commonest leukaemia however in adults # particularly as it can # progress from other conditions as we can see there myeloproliferative disorders and preleukaemic conditions like myelodysplasia # the incidence increases with age and the median presentation age is sixty # future management just briefly they're giving a combination chemotherapy and also bone marrow transplantation either from a sibling she does have an older brother # or from a matched unrelated donor and that's the lot thank you</u>
<u who="nm5253">right so the # presentation of # acute leukaemia as we've said you can # work out really from the blood blood results these patients are anaemic # and they have problems with breathlessness tiredness whatever # the white count is very low usually having a neutrophil count of less that 05and when you've got a neutrophil count like that you are at risk of both bacterial and fungal infection in particular # so gram-negative # septicemia is common # <trunc>s</trunc> infections with staphylococcal # infections often from infected # Hickman lines which are the central lines which are inserted into patients so that they can have their treatment and chemotherapy is a common and # persistent problem for patients that are neutropenic # and patients who have low platelet counts as most patients with acute leukaemia do are at significant risk of bleeding and bruising so the principles of treatment are based on the management of these perimeters and patients with low platelet counts with platelet counts usually less than twenty times ten to the nine per litre would have a regular platelet transfusions and i was just wondering if anybody can tell me how long a platelet actually survives routinely in a normal circulation</u>
<u who="su">seven to ten days</u>
<u who="nm5253">seven to ten days good okay and what about a red cell how long would a red cell</u>
<gap reason="inaudible" extent="uncertain"/>
<u who="nm5253">okay well in the presence of # severe infection where you've got consumption of # different blood products the survival of cells is significantly shorter but it does mean that patients with acute leukaemias do require to have platelet transfusions often on alternate days and blood transfusions # perhaps not as frequently but once or twice # a month in order to maintain their haemoglobin they do require to have antibiotic prophylaxis because # being neutropenic it's often the organisms that are within their own gastrointestinal tract that cause problems it's not so much what you and i # necessarily infect them with it's what they've actually got within their own # intestines so while they are neutropenic they are at risk of bacteremia and septicemia # patients who develop pyrexias of thirty-eight degrees for more than two hours if they're neutropenic would then be treated with intravenous antibiotics and it's important that # such patients do have regular monitoring of their temperature # because # if you let them drift and remain pyrexial for twenty-four hours you may well end up with # an overwhelming septicemia and # a significant mortality that could be avoided so they're the general principles of # management # on a day-to-day basis on the ward for patients with acute leukaemia the basic treatment that they receive is cytotoxic treatment which consists of # multiple chemotherapy agents because we know single agents are not as good as if we use multiple agents and we know that if we give repeated courses of treatment certainly up to four or five courses of treatment then the risk of relapse is significantly less and if we look at the overall prognosis for patients with acute myeloid leukaemia we would find that approximately forty per cent of patients with acute myeloid leukaemia are cured it means clearly that the majority of patients still are not curable although up to seventy to eighty per cent of patients will go into a remission in other words there'll be reconstitution of the normal blood counts there will however in many of these cases remain molecular evidence of disease and there are important techniques to actually try and identify # which patients have got persistent disease in terms of chromosome analysis it's important at diagnosis to look at the # # chromosome make-up because certain translocations are associated with a good prognosis and certain translocations are associated with a poor prognosis and for those patients who have good prognostic # features # in particular the chromosome analysis # these patients may be curable with chemotherapy alone so for example patients who have acute promylocytic leukaemia which is a type of acute myeloid leukaemia <trunc>wh</trunc> which we've heard about that is associated with increased granulation in the cytoplasm but can cause # disseminated intravascular coagulation due to the release of a thromboplastin-like material from the granules if these patients actually survive the first few days and don't go into D-I-C they actually have a significantly better # long term prognosis # and this particular type of leukaemia is associated with a translocation between chromosome's fifteen and seventeen the majority however of chromosome translocation's are usually associated with a poorer prognosis and it is really for these groups of patients that # one would consider more intensive forms of treatment and in particular bone marrow transplantation so patients with poor prognosis # we would consider bone marrow transplantation from a sibling donor # shortly after establishing the patient into remission with standard chemotherapy are there any questions that you want to ask quickly about this because we've got all the other leukaemias and lymphomas to go through # anything anybody's yeah</u>
<u who="sm5260">you talk about having a pancytopenia but then you get times of hyper-leukocytosis you talk about obviously replacing what's lacking if you like # transfusion wise but don't you risk hyperviscosity if there is say a what do you in a <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/></u>
<u who="nm5253">well # you're right some # patients with acute leukaemia at presentation have extremely high white blood counts # due to large numbers of blast cells and primitive cells spilling out into the peripheral blood if that is the case then # it is # a matter of urgency to reduce the white count because at a certain level usually around about a white count of three-hundred times ten to the nine per litre you can run into problems with leukostasis # and you can either do one of two things you can try and treat them with chemotherapy # as soon as you can really or you can mechanically try and remove some of the cells # on a cell separator and that # can at least buy you some temporary time # but it is # a a difficult problem and # it's probably even more so # # a problem with patients with chronic myeloid leukaemia that can present with really very high white counts right so # we're going to move on now and # learn a little bit about about chronic myeloid leukaemia and # we'll be able to <trunc>c</trunc> contrast the presentation the clinical features # with the acute leukaemias thanks</u>
<u who="sm5258">this was a forty-eight year old gentleman who was admitted to the C-C-U # with chest who's complaining of abdominal discomfort and feeling of tiredness the chest pain was of sudden onset radiating up the sternum and lasting twelve hours # when he was <trunc>pres</trunc> when he presented to the C-C-U # the chest pain was actually absent there was no associated nausea or vomiting # pain was worse on lying flat and it was constant in nature # he did have left-sided abdominal discomfort and he found it very difficult to describe this discomfort he did suffer from weight loss over the last few months # he was previously fit and healthy his past medical history nothing to note he was not on any other medication # no known drug allergies # he was a non-smoker no alcohol he lives with his wife and two children who are all fit and well and he doesn't have any living siblings okay family history there was no relevant family history no history of heart disease or leukaemia or any cancers okay on examination # this gentleman was pale he had a mild fever which was thirty-seven-point-eight degrees c he was alert and not dehydrated there was no jaundice cyanosis # edema or lymphadenopathy # cardiovascular system no abnormality was found pulse rate was normal # regular rhythm and B-P was one-forty over ninety his heart sounds one and two were present and there were no murmurs okay respiratory rate same again no abnormality was found here he had vesicular breath sounds and his chest was clear on examination of the abdomen he did have # it was soft and tender particularly in the left upper quadrant his spleen was enlarged and just below the left costal margin okay C-N-S no abnormality was found right investigations # the first investigation that was carried out was a full blood count his haemoglobin was eight-point-four and it should be between thirteen and eighteen so it was quite reduced in this bloke # his white cell count was one-five -nine as you can see it's significantly raised right it should be between four and eleven his platelet was three-two-six and that's # more or less within the normal range chest x-ray was found to be normal and his E-C-G was he had sinus rhythm there was no changes no S-T elevation depression and also cardiac enzymes were not elevated okay # in this patient # heart disease or myocardial infarction or angina was ruled out because we couldn't find any changes on the E-C-G # so his chest pain was actually attributed to a hyperviscosity of the blood # secondary to a increased white cell count so i'm not going to talk about the chest pain any more i'll probably go off on one that's why okay a differential diagnosis # in this patient we thought he might have myelofibrosis which is a proliferative disorder of the myeloid cells and fibrosis of the bone marrow but you would find a white cell count of a <trunc>betwee</trunc> between fifty and sixty # could also be chronic lymphocytic <trunc>leuk</trunc> leukaemia which is proliferation of lymphocytes which is mainly <trunc>characte</trunc> characterised by small mature lymphocytes and the absence of many of the precursor cells which are found in chronic myeloid leukaemia # acute myeloid leukaemia Rachel and Will have already talked about sarcoidosis # is a restrictive deficit and # this is # and it usually can present with enlarged hilar and enlargement of the spleen and so we <trunc>cou</trunc> we did think it might be this reactive neutrophilia also known as a leukaemoid reaction and this usually occurs due to exaggerated response to infection so in this patient we was we were mainly looking at # chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and chronic myeloid leukaemia # okay # we carried out a few more investigations to narrow that down and the blood film showed an increased eso- <trunc>eso</trunc> <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> whatever count and occasional blasts and nucleated red cells a B-M aspirate in the B-M aspirate we look for # we just look for chromosomal analysis and the aspirate was found to be hypercellular with the presence of a Philadelphia Chromosome which Putri will talk about # soon # and that was present in the granular sized red blood cells and platelet precursors okay diagnosis this patient was diagnosed with # diagnosed with chronic myeloid leukaemia mainly due to the presence of the Philadelphia Chromosome he had a significantly increased white cell count he did have splenomegaly he had anaemia weight loss low grade fever and tiredness which are some of the classic signs of chronic myeloid leukaemia # this patient was managed on Hydroxyurea and Glivec which is a protein tyrosine kinases inhibitor and # a bone marrow transplant is going to be considered but Putri will mention that shortly as well okay</u>
<u who="sm5257">right # i'm going to talk about # C-M-L the definition is it's an uncontrolled proliferation of myeloid stem cells the cells contain the Philadelphia Chromosome which is the diagnostic feature of C-M-L it's basically a reciprocal translocation from long arm of chromosome twenty-two to chromosome nine C-M-L is a progressive disease consisting of two phases a chronic phase and an accelerated advanced phase the chronic phase is actually signified by three it lasts for about three to four years and it might be characterised by systemic symptoms like weight loss amaemia fatigue # it <trunc>i</trunc> it is during this period that usually the diagnosis is made and treatment is offered to the patient but mainly on an # outpatient basis unfortunately every patient with C-M-L does go into an accelerated or advanced phase it's # almost inevitable and this is when they stop responding to the treatment and they get increased anaemia and thrombocytopenia the prognosis is very poor at this stage and the only cure available at this moment of time well at this time is basically bone marrow transplant the incidence is one per a hundred-thousand per year and there's a slight male dominance over females # it's usually a middle-age disease and it occurs between the forty-fi-, forty to sixty-five year olds it constitutes twenty per cent of all leukaemias the clinical features are anaemia fever fatigue abdominal pain due to splenomegaly weight loss blurred vision or headaches this is due to the increased white cell count and bruising due to the decreased platelets the main investigations carried out are a full blood count in which you're mainly looking for the haemoglobin you're looking for platelet count and increased white cell count # U and E's # you'll do the blood film to look for an increased number of blasts and any mature granulocytes also # you're looking for a <trunc>bo</trunc> bone marrow aspirate to see hypercellularity and to check for the Philadelphia Chromosome which is again the main diagnostic feature you can also carry out an R-T-P-C-R which shows the expression of B-C-R-A-B-L oncogene this is the oncogene responsible to produce tyrosine kinases which is required for the growth and proliferation of the cells # the treatment is oral hydroxyurea this is an orally active drug and it's a hydro carbamide but i'm not quite sure how it works # the other treatment is alpha interferons these these treatments are given during the chronic phase # this helps in haematological remission and aids in five to ten per cent of patients to get to get complete disappearance of the Philadelphia Chromosome Glivec or Imatinib is a protein tyrosine kinases inhibitor and it prevents growth and division of the leukaemic cells by blocking the signal transmission it also causes reduction of the Philadelphia Chromosome and the side effects are quite mild and easy to treat bone marrow transplant that's the only curative treatment for C-M-L using a matched sibling or unrelated match donor however it's restricted to younger patients below sixty years of age and there's an increased risk of relapse after transplantation autologous transplantation a lot of studies have been done on this trials have been done but the results have been quite disappointing so it's not used in daily practice so the prognosis of <trunc>C</trunc> C-M-L is variable but it the median survival is between three to five years and i'll pass it on to Doctor Rose</u>
<u who="nm5253"># so chronic myeloid leukaemia is # a condition which # at the end of the day is really quite chronic and insidious in it's onset but at the end of the day is something which # ultimately will transform to a blast crisis and patients presenting with acute leukaemia following chronic myeloid leukaemia have a very poor prognosis indeed in fact it's just about universally fatal so the principles # of treatment and management are to try and prevent the # chronic phase of disease entering into the accelerated and then subsequent blast crisis so the standard treatments that are being used # such as hydroxyurea and # alpha interferon although we're not entirely sure the exact mechanism of how they work they do delay the phase # the chronic phase of disease # more recently # as we've heard already # we there has been a lot of # interest in the press about this tyrosine kinases # inhibitor this drug was basically built <trunc>s</trunc> specifically to # carry out the task of # # inhibiting the # B-C-R-A-B-L # gene from doing it's work and # this drug is now available and # if you look at the # chromosome level many of the patients who actually receive # Glivec # will go will # lose the # Philadelphia Chromosome and # it # certainly is a major step forward in terms of the management of a lot of patients with chronic myeloid leukaemia bearing in mind that only about twenty per cent of patients that you look for a transplant donor will you actually be able to find one # so the majority of the patients in the future are likely to be to be treated by Glivec and although it's unlikely to produce # molecular remission in a sustained manner it is a major # step forward in the treatment and management of patients with C-M-L # the drug itself i should say costs twenty-thousand pounds # a year and bearing in mind that many of the patients with chronic myeloid leukaemia might live fifteen years then as you accumulate these patients and they live longer so the finances get more and more stretched # but it is a major step forward in # in the management of # leukaemias # if you are in an exam and you # had a patient who had splenomegaly what would be your immediate # clinical # differential diagnosis it's the sort of thing you're bound to get in your finals isn't it so you need to be able to say something vaguely sensible about it right before i start picking on people # who's going to tell me what the differential somebody with a big spleen # would you like to tell us what you would # consider</u>
<u who="sm5261">secondary to portal hypertension</u>
<u who="nm5253">right okay so portal hypertension patients with chronic liver disease are a common reason to have splenomegaly and # # it would be sensible in your clinical exam to actually not just look at the spleen in sheer amazement that you've found it but to actually have some sort of plan as to how you're going to impress the examiner one point if you're going to talk about the differential diagnosis of portal hypertension would then to have been made clear that you've looked for other signs clinical signs of liver disease so if you find you're asked to examine an abdomen and you find a spleen then it would be very useful to actually # look for other signs of chronic liver disease okay so that is one reason what other haematological reasons might we what are you likely to have</u>
<gap reason="inaudible" extent="uncertain"/>
<u who="nm5253">some blood <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> so would you like to be a little bit more specific it's likely to be chronic problems aren't they because we're not going to produce people with acute leukaemia to sit in the outpatient area's and and have hundreds of people pummel their stomachs so i think chronic myeloid leukaemia that we've just been talking about is a good differential diagnosis so somebody with an isolated splenomegaly and the other condition that we've mentioned already is myelofibrosis whereby you get # extra medullary haematopoiesis the spleen will set itself up as a factory it'll produce # # or attempt to produce increasing numbers of haemopoyetic cells and # the spleen will enlarge and these patients have increased fibrosis in their bone marrow so particularly large spleens perhaps the first thing you would say is myelofibrosis portal hypertension would come close second chronic myeloid leukaemia would be in there and one other group of conditions that you would consider for somebody with an enlarged spleen</u>
<gap reason="inaudible" extent="uncertain"/>
<u who="nm5253">well infections yes # you certainly can get increased splenomegaly certainly with things like glandular fever the splenomegaly in patients with glandular fever is usually tender again in # an exam situation these things are often transient they are not likely to be there # unless you've got some person who's come from abroad and has some form of chronic infection</u>
<gap reason="inaudible" extent="uncertain"/>
<u who="nm5253">so you could have someone with a haemoglobinopathy # certainly some patients # with thalassemia would have # splenomegaly if they've still managed to retain their spleen and it hasn't been removed</u>

<u who="nm5253"># yes some of the haemolitic anaemias again where you have # splenomegaly i think the other group that we're going to go on and talk about are patients with lymphomas and # # if you want to really impress your examiners again # when you've found the spleen not only do you look for evidence of chronic liver disease and you can say well this patients got splenomegaly there aren't any signs of chronic liver disease the other thing that would impress them would be if you actually went and were seen to be examining as to whether the patient had any enlarged lymph glands because if the patient has something like chronic lymphocytic leukaemia or the patient has a lymphoma then you might score some extra points by actually showing that you actually are thinking one step ahead so as part of your clinical examination for an enlarged spleen you have a differential diagnosis a myelofibriosis chronic myeloid leukaemia lymphomas and # chronic liver disease so i think they're worth all considering right we're going to # go on now and # discuss some of the # clinical situation <trunc>r</trunc> relating to lymphoma patients and we're firstly going to have a case of a patient with a high grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma</u>
<u who="sf5255">okay Paul and i are going to be talking about lymphoma and we'll try and keep it as brief as possible # the two main different types of lymphomas are divided by Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma Hodgkin's is characterised by Reed-Sternberg cells and every other lymphoma falls into non-Hodgkin's lymphoma basically it's a cancer of the lymphoid tissue and it can be characterised on their biological features and also on the clinical behaviour and once you work this out you're able to <trunc>f</trunc> put them into a classification and then stage them on the disease our patient was a twenty year old girl presented in September two-thousand-one with shortness of breath chronic cough and anaemia she subsequently had a chest x-ray which revealed wide mediastinum and left hilum shadowing which is of huge medical emergency in this age group # there was no significant past medical history the only medication she was on was an oral contraceptive pill which was for contraception reasons # at the time she was living with her parents taking her A-levels and this obviously affected how she did in her exams and i think she had to postpone them for a while # she didn't take <trunc>dr</trunc> well she didn't smoke and she doesn't drink and there was no significant family history the significant findings on examination were the anaemia the stridor # an increased respiratory rate and actually no splenomegaly or <trunc>hept</trunc> heptaomegaly # as she had no splenomegaly or heptaomegaly i thought i'd just look at the causes of lymphadenopathy which has sort of been discussed already however the best way to probably divide them is through infection and malignancy # infection could be then subdivided into viral bacterial and protozoal and at this age group you're probably thinking along the lines of glandular fever # also malignancy which we've had two of the cases discussed already and obviously she falls into the non-Hodgkin's lymphoma category the most likely causes for this patient will be non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and sarcoidosis and the investigations have already been kind of discussed by Will in great depth so the main thing's that we'd be looking looking for on our investigations were the biopsy to actually type the lymphoma and also the C-T scan to actually stage the disease so she had a mediastinal lymph node biopsy which is not typical but as she had no other lymphadenopathy anywhere else we had to biopsy the lymph node when i say we they did and the histology revealed that it was sclerotic and necrotic tissue an atypical lymphoid population indicative of a high grade N-H-L the # immunology showed C-D-twenty and C-D-seventy-nine-A which i believe are B cell markers and the C-T scan indicated that she was stage one by Ann Arbor staging which just means that she had # one lymph node group above the diaphragm and so therefore she was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin's B Cell Lymphoma the treatment was quite extensive which isn't always true for all non-Hodgkin's patients she <trunc>we</trunc> underwent six cycles of C-H-O-P and then had a C-T scan which revealed there was no real progress so then she under went two more cycles of E-S-H-A-P a positron emissions tomography revealed then that she still needed further treatment which was Chemo B-E-A-M # therapy after this once she was in the clear she had autologous peripheral stem cell rescue # the good thing about # this type of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma is the fact that it's got a curable rate and using <trunc>ch</trunc> <trunc>in</trunc> intensive # chemotherapy twenty to forty per cent of the patients under the age of sixty will actually be cured</u>
<gap reason="inaudible" extent="uncertain"/>
<u who="sf5255">Paul will be discussing C-H-O-P in great <trunc>de</trunc> detail and E-S-H-A-P is just another chemotherapy regime which i don't know what the letters stand for but i'm sure if you ask # Doctor Rose he'll actually go through that with you # thank you so three days post-transplant she developed a fever which was treated appropriately with antibiotics and I-V fluids however on administrating the I-V fluids through her Hickman line # they noticed that she was developing a swollen neck and anterior chest so on investigation they found that it was a fibrosed <trunc>sub</trunc> # superior vena cava and also thrombosis in the subclavian vessels one of the main complications of chemotherapy is fertility and ovarian dysfunction and unfortunately is had an early onset of menopause which is currently being treated by hormonal therapy she recently # visited outpatients in June two-thousand-three and seems to be cured as she has no symptoms or signs of recurrent lymphoma her L-D-H and F-B-C are both normal and she's off to university in September two-thousand-three # the prognosis for this girl is actually very good and age is a huge thing that # influences your prognosis so what i've done is use the age adjusted I-P-I instead and this is just based on your L-D-H levels your extra nodal involvement and the stage and so her score actually came out as a zero which is a really good prognosis and it corresponds to eighty-three per cent five year overall survival and that is it and you can ask questions now to Doctor Rose instead of me</u>
<u who="nm5253">so <trunc>p</trunc> patients with # high grade lymphomas # are potentially curable and # although high grade lymphomas have a much faster cell turnover and # # contrast to patients with a low grade lymphomas # they do in some respects in for younger patients you could say have a in some ways a better prognosis # patients treated with high dose treatment # are potentially curable # patients with # treatment with chemotherapy if they've not relapsed usually within two years of finishing their chemotherapy are likely to be cured this does contrast with patients with Hodgkin's disease because patients with Hodgkin's disease can relapse anything up to ten fifteen years after their initial chemotherapy # so it is important to # be aware of that i think one or two other things recently that have come out about we're talking about Hodgkin's disease now for a few minutes are that patients with Hodgkin's disease despite their initial chemotherapy up to five ten fifteen per cent of these patients are developing second malignancies # these malignancies vary from # acute leukaemias through to patients developing # problems with # bone marrow function where they develop myelodysplasia through to patients female patients # developing # problems with # breast cancer and # some very high percentage of patients who've been treated with # Hodgkin's disease are now actually <trunc>g</trunc> develop subsequent breast cancer and it is recommended that patients with Hodgkin's disease now are screened on a regular basis really female patients # with mammography thereafter # the overall chances of going into remission with # different stages of Hodgkin's disease do depend on the actual stage of disease if you have localised disease # then this is potentially curable with a radiotherapy to those particular sites for patients who have stage four disease and by that we mean have extra nodal disease or bone marrow involvement these patients have a significantly worse prognosis with approximately fifty per cent long term survival so for a disease that we tend to think of as very curable if you happen to have stage four disease at presentation there are still a lot of patients who require very intensive treatment and for these patients if they relapse they would require to have a stem cell bone marrow transplant # # in order to try and salvage these patients # for patients with # the low grade lymphomas we'll hear the treatments are very different and these diseases behave in a entirely different indolent manner again so it is important to actually make the right diagnosis and the most important thing in terms of management of patients with lymphomas is to actually get a proper histological assessment and diagnosis # and the histological assessment can be aided again by a chromosome analysis # as certain lymphomas associated again with certain specific # chromosomal translocations # so it's important to make the # accurate histological diagnosis it's important to have chromosome analysis again wherever possible right well we're going to hear a case now of # low grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and we'll just contrast the clinical presentation with patients with high grade disease i think the only other thing i want to say about the high grade lymphoma was with this particular case was the fact that this patient presented with a mediastinal mass and # young people presenting with mediastinal masses do represent medical emergencies they can cause # stridor and if you remember stridor is an inspiratory wheeze so if you get a young patient who comes in with a leukaemia or lymphoma it's important to get a chest x-ray that day because these tumors can grow really quite rapidly and some T cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemias and high grade # T cell lymphomas can result in you know # compression of your airways really quite quickly so it's important and that would be again represented # an urgent clinical presentation of a lymphoma thanks</u>
<u who="sm5259">okay # so i'm just going to do a case presentation on a low grade patient who had follicular lymphoma right so a thirty-eight year old gentleman he presented to his G-P # January last year he had a swollen right leg which he'd had for six months and he also had bilateral inguinal masses # the reason why he'd waited six months before he went to see his G-P about it was that he'd previously fractured his femur and thought it was <trunc>i</trunc> in some way related to that and also he said that he'd recently put on weight and thought it might just be something related to that as well # but as it turned out he he saw his GP and he referred him on to the haematologist via the two week cancer referral scheme # additional history # as i said he had fractured right femur following an R-T-A he was on no medication no significant family history # he's married and he has three children he works as an engineer lecturer and he says that he previously worked in the petroleum industry and there is said to be some association with exposure to <trunc>ben</trunc> # i think it's benzine and developments of lymphoma # and yeah he was a non-smoker so significant points in this patient # he had unilateral lymphoedema # with his lymph nodes they were enlarged greater than one centimetre they were firm rubbery and non-tender and he'd had these for six months significant # negatives were the fact no recent history of long haul flights no recent trauma no source of infection and no signs of inflammatory or connective tissue disease okay so differentials so he had unilateral leg swelling so you'd be thinking venous disease and lymphatic disease # in terms of his # lymphadenopathy it'd be very similar to what Jo said in terms of the infections so you think viral bacterial and protozoal and also primary and secondary malignancies can cause that okay so he was referred on to the haematologist and on examination he noted there was generalised lymph node enlargement # there was no sign of splenomegaly although subsequently he's developed that # and he had no history of night sweats fever or recent weight loss # and these are so-called B signs okay # so the investigations that he had he had an ultrasound of his right leg to rule out a thrombus # he had microbiology to rule out any infection # they all came back negative for any pathology so he had some more investigations he had # a inguinal lymph node biopsy histology indicated this to be a non-Hodgkin's low grade follicular lymphoma and it was positive for C-D-ten C-D-twenty and also this B-C-L-two protein which is overexpressed due to a translocation from chromosome fourteen and eighteen # which results in overexpression of this oncogene # and that's present in this patient # he had a C-T scan and that indicated that he had diffuse bulky disease he had a bone marrow aspirate and a core biopsy of the right iliac crest # and this helped stage the condition and it indicated that it was # diffuse infiltration with small lymphoid cells in the bone marrow so this patient was discussed at the M-D-M and he was diagnosed with bulky disease stage four so treatment right he was started on C-O-P which is cyclophosphamide vincristine prednisolone # he had four cycles of that and this was all done as an outpatient # with three weeks in between each cycle after the first four cycles he had a C-T scan and that indicated # there was no significant reduction in # lymph node size so he had four more cycles following that he had two month break from chemotherapy # during inguinal node # re-enlargement so he started back on C-H-O-P which is a more aggressive chemotherapy and added to that was this # Rituximab # and the difference between C-O-P and C-H-O-P is that you have # one <trunc>chemoth</trunc> chemotherapy agent called doxorubicin hydrochloride and the significance of the # Rituximab is that it's a monoclonal antibody # which causes slices of B cell # B lymphocytes and it's specific to C-D-twenty which this patient was positive for # right future treatment options so patient responded well to this # final course of C-H-O-P he had six cycles of that and he went into remission following it however although he's in remission now it's not curative there isn't actually any cure for low grade lymphomas and when it does reoccur it they're going to have to require # more aggressive chemotherapy # that type of chemotherapy's going to <trunc>re</trunc> result in bone marrow destruction therefore at the present he's having # peripheral stem cell harvest so that that can be stored and # later on he can have that infused and # used as a bone marrow transplant unfortunately he had a sister but she wasn't a suitable # transplant patient okay and that's it</u>
<u who="nm5253">so # low grade lymphomas are often slow growing but indolent they don't respond very well to a particularly to aggressive treatment and the more aggressive you are with them sometimes the more resistant they are they do respond to # low grade # treatment with # oral chemotherapy certain alkalating agents in particular chlorambucil # is a useful agent and # these are not curable conditions so if you have a patient presenting with diffused lymphadenopathy in middle age who hasn't got a particularly high lymphocyte count to exclude chronic lymphocytic leukaemia then the likelihood would be that they've got a a low grade # diffused non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in terms of the classification of lymphomas over the last twenty years there have been something like fifty different classifications of non-Hodgkin's lymphomas and # you could look through # most pathology and histology text books over the last # # few years and you will find a different classification in every text book there is a # an agreed classification at present which is the W-H-O classification which is worth looking at at least to give you some idea as to what the current nomenclature is in terms of classification of different lymphomas but basically on a clinical level you need to be able to distinguish between high grade and low grade non-Hodgkin's lymphomas you need to be able to identify the patients who have Hodgkin's disease in terms of immunological diagnosis it is important to differentiate B cell conditions from T cell conditions in general T cell disorders carry a worse prognosis certainly patients with chronic T cell lymphomas # do particularly badly they're often associated with skin infiltration and # again are indolent and tend to be rather resistant to treatment are they any questions you've had an hours worth of being drilled with information about high and low grade lymphomas patients with acute and chronic leukaemias so i think yeah</u>
<u who="sf5262"># i think this was mentioned before but can you say again the difference between Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's</u>
<u who="nm5253">right well Hodgkin's disease is characterised by the presence of Reed-Sternberg cells in the bone marrow # these are large cells which have an owl-like appearance and # # are <trunc>read</trunc> usually readily identified on # histological examination # they are believed to be the malignant cell in patients with # Hodgkin's disease and they probably are an early B cell # malignancy</u>
<u who="nm5263">about half of them are <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> positive</u>
<u who="nm5253">right yes #</u>
<u who="nm5263">can i can i ask a question somebody mentioned B B signs <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> what are A signs</u>
<u who="nm5253">sorry the A-A signs sorry B-B in terms of the clinical signs you've got # you can classify somebody as being A or B and it really means absence or present and the B clinical signs are the presence of fever drenching night sweats so it's not somebody just feeling a bit hot and you know bit of a clammy night and coming in and it's drenching night sweats so that they have to change their bedding they have to change # their nighty or whatever # and it's significant weight loss so something like a stone in the last six months in weight # and loss of of appetite so the you need to be a little bit # firmer about when you're actually attributing somebody to have B symptoms patients often also have fever and it's important to identify the type of fever that they've got # in Hodgkin's disease you can get this Pel-Ebstein fever which the temperature remains elevated for two or three days goes down and then comes up again or sometimes you can just get a persistently raised # high temperature with it sorry # yes you were going to</u>
<u who="sf5264"># i was just wondering if there were like diagnostic criteria do you need all three or would you maybe just get the one or two</u>
<u who="nm5253">you may just get one or two but if # you're getting drenching night sweats then that patient would be # classified # as a as a B type patient and it does seriously affect the prognosis to these patients because if you have B symptoms your prognosis in general # whether you've got Hodgkin's or non-Hodgkin's disease is significantly worse and often when patients relapse you may not necessarily even be aware of any lymph glands or something like that but the first thing that they actually notice is that their drenching night sweats have come back or # the most disappointing thing is between courses of chemotherapy if they come along and tell you that they're still getting drenching night sweats after a fortnight after the chemotherapy's finished and you're pretty well sure that the treatment patients are resistant to it and you need to be thinking of changing your management</u>
<u who="sf5265">can i just ask # you were talking about # prognosis # and you were saying that you looked at full blood count i can understand # that but <trunc>L</trunc> L-D-H as well #</u>
<u who="nm5253">yeah the <trunc>L</trunc> L-D-H # is # it's a liver enzyme # but it it's also very useful # it's also present in red cells but it is has also been shown to be of # good prognostic # value in patients with lymphoma and it's also particularly useful in monitoring response to treatment so # round about thirty to forty per cent of patients with high grade lymphomas will have a raised L-D-H and # these patients you can use it to monitor the management and # also in patients who are again otherwise well if they come to clinic and you check their L-D-H and it's suddenly shot up then again that's often an early indication that the disease is shortly to become active</u>
<u who="su">i was wondering if they've used # umbilical cord stem cells for treatment in this country</u>
<u who="nm5253">if we take for example a patient with chronic myeloid leukaemia chronic myeloid leukaemia can affect patients at all ages and # # i'll give you an example round about seven or eight years ago we had a mother with chronic myeloid leukaemia who did not have # a sibling transplant donor and # she was pregnant and she did have her stem cells harvested # on the basis that they might be # potentially useful # in those sort of situations # you know there may be # a situation there that you would actually use # # you know cord cells they're not commonly or routinely collected and it isn't routine practice in the U-K # usually for patients who haven't got a a sibling donor you would look on the computer systems in the U-K and further afield to look for a matched unrelated donor there are one or two places certainly in Bristol they are collecting # lots of # # stem cells from # you know foetal stem cells # but it isn't # part of the routine practice but i think if you had a mother who was pregnant who had a baby then you might seriously think about potentially using them</u>
<u who="su">do you know how successful it is in other countries</u>
<u who="nm5253"># i mean they have been done with some success but they're not it's certainly not mainstream or or routine practice by any means</u>
<u who="nm5263">the thing about cord blood # is if it is for of of somebody else it's just like any other <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> and the cord blood is very rich in stem cells and if you take # cord blood from your child of course that's that's an <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> donor the same as your sister would be the thing about about cord blood if if you can think ahead sufficiently so that you score it against the risk of your developing leukaemia <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> in later life # that may be very valuable because of course that'd be # # an autograph but you've got to think ahead or your parents have to anyway</u>
<u who="nm5253">i think the other thing to say about <trunc>bo</trunc> transplantation is that most people would believe that # transplantation is successful and and cures patients really because it induces graft-versus-host disease and # it is that graft-versus-host disease effect which is important actually in the treatment # for example where patients have had transplants from identical twins these patients # more commonly relapse with the # original disease so people have tried to look at ways of # mimicking or instituting you know graft-versus-host disease # in order to you know as actually part of the # experimental regimes in terms of management of patients with leukaemias</u>
<u who="nm5263">so generally graft-versus-host or is it graft-versus-tumor</u>
<u who="nm5253">well it's graft-versus-tumor</u>
<u who="nm5263">yeah nice distinction isn't it</u>
<u who="nm5253">it is right there must be lots of other questions <trunc>any</trunc> anybody want to ask any of this distinguished panel any question before you leave</u>
<u who="sm5260">it is a bit of a # off the beaten track but you mentioned D-I-C earlier in the talk</u>
<u who="nm5253">yes</u>
<u who="sm5260"># there's a bit of confusion from what i've read that people say you'll have to # use thrombolysis because of all the clots around the body and other people argue you can't do that you have to give F-F-P what is <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/></u>
<u who="nm5253">yeah # # i don't think that there would be anybody who would seriously consider giving thrombolysis to somebody with overwhelming # disseminated intravascular coagulation you could # # bearing in mind that most of these patients # not only are thrombosing but they also bleed and they bleed because they're got severe thrombocytopoenia at the same time they do get # # consumption of the coagulation factors so they can thrombose but at the same time # eventually they end up with # quite a severe bleeding diathesis and to actually routinely talk about using # # lysis of clots # is not # you know would be <trunc>v</trunc> highly dangerous and most of these patients would bleed to death quicker than they will do otherwise # so the aims of treatment would be to really to damp down the process of consumption of clotting factors so replace clotting factors in fresh frozen plasma but particularly to give platelet transfusions because the reason most of these patients die is because they bleed because of the thrombocytopoenia</u>
<u who="sm5257">what's the prognosis like if you give # platelet transfusions because apparently the patients don't respond to it after a while</u>
<u who="nm5253"># platelet refractoriness is is a serious problem and many of the patients do develop antibodies and can become refractory to # platelet transfusions # you can give H-L-A matched # platelets # for those who don't get an adequate increment after you've given # standard platelet # donations # but it is a # quite problem actually # and certain many of the patients with acute leukaemias who have repeated and recurrent courses of chemotherapy and then you want to go on and <trunc>g</trunc> have a bone marrow transplant if they've got antibodies then it's all the more difficult for them to actually go through that right <trunc>any</trunc> anything more are you all dead or you're all you've had enough you're right well <trunc>c</trunc> can i just say # thank you very much to # all all of you who have taken part # this evening and # thank you very much for coming</u>
