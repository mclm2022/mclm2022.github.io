<u who="nm0442"><kinesic desc="projector is on showing slide" iterated="n"/> today we're going to <trunc>s</trunc> cover structural and functional relationships in proteins <pause dur="0.5"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> and i'm sure as most of you will really all be aware this is going to be <pause dur="0.5"/> # you know we're going to only cover a very small proportion of <pause dur="0.5"/> of # structural and functional relationships in proteins <pause dur="1.2"/> proteins are of course the sort of workhorses the machines of the cells <pause dur="0.3"/> and they perform all of the reactions that are compatible with life including those ones <pause dur="0.4"/> listed there <pause dur="0.9"/> # <pause dur="1.1"/> and of course there are very <pause dur="0.2"/> many relevant medical examples to how <pause dur="0.3"/> the structure <pause dur="0.4"/> and function of a protein <pause dur="0.3"/> is related to <pause dur="0.5"/> the normal physiology <pause dur="0.3"/> is related to a disease whereby <pause dur="0.7"/> a loss of function results in an important medical condition i'm <trunc>think</trunc> thinking of things like <pause dur="0.3"/> cystic fibrosis <pause dur="0.7"/> where the gain of a function <pause dur="0.5"/> is a problem for example a <pause dur="0.3"/> tumour <pause dur="0.5"/> tumour genes <pause dur="0.3"/> things like rasp found in a large proportion of <pause dur="0.3"/> human tumours <pause dur="0.3"/> and even when the normal function <pause dur="0.2"/> of a protein <trunc>be</trunc> could become a a 
medical problem <pause dur="0.4"/> i'm thinking there particularly of things like multidrug resistance <pause dur="0.3"/> both in bacteria <pause dur="0.5"/> and again in tumours <pause dur="0.7"/> so <pause dur="0.3"/> with that in mind <pause dur="0.3"/> we will briefly and it will be brief and this is <pause dur="0.2"/> essentially part of i guess your <pause dur="0.3"/> assumed knowledge we'll review the basic <pause dur="0.2"/> aspects of # protein structure <pause dur="0.3"/> and go on to <pause dur="0.3"/> some <pause dur="0.4"/> medically relevant examples <pause dur="1.6"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> so the basic <pause dur="0.6"/> # unit of protein structure is of course the peptide bond <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> a polypeptide <pause dur="0.3"/> # it's a sequence of amino acids <pause dur="0.3"/> that are joined through peptide bonds that represents the <pause dur="0.4"/> the primary structure <pause dur="0.5"/> of that protein <pause dur="0.7"/> the peptide bond is formed through the condensation of a <pause dur="0.2"/> carboxylic <pause dur="0.6"/> acid group from an amino acid <pause dur="0.4"/> and a <pause dur="0.9"/> amine group from an amino acid <pause dur="1.9"/> the # carbonyl oxygen <pause dur="0.6"/> and the nitrogen <pause dur="0.5"/> are electronegative and that effectively means that the peptide bond itself <pause dur="0.3"/> has extensive double-bonded character <pause dur="0.6"/> it's rigid and planar <pause dur="0.5"/> it can't rotate <pause dur="1.5"/> but of course there's free rotation <pause dur="0.5"/> of the bonds on either side <pause dur="0.4"/> of that peptide bond <pause dur="0.6"/> and so the 
side chains of the amino acids <pause dur="0.3"/> could in theory <pause dur="0.3"/> form any number of angles in relation to that peptide bond <pause dur="2.4"/> i'm sure as you know in fact <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> there are relatively few angles <pause dur="0.3"/> that are allowed <pause dur="0.4"/> on either side of that peptide bond <pause dur="1.5"/> and most of the angles are not allowed because they're sterically unfavourable <pause dur="0.3"/> they represent <pause dur="0.6"/> clashes interactions between <pause dur="0.5"/> the # side chains of amino acids <pause dur="0.5"/> or the side chains of amino acids and the and the polypeptide chain <pause dur="1.2"/> and so <pause dur="0.4"/> the confirmations of the bonds <pause dur="0.3"/> on either side of the peptide bond can actually <pause dur="0.3"/> only form <pause dur="0.2"/> relatively few <pause dur="0.4"/> what are generally termed secondary structures <pause dur="2.1"/> the one with the largest scope is the is the beta sheet <pause dur="0.7"/> # i should say that <pause dur="0.2"/> psi and phi are of course the they're the names of the two bonds on either side of the peptide bond you don't really <pause dur="0.2"/> need to know that <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.9"/> but for a beta sheet <pause dur="0.4"/> those psi and phi angles suggest that the only <pause dur="0.3"/> the favourable <pause dur="0.2"/> energetic confirmation <pause dur="0.8"/> # for the side chains of these amino acids <pause dur="0.2"/> would be <pause dur="0.2"/> if 
they were essentially opposed <pause dur="0.3"/> on either side <pause dur="0.3"/> of the peptide bond <pause dur="0.6"/> and so they alternate <pause dur="0.5"/> on either side of the peptide bond <pause dur="1.2"/> # beta sheets # the that # opposition of # side chains allows for extensive <pause dur="0.3"/> hydrogen bonding between <pause dur="0.5"/> separate polypeptide chains that are in the beta sheet <pause dur="0.3"/> confirmation <pause dur="0.7"/> and i'm actually not really going to talk much more about beta sheets that's not because i don't think they're important <pause dur="0.4"/> # # or indeed have medically relevant examples it's just there isn't <trunc>s</trunc> time <pause dur="0.4"/> within this lecture to really go into beta sheet structures <pause dur="0.3"/> other than to describe <pause dur="0.7"/> # the Ramachandran conditions <pause dur="1.2"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> obviously there are very <pause dur="0.3"/> pertinent examples indeed the transition between alpha helical structures and beta pleated sheet structures is pathological in various diseases such as Alzheimer's that's that ameloid <pause dur="0.4"/> transition <pause dur="1.8"/> the second set of allowed angles <pause dur="0.5"/> on either side of the peptide bond are essentially <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> offset by about i think about # a hundred-and-ten 
a hundred-and-twenty degrees <pause dur="0.9"/> and the only way you can conceptualize the arrangement of side chains in a polypeptide that are offset like that is if they're essentially rotating and that gives you <pause dur="0.3"/> the <trunc>i</trunc> notion that that would be a helix <pause dur="1.0"/> you can see there there's one small <pause dur="0.4"/> area that's allowed if van der Waals' radii <pause dur="0.2"/> radii are taken to be a little smaller <pause dur="0.3"/> and that's a left-handed helix <pause dur="0.5"/> and we'll talk about that <pause dur="0.9"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> and generally <pause dur="0.4"/> # most amino acids <pause dur="0.2"/> fall into these Ramachandran rules Ramachandran was of course a <pause dur="0.3"/> Indian mathematician who who who # worked out these rules <pause dur="0.3"/> # for a secondary structure <pause dur="0.5"/> in the # turn of the <trunc>s</trunc> turn of last century now <pause dur="0.9"/> using both mathematical principles and # models of peptides <pause dur="1.0"/> the only amino acid that can be found in <pause dur="0.3"/> virtually any <pause dur="0.5"/> angle confirmation <pause dur="0.5"/> is # is glycine of course and that's because it's secondary <pause dur="0.3"/> # it's # sorry side chains of course hydrogen <pause dur="2.6"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> so most proteins contain <pause dur="0.3"/> alpha helix and indeed some <pause dur="0.2"/> are nearly all alpha 
helix <pause dur="0.4"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> things like myoglobin and haemoglobin <pause dur="0.2"/> are predominantly alpha helical <pause dur="0.4"/> indeed the <pause dur="0.3"/> structures the parts of the protein that are not alpha helices <pause dur="0.3"/> in myoglobin and haemoglobin <pause dur="0.4"/> are involved in turning <pause dur="0.8"/> the molecule back on itself <pause dur="0.3"/> to give <pause dur="0.2"/> the very characteristic compacted <pause dur="0.5"/> shapes of those molecules <pause dur="1.7"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> so i'm sure that <pause dur="0.8"/> oh <pause dur="0.5"/> if anybody's struggling with their right-handed and left-handed helices that's what that's <pause dur="0.2"/> there for <pause dur="1.6"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> so this then is an actual alpha helix <pause dur="2.4"/> we can see that # <pause dur="1.2"/> the side chains are nicely arrayed <pause dur="0.4"/> to the outside of the helix on <kinesic desc="indicates point on slide" iterated="n"/> this side and on <kinesic desc="indicates point on slide" iterated="n"/> this side <pause dur="0.5"/> # that # it being it it being right-handed it pitches essentially from # # from the left towards the right upwards <pause dur="0.5"/> # in this particular helices you can see that there's essentially hydrophobic <pause dur="0.7"/> side chains on <kinesic desc="indicates point on slide" iterated="n"/> this side <pause dur="0.5"/> and <pause dur="0.3"/> # charged side chains on <kinesic desc="indicates point on slide" iterated="n"/> this side and this gives you an idea as to the orientation <pause dur="0.2"/> potentially <pause dur="0.2"/> of that helix in a protein <pause dur="0.3"/> obviously the hydrophobic side would be inward-facing <pause dur="0.5"/> 
the hydro<pause dur="0.4"/>philic side <pause dur="0.3"/> would be facing towards the aqueous environment <pause dur="1.3"/> you can see on the top there the <pause dur="0.2"/> how the # <pause dur="1.3"/> the # side chains essentially <pause dur="0.2"/> overlap and the <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.9"/> array themselves such they're approximately four residues apart as they go up <pause dur="0.7"/> the side of the helix <pause dur="1.4"/> so that's as i said there's approximately three-and-a-half amino acids per turn <pause dur="1.7"/> and also you can see that the helices <pause dur="0.3"/> this arrangement of helices <pause dur="0.3"/> allows for hydrogen bonding within the chain <pause dur="1.1"/> so interchain hydrogen bonding and this helps stabilize the structure and it's why helical structures are so <pause dur="0.4"/> <trunc>oft</trunc> alpha helical structure energetically very favourable <pause dur="5.7"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> so if we look at the primary <pause dur="0.6"/> so the the the notion that there's periodicity or there appears to be certain periodicity <pause dur="0.2"/> in helices allows you to look at the primary structure <pause dur="0.2"/> and make predictions <pause dur="0.3"/> as to <pause dur="0.3"/> # what the secondary structure is most likely to be <pause dur="0.3"/> there is frequently periodicity <pause dur="0.2"/> in amino acid sequences <pause dur="0.3"/> # and certain amino acids are indeed 
preferred in helices <pause dur="0.2"/> yet others are not preferred in helices <pause dur="0.6"/> glycine isn't preferred in helices and proline as you know is a <pause dur="0.5"/> an amino acid that will essentially kink <pause dur="0.4"/> a polypeptide chain that won't be found in <pause dur="0.3"/> helices <pause dur="4.7"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> so this then demonstrates with that helices i was just showing you that the <pause dur="0.2"/> indeed the <pause dur="0.4"/> the polar residues <pause dur="0.4"/> # the sorry the non-polar residues are in the centre of the myoglobin molecule <pause dur="0.5"/> and the polar residues are arrayed on the surface <pause dur="0.8"/> aiding the solubility of myoglobin <pause dur="2.4"/> and in now allowing myoglobin and indeed haemoglobin as it's since it's very <trunc>r</trunc> closely related to myoglobin to # <pause dur="1.6"/> be in solution at relatively high concentration <pause dur="3.9"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> so this of course is what we are really going to talk about today <pause dur="0.9"/> myoglobin and haemoglobin <pause dur="8.7"/> this then shows the arrangement <pause dur="2.0"/> of the secondary structure <trunc>wi</trunc> in myoglobin which is <trunc>predo</trunc> predominantly alpha helical <pause dur="0.4"/> into the globin fold so that would be its tertiary structure <pause dur="1.6"/> and the tertiary structure <pause dur="0.2"/> is essentially an 
arrangement of eight <pause dur="0.5"/> alpha helices <pause dur="0.4"/> in globins <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> labelled A to H <kinesic desc="indicates point on slide" iterated="n"/> this was A <pause dur="0.5"/> <kinesic desc="indicates point on slide" iterated="n"/> B and C are behind here <kinesic desc="indicates point on slide" iterated="n"/> this is D <pause dur="0.5"/> <kinesic desc="indicates point on slide" iterated="n"/> this is E <pause dur="0.6"/> <kinesic desc="indicates point on slide" iterated="n"/> this is F <pause dur="0.4"/> <kinesic desc="indicates point on slide" iterated="n"/> this is G <pause dur="0.6"/> and <kinesic desc="indicates point on slide" iterated="n"/> this is H <pause dur="2.3"/> you can also see that in myoglobin it has a prosthetic group <pause dur="0.3"/> that's <kinesic desc="indicates point on slide" iterated="n"/> this red molecule here <pause dur="2.2"/> and this prosthetic group <pause dur="0.3"/> is essentially held in position <pause dur="0.4"/> in a myoglobin in a <pause dur="0.3"/> in a <trunc>r</trunc> in a a reasonable cleft or fold that helps protect that prosthetic group from oxidation <pause dur="1.6"/> and <trunc>m</trunc> and the prosthetic group haem <pause dur="0.5"/> of course is held in position <pause dur="0.4"/> by two histidine residues <pause dur="0.9"/> histidine <pause dur="0.7"/> E-seven <pause dur="0.2"/> and histidine F-eight so it's <pause dur="0.4"/> the seventh residue in the <pause dur="1.1"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> E helix and the eighth residue in the F helix <pause dur="1.7"/> you can see that <pause dur="0.6"/> the F-eight histidine appears to be quite close to the haem group <pause dur="0.8"/> the <pause dur="0.6"/> E <pause dur="0.2"/> histidine appears a little bit further away <pause dur="0.7"/> so the F-<pause dur="0.3"/>eight histidine is called the proximal histidine <pause dur="1.1"/> and the E-seven histidine is called the distal histidine <pause dur="9.5"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> so what we are going to talk about today of course is the binding of oxygen to myoglobin and 
haemoglobin <pause dur="1.9"/> we'll talk about the functions of myoglobin and haemoglobin <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> myoglobin acts as essentially as an oxygen store in muscle <pause dur="1.9"/> and it you'll see that its structure is entirely consistent with its function <pause dur="0.6"/> # whereas haemoglobin which is of course oxygen transport for transporting oxygen from the lungs to the tissues <pause dur="0.4"/> we'll talk about the factors affecting oxygen binding <pause dur="2.7"/> transport of carbon dioxide and P-H regulation <pause dur="7.9"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> when we consider the binding of oxygen to haemoglobin and indeed myoglobin we'll <pause dur="0.6"/> perhaps worth considering what atmospheric oxygen <pause dur="0.5"/> # the <pause dur="0.2"/> partial pressure <unclear>axle</unclear> <pause dur="0.2"/> atmospheric oxygen is around about a hundred-and-fifty <trunc>m</trunc> millimetres of mercury or twenty <pause dur="0.3"/> sometimes referred to as twenty pascals in other textbooks <pause dur="1.7"/> a significant proportion of that <pause dur="0.5"/> enters into the wet surface of the lungs providing of course those <pause dur="0.6"/> # lung surfaces are wet if they're not for whatever reason <pause dur="0.4"/> then you do not get efficient exchange between the atmospheric 
oxygen <pause dur="0.9"/> and the lung mucosa <pause dur="1.4"/> of the oxygen that dissolves into the <pause dur="0.5"/> lung mucosa <pause dur="0.4"/> the majority of that is taken up <pause dur="0.5"/> into the blood <pause dur="0.2"/> through exchange in the lungs <pause dur="4.7"/> oxygen then is # the blood is then circulated oxygenated by this circulated in the tissues <pause dur="0.6"/> and <pause dur="0.4"/> a relatively small proportion <pause dur="0.3"/> perhaps less certainly less than fifty per cent of <pause dur="0.2"/> oxygenated haemoglobin <pause dur="0.3"/> a relatively small proportion of the oxygen it carries is unloaded into the tissues <pause dur="1.6"/> carbon dioxide is picked up from the <trunc>o</trunc> <pause dur="0.3"/> from the active tissues and that's transported back via the blood <pause dur="0.3"/> back to the lungs <pause dur="0.7"/> and then back <pause dur="0.3"/> # in exchange back into the <pause dur="0.8"/> air that we breathe <pause dur="1.5"/> so one of the <pause dur="0.2"/> first factors that's going to affect <pause dur="0.6"/> the <pause dur="0.4"/> binding of oxygen to haemoglobin <pause dur="0.4"/> is the efficient physiology <kinesic desc="indicates point on slide" iterated="n"/> here at <pause dur="0.2"/> at the lung <pause dur="1.3"/> # circulation interface <pause dur="1.4"/> another more subtle perhaps <pause dur="0.2"/> # notion is that it all relies on the fact that atmospheric oxygen is <pause dur="0.7"/> what i said is up there <pause dur="0.6"/> and of course there are certain conditions when it's not for 
example altitude <pause dur="1.7"/> and <pause dur="0.4"/> that the lungs are # <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> functioning efficiently <pause dur="0.2"/> that the circulation is functioning efficiently you can see that of the <pause dur="0.4"/> oxygen that dissolves into the wet surface <pause dur="0.3"/> the majority of it is taken up by the lung <pause dur="0.2"/> by <pause dur="0.2"/> by the blood in the lungs <pause dur="1.2"/> so this is a fairly <pause dur="0.3"/> this is working to almost its maximum efficiency <trunc>n</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> at <pause dur="0.2"/> at this point and anything <pause dur="0.3"/> that affects that <pause dur="0.4"/> well it ultimately affects <pause dur="0.4"/> oxygenation of the tissues <pause dur="4.4"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> so the rate at which you breathe <pause dur="1.0"/> the so-called ventilation rate and the perfusion of the lungs I-E how much blood is passing through the lungs at any given time <pause dur="0.7"/> # must be matched <pause dur="0.4"/> that's called a ventilation and perfusion match <pause dur="0.9"/> and the ratio must be approximately four litres of breathing per minute and five litres of blood per minute passing through the lungs giving you a ventilation <pause dur="0.4"/> perfusion match of point-eight <pause dur="2.2"/> anything that impears impairs breathing such as a a crushed chest <pause dur="0.9"/> a deflated lung <pause dur="0.9"/> chronic lung disorder <pause dur="0.9"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> somebody <pause dur="0.3"/> making 
the <kinesic desc="puts hand round throat" iterated="n"/> universal choking sign <pause dur="0.7"/> # will affect <pause dur="0.2"/> the amount of oxygen that's <pause dur="0.2"/> that's breathed that they're that they're <pause dur="0.2"/> able to <pause dur="0.4"/> obtain <pause dur="1.3"/> obviously if they have a problem with their blood flow <pause dur="0.7"/> like they're bleeding from <pause dur="0.5"/> a large artery in the leg <pause dur="0.4"/> will ultimately affect <pause dur="0.4"/> their oxygenation of their tissues but under those conditions i suggest you're more focused on the leg issue <pause dur="1.0"/> # at least initially <pause dur="0.2"/> and of course this relates to <pause dur="0.4"/> the A B C of <pause dur="0.2"/> first aid in many respects <pause dur="0.3"/> airway breathing <pause dur="0.2"/> circulation <pause dur="2.6"/> and any <pause dur="0.3"/> mismatch in ventilation or perfusion <pause dur="0.2"/> will ultimately lower <pause dur="0.4"/> the amount <pause dur="0.3"/> of oxygen <pause dur="0.2"/> in the arterial blood <pause dur="1.2"/> so that reveals to you <pause dur="0.2"/> that there's a problem with oxygen <pause dur="0.2"/> oxygenation <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> <pause dur="4.7"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> so accepting that <pause dur="0.6"/> the lungs are working properly and there's the right the correct concentration of atmospheric oxygen <pause dur="0.5"/> we can then go back and and think about the binding of oxygen to haemoglobin and and myoglobin <pause dur="1.5"/><kinesic desc="indicates point on slide" iterated="n"/> this is the haem <pause dur="1.1"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> prosthetic group found in myoglobin and haemoglobin <pause dur="0.6"/> it's made up of the the carbony 
bit it's called the protoporphyrin and in the middle there is <pause dur="0.6"/> iron <pause dur="1.1"/> the ferrous iron <pause dur="0.4"/> that's iron two-plus <pause dur="0.9"/> the as i said the hydrophobic fold <pause dur="0.6"/> of myoglobin and haemoglobin protects oxidation of that iron <pause dur="0.4"/> if that iron does become oxygenated # <pause dur="0.2"/> oxidized it can no longer bind oxygen <pause dur="1.4"/> so in that and in that case it's <pause dur="0.2"/> that would be referred to as a met-myoglobin or a met-haemoglobin that's iron <pause dur="0.5"/> in the <pause dur="0.2"/> three-plus oxidation state <pause dur="1.9"/> the iron can make six coordination bonds it makes four <pause dur="0.4"/> with nitrogens <pause dur="0.3"/> that are in the pyrrole group <pause dur="0.9"/> it makes one <pause dur="0.2"/> with the <trunc>pro</trunc> with the nitrogen in the proximal <pause dur="0.7"/> histidine <pause dur="0.6"/> and the last one <pause dur="0.4"/> is for the binding of oxygen as i'll show you <pause dur="0.3"/> and essentially <kinesic desc="indicates point on slide" iterated="n"/> this molecule <pause dur="0.7"/> is planar <pause dur="0.3"/> in isolation <pause dur="5.7"/> so this then <pause dur="0.5"/> # puts the haem then in context of those two histidines <pause dur="2.1"/> # you can see here the proximal <pause dur="0.5"/> # histidine providing the <trunc>s</trunc> the fifth coordination point for the iron <pause dur="0.9"/> and oxygen is able to intercede between the <pause dur="0.5"/> the distal <pause dur="0.5"/> nitrogen in the histidine <pause dur="0.4"/> 
and that provides the binding site for oxygen to <pause dur="0.8"/> <trunc>h</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> to haemoglobin <pause dur="0.2"/> or indeed myoglobin <pause dur="1.5"/> and in this case <pause dur="0.2"/> in the presence of oxygen you can see that the <pause dur="0.3"/> haem <pause dur="0.6"/> remains planar <pause dur="0.8"/> and and i'll explain why that's important in a little while <pause dur="2.1"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> the other thing i want to point out is about # carbon monoxide <pause dur="1.0"/> isolated haem <pause dur="0.5"/> has a very strong affinity for carbon monoxide <pause dur="0.3"/> much more <pause dur="0.4"/> # # much stronger than it does for oxygen <pause dur="0.7"/> but haem <pause dur="0.3"/> in the presence of protein such as myoglobin or haemoglobin <pause dur="0.4"/> there are <trunc>r</trunc> the <pause dur="0.2"/> the differential between the affinities for carbon dioxide <pause dur="0.5"/> and <pause dur="0.6"/> oxygen is reduced such that it goes from twenty-five-thousand times difference in <pause dur="0.3"/> isolated haem <pause dur="0.4"/> to two-hundred times different <pause dur="0.6"/> in the context of the protein so the protein plays an important role <pause dur="0.4"/> in hopefully limiting the effects of carbon dioxide <pause dur="1.1"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> the reason <pause dur="0.6"/> that that's important is of course is firstly carbon dioxide is the single most <pause dur="0.3"/> # single <pause dur="0.4"/> biggest <pause dur="0.4"/> metabolic poison <pause dur="1.5"/> it's far more potent and there are far more deaths 
from carbon monoxide than there are for any other metabolic poisons that might <pause dur="0.2"/> cyanide for example <pause dur="5.7"/> and carbon monoxide <pause dur="0.7"/> obviously actively competes <pause dur="0.2"/> for oxygen binding sites <pause dur="4.1"/> normally <pause dur="0.3"/> # the # when once carbon monoxide is bound to haemoglobin or <pause dur="0.4"/> to haemoglobin it will be referred to as <trunc>carb</trunc> carboxyhaemoglobin <pause dur="1.7"/> and there is a small percentage of <trunc>carboxyhaem</trunc> haemoglobin in our blood normally <pause dur="1.4"/> in smokers for example that percentage goes up to about fifteen per cent <pause dur="1.5"/> and around thirty per cent it's a medical emergency <pause dur="0.7"/> and around fifty per cent you're probably going to die <pause dur="1.5"/> so carboxyhaemoglobin <pause dur="0.4"/> is a significant <pause dur="0.3"/> problem <pause dur="1.0"/> because it's able to <pause dur="0.2"/> effectively reduce <pause dur="0.3"/> the oxygen <trunc>ca</trunc> carrying capacity <pause dur="0.7"/> of blood <pause dur="6.2"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> so now let's just think a little bit about this <pause dur="2.9"/> planar haem molecule <pause dur="10.9"/> this is the proximal histidine <pause dur="0.3"/> here's the planar haem molecule in the presence of oxygen <pause dur="1.7"/> in this form <kinesic desc="indicates point on slide" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.4"/> haemoglobin or myoglobin would be referred to as relaxed <pause dur="1.7"/> when it becomes deoxygenated <pause dur="0.6"/> the

the ends here <pause dur="1.8"/> free hydroxyls from <trunc>l</trunc> # <pause dur="0.2"/> free hydroxyls <pause dur="0.2"/> free hydroxylysines <pause dur="0.2"/> or indeed lysines <pause dur="0.2"/> are covalently linked <pause dur="0.3"/> across <pause dur="0.8"/> these <pause dur="0.6"/> triple helices <pause dur="3.5"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> this gives you an idea actually this is a lysine cross link <pause dur="0.6"/> to form a so-called shift base <pause dur="2.4"/> you don't really <pause dur="0.3"/> you just need to know that that's a covalent link you don't really need to worry about the <trunc>f</trunc> the <pause dur="0.6"/> <trunc>fan</trunc> fascinating structure of a shift base <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> nevertheless <pause dur="0.6"/> there is another disease associated with the <pause dur="0.6"/> improper cross-linking of collagen and that's called lathyrism <pause dur="2.4"/> inhibition of lysyl oxidase the <trunc>cro</trunc> the collagen cross-linking enzyme <pause dur="1.3"/> by found <pause dur="0.4"/> this compound's found in sweet pea so although sweet pea of course is a <pause dur="0.5"/> very good source of vitamin C <pause dur="0.2"/> it's not necessarily the best cure for scurvy <pause dur="0.4"/> because actually what you do is you inhibit the lysyl oxidase <pause dur="1.2"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> okay and again <pause dur="2.2"/> a collagen disease where dislocations of the joints <pause dur="0.2"/> and vascular problems <pause dur="1.7"/> are associated with the disease <pause dur="2.7"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> all of those diseases represent loss <pause dur="0.3"/> of function <pause dur="1.7"/> 
but gain of function or <pause dur="0.3"/> deposition of collagen <pause dur="0.2"/> can be <trunc>le</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> can be equally as dangerous <pause dur="0.6"/> it's referred to medically as fibrosis <pause dur="2.9"/> in <trunc>exa</trunc> for example in a medical student liver <pause dur="0.2"/> being constantly abused by alcohol scarred <pause dur="0.6"/> collagen is busily being deposited in <pause dur="0.2"/> that gentleman up there who's <pause dur="0.2"/><vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" n="sl" dur="1"/> <pause dur="0.4"/> busy partying every night <pause dur="0.6"/> and # <pause dur="1.9"/> that can result in impaired liver function <pause dur="0.9"/> similarly in the heart fibrosis of the heart tissue is going to result in severe <pause dur="0.5"/> # reduction in the efficiency of the heart in stroke volume and so on <pause dur="1.3"/> and that and that # again <pause dur="1.4"/> serious # complication <pause dur="0.6"/> lung fibrosis is quite interesting and and of course <pause dur="0.7"/> lung fibrosis is going to dramatically reduce the oxygen uptake <pause dur="0.5"/> the oxygen uptake ability of the lungs <pause dur="0.4"/> and lung fibrosis is frequently caused <pause dur="0.6"/> # in <pause dur="0.3"/> it's frequently found in patients in long term stay in hospital <pause dur="1.7"/> and can be induced <pause dur="0.3"/> indeed quite rapidly by certain drug treatments as well so you can <pause dur="0.2"/> you can treat patients with certain drugs and 
all of a sudden <pause dur="0.3"/> you induce lung <trunc>fun</trunc> fibrosis and it's a very serious problem <pause dur="1.2"/> so both loss of function and gain of function of collagen <pause dur="0.4"/> are serious <pause dur="0.3"/> medical issues <pause dur="5.3"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> in the main we've talked about these fibrillar collagens and the # the # notion that they're <pause dur="0.9"/> they're of course involved in ligaments tendons in the architecture of joints <pause dur="0.5"/> # that they are <pause dur="0.7"/> in in <pause dur="0.2"/> in those cases they're complex molecules they contain fibrillar collagens microfibrils they contain collagens that are <trunc>is</trunc> just <pause dur="0.2"/> there to be associated <pause dur="0.2"/> with the fibril <pause dur="1.4"/> other collagens <pause dur="0.3"/> and <trunc>du</trunc> generally these collagens will be much more heavily glycosylated <pause dur="0.2"/> form branch structures <pause dur="0.5"/> they form <pause dur="0.6"/> meshworks <pause dur="0.2"/> that are involved in the formation of basement membranes which <pause dur="0.2"/> endothelial layers <pause dur="0.4"/> grow on the when on which fibroblast <pause dur="0.6"/> layers will grow <pause dur="2.9"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> right well should just say as well of course in in this case the extracellular matrix is not just collagen it's associated with a lot of other proteins proteoglycans <pause dur="0.4"/> # glycoproteins <pause dur="0.3"/> and the 
various elastins <pause dur="0.4"/> and <pause dur="1.5"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> it's the elastin gene <pause dur="0.5"/> which there's only one <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> # gene # one elastin gene <pause dur="0.2"/> that's mutated in Marfan <pause dur="2.5"/> it's similar to collagen it has this glycine and proline <pause dur="0.7"/> rich sequence <pause dur="1.0"/> has # <pause dur="0.4"/> more valine in it <pause dur="0.3"/> it's essentially very hydrophobic <pause dur="1.6"/> it <pause dur="0.2"/> it # <pause dur="0.3"/> it's <trunc>le</trunc> much less post-translationally modified than is collagen <pause dur="0.2"/> it has very little secondary <trunc>struc</trunc> recognisable secondary structure perhaps that's consistent with its # more elastic properties <pause dur="0.9"/> it is cross-linked in the same way as collagen is by the lysyl oxidase <pause dur="2.6"/> and it's mutations in that fibrillin gene <pause dur="0.4"/> that make up elastin fibres <pause dur="0.2"/> that are responsible <pause dur="0.4"/> for the Marfan <pause dur="0.5"/> syndrome <pause dur="3.2"/> and quite characteristically the Marfans are tall <pause dur="0.6"/> they have # <pause dur="0.2"/> long limbs <pause dur="0.2"/> arachnodactyly which is spidery long fingers <pause dur="0.6"/> and the thing that # <pause dur="0.4"/> alerted <pause dur="0.4"/> Carter was the <pause dur="0.2"/> <trunc>pec</trunc> pectus excavatum which essentially means a slightly sunken chest <pause dur="5.4"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> so <pause dur="1.5"/> in just about an hour we have reviewed protein structure <pause dur="1.1"/> we've talked about the 
binding regulation of the binding of oxygen to haemoglobin and myoglobin and we've even <pause dur="0.3"/> watched telly and done the collagen diseases <pause dur="0.4"/> you will notice at the end of your lecture handout <pause dur="0.4"/> that there are a few <trunc>sli</trunc> there are a few slides i've included about # <pause dur="0.3"/> the molecular basis <pause dur="0.6"/> of the contraction of muscle <pause dur="0.5"/> something that we <pause dur="0.2"/> don't have time to cover <pause dur="0.8"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> in this series and something i suggest you use your hour <pause dur="0.8"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> now <kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> to have a little brief look at and familiarize yourself with <pause dur="0.3"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> in particular <pause dur="0.8"/> the basic <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> apparatus that's involved in skeletal <pause dur="1.1"/> smooth and cardiac muscle that regulates the contraction <pause dur="0.6"/> and even a little bit on how to recognize what a skeletal muscle cell looks like <pause dur="0.3"/> compared to a smooth muscle cell <pause dur="0.5"/> compared to a cardiac muscle <pause dur="1.0"/> okay <pause dur="0.9"/> so we're done for the <pause dur="0.3"/> the groups that have got to go i suggest you go if there's anybody who wants to come and ask me something come down when <pause dur="0.3"/> when <pause dur="0.2"/> the first group have <pause dur="0.3"/> got away
