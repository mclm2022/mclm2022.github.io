<u who="nm5197">okay i'm going to # work with you now for about an hour and i'm going to talk with you about trauma now this is not a lecture and i'm not going to stand here and lecture you at all i'm going to try and encourage you to talk with me so that we can develop and understand some basic principles that's why i want you all to sit down here so we're part of a little group and there'll be some fun activities for you to take part in as well now i've got some of your colleagues helping me and # we've picked a couple of patients who i think reflect # two different aspects of trauma one patient who had a hip fracture and one patient who was run over by a truck and we're going to talk about those two patients not to talk about how they were treated but rather to understand the disease that they had and you should start thinking right now about trauma as being a disease something which has risk factors something which has causes and etiology something which can be measured in the population something that can be diagnosed so we're going to speak about trauma as a disease and we'll focus <trunc>o</trunc>  in the two cases on some of the etiological factors and some of the aspects of diagnosis and initial assessment so Tim why don't you begin</u>
<u who="sm5198">sorry can we have the machine on please <vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" dur="2"/> it would help hi everybody that's me wiggling my hips # i'm going to present a case to you on hip fracture # a very nice ninety year old lady # and this is the A and E A and E assessment that was performed and # documented the incident on the twenty-ninth of April this year she had a fall while she was walking and experienced some left-sided hip pain and she was categorised into the yellow category of in triage which is not that severe and at this point it wouldn't be irrational to assume that she'd suffered from a neck of femur fracture given that it's the most prevalent one whoops so here was the history # presenting complaint just painful left hip # if we delve into that a little bit more she tripped off the bus in town # and she fell onto her left side # she experienced immediate pain in her left hip without loss of consciousness drowsiness or nausea # she was unable to mobilise or weight bear on that leg and she denied any pins and needles and other symptoms so her past medical history we know that she's got osteoporosis she's had that for many years # she suffered a fracture before # namely a left proximal humeral fracture in October in last year she's an known hypertensive hypothyroid suffers from a hiatus hernia she's depressed and gets the occasional stress incontinence so just to give you an insight into osteoporosis # the definition is that it's a disease characterised by low bone mass and microarchitectural deterioration of bone tissue leading to enhanced bone fragility and an increase in future risk of fracture # and it's important to note that # the deficiency lies in the quantity and the quality and the structural integrity of the bone and # not in the mineralization of the bone which we call osteomalacia and you can actually see in this graph here # if we consider Mrs M's case she's over eighty-five she's ninety years old so she's going to be on the brown line of that graph her femur bone mineral density is likely to be less than six-hundred and so her percentage risk of a hip fracture is going to be edging towards about thirty per cent but we'd need to confirm this on a dexa bone scan # obviously in fracture patients it's important to consider all the social implications # just initially # she's not smoked she doesn't drink excessively and she has a good diet these factors are essentially important because smoking actually accelerates bone loss and can negate the benefits of oestrogen therapy like accelerating oestrogen metabolism # diet i'm particularly interested in the intake of calories vitamin D and calcium here # it's actually recommended in post-menopausal women to be consuming fifteen-hundred milligrams of calcium daily and between four-hundred and eight-hundred I-Us of vitamin D which is quite sort of sufficient isn't it # normally goes into town once a week if you just read through that where's it say that yeah only daughter lives close by and takes her out weekly in the car unfortunately on this occasion her daughter was on holiday and that's why Mrs M went into town by herself on the bus # so her family work full-time she has an upstairs bedroom which is going to have profound implications on her management she lives alone in the three bedroom house # she was receiving day care but she cannot afford that anymore # and she was mobilising with one stick before so we'd like to get her back on her feet these are the risk factors that can be grouped into skeletal and fall related variables # and as you can see Mrs M is clearly disadvantaged already because she's # got osteoporosis so bone mass microarchitecture already down she's post-menopausal she's a female she's white # and she's had a previous fall before # however she's hypothyroid so she's likely to be overweight which she is and # her low body weight is likely to be her increased body weight's likely to be protective in the future # so that's one of the advantages # she's also relatively mobile she doesn't sort of run about but she does go into town a couple of times a week # she's never smoked never consumed alcohol in excess so we can # disregard the fall related ones as well # drug history the obviously ramipril ACE inhibitor paroxetine SSRI she's on detrusitol for her incontinence thyroxine fifty milligrams and ranitidine for a hiatus hernia but the fosamax is really what we need to home in on here that's alendronate and is a <trunc>bisphosph</trunc>  sorry bisphosphate so if i just talk you through what bisphosphonates are they're actually # designer drugs based on the naturally occurring pyrophosphate molecule # now when they found pyrophosphates they were actually searching for an agent that would prevent # calcification in soft tissues and they found pyrophosphate inhibited crystallisation in the urine # pyrophosphate is actually cleaved by alkaline phosphatase # and that prevents it from gaining access to the bone collagen # in the case of the bisphosphonates you can substitute an oxygen in place of a carbon # in the pyrophosphate molecule which renders it # resistant to cleavage by the alkaline phosphatase enzyme so therefore enabling it to attach to calcium containing crystals in the bone and therefore increasing the bone mass in both the cortical and the trabecular bone the fist bisphosphonate noted was etidronate but that tends not to be used now because it can actually cause osteomalacia due to # osteoclastic effects as well so role in osteoporosis of the bisphosphonates is # in osteoporosis corticosteroid-induced osteoporosis Paget's disease and hypercalcaemia of malignancy the next slide # just to show you how alendronate actually has it's actions # you can see on the spine and the hip that it's improved the bone mineral density and in this study the dose was actually doubled after <trunc>y</trunc>  after two years the # graph down in the bottom there the two of those graphs the NTX and the BSAP are biochemical markers that are released # during times of bone resorption that will the N-telopeptide and bone formation which is the bone specific alkaline phosphatase and you can see improvements in both those markers there with the alendronate observations and examination # general observations # patient was comfortable this is obviously following the A and E assessment # no pallor cyanosis no jaundice no lymphadenopathy and neck <trunc>mo</trunc> mobility was fine mouth was opening thyroid was normal # her left leg was shortened and externally rotated and as i'm sure you'll all be able to tell me it's due to the action of the quadriceps specifically the rectus femoris the adductors and the hamstrings which pull the leg in that sort of position # it's important to test for the pedal pulse there because fractures of the neck of the femur can cause # avascular necrosis because of the way that the medial circumflex artery goes around the neck of the femur into the head so the plan the most important thing there really is the X-ray just random bloods done as well and transfer to the orthopaedic ward # i've got the X-ray to show you actually we're looking in this area here obviously any guesses</u>
<u who="su5219">intertrochanteric</u>
<u who="sm5198">no it's not actually sorry <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/><vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" dur="2"/> it's a subtrochanteric fracture of the left femur and here's one i made earlier i got off the internet because that one wasn't particularly good # that's actually a spiral fracture of the femur as well just to point out that's not really relevant in her case there we go subtrochanteric fracture of left femur what did they do about it she had surgery pre-operatively they checked her haemoglobin cross-matching obviously important if she has # a bleed U's and E's requested starve from midnight # she was given local anaesthesia and consent was requested so that's a cross-section of the hip joint there and if there's any surgical boffins out there i'm just going to read through the approach that was taken not that i quite understand it so it's a lateral approach was favoured and they reflected the vastus lateralis <trunc>m</trunc> muscle which has it's proximal attachment on the greater trochanter and it's distal attachment on the patella and the patellar ligament going to the tibial tuberosity the trochanter was exposed and a guide wire was passed into the head and neck then using a triple reamer it was reamed to ninety millimetres tapped and then a <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> guide wire was inserted ninety-five millimetre DHS was passed through a hundred and thirty-five degrees and then a four hole plate was fixed with cortical <trunc>s</trunc>  cortical screws # and it was noted to be a stable fixation image films were obtained and found to be satisfactory although there was some rotation of the head and the neck fragment then obviously wash out and closing and staples to the skin that's # a reamer at the top there shooting into the bone post-operatively regular blood tests were done # she was mobilised for weight bearing clexane also known as enoxaparin is a low molecular weight heparin and that's used to prevent embolism analgesia was given morphine and co-codamol and she was discovered to be moderately anaemic so that warranted the administration of ferrous sulphate i just included senna and lactulose # not importantly but because of the opioid analgesia she was on she's obviously at risk of constipation # she is due to be going off to a rehabilitation hospital soon # where she will require rehabilitation physiotherapy and occupational therapy and they're really going to try and # mobilise her with one stick or possibly two sticks # i have been told by a physio that # walking with a frame isn't really getting an old lady into a normal straight back walking position so they will always try and get her to use her sticks okay # last slide prevention of hip fractures again divided into skeletal and fall related factors # you can see bang in the middle there oestrogen therapy in the form of HRT is of proven value # with regards to prevention of future fractures and # especially in post-menopausal woman the SERMs are selected oestrogen receptor modulators and they're under trial at the moment for stimulating receptors in the bone there by increasing the bone mass and they don't have the same effects on the endometrium as the HRT does # they've also they're also of benefit in lowering total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol and an example of an S-E-R-M is raloxifene the tibolone included there # combines oestrogenic # progestagenic and androgenic activities and it's indicated in the prophylaxis of osteoporosis quite a new therapy coming out # so obviously those are the drug choices for managing Mrs M's case in the future but # it's going to be essential to re-establish her mobility in the form of rehabilitation and # preferably getting her back onto sticks or soon there's going to be huge social implications her family all live quite far away and she's only <trunc>o</trunc> one daughter who lives close by # and hopefully she won't be going into town on the bus by herself again</u>
<u who="nm5197">so have you got any questions you'd like to ask Tim</u>
<u who="sm5198">bear in mind i'm doing dermatology at the moment i've just done my G-P casework</u>
<u who="nm5197">yeah so you've heard his presentation it was extremely interesting comprehensive did it # make you curious about anything </u>
<u who="sm5202">one of # Claire and i were in care of the elderly for our first place and he was mad he used to run around the wards and open up cardexes and see and make sure that all his old ladies were on vitamin D-three and calichew # do you know <trunc>wheth</trunc>  whether there's any point in # pre-menopausal women taking it as in like prophylactic prophylactic things or is there no point at all <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/><vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" dur="2"/></u>
<u who="sm5198">no # i don't see why not though vitamin D</u>
<u who="nm5197">does anyone know the answer to that </u>
<u who="sm5201">is peak bone mass like an important factor for osteoporosis </u>
<u who="nm5197">can you talk us through that</u>
<u who="sm5201">well i mean # like women pre-menopausally if they're taking vitamin D or or calcium will obviously have a higher peak bone mass so even if they don't take <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> are therefore predisposing themselves to fractures i can't really give you any more than that really</u>
<u who="sf5214"> but if you're getting adequate vitamin D and calcium in your diet then taking a supplement probably is just going to increase your bone density </u>
<u who="nm5197">so # this is exciting it sounds like we're talking a little bit about calcium metabolism so who's excited about that anyone over this side or is it only on that side you guys know a bit about calcium metabolism right all the girls in the audience here at what age is your bone <trunc>b</trunc>  bone mass at it's peak </u>
<u who="ss">thirty twenty-six </u>
<u who="nm5197">on this side only </u>
<u who="su5219">thirty</u>
<u who="nm5197">thirty about thirty someone else </u>
<u who="su5219">twenty-five twenty-six</u>
<u who="nm5197">right so you're talking about sort of # early adulthood and # in in the course of your whole life at least so that means that some of you are around about your peak bone mass now so it's all downhill from now on now the boys here what about your bone mass</u>
<u who="sm5203">pretty similar isn't it about twenty eight or something thirty</u>
<u who="nm5197">yeah any difference</u>
<u who="sm5203">oh yeah <trunc>m</trunc>  males have a greater than females anyway don't they</u>
<u who="nm5197">right any difference though in the profile of bone mass as it changes with time between men and woman</u>
<gap reason="inaudible" extent="uncertain"/>
<u who="nm5197">yeah we'll let you come in on this side go ahead</u>
<u who="sm5203">there's a reduced decline over time </u>
<u who="nm5197">yes it doesn't go down as much we said it gets to a higher peak</u>
<u who="sm5203"><gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> and # women live longer than men anyway don't they so # they've got like <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/></u>
<u who="nm5197">right so <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> so in fact # men and women both have an increase in bone mass as they get older # from childhood and then in their late twenties or thereabouts it reaches a peak and in men it's much higher than it is in women and then they decline roughly parallel until an event that only occurs in women menopause so women end up with a a lower bone mass than men but it's only been going down proportionately until menopause and then suddenly it just collapses and why's that</u>
<u who="ss">oestrogen</u>
<u who="nm5197">oestrogen or</u>
<gap reason="inaudible" extent="uncertain"/>
<u who="nm5197">the lack of oestrogen okay so oestrogen in women maintains bone mass we could take through the biochemistry of that but let's not so in women suddenly a lack of oestrogen causes collapse in bone mass and that's why oestrogen replacement therapy is proposed for the purposes of maintaining the bone mass okay so that's it now in men it reaches a peak which is # larger than in women but differs between men and what sort of factors might influence that </u>
<u who="su5219">race</u>
<u who="nm5197">race yes </u>
<u who="su5219">smoking</u>
<u who="nm5197">smoking that's not one i know about it could be makes sense maybe </u>
<u who="su5219">activity</u>
<u who="nm5197">activity yeah men who are physically active sports people people who do a lot of weight training they lay on a much large bone mass in fact exactly the same applies to women anything else </u>
<u who="sf5215">family history obesity</u>
<u who="nm5197">yeah clearly there are genetic factors as to how much bone mass you lay down obesity # that's interesting now i have a sort of theory that obese people carry more weight so they lay down more bone but they are also people who tend not to be physically active so they don't get as much muscle # work and that seems to sort of roughly balance out so being obese doesn't seem to make much difference</u>
<u who="sf5215">i thought that it was if you were obese you had more oestrogen and therefore you might actually be at an advantage</u>
<u who="nm5197">in women only or in men as well </u>
<u who="sf5215">no women</u>
<u who="nm5197">yeah i don't know that's interesting anyone got any information about that no i'd like to know that's interesting okay # so men who are active men who are # physically active men who are # # black have a higher bone mass # at peak what about vitamin D and calcium though you mentioned that earlier on </u>
<u who="sm5212">people who live in the dark or sort or cover themselves up could be at risk</u>
<u who="nm5197">i don't want to know about that you carry on so certainly people who are deficient in vitamin D or calcium will not lay down as much</u>
<u who="sm5212">nutrition</u>
<u who="nm5197">oh so nutrition okay major major very very important environmental factor that applies to lots and lots of people in the world and that brings us back to the women again and whether having vitamin D and calcium pre-menopausally could increase their peak bone mass anyone know of <trunc>a</trunc>  any evidence on that <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> asked that question </u>
<u who="sm5198">Paul</u>
<u who="sm5212">yeah i asked that originally</u>
<u who="nm5197">yeah do you of any</u>
<u who="sm5212">no <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> that's why i asked</u>
<u who="nm5197">there's been there's been some work that's investigated that and essentially the bottom line is that # vitamin D and calcium are both very cheap and so even a small benefit might be worth having but in fact that benefit hasn't been easy to show and it looks like at least in this country a great majority of people already max out on calcium and vitamin D in their diet and adding it to their diet doesn't provide any benefit there has been an argument that for some people living in this country particularly black people who tend to be more in in the north of England live in Scotland tend to be more likely to suffer vitamin D deficiency they might benefit and so widespread use might be indicated but it's not it's clearly not very important now what about vitamin D and calcium after menopause anyone know anything about that </u>
<u who="sf5216">well most women seem to be recommended to take it by their GP so i assume there's probably an evidence base </u>
<u who="nm5197">either that or a very strong pharmaceutical benefit to the pharmaceutical companies now actually there is quite good evidence but you should always think about that why would lots and lots of people be prescribed something is there good evidence to support that i mean many example of such mass prescribing that are not supported by good evidence but in this case there is reasonably good evidence that in this country again # women post-menopausally can benefit from vitamin D and calcium but the benefit is very small and so there's a massive prescribing going on for a very small benefit and the reason for that again is most people have an excellent diet but we're now talking about elderly people who were young and therefore at their peak bone mass often in around about the war years when diet was very poor and those people often had a low peak bone mass so they're more at risk so a small benefit in people at higher risk is worth having more than a small benefit in people at low risk we've done a bit of statistics haven't you you don't want me to talk about that do you but it that's the sort of time when thinking about relative risk and risk reduction and absolute risk reductions it starts to get interesting and that's where you'll need to remember all that statistics when you're working as a GP you start to answer the question should i prescribe this treatment routinely in my post-menopausal ladies </u>
<u who="sf5214">i can't remember what your list was for risk of falls but the same consultant that was giving a lot of vitamin D and calichews also on polypharmacy and he considered that did you ever come across this if a patient is on three or more drugs that's considered a risk of falls </u>
<u who="sm5198">sorry you were talking about the risk factors like on the vitamin D and calcium you're not talking about the thyroxine and the </u>
<u who="sf5214">not in terms of not on a biochemical level or any well in terms of her bones at all but </u>
<u who="sm5198">which which drugs are you talking about specifically then </u>
<u who="sf5214">any drugs just that if anyone's on any drug more than three drugs it's considered at risk of falls</u>
<u who="su5219">is it is</u>
<u who="sm5198">i just heard about cortical steroids i didn't really</u>
<u who="sf5214">yeah <trunc>a</trunc>  any drug any </u>
<u who="sm5198">i mean obviously in this sorry to cut you off</u>
<u who="sf5214">no no sorry i'm</u>
<u who="sm5198">in in this case you have treat her known hypertension and her hypothyroidism you can't just completely ignore that can you and by correcting the # those problems she's less likely to have a fall on the long run</u>
<u who="sf5214">yeah i just wondered if you came it all in your reading that <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/></u>
<u who="sm5198">no </u>
<u who="sf5216">is it clear which direction <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> in whether it's that that predisposes people to falls or whether it's the people who are taking who are needing that many drugs are also more likely to fall because they're iller anyway</u>
<u who="sf5214">well yeah but this i mean he would literally walk round the # the bays and slash drugs off</u>
<u who="su5219">right</u>
<u who="sf5214">off and then the next doctor would come along and put them all back on again thinking about that but yeah and then he would just stroke them off</u>
<u who="sf5217">i don't know about all of the drugs on the list but the anti-hypertensives can make you dizzy can make you hypertensive</u>
<gap reason="inaudible" extent="uncertain"/>
<u who="sm5198">i think it's difficult to actually tell if it's an iatrogenic cause of a fall of whether it's been caused by the underlying hypertension or whatever else the underlying pathology that's there i don't think you could really tell that</u>
<u who="nm5197">so let me just explore that for a moment # you're asking whether the fact that she's on six drugs or thereabouts is itself a cause</u>
<u who="sf5214">a risk </u>
<u who="nm5197">of her falling</u>
<u who="sf5214">of her falling </u>
<u who="nm5197">and that might therefore cause her to have a fracture</u>
<u who="sf5214">yeah</u>
<u who="nm5197">yeah and # between you you explored two possible scenarios either that is the case that the drugs themselves are causing her to fall and we've had some suggestions as to how drugs like anti-hypertensives might actually do that by making people dizzy or whether the fact that a person is on lots of drugs is a marker an indicator of the fact that they've got lots of physiological disease and therefore they might fall in that second situation what would you call all those diseases that they've got </u>
<u who="ss">co-morbidity</u>
<u who="nm5197">co-morbidities yes and you'd call them something else if you were thinking of what this association between having lots of drugs and falling might reflect </u>

<u who="su5219">compounding </u>
<u who="nm5197">okay someone's got it compound that's what i'm getting at yes so there are two possibilities you've got an association between having lots of drugs and falling then it may that there's a causal relationship between those that the drugs cause the falling and that would be very interesting because then if you could take some of those drugs away in other words be the doctor who slashes them out then maybe you'd stop the falling occurring on the other hand it may be that something you haven't thought of like a whole bunch of diseases are confounding factors and they're associated both with having lots of drugs and falling if that were the case then crossing out all the drugs won't get rid off the falls it won't reduce the falls and so the reason that i bring that up is that we're talking here about risk factors and whenever we talk about risk factors it's worth you thinking about how did anyone figure out what a risk factor was for a fall and i can tell you the studies you're talking about # describing on falling have been done by looking at large numbers of people and measuring the fall rates in groups of those people and then trying to find differences between those groups and if you find the difference between people who have less than three drugs and those who have more than three drugs in their prescription chart then you might say ah there's a association between polypharmacy and falling but then you always need to think as doctors and scientists you always need to think is that association causal or is it a reflection of confounding by something that the investigators didn't think about and it's when you think like that that you'll know whether it's right to be the doctor who slashes the drugs off the drug chart or whether it's right to be the doctor who goes around and treats each of the possible causes i don't know what the answer is maybe one of you will figure it out because i can tell you no-one knows the answer to that question at the moment okay i want to ask you a question Tim you showed thirty per cent risk of fracture in this lady in one of your graphs can you put that graph up again that's great just tell us what that thirty per cent risk is what do you mean by that</u>
<u who="sm5198">she's got a thirty per cent chance of having a another hip fracture specifically hip fractures</u>
<u who="nm5197">do any of you want to ask him any questions about that </u>
<u who="sf5214">is that in a long time or in ten years one year</u>
<u who="sm5198">in her lifetime i assume </u>
<u who="nm5197">no i think actually those numbers that you're looking at are risks per year and an eighty-five year old lady who has that bone mineral density which is extremely low does have about a thirty per cent risk of having a hip fracture in a year she doesn't have to have had a risk a hip fracture already in fact having had a hip fracture and having it fixed halves her risk of having a hip fracture because she's only got one hip now to fracture because the other one's been fixed with a metal plate that won't break so in fact if you go out into the population and measure bone mineral density then you can plot graphs like this of risk per year of having a hip fracture now we've got how many people in this country</u>
<u who="ss">sixty million</u>
<u who="nm5197">about sixty million a bit less and # lot of them are old # you know what the demographics look like probably but there's lots of old ladies among those fifty-nine million if i were to tell you there were about a hundred and fifty-thousand hip fractures a year in this country that won't come as a surprise to you when you've seen those sorts of risk rates that's more than the knee replacements and hip replacements done in total in this country every year in fact it's about double those so hip fractures and hip fracture treatment are exceedingly important and internationally in this present decade of the bone and joint as it's called there's a great deal of interest in osteoporosis associated fractures and hip fractures are perhaps the most important of those and the World Health Organisation sees hip fracture or perhaps more generally osteoporosis associated fracture as the most pressing public health problem in the developed world for this decade and i tell you that because hip fractures aren't very sexy they're not really that interesting to surgeons and # people like me who are happy to fix them but we don't really get that much involved in the patients and in the etiology of that disease and in thinking about prevention but some of you may be interested in doing that and i think the chap that you mentioned who chased around with the calichew he's really onto a winner there there's an enormous amount of work to be done in improving the health of our population by thinking about osteoporosis related fractures i just want to ask you one more question # osteoporosis you gave a definition can anyone remember it now don't be shy i gave you a definition just a few moments ago</u>
<u who="sf5204">decrease in bone mass due to changes in the balance between # bone formation and bone destruction # leading to changes in the bone architecture</u>
<u who="nm5197">okay good lots of lots of right things in there i want to pick out just the very last thing you said about architecture now what's that what does that mean not you but someone else any idea you heard Tim talking about bone architecture you've just heard it again what's that all about then</u>
<u who="sm5212">is it that there are thinner trabeculae or something</u>
<u who="nm5197">yes so here's a bit of bone can you switch this <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> can i have the # visualiser on please okay this is a bit of bone if you could look inside a bone which part of the bone would i be in here </u>
<u who="su5219">spongy bone</u>
<u who="nm5197">spongy bone yeah or another word more Latin</u>
<u who="su5219">trabecular bone</u>
<u who="nm5197">trabecular bone okay that's as compared to what sort of bone</u>
<u who="ss">cortical</u>
<u who="nm5197">cortical bone so whereabouts in your body is some cortical bone just show me a bit everyone show a bit of cortical bone come on guys you've got a whole body full of it here show me some cortical bone where have you got some where have you got some cortical bone </u>
<u who="su5219">i've no idea</u>
<u who="su5219">it's the outside of every bone isn't it</u>
<u who="nm5197">anywhere</u>
<u who="sf5205">yeah all bones <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/></u>
<u who="su5219">skull</u>
<u who="nm5197"># yes # skull's not a very good example actually the really good example of cortical bone is the tubes of bone in your long bones so your femur femoral shaft tibial shaft the shafts of your long bones in you arms there are all cortical bone so what about trabecular bone where's that</u>
<gap reason="inaudible" extent="uncertain"/>
<u who="nm5197">sorry whereabouts </u>
<gap reason="inaudible" extent="uncertain"/>
<u who="nm5197">you don't know okay anyone else </u>
<u who="su5219"><gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> cortical bone</u>
<u who="sf5205">it's the bit on the outside isn't it </u>
<u who="nm5197">right on either end of the long bones yes # and also some bones are almost entirely made of trabecular bone actually the vault of the skull is mostly trabecular bone # and # where else is a good trabecular bone the body's of the vertebrae most of the pelvis that's mostly trabecular bone so this would be some trabecular bone and we'd looking down at what sort of scale how wide are these trabeculae what's the distance from there to there</u>
<gap reason="inaudible" extent="uncertain"/>
<u who="nm5197">you've done a bit of bone histology have you have you</u>
<u who="ss">yeah</u>
<u who="nm5197">so these are fairly straightforward questions really where's trabecular bone and how wide's trabeculae # how wide is it give me a guess go on </u>
<gap reason="inaudible" extent="uncertain"/>
<u who="nm5197">say again</u>
<gap reason="inaudible" extent="uncertain"/>
<u who="nm5197">i'm sorry</u>
<u who="sf5205">point one of a millimetre</u>
<u who="nm5197">point one of a millimetre a bit big</u>
<gap reason="inaudible" extent="uncertain"/>
<u who="nm5197">yeah they're only they're only in the sort of # ten to a hundred micron range so getting up <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> perhaps so let's say that's about ten microns wide # and there's lot's of space in here in fact most of trabecular bone is just filled with space # filled with air</u>
<u who="su5219">no</u>
<u who="nm5197">no okay it's filled with air in the dry bones you look at what's it filled with in life </u>
<gap reason="inaudible" extent="uncertain"/>
<u who="nm5197">bone marrow which has got all sorts of good stuff in it and # you will have some of you seen bone marrow samples being taken what does it look like when it comes out has anyone seen a bone marrow sample done</u>
<gap reason="inaudible" extent="uncertain"/>
<u who="nm5197">anyone no-one's seen that okay you need to look out on a haematology ward it's commonly done it looks like blood with lots of fat in it so there's lots of fat in here lots of cells and a lot of blood in there and remember that's where a lot of the # synthetic activity for the haematological system goes on so in osteoporosis what happens is these trabeculae get thinner and your colleague i'm sorry i don't know any of your names was describing how that happened it's because this bone gets removed more quickly than it gets laid down and it gets very thin and then eventually some of the trabeculae actually lose bits of them so this trabecular here say which is going between here and here it might thin down and thin down until it ends up just being like that now that's a discontinuity in a trabecular how useful is that to you that trabecular how useful is it now</u>
<gap reason="inaudible" extent="uncertain"/>
<u who="nm5197">that's completely useless it might as well not be there because it can't work as a strut to resist compressive forces which is what the trabeculae do so in fact you can still have this bit of bone here but it can't do anything at all so osteoporosis is about losing bone mass so there's less bone and that's what we measured on those graphs but it's about much more than that it's much more complex than that it's about the bone being lost from particular places it's being lost from the sides of the trabeculae and it's increasing the number of trabeculae that are discontinuous and that's why these graphs look so dramatic because if you lose a certain amount of bone mass take it away take it away and it's not until you actually make those trabeculae discontinuous that it stops working and then you're going to fracture more easily so that's a bit about osteoporosis let's move on any final questions for Tim before he sits down one more thing i want you to do have a seat Tim is # i want you all to get a bit of paper and # draw on the bit of paper have you all got a piece of paper everybody draw on the piece paper a picture of a hip i'll only give you about twenty seconds so get cracking to help you i've drawn one here so you can just copy that now i'm a surgeon and i'm an orthopaedic surgeon and # i'd have to say that i <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> a little bit when i detect Tim's # # how should i put this # # lack of respect for anatomy Tim clearly doesn't think that anatomy's very important # or indeed a subject that any of you should know anything about so i'm going to show you why Tim really did need to know about anatomy in order to know anything about how this patient was treated and how the surgeons if they hadn't done this bit of anatomy would have completely screwed up the manage of this patient and you'll see why that term's particularly relevant in a moment so # here we go here's a picture of a hip what's this bit called</u>
<u who="ss">acetabulum</u>
<u who="nm5197">and this bit</u>
<u who="ss">femoral head</u>
<u who="nm5197">and this bit</u>
<u who="ss">femoral neck </u>
<u who="nm5197">and this bit</u>
<u who="ss">greater trochanter</u>
<u who="nm5197">and this bit</u>
<u who="ss">capsula articularis</u>
<u who="nm5197">and this bit</u>
<u who="ss">shaft </u>
<u who="nm5197">so someone said intertrochanteric fracture earlier on what does that word mean </u>
<u who="ss">between the <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> </u>
<u who="nm5197">and so a fracture that goes like this would be an intertrochanteric fracture okay # Tim reckoned that that patient that we just looked at had a subtrochanteric fracture so where would that fracture be </u>
<gap reason="inaudible" extent="uncertain"/>
<u who="nm5197">so down here somewhere okay and # another term that's often talked about is a subcapital fracture what would that mean </u>
<gap reason="inaudible" extent="uncertain"/>
<u who="nm5197">so that would be usually in the neck about here somewhere so they're three pretty common hip fractures this one actually the subtrochanteric is quite rare in comparison and these are roughly equally common # these ones usually occur when people fall down and land on their hip as our lady here did and these ones usually occur spontaneously so they're just walking along and all of a sudden they fall down because their hip breaks and these ones are much more associated with osteoporosis than these so this is the the way that those patients with discontinuity of their trabeculae will probably get a fracture be walking along one day and their hip will break and that will cause them to fall now let's just focus on these two for a moment so on your diagram show me in some way the blood supply of the femoral head i'll give you a few seconds to draw that and then once you've drawn it you can come and show everybody what you've drawn </u>
<gap reason="inaudible" extent="uncertain"/>
<u who="nm5197">okay # who'd like to come and show us what you've drawn come on i don't want to pick someone let's have a volunteer yeah come <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> what's your name <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/></u>
<u who="sf5205"><gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/></u>
<u who="nm5197"><gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> okay show us what you've drawn </u>
<u who="sf5205"><gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/></u>
<u who="nm5197">have you got a drawing </u>
<u who="sf5205">sorry</u>
<u who="nm5197">have you got a drawing </u>
<u who="sf5205"># yeah</u>
<u who="nm5197">bring it with you go on show us on the # on the demonstrator </u>
<u who="sf5205">on this thing </u>
<u who="nm5197">yeah</u>
<u who="sf5205"># there's one here to the head of the femur and # the medial circumflex femoral artery i think comes round here </u>
<u who="nm5197">that's brilliant okay have a seat thanks okay Tim let me see yours you're the anatomist </u>
<u who="sm5198"><gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> the medial circumflex artery goes round here and then the two <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> arteries bunch up into the femoral neck into the femoral head </u>
<u who="nm5197">good and what about the one that # <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> showed coming in from the medial aspect </u>
<u who="sf5206">that's obliterated at the back at five years old</u>
<u who="nm5197">say that again</u>
<u who="sf5206">that's obliterated at about five years old and then it becomes a ligament at the head of the femur</u>
<u who="nm5197">yes so there's a ligamentum teres which is the ligament between the acetabulum and the centre of the femoral head and in children there's a little blood vessel in there actually in children it's quite a big one and an important one but in adults it it does get much smaller and is probably not very important in most elderly people you're absolutely right so Tim who was pre-warned had drawn some blood vessels that came up here and supplied the femoral head and # actually they're plastered down on to the neck of the femur there what would plaster them down </u>
<gap reason="inaudible" extent="uncertain"/>
<u who="nm5197">not the capsule because the capsule of the hip joint would be like that and so there's a a potential space there with a little bit of synovial fluid in it so they can have that part plaster those down on to the femoral neck</u>
<u who="su5219">is it the periosteum</u>
<u who="nm5197">periosteum what's periosteum </u>
<u who="sm5203">it's # <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> </u>
<u who="nm5197">it's the bit that plasters down the blood vessels so it's # it's the material which is all over the bone # but that's actually quite thick usually # in the # around the femoral neck and doesn't go any further than that why not</u>
<gap reason="inaudible" extent="uncertain"/>
<u who="nm5197">say again</u>
<u who="su5219">because of the articular surface </u>
<u who="nm5197">yeah because there's an articular surface here of hyaline cartilage so # runs over the femoral # neck on either side # all the way round and is plastered down onto the femoral neck and that holds those blood vessels onto the femoral neck now apart from this little teeny weenie blood vessel that maybe is there # in adults but probably not in most adults essentially there's no other blood supply to the femoral head than these ones that are coming in here now that's actually quite an unusual situation isn't it because if we think about your hand for example its blood supply is # there there are various bits to it so tell me about some of the blood supply to your hand </u>
<u who="ss">radial artery </u>
<u who="nm5197">the radial artery that's coming down on the radial side ulnar artery over here they they come together in anastomosis in the centre and there's a whole bunch of little vessels under the skin # all around the wrist so that even if you lose both the radial and the ulnar artery there's still a potential for some supply to the hand so you've got lot's of options for how you get blood supply to your hand but in this sort of situation if the patient has a fracture which runs across there you can see how all those blood vessels that are plastered down onto the femoral neck would be ruptured by such a fracture and then what would happen to the hip</u>
<gap reason="inaudible" extent="uncertain"/>
<u who="nm5197">it would die and that's called avascular necrosis and in those circumstances this head would be no use at all because it's all going to die and fall to bits and so that patient would need some sort of hip replacement and who was the hip replacement guy so that's the answer to your question there but what about if the fracture was here would the blood supply be disrupted</u>
<u who="ss">no</u>
<u who="nm5197">no it won't because the blood vessels come in from here and then <trunc>ru</trunc>  run up the femoral neck and the fracture down here just the same that's not going to disrupt the head so it's possible for the surgeons to fix this with a screw device that held it all together and they can expect this bit to have a good blood supply and this bit to have a good blood supply and therefore here and that's what should happen in our patient here and clearly if they've not understood that they hadn't understood how the blood supply works then they wouldn't be able to choose which operation to do and so assessing this person's fracture involves thinking about not just what you can see on the X-ray of a broken bone but thinking about the anatomy which may have been disrupted and that brings us on nicely to our second case who's going to begin okay go ahead can we have the <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> off please</u>
<u who="sm5199">okay so our clinical case presentation is on multiple trauma Adeline and i spoke to Mr H who is a twenty-two year old army tank operator # who has no significant previous medical history that i need to tell you about at the moment # he's a motorcyclist # and he had to # effect a sudden deceleration when he was <trunc>driv</trunc>  # cycling along # which apparently if you do it too quickly on a motorbike you're going to fall to one side or another he was unlucky and fell into the oncoming traffic on the other side of the road and was hit by a van # he actually rated his pain on the impact as only six out of ten and compared it with when he broke his arm as a young child # he he said the pain was actually worse when he was just lying in bed in the rehabilitation ward # than it was when the accident actually happens which i thought was quite interesting # pre-hospital # management when the ambulance crew arrived on the scene # was purely moving him onto a spinal bed and # giving him analgesia and a leg splint before bringing him into hospital # when he came to A and E # the primary survey of A B C D E which is probably familiar to a lot of people was # performed his airway and breathing were non-compromised circulation wise he was tachycardic he was pale and he had # a borderline impaired capillary refill which are signs of hypovolaemic shock which we might talk to you about later if you're lucky # disability wise his Glasgow coma scale was fifteen throughout fifteen out of fifteen and then the # # hospital staff moved on to exposing to look for further injuries # and this secondary survey revealed a continued hypovolaemia # substantial perineal laceration and bruising which apparently # the perineal area is one that's very easy to overlook when you're assessing trauma cases # and he also had suspected damage to his pelvis and his left leg so he was zoomed off to CT which gave this groovy picture # which # i've been asked to ask you to tell me about anybody # there's two main things really i think compare the left to the right </u>
<gap reason="inaudible" extent="uncertain"/>
<u who="sm5199">anybody want to tell me </u>
<u who="su5219">is it a comminuted fracture of the left # anterior superior aspect </u>
<u who="sm5199"># i don't know whether it's comminuted or not but there's definitely a fracture there yeah # it was <trunc>s</trunc>  severe disruption to # the left sacroiliac # joint in fact and apparently there's # some lesser damage to the right one as well there's also # at the front disruption of the synthesis pubis # </u>
<u who="nm5197">let's just # nail this word comminuted what does that mean </u>
<u who="su5219"><gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> in loads of pieces</u>
<u who="nm5197">right so that's a that's a sort of big word really but i think it's just about confusing patients because i don't think we use that word in any normal life and you might as well just say lots of bits or multi fragmentary or smashed to smithereens almost but # comminuted is a word that doesn't really mean anything extra which is i think is why there is a little bit of uncertainty between you as to whether it was comminuted or not so even among doctors people don't really know what it is # general point try to use the simplest word that will address the situation </u>

<u who="nm5197">oh no not at all i mean # i work i work with sixteen other orthopaedic surgeons and i would think that # three-quarters of them would use the word comminuted routinely every day but some of us don't think it's a very useful word and i'm alerting you to the fact that in your practice when you become doctors you will need to think about what sort of language and on the whole the simplest language that conveys the message is the right thing to do but you'll therefore need to think about everything you hear not just now but throughout your working lives and think what does that really mean does that actually convey anything to me other extra to some straightforward word and you'll find that some doctors are dreadful at this and they will use highly complex words for no good reason at all and you'll find that other doctors # will rebel against that and use very straightforward words and you need to find your own place in that what i'm saying to you is think about it a bit don't be surprised when your teachers use take different approaches to that and you need to work out what yours ought to be </u>
<u who="sm5199">thank you # after the CT was performed he was taken straight to theatre and for those <trunc>bud</trunc> budding surgeons among you they sliced open his tummy # they found significant retroperitoneal haematoma # bleeding into the abdominal cavity # severe disruption of the pelvic floor apparently his # # rectum had become completely dissociated from the supporting structures but other than that there was no major other major pelvic or abdominal damage his livers his kidney his spleen were all still intact # while he was still on the table # further surgery was performed to find # to fix the bits that they'd found that was wrong there's simple language for you # so they sutured the # mesenteric # artery they found that had caused the majority of the bleeding # they gave him a colostomy to defunction the damaged lower bowel # they also inserted a suprapubic catheter because with disruption of the synthesis pubis there's # a large chance for # # laceration of the urethra so they decided to put a catheter in they packed the perineal wound and # they fixed the pelvis externally as well # i've got a nice picture of that # this is indicated again where the synthesis pubis has been disrupted to stabilise the pelvis and stop the two halves rubbing together to cause more damage and now purely because we're half way through the talk i'll hand you over to Adeline</u>
<u who="sf5200">thanks okay right so they then went on to take a look at the damage to the femur and saw that there was a closed transverse fracture to the shaft of the femur and because it was # because he was actually suffering from multiple fractures this was an indication for stabilisation with surgery rather than # simple plaster of paris so a nail was inserted and this is an X-ray of the fracture to the femur the # i think i'm going to be ask some questions about this in sec but first just to say that the sciatic nerve was left undamaged and as you can see there was obviously no damage to the joint and both of these indicate a better prognosis than if either of those had happened sorry did you want me to stop this so you could ask some questions</u>
<u who="nm5197">no carry on okay</u>
<u who="sf5200">okay right as you can see he was given quite a bit of blood products while in surgery to combat the hypovolaemia that he was suffering and then post-surgery over the next week or so he was # he was weaned off the ventilator which i've heard can actually be quite a traumatic process and he was treated for a left sided pneumothorax which was discovered on chest X-ray rather than actually clinically he developed a spiking temperature and MRSA was # cultured from a throat swab and Candida from his central line and he was treated accordingly by isolation antibiotics and antifungals he was then moved to Coventry and Warwickshire for their expertise in pelvic repair and here he initially # underwent examination under anaesthetic and this perineum they removed the stabilising bridge that had been put in place previously not because it was no good but because it's not a permanent procedure and they replaced it with something more permanent # fixation with a screw which actually went from the ileum through to the sacrum # to stabilise the sacroiliac joint which was the site of the <trunc>ma</trunc>  the major injury they also removed quite a lot of necrotic tissue from his buttock muscles because obviously he was at risk of infection from that then during the next couple of weeks he made a number of trips to the theatre # of which i think Macbeth he particularly enjoyed and less enjoyable # was the further tissue removal from his buttocks and thighs the colostomy # examination which then revealed that yet more # skin and tissue had to be removed they re-dressed the wound # on a separate occasion and a skin graft was performed to replace some of the tissue which had been the damaged tissue which skin which had been removed earlier just very quickly # i'm going to mention some of the possible long term complications i don't really need to go into these in detail because you're probably quite aware of them physically the the most obvious is the <trunc>mus</trunc>  musculoskeletal damage which if if we're not careful with his # rehabilitation could lead to long-term immobility and disability the genitourinary and GI complications as yet aren't particularly clear and probably won't be until they reverse the colostomy et cetera and then of course there's the # possibility of social and psychological complications things like anxiety and depression are very common in this sort of situation and so # we've split the rehabilitation up into surprise physical social and psychological and again you <trunc>kn</trunc>  you all know about physiotherapy occupational therapy walking aids et cetera socially good communication with his family and employment # his employee employer's particularly important so that he can get back to if possible the work if not the work he was doing before as close to it as possible and evidence had shown that # a more psychological base to rehabilitation is of benefit one last thing to mention that i think's important i've sort of noticed while in hospital not just looking at this case is the two extremes of patient attitudes following something like trauma # at one extreme you have the sort of patients who really want to hand everything over to the doctors and don't want that that much involvement in their care they don't want to take it on board and at the other <trunc>en</trunc>  the other end you have those who really want to be empowered and want to do as much as possible for themselves and i think from speaking to him although at the moment he's still in obviously quite a state of shock he seems to fall into that end of the spectrum and he's a pretty motivated individual and that obviously bodes very well for his recovery okay thanks</u>
<u who="nm5197">do you have any questions </u>
<u who="sf5218">how can you wean somebody off a ventilator</u>
<u who="sf5200">i think it's # yeah an unnecessarily complicated way of saying take it out and see if they can breathe without it or take it off see if they can breathe like without it on but the but now # i think there's a more sophisticated type of ventilator which # is able to respond somewhat to the # i'm not sure of the name of it but it's able to respond to the amount of breathing that the patient can do and yeah respond accordingly so the ventilator is in a sense telling what the patient can do and not taking too much away at once am i right # yeah</u>

<u who="sm5199">again i don't think they took away enough to be to give a significant loss # but don't quote me on that one </u>
<u who="sf5200">no all that was mentioned in his notes was that he had a skin graft and he was pretty unaware of exactly what had been done and he's <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> a little too shocked to really take it all on board and ask too many questions at the time so he hadn't really asked the doctors for details of his injuries </u>
<u who="nm5197">see about half of the muscle here has gone <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> a little bit more than half maybe two-thirds which muscle is this </u>
<gap reason="inaudible" extent="uncertain"/>
<u who="nm5197">gluteus what sorry</u>
<gap reason="inaudible" extent="uncertain"/>
<u who="sf5200">medius</u>
<u who="nm5197">gluteius medius good yes so where's gluteus maximus everyone stand up put your hand on your gluteus maximus</u>
<gap reason="inaudible" extent="uncertain"/>
<event desc="most students stand and put hands on buttocks" iterated="y" dur="5 secs"/>
<u who="nm5197">right round the back here the gluteus maximus is the back part of the buttock and most of it's <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> comes off the sacrum and most of it's <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/></u>
<u who="sf5217">can i just ask he was on a motor bike wasn't he</u>
<u who="nm5197">yes he was</u>
<u who="sf5217">was he wearing motor cycle leathers and do they actually make much difference to whether he'd lose much of his bum or not when he's skating along on it</u>
<u who="sm5199">i don't know whether he was wearing leathers or not no </u>
<u who="su">i can vouch for the fact they do make a big difference i mean i don't know about in his case but yeah i've come off motorbikes and they make a very big difference yeah </u>
<u who="nm5197">i think that's certainly true they definitely an enormous difference # especially if you see the leathers after the accident when someone has had an accident they've been going sixty miles and they've come off their bike and they're skidded along the road you look at their leathers afterwards you realise how they've benefited from their skin not looking like their leathers in fact this chap's injury was primarily caused by him being run over it wasn't the fact that he came off the bike that did him much of the damage he was actually driven over by a large truck and the truck came diagonally across his body # that side so it came one of the sets of wheels came between his legs</u>
<u who="ss">oh</u>
<u who="nm5197">across the middle of his pelvis and came off over here and you could see when he first came in the tyre tracks </u>
<u who="ss">oh<vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" dur="2"/> </u>
<u who="nm5197">and # because the injury was actually therefore caused by pure crushing and that's what damaged the muscle on the side and that muscle was just killed its there there was nothing that could ever be done about that because he was going to lose that </u>
<u who="sm5209"># his rectal muscles were completely removed from the surrounding structures and he was on a colostomy <trunc>i</trunc>  is there surgery that can repair that so that he won't have to be on the colostomy long term</u>
<u who="nm5197"># yes but let's go back a few steps so he'd been crushed and he'd lost about half two-thirds of the gluteus medius so what sort of functional deficit might he experience </u>
<u who="ss">adduction</u>
<u who="nm5197">he's going to lose adduction so how will he notice that what you can be sure of is he won't come into the clinic and say doctor doctor i've lost my adduction power how would he complain what would he say </u>
<gap reason="inaudible" extent="2 secs"/>
<u who="nm5197">so what would he complain of </u>
<gap reason="inaudible" extent="uncertain"/>
<u who="nm5197">he's on the end of the phone now and he's trying to describe to you what the problem is what would he say </u>
<u who="su5219">can't walk properly</u>
<u who="nm5197">can't walk properly okay what happens when you try to walk </u>
<u who="sf5216">he won't be able to support himself on one leg </u>
<u who="nm5197">now that's exactly what he won't be able to do he can't stand on one leg because if he tries to stand on his left leg he hasn't got enough adduction power he can't tilt his pelvis like this to bring his centre of gravity over that one leg and so when he tries to stand on one leg his weight will still hang over to the right side and he'll fall over so he won't be able to stand on his left leg and when he walks every time he's in the stance phase on his left leg he'll be falling over so as he walks he'll do something like this okay so he's going to have a functional deficit and there's not much we can do about that but what we're trying to do is just to get his pelvis sufficiently reconstructed thank you very much get his pelvis sufficiently reconstructed to make it work later on okay let's talk a bit then more about the injuries can you get back to his # his initial X-ray great so have a look at this and # here's a pelvis which you can compare with that one that's # a reconstruction from the CT scan and he's got # a lot of fracture around here a multi fragmentary fracture in this area this side of his pelvis this <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> of the ileum is just smashed into lots of bits but that's not really a his big problem although that reflects how much damage has been done there and hence why gluteus medius was so crushed his big problem was that his whole pelvis was completely disrupted it was taken into two pieces one bit went that way and the other bit went that way when the tyres when over the middle and it separated here what structure is this </u>
<u who="ss">sacroiliac </u>
<u who="nm5197">sacroiliac joint and here</u>
<gap reason="inaudible" extent="uncertain"/>
<u who="nm5197">right and in fact we know that this part of his pelvis went backwards with respect to this part as well now that's actually quite a technically difficult problem for us to manage but what you need to think about just now when you first see him is what are the implications of that that's what the picture looks like but what will that mean so what sort of big stuff is in here that might get damaged when the bones do that sort of thing </u>
<gap reason="inaudible" extent="uncertain"/>
<u who="nm5197">his bladder okay where's his bladder</u>
<gap reason="inaudible" extent="uncertain"/>
<u who="nm5197">okay it's about here sitting behind the synthesis pubis and you can imagine it when his bladder fills up it comes up like this and his urethra is at the bottom of the bladder and comes down between the two rami of the pubis and that's why his urethra was damaged and that's why he had to have a suprapubic catheter okay what # other big stuff's in here no we're not talking about <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> here we're talking about <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> matter</u>
<u who="su5219">intestines</u>
<u who="nm5197">intestines yeah lots of intestines all wriggly stuff in here lots of intestines any of the intestines damaged </u>
<gap reason="inaudible" extent="uncertain"/>
<u who="nm5197">what did you hear in the presentation</u>
<u who="su5219">his rectum was damaged</u>
<u who="nm5197">his rectum was damaged actually his rectum was damaged right down here where he had a great big wound where his pelvis had sort of been not just the bone of his pelvis but the whole soft tissue structure had been split so a great big wound down here which went into his rectum so that was the damage to the rectum what about further up here i think Adam mentioned it in the presentation </u>
<u who="su5219">mesenteric vessels</u>
<gap reason="inaudible" extent="uncertain"/>
<u who="nm5197">mesenteric vessel so one of the mesenteric vessels what's the mesentery </u>
<gap reason="inaudible" extent="uncertain"/>
<u who="su">something that suspends the colon into the rectum</u>
<u who="nm5197">okay so there are there's a a thin relatively delicate structure which joins the whole bowel the whole length of the bowel onto the back of the abdomen onto the retroperitoneal area and all the blood vessels which supply the bowel come from the back there and so they're thin relatively fragile structure the mesentery's got lots of mesenteric vessels in it and one of those was ruptured so he was bleeding from that and that required surgery and we've heard about that during his abdominal surgery what else is in here </u>
<u who="su5219">aorta</u>
<u who="nm5197">aorta yeah aorta where does the aorta stop how far does it come down </u>
<gap reason="inaudible" extent="uncertain"/>
<u who="nm5197">someone L4 T10 </u>
<gap reason="inaudible" extent="uncertain"/>
<u who="nm5197">about T10 and it's at the level of the <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> so it's up here somewhere so down in here there's not really any aorta but what are the two big vessels that come off the aorta </u>
<u who="ss">iliac</u>
<u who="nm5197">the iliac arteries and then subsequently the external and internal iliac arteries and where do the external iliac arteries go into the </u>
<gap reason="inaudible" extent="uncertain"/>
<u who="nm5197">they become femoral arteries and go into the leg so where are they on this model they're lying over here like this and each one's about the size of my finger so big vessels and you can see how maybe some of that disruption you can see on the left hand side might be getting quite close to where the femoral artery is on the left okay what else the internal iliac arteries where are they </u>
<gap reason="inaudible" extent="uncertain"/>
<u who="nm5197">they're in here they're in this space so they're winding around in here and the internal iliac arteries are not much smaller than the external they're really quite big structures and what runs along beside them </u>
<u who="su5219">veins</u>
<u who="nm5197">veins what are they called </u>
<gap reason="inaudible" extent="uncertain"/>
<u who="nm5197">the iliac veins the internal iliac veins it's easy isn't it and the arteries are sort of stretchy they're very elastic so if you take the pelvis and go like that the arteries stretch out and it's quite difficult to injure them the veins are not like that at all they're very very thin walled structures if you do this they will just tear and so the veins are all lying in this sort of place on the side big ones where they come off the # # before they before they join the <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> to form the inferior vena cava and these veins are therefore right in front of where the sacroiliac joint disruption is can you see it on that picture by the way where it says degree there's a whole bit of bone missing because that's all gone backwards the sacroiliac joint's completely disrupted and so those big big veins have very very likely been damaged in here and many other structures as well now did you get the impression that he almost died or did he come through this no trouble at all </u>
<u who="sm5199">stiff upper lip and all that </u>
<u who="nm5197">stiff upper lip</u>
<u who="sm5199">yeah # i never got the impression that he almost died did you</u>
<u who="sf5200">some well if i'd just read his notes i would have thought he'd come pretty close to death but from speaking to him i didn't get that impression he he didn't sound like he thought it </u>
<u who="nm5197">that's interesting how much did he know about what was going on when he was initially being resuscitated</u>
<u who="sm5199">not much </u>
<u who="nm5197">no <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> quite a long time ventilated and sedated in the intensive care unit so he probably doesn't remember any of that so in fact i can tell you that he did almost die and we'll see a few bits of direct evidence for that in a moment but lets go back a little bit # to some of the things we were thinking about with the lady who had the hip fracture we talked about her being elderly female white we talked about bone mass we talked about osteoporosis so what sort of risk factors did this chap have for trauma</u>
<u who="ss">motor bike</u>
<u who="nm5197">rides a motor bike he's a young man young man </u>
<u who="sf5218">speed he was travelling</u>
<u who="nm5197">say again</u>
<u who="sf5218">the speed he was travelling</u>
<u who="nm5197"># yeah and how fast was he going actually in fact he could have been going very slowly couldn't he because # his main injury was being driven over </u>
<u who="su5219">his occupation</u>
<u who="nm5197">what's his occupation </u>
<u who="su5219">tank operator</u>
<u who="nm5197">no he's a soldier so he's a sort of rough and ready sort of chap i can say that because i was in the army too what else what other risk factors might you be interested in maybe you'd like to ask the chaps about them</u>
<u who="sm5210">they said there was no relevant past medical history</u>
<u who="nm5197">no past medical history what what would be relevant</u>
<u who="sm5210">depends whether or not there's systemic illness so if he was diabetic or </u>
<u who="nm5197">a bit more broad</u>
<u who="su5219">psychiatric</u>
<u who="nm5197">psychiatric history certainly what about previous trauma trauma is a repeating disease my best is a patient who was shot five times on five separate occasions right on the third occasion when i saw him he was shot in the heart he had a bullet that went right through his heart we managed to keep him alive he survived i then saw him two subsequent times having been shot again on two separate occasions this is a person who got shot five times to my personal knowledge i don't know whether he's still alive or not but trauma is something that happens to people again and again and i want you to think around the idea that this is a disease it's not an accident it's not just hard luck some people are trauma patients they get it in the same way that some people get hip fractures some people get run over by trucks and the people who get run over by trucks are young men who are physically active and often have a particular sort of # # maybe we'll call it outgoing but it might be aggressive # personality they're people who get involved in activities which are more likely to result in injuries and some things you haven't mentioned at all they're people who drink they're people who take drugs they're people who are antisocial in their behaviour these are trauma victims and just the same way that not every person who gets a hip fracture is a little old lady with osteoporosis not every person who gets run over by a truck is in like this but you can categorise what these patients are like and think about the epidemiology of trauma in just the way you can think about the epidemiology of pneumonia okay # these patients who get trauma as a disease what kills then</u>
<u who="su5219">infection</u>
<gap reason="inaudible" extent="uncertain"/>
<u who="nm5197">i want you to think of the most common cause of people dying from trauma in this country </u>
<gap reason="inaudible" extent="uncertain"/>
<u who="su5219">infection</u>
<u who="nm5197">so a few possibilities infection is not the right answer</u>
<u who="su5219">shock</u>
<u who="nm5197">shock is not the right answer</u>
<u who="su5219">hypoxia</u>
<u who="nm5197">hypoxia yes talk about about that a little bit more</u>
<u who="sf5217">well the <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> breathing or circulatory failures then they won't get enough oxygen to the brain and they'll die</u>
<u who="nm5197">yes that's not really hypoxia although that would be a cause of everyone dying really not enough oxygen in their brain but # i think you're on the right track but it's a little bit more straightforward</u>
<u who="su5219">airways</u>
<u who="nm5197">yeah most people die as a result of trauma from airway obstruction so of the people who have trauma and die it's airway obstruction that's the most common cause i'll tell you a little story one of my colleagues a consultant orthopaedic surgeon very famous scoliosis surgeon working in Oxford was killed when i was a medical student in Oxford and # he was killed in pretty similar circumstances really he was on a push bike and was run over by a # bus and # the bus didn't actually do very much damage but he banged his head on the road and so he was a bit concussed and he was taken by an ambulance to not the nearest hospital but the hospital that happened to have a C-T scanner at the time and on the he was taken there because a junior doctor jumped in the ambulance and said ah this chap's got a head injury we need to take him to a C-T scanner and in fact # he died when he got to that hospital because no-one thought about common causes of death they were all thinking about what was going on inside his head and he died on a trolley in the accident and emergency department because no-one thought about the fact that he became unconscious because he had a head injury and he developed respiratory obstruction and he died so airway obstruction commonest cause of death in people who suffer injury in this country second commonest cause </u>
<u who="su5219">blood loss</u>
<u who="nm5197">bleeding exactly could you just talk about hypovolaemic shock </u>
<u who="sm5199">yeah okay it's only quick i think and <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> i wasn't expecting this # # hypovolaemic shock you're losing blood volume # which gives you a fall in venus pressure and therefore reduced cardiac output # your arterial pressure will also fall # it's detected by your baroreceptors which # increase your heart rate # and as a result of that your total peripheral resistance raises as well in an effort to get the cardiac output up and # also venoconstriction but # obviously the main # way to treat it is by replacing the volume that was lost and is there anything else you want to know</u>
<u who="nm5197">no that's fine any questions </u>
<u who="sm5199">good</u>
<u who="nm5197">so # when # do sit down Tim when someone takes a blood sample with a syringe # we lose some volume there does that person develop hypovolaemic shock </u>
<u who="ss">no</u>
<u who="nm5197">why not </u>
<u who="sm5213">does it have to be more than seven-hundred and fifty millilitres </u>
<u who="nm5197">how much</u>
<u who="su5219">is it seven-hundred and fifty millilitres</u>
<u who="nm5197">eh # so what we're saying is that there's some sort of threshold once you've lost more than a certain amount of blood you're going to develop hypovolaemic shock which is in a sense a disease isn't it caused by bleeding some people are going to be able to respond their haemostatic mechanisms will be more effective than others what sort of people are likely to have relatively ineffective haemostatic <trunc>mecha</trunc>  mechanisms </u>
<gap reason="inaudible" extent="uncertain"/>
<u who="nm5197">elderly people yeah</u>
<gap reason="inaudible" extent="uncertain"/>
<u who="nm5197">say again </u>
<u who="sm5203">people with kidney disease maybe</u>
<u who="nm5197">yes that's usually not much good any way <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> what else </u>
<gap reason="inaudible" extent="uncertain"/>
<u who="nm5197">children yeah children don't have very much reserve so they can lose a small amount of blood and be very severely affected so how much blood did this guy lose </u>
<gap reason="inaudible" extent="uncertain"/>
<u who="nm5197">what what was the answer </u>
<u who="su5219">we don't know</u>
<u who="nm5197">oh we don't know how much does he have replaced </u>
<gap reason="inaudible" extent="uncertain"/>
<u who="nm5197">seventeen units how much is a unit </u>
<u who="su5219">five-hundred mils</u>
<u who="nm5197">five-hundred mils okay and how much blood's in his body to start with </u>
<gap reason="inaudible" extent="uncertain"/>
<u who="nm5197">five litres okay so he's # # had replaced how much in total </u>
<gap reason="inaudible" extent="uncertain"/>
<u who="nm5197">eight and a half litres okay so we don't really know how much he lost exactly but we do know that by the end of it he had another eight and a half litres put in so unless he's become very very big then probably he's lost something in the order of except it's not an exact match it's something in the order of one and a half blood volumes now that's an enormous amount that's a gigantic amount if i put seven # eight and a half litres of blood on the floor here we'd be awash with blood it's a gigantic amount of bleeding and a large proportion of people who lose that much blood will die just from the fact they've lost all that blood even if you replace it complications of the losing of the blood is enough to kill you so in fact he did come very close to dying with <trunc>regar</trunc> regardless of anything else just because of his blood loss now let's think a little bit generally and he'll be a good example here where do you think people can lose blood after major injury </u>
<u who="sm5211">where where to</u>
<u who="nm5197">yes where does blood come from </u>
<u who="sm5211">from the bones</u>
<u who="nm5197">from bones okay so he had some fractures so he had a fracture of his femur and he had a fracture of his pelvis so talk about the pelvis in a minute but the long bones the femur the tibia the arm bones these can all bleed quite a lot and big amounts of blood can be in the cavity around that bone # femur for example easily fit two litres of blood in your thigh around your femur so a lot of blood can be lost there pelvis he had a big fracture of his pelvis you you'd expect him to bleed from the fractured surfaces but much more importantly is the bleeding from those blood vessels that we talked about where else</u>
<u who="su5219">into the abdomen</u>
<u who="nm5197">into the abdomen he was bleeding into his abdomen he had a mesenteric vessel rupture so bleeding in the abdomen </u>
<u who="su5219"><gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> wound onto the floor </u>
<u who="nm5197">good onto the floor and it doesn't matter how it gets out but somewhere onto the floor and probably quite a lot of blood was left on the road in this case so somewhere out in Worcestershire there's a very bloody road and that bleeding could be left at any point along the track and usually some everywhere so you leave some blood on the road leave some in the ambulance leave some blood in the A and E department floor leave some blood in your clothes leave some blood in your car blood gets left in lots of places where else </u>
<u who="su5219">intracranially</u>
<u who="nm5197">inside your head how much blood can you lose inside the head</u>
<u who="su5219">probably not a lot</u>
<u who="nm5197">yeah i mean about # two-hundred mils will kill you because of the pressure effected that volume of blood if you you bleed quickly into you head like that think about an extra # sorry a subdural haematoma or an extradural haematoma those sorts of acute bleeds can lead to death with only a very small volume of blood so no not much blood loss inside his head and we're not going to explain anything like eight and a half litres in his skull</u>
<u who="su5219">into the chest</u>
<u who="nm5197">into his chest yeah so # into his chest so into the pleural space # he can't really lose blood into the pericardium because a smaller volume there would kill you again # two-hundred mils easily enough to kill you a hundred would certainly make you very ill but quite a big volume in your chest how big's the volume in your chest </u>
<gap reason="inaudible" extent="uncertain"/>
<u who="nm5197">ten litres you're a big man </u>
<u who="su5219">about five</u>
<u who="nm5197">yeah about five litres is the maximum # think about two litres in each side of the chest because you can't obviously fill the whole chest up because you've still got some lungs and other stuff to fit in there so # again some litres inside the chest where else</u>
<u who="su5219">into the gut itself</u>
<u who="nm5197">into the inside of your gut </u>
<u who="su5219">uh huh </u>
<u who="nm5197">yes certainly bleeding can occur there but to be a large amount it's either going to stay in the abdomen and just fill up your abdomen with blood or it's going to come out # at one end or other of the gut in which case it's on the floor</u>
<u who="su5219">the retroperitoneum</u>
<u who="nm5197">yeah the retroperitoneal space that's really about bleeding in the pelvis that's where it goes when you bleed in the pelvis so into the posterior wall of the abdomen well the answer is that's it it's really pretty simple they're the only places that you can lose blood so if you've got a person who's suffered a big injury and you can secure their airway and make sure their airway's not obstructed and be certain that they're not bleeding in any of those places then you will avoid about seventy per cent of all the deaths that occur after trauma so for all those young smoking alcoholic men that get trauma that's the sort of way to minimize the impact of their disease now we could talk about this chap all day and i'm sure some of you would be interested in doing so in fact how many of you would be interested in doing so not tonight but <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> i'm interested to know how many of you find this sort of patient the one we've just discussed interesting how many of you find him so interesting that he's the sort of thing that you would choose to make your professional career around about six or seven of you then of those of you would you be interested in the initial assessment and initial treatment in other words the emergency room medicine the ER type stuff or are you interested in the subsequent management in other words how to fix him up and and make him work </u>
<gap reason="inaudible" extent="uncertain"/>
<u who="nm5197">so how many of you interested in the ER bit and the subsequent management okay that's just my own my interest to know that good we've talked about two different sort of extremes in trauma we've talked about a little old lady with a hip fracture and we've talked about a young man run over by a truck and # they don't cover the whole spectrum of trauma by any means but what i've tried to do is just to illustrate to you some of the complexities that you need to think about when you're considering what fractures and other injuries # mean to patients and in particular i'd like to take you to take away the thought that trauma is a disease and you can think of it in the same way you think of any other disease so you can think about risk factors you can think etiology you can think distribution and just in case your examiners thought the same way i'd like you to spend just one minute writing down three bullet points that would be the main headings of your essay answer to write on the epidemiology of trauma i'll give you one minute to write three bullet points on the epidemiology of trauma <event desc="students writing" iterated="y" dur="4"/>this is not a real exam i can see someone looking over their hand at their neighbour there okay so give me some bullet points </u>
<u who="sf5217">risk factors</u>
<u who="nm5197">say again</u>
<u who="sf5217">risk factors</u>
<u who="nm5197">risk factors okay so we've seen how risk factors could be applied across the board okay</u>
<u who="sf5218">statistics</u>
<u who="nm5197">statistics what does that mean </u>
<u who="sf5218">you need information you need </u>
<u who="nm5197">yeah</u>

<u who="nm5197">yes </u>

<u who="nm5197">i guess you're talking about descriptive statistics you're talking about how many cases are there or the incidence # that may be associated then with risk factors you might talk about how some of those graphs show how the risk factors affect the # prevalence </u>
<u who="su5219">prevention</u>
<u who="su5219">trauma as a disease who gets it </u>
<u who="nm5197">isn't that the same thing okay </u>
<u who="su5219">prevention</u>
<u who="nm5197">some one says prevention okay so that could be a whole topic on it's own and you could pick either of these and talk about prevention we talked quite a little bit about osteoporosis and we need to take the next step when talking about treatment of osteoporosis but of cause prevention would mean identifying at risk people and then treating them with effective treatments and we mentioned early on that maybe some treatments that we use aren't really effective</u>
<u who="su5219">mechanisms</u>
<u who="nm5197">yeah mechanisms and we just talked a bit about why people die # we could easily have talked about why people get hip fractures and # in one of your slides you showed hip <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> hip protectors and there's been a whole load of interest in the fact that people get hip fractures because they fall over and land on their hip and those intertrochanteric fractures seem to occur like that so there's been a massive amount of interest in inventing devices that you wear inside your pants that are sort of like cushions that protect the trochanteric area so that when you fall over you don't fracture your hip it works actually if you can get people to wear them but people don't like wearing balloons on their hips one thing it doesn't very look very nice so actually the research has moved onto in elderly people's homes should we put very thick underlay under their carpets the problem is that in fact in most elderly people's homes they don't have carpets at all they have # smooth floors because carpets make people fall over so we're not quite sure whether having the rough surface of the carpet is # outweighed by having the soft cushion underneath it of course you can make it very soft and it becomes like walking around on a bed on a mattress with all these little old ladies <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> we're not sure whether that works at all any other bullet points </u>

<u who="nm5197">complications yes # we'd be talking then more on the treatment end wouldn't we what about assessment diagnosis # we've talked about various tests that were done and it would be well you could talk about how you assess someone who's suffered an injury </u>
<u who="su5219">costs</u>
<u who="nm5197">costs very good trauma is probably the most expensive health problem in the developing world and is almost certainly the most expensive health problem in the developed world and for two different reasons in the developing world there's an awful lot of it which is why it's so expensive and then in the developed world it's costing an enormous amount to treat it because we can do lots of very very expensive fancy stuff but it's also expensive because on the whole people don't get that much better afterwards they don't get back to their jobs they don't get back to their normal lives a lot of these hip fracture patients never get to their house where they were living alone with their family looking after them this young guy probably will never work in the Army certainly again and probably never work in a physical job again so it's very expensive because then we've got a whole life time of expense in front of us</u>
<u who="su5219">when you say it's the most expensive what # proportion of the NHS budget does it # <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/></u>
<u who="nm5197">well in fact treatment terms it's a small fraction of the NHS budget and less than one per cent of the NHS budget is spent on trauma and that's because the actual treatment bit doesn't cost very much in comparison to other hi-tech treatments for things like heart disease and cancer but it's expensive to the <trunc>s</trunc>  to society because of the loss of income the fact that you have to spend a lot more money on these people in the future to look after them and the other heading i would talk about would be # social impact we touched on these little old lady is going to be desperately # disabled in the future certainly in the medium term if not in the long term and that's going to have a big impact on her and her family one of the questions i wanted to ask you Tim is i wonder how her daughter feels about the fact that her Mum's been living on her own in a house which she had an upstairs bedroom she had some help but they ran out of money and so now she doesn't have any the daughter used to take her shopping but didn't on that occasion because goodness me the daughter wanted to go on holiday and the one time her daughter doesn't take her shopping her mum goes out and breaks her hip so when you imagine looking after that patient maybe you need to look after her family as well okay i'm going to stop there i hoped you've enjoyed that session</u>
