that may <pause dur="0.3"/> play in the selection process <pause dur="0.5"/> my colleague Dr <gap reason="name" extent="2 words"/> is <pause dur="0.2"/> a lecturer <pause dur="0.4"/> here at the medical school in general practice and he's also <pause dur="0.4"/> a general practitioner <pause dur="0.5"/> in <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> <pause dur="0.4"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> for this session Dr <gap reason="name" extent="2 words"/> has joined us as well who's the <pause dur="0.3"/> admissions tutor for the <pause dur="0.4"/> medical school <pause dur="0.3"/> here <pause dur="0.2"/> so <pause dur="0.4"/> i shall pass over to </u><u who="nm0323" trans="overlap"> okay <pause dur="0.4"/> thank you </u><u who="nm0321" trans="latching"> to <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> </u><pause dur="0.2"/> <u who="nm0323" trans="pause"> yeah thanks very much <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> the earlier session <pause dur="0.3"/> on attitudes of # <pause dur="0.4"/> medical students and # <pause dur="0.5"/> medical professionals <pause dur="0.4"/> is a important lead-in to this particular topic <pause dur="0.9"/> # i'm quite interested in this and # i've been looking into <pause dur="0.4"/> our selection procedure at <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> Medical School <pause dur="0.8"/> okay <pause dur="0.8"/> <kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> for the purpose of this presentation what i thought i would do is i'd look at current issues in the selection process <pause dur="0.3"/> which are <pause dur="0.2"/> in the literature at present time <pause dur="1.4"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> i will <pause dur="0.6"/> give you an overview <pause dur="0.3"/> of the selection process at <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> <pause dur="1.1"/> and then <pause dur="0.3"/> now that 
will be about twenty slides so i'll be going fairly fast at that stage <pause dur="0.4"/> and most <trunc>os</trunc> most of us have been through the # selection process so we'll understand it fairly quickly <pause dur="1.2"/> and # <pause dur="1.5"/> in the third section i'll look at some possible areas of research <pause dur="1.4"/> in the <pause dur="0.2"/> selection procedure <pause dur="1.1"/> and also report on a statistical analysis we've done of the interviewer scores <pause dur="0.6"/> okay <pause dur="3.7"/> <kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> current issues in selection <pause dur="1.1"/> you may have come across wider access for underprivileged <pause dur="0.3"/> # educational and social background <pause dur="0.6"/> people <pause dur="1.6"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> then there's the personal qualities assessment <pause dur="1.2"/> and common admissions tests for all graduate entry courses <pause dur="0.5"/> which has really <trunc>b</trunc> # <pause dur="0.6"/> just been talked about but i thought it would be <pause dur="0.5"/> useful to bring it to <pause dur="0.2"/> your attention <pause dur="2.3"/> <kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> the underprivileged <pause dur="0.9"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> is quite contentious and problematic <pause dur="0.8"/> it is desirable but <pause dur="0.4"/> it's really addressing inequality with further inequality <pause dur="0.8"/> # but it's worth noting that 
something like seventy per cent of medical students are from very <pause dur="0.2"/> privileged sort of backgrounds <pause dur="1.1"/> and the first university who <pause dur="0.6"/> # started looking at this area was Bristol around about two-thousand-and-one it was reported in the <pause dur="0.7"/> news items <pause dur="0.2"/> # they were giving something like two Bs and a C <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> gradings for <pause dur="0.5"/> entry into their medical course <pause dur="0.6"/> for <pause dur="0.8"/> pupils from <pause dur="0.6"/> inner city <pause dur="1.4"/> secondary schools and things like that or comprehensive schools <pause dur="1.5"/> and this year Saint George's # Hospital have # <pause dur="0.3"/> this sort of policy i don't know whether it's a general policy or whether they're just kind of looking at a certain percentage say ten per cent or fifteen per cent i'm not entirely sure <pause dur="0.5"/> but it was in the in the press that they are <pause dur="1.1"/> looking at it this year <pause dur="2.2"/> <kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> psychometric testing <pause dur="0.7"/> quite a lot of work currently going on <pause dur="0.8"/> it's quite prevalent and the origins are from U-S-A and Australia <pause dur="2.3"/> and basically it focuses on <pause dur="0.6"/> students who have empathic <pause dur="0.2"/> attitudes <pause dur="1.5"/> and 
if you are looking at this area <pause dur="0.5"/> one wonders that <pause dur="0.2"/> perhaps you could give lower grade offers <pause dur="0.7"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> Durham this year i i think Professor Hamilton <pause dur="0.8"/> is is reporting that he would look at <pause dur="1.1"/> look at students who have this sort of empathic attitude <pause dur="0.5"/> much more favourably and perhaps give lower grade offers <pause dur="1.1"/> and of course when you're looking at this area you begin to think whether <pause dur="0.5"/> it might be a useful <pause dur="0.3"/> tool <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> to look at low numbers to interview because it is very labour intensive <pause dur="0.8"/> # at <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> we had # five-hundred interviews <pause dur="0.4"/> and <trunc>i</trunc> <trunc>i</trunc> it is hard work <pause dur="2.0"/> the Scottish universities have got two <pause dur="0.2"/> cohorts of # five-hundred <pause dur="0.3"/> voluntary P-Q-A <pause dur="0.5"/> assessment <pause dur="0.9"/> # this is <pause dur="0.2"/> the the there are five universities involved <pause dur="0.8"/> and # <pause dur="1.5"/> there is # </u><u who="nm0324" trans="overlap"> sorry what's P-Q-A </u><pause dur="0.7"/> <u who="nm0323" trans="pause"> # P-Q-A <pause dur="0.2"/> personality # <pause dur="0.4"/> personal qualities assessment <pause dur="0.5"/> it's sort of attitudes really <pause dur="1.4"/> # they're they're looking at # five-hundred volunteers <pause dur="0.7"/> okay <pause dur="0.5"/> <trunc>h</trunc> who have taken this P-Q-A <pause dur="0.3"/> test <pause dur="1.1"/> and <pause dur="0.3"/> of 
course <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.9"/> there is a long study which i'll describe in a minute <pause dur="0.5"/> and the areas of interest # <pause dur="0.5"/> primarily are <pause dur="0.6"/> problem solving <pause dur="0.2"/> capability <pause dur="0.2"/> and personality traits <pause dur="2.2"/> <kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> and this study which has yet to be # reported upon the preliminary <trunc>resu</trunc> results will be out say in the autumn time <pause dur="0.3"/> but <pause dur="0.8"/> the <trunc>prelim</trunc> preliminary results are already being talked about and that's where i come in <pause dur="0.5"/> there's a lady called Dr Lumsden from Glasgow University she's the admissions tutor i guess <pause dur="1.0"/> and they looked at two cohorts of # five-hundred students in two-thousand-and-two intake and the two-thousand-and-three intake <pause dur="0.8"/> and they're hoping to follow up these students <pause dur="0.3"/> # for up to ten years <pause dur="1.2"/> and this is to assess whether pre-admission psychometric scores can accurately predict <pause dur="0.4"/> their medical performance <pause dur="0.5"/> I-E <pause dur="0.2"/> the area they go into and how high <pause dur="0.3"/> they kind of rise in the ranks <pause dur="2.3"/> as i said the preliminary results will be reported later on this year <pause dur="0.8"/> but the 
interesting remark was <pause dur="0.3"/> according to the testing they've done so far <pause dur="0.3"/> something like a hundred-and-twenty-eight <pause dur="0.5"/> out of the five-hundred-and-ten that's quite a <pause dur="0.4"/> high percentage <pause dur="0.6"/> # are judged to be unsuitable for a career in medicine <pause dur="7.5"/> <kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> actually just going back <pause dur="1.5"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> the areas of interest <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> the P-Q-A test <pause dur="0.4"/> they did find <pause dur="0.6"/> # that the test was much more useful for problem solving capability <pause dur="0.3"/> than it was for personality traits <pause dur="0.6"/> but i ask you to bear in mind that these people <pause dur="0.9"/> are fairly intelligent but they have been chosen <pause dur="0.6"/> okay <pause dur="0.4"/> so they may <trunc>ha</trunc> already have the right sort of personality traits it's not kind of <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> # a whole population <pause dur="0.3"/> study <pause dur="0.2"/> it is very much focused on the people who've already been accepted <pause dur="4.8"/> <kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> the common admissions test <pause dur="0.2"/> # we have a graduate entry programme at # <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> <pause dur="0.5"/> and there is a proposal from Oxford for <pause dur="0.2"/> a common admissions test <pause dur="0.2"/> at the present time <pause dur="0.6"/> # i'm aware of 
another workshop <pause dur="1.0"/> for for development of this common admissions test on fourth of July and i think this is towards the end of June and <gap reason="name" extent="2 words"/> has been invited to this <pause dur="1.1"/> essentially the workshop # is being held and they hope to agree on what core knowledge skills and values <pause dur="0.6"/> are important in medical students <pause dur="0.5"/> and they would obviously look at the quality issues and validity and reliability <pause dur="0.5"/> and they will monitor all of that <pause dur="0.5"/> and they're hoping to tender <pause dur="0.6"/> # to a test contractor <pause dur="0.9"/> and they're thinking of <pause dur="0.4"/> implementing this by two-thousand-and-five it's it's a tall order but i thought i'll bring it to your attention that <pause dur="0.3"/> these things are being talked about <pause dur="0.7"/> and what the rights and wrongs that may be <pause dur="2.4"/> <kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> okay <pause dur="1.2"/> now i'm going to really speed up # the selection procedure at <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> it's based on the Leicester model <pause dur="0.9"/> # this is the fourth year of selection <pause dur="0.6"/> we're going through <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> it's based on <pause dur="0.5"/> the best current evidence and advice that is 
available <pause dur="0.9"/> and i make reference to <pause dur="0.3"/> the # <pause dur="0.9"/> the Committee of Heads of Medical Schools <pause dur="1.0"/> # Tomorrow's Doctors <pause dur="0.2"/> the General Medical Council i think <pause dur="0.4"/> fairly familiar with that <pause dur="0.5"/> and How To Do It # an article in the B-M-J by Powis <pause dur="0.6"/> and it was in nineteen-ninety-eight not nineteen-eighty-eight <pause dur="0.6"/> that's an error on my part <pause dur="1.7"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> the heads of medical schools essentially <pause dur="0.5"/> say that the <pause dur="0.2"/> selection process must be transparent <pause dur="0.8"/> i mean that's <pause dur="0.8"/> political correctness and everything else and <pause dur="0.5"/> fairness too really <pause dur="1.5"/> # the process must identify core qualities <pause dur="0.2"/> those are both academic <pause dur="0.3"/> and personal <pause dur="2.0"/> and we're looking at # highest standards of personal conduct for obvious reason <pause dur="0.7"/> and it's # incumbent <pause dur="0.2"/> for for <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> potential students <pause dur="0.5"/> the applicants to disclose criminal records <pause dur="1.7"/> and equally <pause dur="0.3"/> primary <trunc>du</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> duty being to the patient they've got to disclose infectious diseases <pause dur="0.6"/> and any disability <pause dur="0.7"/> now this does not bar them <pause dur="0.3"/> from entry into medical school but <pause dur="1.2"/> there is a panel which assesses what sort of disability and 
whether they would be suitable for <pause dur="0.4"/> a medical career <pause dur="1.3"/> and i think the same would apply what sort of criminal record there is <pause dur="0.2"/> but it is incumbent for them to <pause dur="0.2"/> disclose that <pause dur="1.7"/> <kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> the entry criteria as i said academic ability and a suitable personality <pause dur="1.7"/> <kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> and the selection process involves # written application through UCAS i'm sure you remember <pause dur="0.2"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> nowadays <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> it involves a <pause dur="0.2"/> personal statement <pause dur="0.8"/> # there's a competitive interview <pause dur="0.4"/> finally it's an admission tutor's decision <pause dur="0.5"/> whether they are offered a place or <pause dur="0.3"/> rejected <pause dur="1.6"/> <kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> # the written application <pause dur="0.4"/> again <pause dur="0.2"/> looking at academic ability <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> from biological sciences we don't have any arts students or engineering students here <pause dur="0.8"/> # we're looking at two-one upwards <pause dur="1.1"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> supportive referee is <pause dur="0.2"/> important <pause dur="1.2"/> and some personal qualities <pause dur="0.6"/> and a strong bias towards works experience in the medical profession <pause dur="0.4"/> and 
i'll come to that a little bit further on <pause dur="1.7"/> <kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> what do we mean by personality <vocal desc="laugh" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.9"/> communication skills and <pause dur="0.2"/> empathy with patients are very important <pause dur="1.2"/> # settled and demonstrable <pause dur="0.3"/> motivation <pause dur="0.5"/> to the profession <pause dur="0.8"/> and a suitable personality which is kind of an overall assessment for the practice of medicine <pause dur="3.0"/> <kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> and we judge these <pause dur="0.5"/> through a referee's report <pause dur="1.0"/> and the written material which they provide <pause dur="0.7"/> i'll come on to that in a minute <pause dur="0.4"/> and of course the interview <pause dur="1.2"/> and it's <shift feature="voice" new="laugh"/>not <shift feature="voice" new="normal"/>an exact science <pause dur="0.2"/> i think everybody admits that <pause dur="1.0"/> <kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> # we give them a supplementary <pause dur="0.3"/> # application form <pause dur="0.3"/> which allows them to <pause dur="0.6"/> expand <pause dur="0.4"/> # on their personal statement in a very structured way <pause dur="0.5"/> and i'm going to quickly run through the the the huge number of questions about ten of them we we ask why do they want to do medicine <pause dur="0.4"/> what sort of <trunc>recrecationa</trunc> recreational activities 
they might be involved with <pause dur="0.9"/> some sort of insight into medicine what's kind of important # ethical issues <pause dur="0.6"/> for the <pause dur="0.4"/> current <kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> sort of times <pause dur="1.0"/> # works experience <pause dur="1.3"/> we're looking at patient centred <pause dur="0.5"/> # explicit dates and details because somebody can go there for an afternoon versus you know <pause dur="0.5"/> a very close <pause dur="0.2"/> observational and <pause dur="0.2"/> active role <pause dur="0.6"/> in a hospice say <pause dur="0.8"/> and <pause dur="0.4"/> more importantly what did they learn <pause dur="0.2"/> from this <pause dur="0.7"/> and how do they feel about it <pause dur="1.0"/> # <pause dur="0.9"/> more importantly for <gap reason="name" extent="2 words"/> this one is to describe their degree course because you can then assess whether that is suitable for <pause dur="0.7"/> # for for our intake <pause dur="0.2"/> or not <pause dur="0.5"/> and i know for a fact that he goes to great lengths trying to find out you know what the <pause dur="0.2"/> structure of the <trunc>c</trunc> degree course is at various universities to make a <pause dur="0.5"/> more informed decision <pause dur="1.6"/> and this all of this helps to decide who interview <pause dur="0.9"/> and also <pause dur="0.2"/> how we structure the interview <pause dur="1.4"/> and <pause dur="0.5"/> <kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> i'll come 
to that in a minute <pause dur="1.6"/> the assessment of the written application is done by a pair of course <pause dur="0.2"/> selectors <pause dur="0.8"/> # up till this year it used to be two people <pause dur="0.2"/> now there are <pause dur="0.3"/> two pairs involved <pause dur="1.0"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> if there is a discrepancy <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> because they give a numerical score <pause dur="0.6"/> # then an adjudicator comes in to decide whether they interview or not <pause dur="0.8"/> # so far # i mean <pause dur="0.6"/> we only had # one pair now we've got two pairs there's fairly good concordance at the present and i'll put a question mark this is something we will be <pause dur="0.4"/> looking at and seeing how it sort of evolves <pause dur="2.1"/> and # something in italics i thought well it's interesting # if you could # <pause dur="0.2"/> look at the concordance between the <pause dur="0.2"/> # the the <pause dur="0.2"/> # numerical scores from the written application <pause dur="0.5"/> and the interview score and if they concord very well one wonders whether we need to interview at all maybe that's just a <pause dur="0.7"/> question <pause dur="0.2"/> <vocal desc="laugh" iterated="n"/> <pause dur="1.5"/> <kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> why interview <pause dur="1.0"/> historically it's always been # the

and like i said you need some sort of game plan as to who's going first and what sort of things they might be asking so that # <pause dur="1.2"/> <kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> you're not <pause dur="0.2"/> repeating yourself <pause dur="0.6"/> the criterion to be judged by are communication skills motivation to do medicine and general suitability <pause dur="1.1"/> <kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> and this is what we <pause dur="0.2"/> mean by communication skills <pause dur="2.6"/> it really comes out as a by-product it's not something <pause dur="0.2"/> you directly ask <pause dur="0.6"/> we're really looking at <pause dur="0.2"/> good presentation <pause dur="0.6"/> and <pause dur="0.5"/> issues about being good listeners <pause dur="0.8"/> and their ability to develop discussion <pause dur="2.0"/> and so forth <pause dur="1.0"/> # we talk about non-verbal communication again it's the way they sit it's the way they come across the way they relate to you <pause dur="0.2"/> it's all important <pause dur="3.0"/> <kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> motivation for medicine <pause dur="0.5"/> obviously important <pause dur="0.5"/> # we're we expect the <trunc>s</trunc> <pause dur="0.4"/> candidates to have some <pause dur="0.6"/> idea what the curriculum is <pause dur="0.4"/> and one of the <pause dur="0.2"/> questions asked is <pause dur="0.6"/> what do you 
think about the sociology modules which are <pause dur="1.0"/> which are <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> taught very early on in the course <pause dur="0.4"/> and that is usually a good discussion point <pause dur="0.9"/> realistic # commitment to a career in medicine <pause dur="1.4"/> appreciate the challenge <pause dur="2.5"/> a knowledge of career structures <pause dur="0.2"/> you know sort of houseman <pause dur="0.4"/> S-H-Os <pause dur="0.2"/> registrar grades and that sort of thing <pause dur="2.9"/> and awareness of current issues in medicine and the sort of things that <pause dur="0.2"/> come up is # if you were the # <pause dur="0.8"/> Minister of Health you know <pause dur="0.6"/> how would you do his job differently and why <pause dur="2.1"/> <kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> general suitability <pause dur="0.3"/> we're looking for determination perseverance tenacity <pause dur="3.1"/> and have an interest in other people and how their decisions may affect other people <pause dur="1.2"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> ability to manage stress <pause dur="0.5"/> and look for advice <pause dur="1.1"/> and also this feeling that they <shift feature="voice" new="laugh"/>can share <shift feature="voice" new="normal"/><pause dur="0.4"/> difficult <pause dur="0.2"/> problems with other people <pause dur="1.1"/> okay <pause dur="1.5"/> <kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> # the decision <pause dur="0.7"/> well <pause dur="0.3"/> if they <pause dur="0.2"/> they've already passed the written application assessment <pause dur="0.4"/> so if they get

follow it up with the specific question <pause dur="0.2"/> all the usual things open questions first <pause dur="1.1"/> set the scenario <pause dur="0.8"/> and then follow up with discussion <pause dur="0.3"/> and then you close it up with closed questions and may actually say <pause dur="0.3"/> what would you do in that situation <pause dur="0.6"/> and you know get them to sort of commit themselves <pause dur="1.4"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> this sort of <pause dur="0.3"/> approach may be seen as problematic by some people <pause dur="0.2"/> I-E if you have a theme to discuss and an area to discuss <pause dur="0.3"/> and if this candidate does freeze <pause dur="0.3"/> well do you stick with that same game plan <pause dur="1.3"/> it's open to discussion at the present time <pause dur="1.6"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> if we do do this sort of training i guess we could follow it up with some qualitative interviews of the selectors has it improved their technique do they feel more comfortable <pause dur="0.2"/> do they think the outcomes are better <pause dur="0.7"/> we could do a further analysis of the concordance factor <pause dur="1.2"/> <kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> okay <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> now this is interesting <pause dur="0.5"/> we did look at # <pause dur="0.3"/> at the the statistical analysis of # <pause dur="0.5"/> nine
