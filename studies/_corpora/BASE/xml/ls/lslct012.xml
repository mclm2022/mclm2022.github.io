projects actually on <pause dur="0.4"/> academic spoken English <pause dur="0.5"/> so # we'd just like to have your permission just to make sure that nobody objects strenuously to being filmed <pause dur="0.6"/> is is that okay with you <pause dur="1.6"/><kinesic desc="nod heads" iterated="n" n="ss"/> any objections <vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" n="ss" dur="1"/><pause dur="0.9"/> <vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" dur="1"/><pause dur="2.4"/> all right thanks very much </u><pause dur="2.2"/> <u who="nf0262" trans="pause"> <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> thanks <pause dur="2.2"/> well the only advantage from my point of view is that i'll have on camera those of you that have fell <trunc>as</trunc> fallen asleep <pause dur="1.0"/><vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" n="ss" dur="1"/> okay <pause dur="0.5"/> so let's # <pause dur="0.3"/> let's set off <pause dur="0.6"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> okay <pause dur="0.2"/> so the timetable for this morning it's quite a heavy timetable this morning we're going to start off by <pause dur="0.5"/> # having # a a a a <pause dur="0.2"/> short thirty minute lecture on inequalities in access to care <pause dur="0.6"/> then after probably just a two minute stretch <pause dur="0.4"/> and # <pause dur="0.2"/> <trunc>ti</trunc> a comfort stop we'll then <pause dur="0.2"/> follow it by another thirty minutes looking at how inequalities can be tackled <pause dur="0.9"/> then we've got a coffee break <pause dur="0.2"/> and then we'll finish off the morning looking # further at the theme of tackling inequalities in health <pause dur="0.4"/> and looking at <pause dur="0.3"/> the 
policies and initiatives that have been put in place <pause dur="0.4"/> to tackle health inqualities <pause dur="1.7"/> are there any questions about that before we start <pause dur="1.3"/> so the learning outcomes of this morning's session are outlined on <pause dur="0.3"/> page twenty-one <pause dur="1.8"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> so we're beginning then by looking at inequalities in health care <pause dur="1.3"/> what i should say is because of the difficulties of accessing <pause dur="0.3"/> the Powerpoint slides on the learning environment which seems to be a continuing problem <pause dur="0.7"/> # the slides for <pause dur="0.2"/> all of today's lectures will be <pause dur="0.2"/> photocopied <pause dur="0.3"/> and put in your pigeonholes <pause dur="0.3"/> because i'm aware that you need # the slides from today's session <pause dur="0.4"/> to help you to write your formative assignment which is due in on Friday <pause dur="0.5"/> so that's also a reminder <trunc>t</trunc> that your first formative assignment your essay plan <pause dur="0.3"/> <trunc>i</trunc> <pause dur="0.3"/> is to be handed in by four o'clock on Friday <pause dur="1.6"/> okay but let's begin then by talking about inequalities in health care <pause dur="3.8"/> so to <pause dur="0.6"/> first of all i just want you to think about what we mean by the terms <pause dur="0.2"/> equality <pause dur="0.2"/> and equity <pause dur="4.2"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> 
we've been looking at <pause dur="0.9"/> over # a period of weeks <pause dur="1.3"/> the fact that <pause dur="0.2"/> there is substantial evidence that documents that we have wide <pause dur="0.4"/> inequalities in health in in terms of inequalities in health status and health experience <pause dur="0.3"/> between different social groups <pause dur="2.9"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> but the evidence suggests that lack of access to health care <pause dur="1.1"/> only makes a minor contribution <pause dur="0.3"/> to the overall difference in mortality and morbidity <pause dur="3.1"/> but having said that <pause dur="0.8"/> it's also widely acknowledged that health services do have an important role to play <pause dur="0.5"/> in ameliorating and helping people cope with <pause dur="0.3"/> the damage to their health caused by poor material <pause dur="0.3"/> and social conditions <pause dur="0.4"/> so having said that lack of access or unequal access to health care <pause dur="0.4"/> isn't the cause of health inequalities <pause dur="0.3"/> that's not to say that they aren't an important issue <pause dur="4.9"/> but we need to bear in mind that <pause dur="0.5"/> equitable <pause dur="0.2"/> health care provision <pause dur="1.0"/> # <pause dur="2.4"/> is important <pause dur="0.6"/> rather than equality in health care provision <pause dur="0.5"/> so if we're talking about # <pause dur="0.7"/> providing people with 
access to care then we need to make sure <pause dur="0.2"/> thak ik that it's equitable according to need <pause dur="0.5"/> rather than # <pause dur="1.5"/> having it distributed equally <pause dur="0.6"/> amongst the population <pause dur="6.7"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> an equity of access to health care is a central objective <pause dur="0.4"/> of the U-K National Health Service and it has been since its inception <pause dur="0.3"/> in the mid-nineteen-forties <pause dur="2.5"/> there's strong evidence that those in <pause dur="0.2"/> poor material and social circumstances <pause dur="0.2"/> low income groups <pause dur="0.4"/> # are <trunc>li</trunc> # in particular are likely to experience <pause dur="0.5"/> the <trunc>w</trunc> poorest health status <pause dur="0.5"/> suffer <pause dur="0.2"/> # a greater number of and more serious conditions <pause dur="0.3"/> than those in better social and material circumstances we've been looking at that evidence <pause dur="0.2"/> and it's been very clear <pause dur="2.2"/> so this suggests then <pause dur="0.2"/> that # those in low income groups those in the poorest social and material conditions <pause dur="0.6"/> need would need to use health care services more than those who are better off <pause dur="2.9"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> so a key question that we need to examine and try to answer <pause dur="0.3"/> is do those with the greatest health care needs <pause dur="0.3"/> have <pause dur="0.5"/> equitable access 
to health care services do they have access <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> # to to services according to their needs <pause dur="4.9"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> so a large number <pause dur="0.2"/> of research studies have looked at this question <pause dur="0.8"/> and they have documented that there are inequities in access to health care <pause dur="1.6"/> but when we look at the evidence it shows quite a complex picture <pause dur="1.5"/> these studies show that in many areas and i mean both areas in terms of geographical areas as well as areas of service <pause dur="0.5"/> those with the greatest health needs # do have # poorer access to health care <pause dur="0.4"/> # than those who are better off <pause dur="0.2"/> and this was identified very clearly in nineteen-seventy-one by Julian Tudor Hart <pause dur="0.4"/> who identified that an inverse care law applies <pause dur="0.3"/> # to Britain <pause dur="0.8"/> and Tudor Hart said that <reading>the availability of good medical care <pause dur="0.4"/> tends to vary inversely with the need for it in the population served <pause dur="1.9"/> and the empirical evidence for this law has accumulated steadily over time</reading> <pause dur="1.2"/> but as i said <pause dur="0.5"/> the evidence is quite <pause dur="0.2"/> is complex and # <pause dur="1.0"/> there is evidence for 
inequities in health care in some areas but not in others but we're going to start off by looking at some of that <pause dur="4.0"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> so what <pause dur="0.2"/> the evidence shows us overall is that there are inequities in access to some services not all services <pause dur="2.4"/> and there's inequity in access to facilities and <pause dur="0.2"/> to treatment and care <pause dur="5.2"/> there are also inequities in the utilization of some services <pause dur="1.4"/> so the way that services are used whether they're underused and overused <pause dur="2.6"/> and there are also inequities in the availability of responsive services <pause dur="1.0"/> because it's it's important not only to have services that are there for people <pause dur="0.4"/> but for people with # substantial health care needs it's important to have services <pause dur="0.4"/> that # <pause dur="0.2"/> that they feel able to use <pause dur="0.4"/> that are accessible <pause dur="0.3"/> but also that are responsive in terms of targeted to addressing <pause dur="0.3"/> and meeting those <pause dur="0.3"/> their particular health needs in a form that are acceptable to them <pause dur="0.7"/> and that's an issue we'll be going to be talking much more about this afternoon when we look 
at <trunc>woi</trunc> working with <pause dur="0.3"/> disadvantaged # <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.9"/> patients and disadvantaged communities <pause dur="3.6"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> but let's <pause dur="0.2"/> first of all look at inequalities in access to primary health care <pause dur="0.6"/> and what we're going to see is a bit of a mixed bag <pause dur="4.6"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> the reviews # of <trunc>r</trunc> of that have looked at # <pause dur="0.4"/> the breadth of research in <trunc>d</trunc> <trunc>i</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> in in # <pause dur="0.6"/> access to primary care <pause dur="0.5"/> suggest that there probably now is a pro poor bias in G-P consultations and that's to <trunc>ex</trunc> <pause dur="0.3"/> to some extent what <pause dur="0.3"/> what you would expect <pause dur="0.9"/> there are higher consultation rates # <pause dur="0.2"/> for those people who are ill amongst disadvantaged groups <pause dur="2.5"/> and that this occurs even when need is controlled for <pause dur="2.5"/> but there is still continuing evidence that <pause dur="0.7"/> some <pause dur="0.2"/> marginalized groups have difficulty # accessing primary health care <pause dur="1.1"/> in particular if you think about it the kinds of groups that have difficulty in accessing primary health care <pause dur="0.3"/> are groups like asylum seekers <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> people who are homeless <pause dur="0.6"/> # who because they don't have # a place of residence <pause dur="0.3"/> may 
find it <trunc>ax</trunc> # difficult to get on to G-P lists <pause dur="0.8"/> travellers <pause dur="0.4"/> # <trunc>s</trunc> many # G-Ps are # <pause dur="0.9"/> don't register travelling families <pause dur="0.4"/> and and as <trunc>tr</trunc> families are travelling round they often find when they <pause dur="0.3"/> they settle for a short period it's difficult <trunc>t</trunc> to get access to G-P services in particular areas <pause dur="3.4"/> some <pause dur="0.3"/> trusts and # <pause dur="0.2"/> and groups of G-Ps # have come together to provide specialized health services for these groups <pause dur="0.3"/> to try and # <pause dur="1.0"/> get round the difficult issue that some of these groups may have <pause dur="0.3"/> in terms of registering with a G-P <pause dur="0.4"/> so for example <pause dur="0.4"/> Coventry # <pause dur="0.6"/> <trunc>i</trunc> in Coventry <trunc>tr</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> Coventry Primary Health Care Trust has a particular <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> # specialist service to provide health care to asylum seekers and refugees <pause dur="4.2"/> but there's also evidence of inequitable access to particular services <pause dur="0.4"/> so for example there's some evidence that # <pause dur="1.1"/> there are inequities in access to health visiting services for people in disadvantaged groups <pause dur="0.5"/> and Reading and Allen in <trunc>nineteen-ni</trunc> ninety-seven looked at access # for 
those with the poorest health needs to health <pause dur="0.2"/> health visiting services <pause dur="0.5"/> and although they found that <pause dur="0.2"/> some account had been taken of the fact that <pause dur="0.3"/> # those in # living in disadvantaged areas had greater health needs and there had been some attempt <pause dur="0.5"/> to # provide extra health visiting services in those areas <pause dur="0.4"/> the additional # resources that had been put in were nowhere near <pause dur="0.3"/> adequate enough to meet the substantial needs <pause dur="0.4"/> # and <pause dur="0.3"/> # health needs # and care needs of those families in those areas so although there were additional health visitors <pause dur="0.3"/> there weren't enough health visitors to meet <pause dur="0.3"/> the service requirement <pause dur="3.8"/> there's also evidence of underutilization of preventive services in primary care <pause dur="1.5"/> so there's a # people like McCormick # Majeed and Goddard and Smith <pause dur="0.5"/> have looked at the utilization of services in primary care <pause dur="0.3"/> and show and and their work suggests that manual social groups are less likely to attend their G-P practice <pause dur="0.3"/> for preventative care <pause dur="0.5"/> so although we've 
got <pause dur="0.4"/> # high <trunc>cons</trunc> consultation rates when people are ill when it comes to <pause dur="0.3"/> attending for preventive health care <pause dur="0.3"/> then <pause dur="0.2"/> uptake # is much much lower <pause dur="2.3"/> and also # <pause dur="1.6"/> there's <pause dur="0.7"/> also evidence of uptake of poor uptake for things like # screening services and particular preventive care like immunization rates <pause dur="1.1"/> child health screening and cervical screening <pause dur="4.7"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> let's <pause dur="0.9"/> move from primary care then to look at secondary care and what happens when we look at access to secondary care <pause dur="2.1"/> well <pause dur="2.8"/> the studies that have looked at access to secondary care <pause dur="0.5"/> suggest that # the systematic reviews that have been done suggest that there's no evidence of inequities in <pause dur="0.3"/> the total number of referrals <pause dur="0.2"/> or referrals for <pause dur="0.2"/> for medical conditions that are made <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> to clinicians in secondary care <pause dur="0.5"/> so <pause dur="0.4"/> that's when clinical need is controlled for <pause dur="1.0"/> so the total number of of referrals <pause dur="0.3"/> and referrals <trunc>com</trunc> # medical <pause dur="0.4"/> conditions seem to be according to need <pause dur="2.3"/> but when you look at # referrals for some specific 
conditions <trunc>ref</trunc> requiring surgery <pause dur="0.4"/> then there's some strong evidence that those with the greatest needs have the poorest access <pause dur="0.8"/> and Chaturvedi and <trunc>bensh</trunc> Ben-Shlomo's <trunc>s</trunc> study <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> they've looked at several areas of access to care <pause dur="0.5"/> # they've looked at # access and surgery for arthritis of the hip and their work showed <pause dur="0.4"/> that # <pause dur="0.3"/> if you were disadvantaged <pause dur="0.4"/> # then you were less likely to be referred for surgery <pause dur="0.3"/> <trunc>th</trunc> # # <pause dur="0.7"/> <trunc>f</trunc> for <pause dur="0.3"/> hip surgery than those who were better off <pause dur="1.5"/> regardless of need <pause dur="3.6"/> there <trunc>als</trunc> also evidence for inequalities in access to inpatient treatment <pause dur="1.6"/> and again there's a number of studies that have documented this <pause dur="1.4"/> disadvantaged patients are less likely to be investigated # with <pause dur="0.2"/> # using <trunc>coro</trunc> coronary angiography <pause dur="0.5"/> and less likely to be referred for coronary artery bypass grafts <pause dur="0.2"/> than those who live in more advantaged area <pause dur="0.5"/> and again this is quite well documented in research by Ben-Shlomo <pause dur="0.4"/> and Chaturvedi <pause dur="0.2"/> in nineteen-ninety-five and Payne and 
Saul in nineteen-ninety-seven <pause dur="2.1"/> there's also evidence that # <pause dur="0.5"/> patients from disadvantaged areas <pause dur="0.3"/> wait longer for cardiac surgery once they have been referred and once they have been identified as having a clinical need <pause dur="0.5"/> # than those who were better off and this is because they're less likely <pause dur="0.3"/> to have their operations # identified <pause dur="0.3"/> classified as of urgent priority <pause dur="0.4"/> and the wait was something like three or four weeks longer <pause dur="3.5"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> so we've documented <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> a complex pattern of inequalities in access to <pause dur="0.2"/> to care both in primary care <pause dur="0.3"/> and to secondary care <pause dur="2.2"/> so how do we explain <pause dur="0.2"/> inequalities in health care <pause dur="2.3"/> well again <pause dur="0.5"/> the reasons for # <pause dur="0.4"/> inequities in health care again quite complex and <trunc>muls</trunc> multifaceted <pause dur="4.5"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> there's little doubt that those who are <trunc>disad</trunc> materially and socially disadvantaged <pause dur="0.4"/> # <trunc>ec</trunc> experience particular barriers to seeking and receiving health care <pause dur="0.5"/> and these barriers are both financial <pause dur="0.7"/> geographical <pause dur="0.4"/> social <pause dur="0.4"/> and cultural barriers <pause dur="4.4"/> and these <trunc>we</trunc> <pause dur="0.3"/> this afternoon we're going 
to look at # these barriers in much more detail and look at some of the ways that these barriers to <pause dur="0.4"/> # seeking and receiving health care <pause dur="0.4"/> can <pause dur="0.2"/> be reduced for those who have the greatest health care needs so i'm not going to say any more about those things now <pause dur="4.4"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> another possible reason is the attitudes of health care workers <pause dur="0.5"/> certainly research that has looked at the attitudes of a of a number of of groups mainly health visitors <pause dur="0.2"/> # social workers <pause dur="0.3"/> # health promotion workers <pause dur="0.4"/> # has suggests suggests <pause dur="0.2"/> that <pause dur="0.3"/> there are particular views about # <pause dur="1.2"/> those with the greatest needs those in the poorest conditions that are held by health workers which may mean they're not offering <pause dur="0.3"/> the kinds of services and the level of services that those people need <pause dur="1.0"/> # there are notions that # of undeserving poor not all groups in in in <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> <trunc>socia</trunc> poor social material conditions are viewed in the same way <pause dur="0.3"/> some groups are seen as more deserving than others <pause dur="1.0"/> you can probably can anybody think 
of those any groups that might be seen as particularly undeserving </u><pause dur="2.9"/> <u who="ss" trans="pause"> <gap reason="inaudible, multiple speakers" extent="1 sec"/> </u><pause dur="0.5"/> <u who="nf0262" trans="pause"> hear some mutterings </u><pause dur="1.9"/> <u who="sm0267" trans="pause"> smokers </u><pause dur="0.2"/> <u who="nf0262" trans="pause"> smokers might be one can you think of any more </u><pause dur="0.7"/> <u who="sf0265" trans="pause"> drug dealers </u><pause dur="0.4"/> <u who="nf0262" trans="pause"> pardon <pause dur="0.5"/> drug dealers yeah <pause dur="0.2"/> yeah </u><pause dur="3.7"/> <u who="sf0266" trans="pause"> prisoners </u><pause dur="0.4"/> <u who="nf0262" trans="pause"> pardon </u><pause dur="0.6"/> <u who="sf0266" trans="pause"> prisoners </u><u who="nf0262" trans="latching"> prisoners yeah <pause dur="0.2"/> maybe maybe some asylum seekers <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> those particular groups who don't behave in the way that # we might think they should behave <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> there's also possibly negative stereotypes for particular minority ethnic groups <pause dur="0.4"/> groups that are <trunc>li</trunc> more likely to be seen as deserving maybe groups like mothers with young children <pause dur="0.3"/> but there there # <pause dur="0.2"/> it's <trunc>proba</trunc> probable that the attitudes of health care workers <pause dur="0.3"/> # and the way that they perceive particular groups of patients <pause dur="0.4"/> # may mean that they don't offer services or the or appropriate services to specific groups of disadvantaged families <pause dur="4.7"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> also <pause dur="0.6"/> # an explanation is likely to be related to the 
knowledge of health care workers <pause dur="1.1"/> first of all that workers may including <pause dur="0.2"/> doctors may <pause dur="0.8"/> fail to recognize or understand the health needs of disadvantaged groups why has it done that hang on <pause dur="0.6"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> let's go back  there we go <pause dur="0.9"/> # <pause dur="2.5"/> because of <trunc>knowl</trunc> because of lack of knowledge that their their health needs <trunc>n</trunc> may be greater <pause dur="0.5"/> or <trunc>n</trunc> <trunc>n</trunc> knowledge and lack of understanding about their how their health care knowledge can be addressed and of course <pause dur="0.4"/> a key # learning outcome for this module <pause dur="0.4"/> is that both # <pause dur="0.2"/> both from your university based teaching and your <pause dur="0.2"/> your community based teaching <pause dur="0.4"/> is that you will develop a body of knowledge <pause dur="0.3"/> which will enable you to recognize and understand <pause dur="0.3"/> the health needs of those who have the greatest health needs in our society <pause dur="1.5"/> so it's <unclear>fairly</unclear> to recognize or or understand health needs but also lack of knowledge about how to address <pause dur="0.2"/> the specific health needs <pause dur="0.4"/> # through the development of responsive services <pause dur="0.4"/> 
and again this afternoon we're going to look at <pause dur="0.3"/> # those issues in much more detail <pause dur="1.6"/> # <pause dur="2.3"/> an example of # <pause dur="1.3"/> this <trunc>i</trunc> of of <pause dur="0.3"/> of practitioners in a # failure to address specific health needs through the development of responsive services <pause dur="0.5"/> was thrown up by this study <pause dur="0.2"/> # which by is Feder et al in in two-thousand-and-two <pause dur="0.5"/> which looked at and it's this is # in the British Medical Journal where you'll find <pause dur="0.4"/> lots and lots of articles on inequalities and inequities in access to care so that's a very good <pause dur="0.4"/> place to go if you put in the terms <trunc>i</trunc> # <pause dur="0.3"/> inequality in access to care you'll throw up thousands and thousands of references <pause dur="1.2"/> but this study looked at # <pause dur="1.5"/> tried to identify # <pause dur="1.0"/> why there were lower coronary <trunc>o</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> or looked at coronary revasculize <trunc>revascu</trunc> <pause dur="0.9"/> revascularization <pause dur="0.2"/> for # <pause dur="0.9"/> different groups of patients <pause dur="0.6"/> so by revascularization we mean access to angioplasty and to coronary <trunc>art</trunc> coronary artery bypass grafts and this study showed <pause dur="0.4"/> that # <pause dur="1.1"/> people of South Asian origin had <pause dur="0.8"/> 
lower <pause dur="0.9"/> # <pause dur="1.2"/> rates of <pause dur="0.2"/> of # angiopasty and coronary artery bypass grafts <pause dur="0.4"/> than white patients <pause dur="0.3"/> but this didn't appear to be explained by <pause dur="0.2"/> physician bias because <pause dur="0.4"/> the study # <pause dur="0.4"/> <trunc>look</trunc> asked groups of physicians <pause dur="0.2"/> to <pause dur="0.3"/> identify # <pause dur="0.2"/> groups of patients from the notes # without showing people's ethnic <trunc>stat</trunc> without showing the patient's ethnic status <pause dur="0.4"/> to <pause dur="0.5"/> from the clinical data to decide whether particular patients <pause dur="0.3"/> needed revascularization <pause dur="0.7"/> # so this wasn't explained by physician bias <pause dur="0.4"/> but may be explained but they were suggesting # <trunc>m</trunc> <pause dur="0.7"/> that <pause dur="1.6"/> it the lower rates were <trunc>ex</trunc> <pause dur="0.8"/> explained by the fact that <pause dur="0.3"/> South Asian <pause dur="0.2"/> patients were less likely to <pause dur="0.2"/> # go on to be <pause dur="0.5"/> to have <trunc>angio</trunc> angioplasties or coronary artery 
bypass grafts <pause dur="0.4"/> possibly because of the culture and language barriers <pause dur="0.3"/> and that physicians <pause dur="0.3"/> that they they felt were there and that the physicians needed to find a way of <pause dur="0.4"/> # reducing these barriers so that <pause dur="0.2"/> patients this particular group of patients <pause dur="0.4"/> # would understand the need for <pause dur="0.3"/> and feel more able to # receive the <pause dur="0.3"/> # the kind of of # surgical procedures <pause dur="0.3"/> that # was being <trunc>idenif</trunc> identified as as as as clinically important for them <pause dur="2.5"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> okay <pause dur="0.8"/> we're going to have a two minute break now <pause dur="0.3"/> # before we look at how inequalities can be tackled <pause dur="0.3"/> so we'll just have a two minute stretch and comfort break
