<u who="sf5272">okay so we're going to start off talking about hypertension okay so blood pressure is a biological variable that is characteristic to each individual and # within a population the B-P is distributed around a mean level but it does produce an asymmetrical curve because more individuals have high blood pressure than a low one and factors that determine the levels of B-P within a population are things like age and ethnicity # the classification of hypertension is sort of a controversial issue but the W-H-O has said it's about a hundred and sixty over ninety-five millimetres of mercury but i think U-S guidelines have said that it's a hundred and forty over ninety # despite these different values it is known that the risk of mortality and morbidity does rise progressively with increase in systolic and diastolic pressures # if someone does come in with a high blood pressure it's important that you # take subsequent readings and just <trunc>ta</trunc>  and don't take the first one and they should be at least a week apart okay so our case study is Mr G and he's a forty-eight year old male who presented with a two week history of neck stiffness and one episode of vomiting and when his B-P was taken it was found to be two-hundred and twenty-two over a hundred and forty-six and he was an unknown hypertensive okay so the history of the presenting complaint was neck stiffness on waking which was getting progressively worse over the last two weeks and he was having pain on movement which was limiting this # he had no associated nausea # no rash or photosensitivity no headaches blurring of vision or loss of consciousness he had no significant past medical history and he'd had no operations he was on no medication and had no known drug allergies however there was a history of heart disease # he lives alone and he's an electrician his hobbies are walking and he smokes approximately ten a day for the last twenty thirty years and he does drink in excess of forty sixty units a week of alcohol okay so the systems review was unremarkable except for occasional indigestion cramp that he experiences # in either leg usually in the morning and palpitations that were due to anxiety and he had complained of approximately six-month history of slight fatigue that he thought was age-related # on <trunc>physi</trunc>  physical examination <trunc>o</trunc>  on admission his B-P was two hundred and twenty-two over <trunc>forty-si</trunc> a hundred and forty-six and even after treatment when we <trunc>ex</trunc>  we examined him it was still a hundred and eighty-four over a hundred and five # on fundoscopy there was found to be bilateral A-V nipping which i'll talk about later and there was no other significant findings okay so fundoscopy is an essential part of an examination on a hypertensive patient # and the abnormalities can be graded as follows so grade one it shows tortuous arteries within # with thick shiny walls grade two is A-V nipping plus # grade one and grade three is flame haemorrhages and cotton wool spots plus grade two and grade four is papilloedema plus grade three okay and i'm just going to show you a picture now of A-V nipping and so this is looking at the artery and the vein within the back of the eye and as you can see here just a slight kinking and narrowing where the artery and the vein cross over okay so now i'm just going to talk about causes of hypertension # there it's either like primary or secondary hypertension and primary otherwise known as essential hypertension counts for ninety per cent of causes of hypertension and it's a multifactorial etiology but recognised factors include genetic factors # foetal factors such as low birth weight and environmental factors such as obesity alcohol high sodium intake and possibly stress # <trunc>it</trunc>  it's known that diabetes and hypertension are linked but just recently # a syndrome X has been linked with # hypertension although the mechanism underlying this is not known but syndrome X includes hyperinsulinemia glucose intolerance a reduced H-D-L cholesterol hypertriglyceridemia and central obesity and it is known that this is a major risk factor for # <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> vascular disease so secondary hypertension needs to be considered # even though it counts for approximately ten per cent of causes of hypertension because you can possibly treat these # and renal causes that count for about eighty per cent of secondary hypertension and the reason it does this is it causes an elevation in the B-P due to the sodium and water retention causes include diabetic retinopathy chronic glomerulonephritis <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> polycystic polycystic disease tubulo-interstitial nephritis and reno-vascular # disease and endocrine causes include Cohn's syndrome which is # results in an excess of # aldosterone there's adrenal hyperplasia pheochromocytoma which # results in sort of noradrenalin adrenaline secreting tumours and Cushing's syndrome okay other causes # are sort of drug causes such as oral contraceptive pill and steroids and in pregnant women they can develop something called pre-eclampsia which is hypertension in pregnancy with proteinuria and this is a medical emergency so now Andy is going to carry on talking about Mr G and talk about the investigations that took place</u>
<u who="sm5277">okay # right so the investigations were carried out in order to uncover # any treatable causes of secondary # hypertension so got the full blood count urine analysis for protein and red cell casts U's and E's creatinine # blood glucose is important because # diabetes # is associated with # renal vascular disease and atherosclerosis # which may contribute to hypertension serum cholesterol # a chest X-ray looking for enlarged hearts and the E-C-G which # acts as a screen for # left ventricular hypertrophy # which may be a complication of # hypertension right # so in the case of Mr G there was a number of # abnormal results his potassium was # lowered which # may be indicative of hyperaldosteronism # since like the excess aldosterone causes # hypokalemia as well as sodium retention so # that needs to be investigated the urea and creatinine were levels were high which may indicate renal <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> so on further investigation creatinine clearance was found to be low it's normally in the range of about a hundred and ten to a hundred and fifty # mils per minute and renal ultrasound however found # no obvious pathologies so this wasn't really in keeping with the # <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> disease theory so # the cholesterol was in the normal range so he didn't have this additional risk factor for # heart disease E-C-G showed sinus tachycardia no left ventricular hypertrophy and there was no other significant findings okay so differential diagnosis it's likely to be essential hypertension due to the asymptomatic presentation # significant factors to consider in the case of Mr G were his excessive alcohol intake # # and alcohol is one of the most common causes of secondary hypertension and it's thought to cause this by raising <trunc>cardia</trunc>  cardiac output and heart rates # by # a rapid rise in # epinephrine and cortisol levels okay # it's also important to consider # other causes of secondary hypertension and in the case of Mr G the most relevant ones were renal dysfunction and adrenal hypoplasia # but # it's it's also important to consider the fact that # the renal dysfunction could have been caused by the hypertension # itself # and so it's # it's it's sort of the converse theory really # and this this when this occurs when you get sort of # damage to end organs # this is due to # <trunc>s</trunc>  sustained hypertension so i'm just going to talk a little bit about that so the most common sort of organs to be damaged are the brain and the heart so in the brain there's risk of throm- # thrombotic or haemorrhagic strokes # in the heart # left ventricular hypertrophy is a compensatory response to chronically elevated blood pressure # and heart failure may relate to left ventricular hypertrophy or to premature coronary disease # renal failure may also result # and this is caused by reno-vascular damage and glomerulo loss okay so in terms of treatment for # Mr G the aims are to gradually reduce the blood pressure to # under a hundred and forty over eighty-five # and the emphasis was on a gradual reduction because # a rapid reduction in blood # pressure # can be fatal like in the context of # a stroke for example # lifestyle changes are important so a low fat diet weight reduction exercise smoking cessation and most importantly for mister G # reduced alcohol intake # and there's a number of pharmacological measures which can be # used to treat patients # and in the case of Mr G it was decided to use combination therapy so he was # treated with # the following drugs so diuretic bendrofluazide # calcium channel blocker # amlodipine and which # acts as a vasodilator # two different types of beta-blocker plus one atenolol # the second one labetalol has an additional arteriolar vasodilating action which lowers the # peripheral resistance an alpha blocker # which acts as a vasodilator as well doxazosin # and that was it thank you</u>
<u who="su"><gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/></u>
<u who="sm5277">any questions yeah</u>
<u who="su">what about his neck pain</u>
<u who="sm5277">his neck pain # it sort of disappeared yeah <vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" dur="2"/></u>
<u who="sf5272">when # on examination his neck pain had gone</u>
<u who="sm5277">yeah</u>
<u who="sf5272">so he didn't actually have any neck pain so they don't know if it was like a musculoskeletal thing and then when he actually came in that's when they just discovered that he was hypertensive but on examination his range of <trunc>movem</trunc>  movement was fine and he wasn't complaining of any neck pain</u>
<u who="sf5274">what was the first sort of grade of that retinopathy thing</u>
<u who="sf5272">what was the first grade</u>
<u who="sm5277">i'll go back to it if you want</u>
<u who="sf5272">it was like tortuous arteries an increase in blood pressure basically which is then obviously going in any artery which goes into the eye</u>
<u who="sm5278">can i just see the drug list again for a moment please</u>
<u who="sm5277">yeah</u>
<u who="sm5279">just tell me you've put it on the web and then <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/></u>
<u who="su">why is it necessary for him to be on atenolol and labetalol</u>
<u who="sf5272"># when he was in there his blood pressure would not come down it it started to come down and then it would just shoot back up again so they initially started him off only on i think it was thiazide and a beta blocker the atenanol # but then because it kept going back up again they started to use more combination therapy and they thought because it has the arteriolar vasodilating action they thought it might be helpful so they didn't actually put him on labetalol until later on</u>
<u who="sf5273">okay right # more hypertension basically Neema and i are going to talk about that so # not just a straightforward case of hypertension this one it's something a little more over and above so Judy's already mentioned a few things about hypertension basically it is impossible to define exactly where you're going to cut off these people are hypertensive and these people aren't but # patients who have been given a diagnosis of hypertension it usually has been based on values that have been selected in trials and so on # where above that above that blood pressure there is actually proven health benefit to treatment versus the costs or because a B-P above that level is actually going to give you a significantly increased # level of # risk of adverse events basically so there have been some British guidelines published on this and so treatment basically is recommended for anyone with malignant hypertension which is sort of a sudden increased risk in B-P # patients who have sustained pressures over a hundred and sixty over a hundred which would be on the sort of three subsequent measurements # for patients who fall in the range slightly below that a hundred and forty over ninety and so on # then you have to make the decisions based upon co-morbidities # risk of coronary events from other things such as other risk factors like atherosclerosis and things that we all know about and also concurrent diabetes or end organ damage the presence of those kind of things so # our case study is Mr P-S i'm going to talk about this in a bit of a slightly roundabout fashion rather than talking about his presentation to begin with just to give you some of the background because it kind of makes more sense once you actually know what his history is so background to Mr P-S he's a male aged sixty-six a retired engineer who lives with his wife he's a non-smoker and only drinks occasional alcohol and he doesn't seem to have very many risk factors for hypertension there but in his past medical history he actually has been diagnosed with hypertension since sort of roughly nine years ago and his B-P is usually around the level of a hundred and fifty over ninety so not <trunc>dra</trunc>  dramatically elevated like we've just seen but still high enough to warrant treatment # for about three or four years he's been suffering # periods of super ventricular arrhythmias which i'll come to in a moment and also peripheral vascular disease suffering intermittent claudication on on walking and so on and other slightly less relevant things <trunc>cholecyst</trunc>  systectomy and appendicectomy some years ago so his drug history and treatment includes what you can see here his atrial fibrillation was treated with a couple of episodes of # DC cardioversion to put him back into sinus rhythm # which was successful for a time but usually tended to relapse and eventually it converted itself into an atrial flutter in two-thousand-two so he was sent for # a procedure at the Queen Elizabeth in Birmingham which is a radio-frequency ablation which i don't think i know much about so i won't try and explain that to you # the drugs that he was taking on presentation were an A-C-E inhibitor a beta-blocker and an anti-platelet drug aspirin like most people seem to be so his presentation he was actually admitted by ambulance his presenting complaint was that he'd lost the use of both legs very suddenly and also had lost all sensation below the waist and this had happened about three or four hours before presenting in the morning # to sort of describe how the onset actually happened it was very sudden he <trunc>des</trunc>  # described a sort of a dramatic pain suddenly radiating from his face down his whole body towards his legs and particularly noted chest and back pain which he described as a ripping quality you might be able to see where i'm going here but # anyway it resulted in loss of sensation and movement in both legs # so on examination his Glasgow coma scale was fifteen out of fifteen so he was alert and talkative and he was quite with it # but basically was in a lot of pain and quite ill at the same time notably # his chest was clear his abdomen was soft and tender and he described this back pain but that wasn't tender no sort of musculoskeletal element there and there had been no history of previous trauma or anything to suggest that but basically the warning signs came when you examined his cardiovascular system he had no femoral pulses and actually no pulses in the lower limbs at all on either side and # his neurological assessment showed that sensation was absent in the right and left lower leg from the knee down and also much diminished in the lateral thighs as well # movement and reflexes were absent in both legs so obviously quite a worrying picture fairly dramatic the impression that was recorded at presentation was that this was probably an acute vascular event # an occlusion and they originally suspected that it might be a saddle embolus sitting over the bifurcation of the aortas and obviously blocking off # both of the sort of common iliac vessels and everything below that level # differential really the only other thing that's included is aortic dissection so for some reason they didn't actually assess him any further until the following day which seems a bit odd in the circumstances but at that time on examination his leg sensation had returned actually so that's a good thing # his foot pulses were weak but palpable legs were cold with poor capillary refill # his radial pulses the left pulse was found to be stronger than the right which # we might be able to explain when we come to what was found subsequently and his heart sounds were soft # but # heart sounds one and two were both audible and with a soft early diastolic murmur</u>
<u who="su">had he had any treatment sorry</u>
<u who="sf5273">sorry</u>
<u who="su">had he had any treatment</u>
<u who="sf5273">no not at this point quite bizarrely so the next thing that happened is he was sent for a C-T scan and # i'm not sure what they were expecting to find but what they did find was a type A aortic dissection extending right from the very root of his aorta down to the bifurcations so pretty drastic kind of dissection there # it's a DeBakey type one Neema's going to mention later on what that actually means so when you look at the anatomy you can see that a <trunc>d</trunc>  dissection of that extent's actually going to involve a lot of branches of the aorta obviously it involved the right coronary origin so obviously affecting the blood supply to the heart itself the left common carotid the left subclavian origin and the brachiocephalic trunk and coeliac origin and it extended along the superior mesenteric artery but that wasn't actually majorly compromised and involved the left renal origin and the inferior <trunc>me</trunc>  mesenteric artery and he did actually suffer some subsequent kidney failure so in of the left kidney so we'll see about that in a moment # the distal aorta obviously severely compromised no blood flow having got to his legs at the initial presentation so they did actually commence treatment at this point <trunc>g</trunc>  gave him some heparin thank god and basically rushed him for some emergency surgery to repair the dissection so the risks of this surgery basically it's very high if you're if you're not going to operate then it's pretty drastic and a lot of patients die i'm not entirely sure of the figures because obviously aortic dissections each to their own they all differ in their extent but for something that that drastic you really you are going to have to have surgery there's no two ways about it so the surgery itself mortality's approximately twenty per cent there's obviously a risk of stroke paraplegia and kidney failure as we said because <trunc>ob</trunc>  obviously all this surgery involves clamping vessels and going on <trunc>p</trunc>  bypass and things like that so the outcome of the treatment itself the surgery whilst they were actually sending him into bypass he had his first cardiac arrest # but they did manage to pull him back from that one and continue with the operation long enough to give him a a knitted graft whatever # Gelscal triaxial graft i think Doctor Shiu could tell you more about that than i could # they only repaired actually the proximal aorta sort of in the ascending region which # would kind of cut out the bit the opening as it were to the dissection they didn't actually repair the entire length of the aorta because that would be very complicated with all the branches and so on so if you can imagine that in your head's # they had to re-suspend the aortic valve which is quite common when # the ascending aorta's involved because that can sort of either the root of the aorta can be dilated and so on which can compromise the valve function they also drained the pericardial effusion and took him to an I-C-U at which point he had his second cardiac arrest including a <trunc>su</trunc>  sudden drop in blood pressure so they rapidly opened his chest and basically found that he had a huge clot in his right atrium which they extracted and after which he managed to sort of stabilise again # suffered some subsequent tachyarrhythmia which were treated with <trunc>ad</trunc>  amiodarone and he also had a creatinine rise and was <trunc>sub</trunc>  subsequently found to have had left kidney failure from probably resulting from the original dissection rather than the surgery # so the outcome happily in the end he for some reason it was a miracle seeing as he walked into our clinic and has no persistent neurological defects he has palpable femoral pulses and palpable foot pulses with a good perfusion and basically's very lucky to be alive i think but that's a rather dramatic presentation of hypertension for you so over to Neema</u>
<u who="sm5280">okay so i'm just going to talk about # aortic dissection which the majority of you probably all know like a bit about it it's generally where there's # a tear in the intima and blood can blood can surge between the two layers or two of the three layers of the aortic wall and as a result when the blood goes between the layers you create a another lumen so you get a a true and a false lumen occurring and this can happen to a variable extent along the length of the aorta generally in an antrograde direction which is downwards to anyone who didn't know what antrograde is like me and so in this case it happened throughout the whole length of the aorta # it's also # well i'm not sure worthwhile to know but up to an eighth of cases there is no intimal tear in somebody with aortic dissection from the literature that i read and this can happen when # the vaso vasorum the the small vessels that supply nutrients to the wall of the aorta they can rupture and you can get an intramural haematoma so there was actually no insult to the # intima aortic dissections are three times more common in men than in women they're more common in black and less common in Asian people and about three-quarters of aortic dissection occur between the ages of forty and seventy okay as the dissection <trunc>advanta</trunc>  advances down the down the length of the aorta it can occlude arteries that happen to branch off so consequences of this can include a stroke and a heart attack sudden abdominal pain lower back pain and nerve damage so factors that can predispose somebody to getting aortic dissections # # mainly hypertension which is found in the great majority of people with aortic dissection atherosclerosis # cystic medial necrosis which # i couldn't really tell you much about i think it's just a pathology of the # of the tunica media where you get a loss of elastin and weakness in fibres and you get some mucoid polysaccharide build up there but that's not important but you you see it in conditions such as Marfan's syndrome Ehlers-Danlos syndrome and something you will never need to know about but <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> but there's some other causes as well aortic stenosis prosthetic aortic valve trauma pregnancy and there's a list of other causes as well so the types of dissection there's two different types of classification there's a DeBakey classification and there's the Stanford classification and as we've said <trunc>th</trunc>  our case Mr P-S i think he was called # has had a DeBakey type one which involves the entire aorta type two just affects the ascending aorta and type three just the descending aorta the Stanford classification is a bit simpler whether it involves the ascending aorta or it doesn't so if it does then it has to be a type A if it doesn't it's a type B simple as that so what are the clinical presentations by far and away the most common presentation is that of chest pain the pain is sharp tearing intractable chest pain which is abrupt and of maximal intensity straight from the onset which is unlike what we learnt last week ischemic pain which has a crescendo quality to it two-thirds of patients have a murmur or a bruit of aortic regurgitation and this is where you get a circumferential # lesion basically from the dissection which alters the shape of the aortic valve causing aortic regurgitation and normally in people with aortic regurgitation they'll get # left ventricular dilatation in chronic cases but somebody like this where it's very sudden sudden and acute aortic regurgitation can cause left <trunc>re</trunc>  # left ventricular failure other clinical presentations you should look for is somebody who is hypertensive i.e. somebody who's got a high predisposition to getting an aortic dissection who is now hypotensive and shocked on examination they may have asymmetrical pulses # because you can get pulse deficits where arteries are getting occluded basically which may appear and disappear over time they may have pulmonary oedema neurological deficits and cardiac tamponade so looking at imaging on chest X-rays you can see all those different stuff which to be honest i wouldn't be able to tell you what they look like on a chest X-ray apart from the picture on the far on the top right you can see mediastinal widening i can't really see anything else # M-R-I you can see an intimal flap or a slow flow or clot in the false lumen which you can see on this next picture see round about here that's where the false lumen is and here you can see where the the intima has closed in and where you get accumulation of blood in the outer layer so the prognosis the long term survival of somebody who's survived an acute episode is sixty per cent over five years and it's forty per cent over a ten year period however that's if they manage to get through the acute <trunc>ph</trunc>  the acute problem seventy five per cent of untreated people die within a fortnight a third of them # from late deaths of the complications of dissection and two-thirds are due to other diseases which i i'm not quite sure what they are because i couldn't find them but # before i go onto treatment # something to do with prognosis is that i read somewhere that for every hour you leave somebody with # a dissection untreated increase their mortality by one per cent so if you leave somebody for two days untreated they'll have a fifty per cent mortality so treatment if somebody's got a dissection and you're in A and E and you see somebody the initial treatment should always be medical sorry i had to laugh at that so # because mortality is highest in the first few hours following a dissection immediate # pharmacological intervention is needed you need drugs that will lower the blood pressure so a combination of sodium nitroprusside and a beta blocker are needed # the sodium nitroprusside is a vasodilator and will reduce # vascular resistance and the beta blocker will reduce cardiac output and i've put down some doses of what you'd <trunc>typ</trunc>  typically give # to somebody but i won't leave that on it's not too important except for on here i've put propranolol a lot of doctors would probably disagree with me and say labetalol's probably a better one because it's a non-specific alpha and beta blocker so what about surgery well surgery is generally reserved for those who have dissections in the first few inches of the aorta as it comes out of the heart and it's pretty much done always in this case unless there are complications which will make surgery too risky however dissections that are further away from the heart it should always be medically treated and they probably treat it for the rest of their life # however there are some indications where you'll need to do surgery whenever there's a a leakage of blood a clot or they've got something like Marfan's syndrome # i haven't read this # the surgical mortality in major medical centres with interest in aortic dissection is about fifteen per cent and somewhat higher for distal dissections as i said before all patients # including those treated surgically should be treated medically with beta blockers calcium channel blockers and A-C-E inhibitors the most important late complications you'll get with aortic dissections is re-dissection formation of localised aneurysms # this is probably a pseudo aneurysm where you get a hole in the aorta and blood can seep in and get trapped by the soft tissues around it and also progressive aortic valve insufficiency and that's me done</u>
<u who="sf5281">i was just wondering you know when it actually # tears and the sort of dissection evolves does it literally happen like a tear or is it gradual</u>
<u who="sm5280">it happens like a tear</u>
<u who="sf5281">so it can go literally right down</u>
<u who="sm5280">well no it's well it depends on the people if somebody's got a cystic medial necrosis where there's actual pathology of the the media then you're bound to get it a lot quicker than somebody who's who's got normal aorta like the tissue's fine but hypertensive because the actual integrity of the tissue is there</u>
<u who="sf5273">i sort of think it sort of pushes itself it's way through under pressure from like you know <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> beating of the heart basically so it won't just sort of be instant but it will sort of push it's way through</u>
<u who="sm5280">so hence the need for the the beta blocker and like something to reduce vascular resistance</u>
<u who="su">how could they repair it if they only repaired the top bit and it was all the way down did they just sort of leave it and hope for the best</u>
<u who="sf5273">well if you if you imagine that the <trunc>a</trunc>  aorta's sort of you know like that the entrance to the dissection as it were is in the ascending aorta but there's no sort of entry or exit of blood through the rest of it so by repairing the entrance to the dissection the rest of it's just going to be cut off from the main lumen</u>

<u who="sm5280">well that that's more of a rupture it because when blood goes in between the two layers they can either it can either break back in to the lumen of the the vessel in which case no blood will be lost because it's just going out into between the layers and then back in it can also go out of which in that case it's effectively an aortic rupture and so will probably go to the retroperitoneal space now if blood happened to escape the retroperitoneal space into the peritoneum they're pretty much going to die if it stays in the retroperitoneum the prognosis is a lot better it holds a lot less blood</u>

<u who="sf5272"># in the end he did initially he didn't his <trunc>hyperten</trunc>  his blood pressure kept going back up again so they just tried different combinations of # medication</u>
<u who="nm5271">okay # the standard approach is really just focus on the history for a primary cause of hypertension usually that really virtually <trunc>el</trunc> eliminates the majority of so-called secondary hypertension i.e. this primary disease in other words if a patient present with kidney failure present with # chronic urinary tract infection and a history of paranephritis or something like that you know there's a renal cause there are patients who present with other medical conditions such as Cushing's disease so in the course of your other medical conditions you find hypertension you're not surprised but when you first diagnose the hypertension taking a history such as this one with actually no background chances are you're dealing with essential hypertension # now i think it's quite interesting to contrast this patient with the heart failure patient in various ways i mean the interesting thing about medicine is that given any particular disease diagnosis you want to know what is a patient's perception of his condition and how is he he's how he's going to respond to treatment or a psychological response if you think of hypertension and heart failure you can't be more contrastive the hypertensive usually don't know what the fuss is about that's a problem he has the condition but a lot of the time you have to convince him that he has it and therefore he will accept your treatment with the heart failure patient it is quite the opposite by the time you diagnose it the patient's usually symptomatic that's the case isn't it in your patient with heart failure i think it does illustrate a lot because it influences how you counsel the patient and how likely he is to comply with his medications i say that interestingly hypertensive patients are the least likely to comply with medications if you actually do surveys something like forty to sixty per cent of patients do not take their the medications according to instructions but by the time you consider heart failure then you have a much higher percentage and the reasons are very obvious in the hypertension they're not symptomatic the patient sometimes never quite convinced that he has to take these nasty medications so i think that you have a job to do there now back to # i i put up this slide and if you if you like i'll <trunc>fo</trunc>  show some prepared pictures that one shows one of the more common conditions which is really renal artery disease however that's very much age-related the older the patient the more evidence of artery disease elsewhere the more likely you'll find artery disease causing renal artery cyanosis thereby causing hypertension but of course in medical student <trunc>tex</trunc>  text books that's high up on the lists of all various causes yes it is if you look at the elderly people and it is not often that it requires any attention so it's i think it's accepted as one of the causes but usually there's evidence of widespread artery disease so probability wise again the history taking will help you if somebody has evidence of artery disease elsewhere any suggestion how it might show up in the history hands up evidence of artery disease elsewhere</u>
<gap reason="inaudible" extent="uncertain"/>
<u who="nm5271">yes i think that's one of the best ones right if you've got low intermittent claudication chances are you've got disease in your aorta and really the kidneys arteries are not far away # of course patients with # coronary artery disease and severe hypertension so i think the point is we look for is where patients do not respond now of on first presentation of course you would do various tests and the simplest one is really simply electrolyte and urea and that's pretty good pointer to any chronic renal problem in the young for example younger populations you look for evidence of kidney infection in particular in females why females because cystitis and pyelonephritis is far more common in female gender because of a urinary tract tendency to get infected so that's the kidney side definition is difficult you will find again again when you come across patients with high blood pressure you ask them they say oh my doctor last checked my blood pressure he tells me it's usually alright it is very difficult to establish whether somebody in fact one has had hypertension not treated or hasn't had hypertension and never had it checked the government is really trying a big drive in making sure that there are so-called well men clinics well women clinics that there is so-called opportunistic checking of high blood pressure i stress this because hypertension is one of those conditions that's more often diagnosed opportunistically in other words the patient goes and seek advice for something totally different check picked up # patient will seek advice for for example contraceptive pill that's definitely an indication to check the high <trunc>bl</trunc>  check the B-P of course if that's high then it's relative contraindication and a lot of the time the patient comes in for hip operations hernia operations so all these opportunities are for us to pick the diagnosis now what is normal what is abnormal strangely you will have thought that this is a condition that nobody will argue about but physicians or cardiologists themselves have been moving the goal posts so we can't blame other specialists not to be up to date and if you look at this it's pretty severe definition of normal versus abnormal and you might wonder why we're moving the goal posts if you look at this now # adults eighteen years and older so it doesn't apply to most of you here optimal one twenty systolic diastolic eighty normal up to one thirty in fact i bet you one or two of you sitting here will have that kind of reading so go home get it checked # we begin to run into real problem with the elderly and partly like all other conditions British physicians have been reluctant to <trunc>inc</trunc>  how should i say it include more patients as it were in other words they are very very prone to see a patient with say age seventy-five with blood pressure one eighty over ninety a lot a lot of primary care physicians and G-P's will just say oh well it's alright for your age or is it i'll show you the evidence it is not alright so therefore regardless of age we now recognise that blood pressure below one forty systolic is preferred and i sorry should be really not above ninety what sort of problem do we raise we may diagnose a lot of hypertension does it matter if we diagnose a lot of hypertension it doesn't why at least you will keep checking you may not treat after the first reading you may not even treat after the second reading but you will begin to at least counsel the patient and look for risk factors such as what we just discussed because hypertension's a condition a a best example of what we call preventive treatment heart failure isn't and we can talk about that later hypertension definitely is okay so we're very strict we have moved the goal posts and i will put this on the net if you want but it is of course in the text books # so it's quite severe and i'll explain to you the reasons now A-V nipping i hope you did explain what causes A-V nipping</u>
<u who="sf5272">it's the hardening of the arteries</u>
<u who="nm5271">that's right it's hardening normally the arteries and veins are quite soft in fact <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> right so really very mild grade one most people won't be able to diagnose that unless you are very very good at looking at it right and this is where great tool moderate sclerosis is increased light reflex and compression of veins at crossings this is what we mean and this is a good example there it's very simply the bigger <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> veins the smaller ones are arteries and the crossover is <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> so i won't dwell on that and of course the increasing stages where there are so-called high exudates and haemorrhages and of cause papilloedema and this is when patients begin to have visual symptoms and that's quite severe and you will see this in so really so-called hypertensive encephalopathy we very very rarely see that now fortunately partly because of this drive to pick up hypertension when it's mild and treat and it is quite interesting when i was a medical student really an acute take often includes the hypertensive crisis it is now very rare so i think the primary care system has helped left ventricular hypertrophy a lot of people worry about this and you know including very seasoned doctors how do you diagnose left ventricular hypertrophy on the E-C-G the answer is if it's overt it's very easy if it's subtle you just have to again go back to square one no don't read the history and look at the patient if somebody gives me an E-C-G and say look tell me where the left ventricular hypertrophy i just won't give the answer at all why because it the the chap's history and even the physical form influences the E-C-G and the best example would be amongst some of you i bet i will find the so-called text book measurement of left ventricular hypertrophy why louder hands up</u>

<u who="nm5271">not so much displaced subcutaneous fat is very good at # reducing voltage and vice versa if we are dealing a very thin patient you have increased voltage don't forget E-C-G is taken on the surface you're trying to draw a conclusion deduction about the heart that's one # another reason why some of you sitting here may have significant left ventricular hypertrophy on the E-C-G</u>
<u who="su">level of fitness</u>
<u who="nm5271">yes level of fitness so physiological left ventricular hypertrophy in other words what people know about is the slowing down of the heart rate but in addition it is of course a a physiological response to exercise that you have got left ventricular hypertrophy of course you won't reach this stage i use this slide to show that really if you are going to a gym regularly and you have an E-C-G like this i'd worry because you're not supposed to reach this stage and what you see here is apart from an increased voltage which is pretty obvious there is also abnormal T waves especially in V-four to V-six # it is in fact very difficult to understand why the T waves behave like that but take it from me it is a feature of very <trunc>se</trunc>  severe left ventricular hypertrophy it is doubtful whether that's reversible now but if it's not reversible that means there's something structurally wrong while you undergo physiology training you've got left ventricular hypertrophy if you train the voltage will go down in other words the # heart is quite capable of hypertrophy and then become thinner what's the difference between hypertrophy and hyperplasia</u>
<gap reason="inaudible" extent="uncertain"/>
<u who="nm5271">and when do you get hyperplasia in the heart</u>
<gap reason="inaudible" extent="uncertain"/>
<u who="nm5271">well done no never the heart muscle cells do not duplicate any more after the person's mature so all you get is <trunc>hyper</trunc>  hypertrophy in other words increase in cell size rather than increase in cell number anyway so much for that # a much more specific way if one of you come to my clinic and say your G-P's picked up your E-C-G's quite abnormal a lot of voltage i take a history you do go to the gym # but perhaps the E-C-G's a little too much for what it is so the next test is a echocardiogram # i'm not sure whether i have included i was going to put an echo there but i didn't anyway so where various investigations will be according to how how much you want to assess the patient the echocardiogram is a superb tool for establishing left ventricular hypertrophy don't look at this slide just yet it is also very good for assessing whether there are so-called end stage sorry not not end organ damage alright these are these are the terms that you want to pick up when you deal with hypertension if it's picked up early and no damage in the organ we really only refer to three serious organs the brain the heart and the kidney alright the eye is part of the brain if you like by the time you've got all the eye changes really that is end organ damage # this patient as far as i know had no renal damage and <trunc>h</trunc>  has no # is that right no kidney disease</u>

<u who="su">yep</u>
<u who="nm5271">it was in that case was there a history</u>

<u who="nm5271">or hypertension</u>
<u who="sf5273"># he was on an ACE inhibitor and a beta blocker and an anti-platelet</u>
<u who="nm5271">so he was quite vigorously treated so this come to this is the next slide alright so you have two examples where really one is early presenting minimal signs of hypertension and you have somebody who is now one into one of the really most serious complications of hypertension # but it is not unheard of put it the other way it is exceedingly rare to have aortic dissection if you weren't hypertensive so you can look at it the other way you can have a stroke you can have a heart attack you get kidney trouble without hypertension but aortic dissection would be very rare unless you have specific conditions affecting the aorta now this is a very busy slide so on the whole i don't like busy slides but it says that i've been trying to look for a slide like this for a long time i've it's only in preparing this lecture i found it and i want you to take note of it it teaches you so much on the on the horizontal axis obviously you will find that the high the blood pressure of increasing degree just look at this first column first systolic blood pressure up to one nine five cholesterol like that glucose tolerance normal no cigarette smoking E-C-G is normal so in other words this patient may take the worst case patient with a systolic B-P of <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> over one is normal it's very good now move to the next category and take this the middle category instead now same sort of blood pressure ranges one o five to one nine five instead now this is American reading and cholesterol three three five that is something like # sixty per cent above normal so it would be something like seven cholesterol or seven instead upper limit normal in this country's five and there is now mild there is now glucose intolerance in other words the patient is a diabetic but otherwise doesn't smoke and no evidence of E-C-G or rate but what it shows here this is an eight year probability per one thousand patient <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> you are now moving from something like a hundred # events to four-hundred events per thousand in other words in eight years roughly half of those patients will have a significant cardiovascular event what does that tell you hypertension per se is not so bad but if you've got all these other risk factors in the worst case really scary if you've got that kind of blood pressure systolic of one-hundred and ninety-five and what i said earlier on there are patients out there walking around aged seventy with systolic hypertension like that untreated and you have almost a certainty that within eight years you have a major cardiovascular event and of course this group has got all these but then it is not difficult to find cigarette smoking non-insulin dependant diabetes and high cholesterol some people have put a name to this condition they call it syndrome X to me it's it's very confusing i think calling it insulin resistance is probably much more # if you like specific it is suspected that this is a group of patients who otherwise # are no by self no major single risk but by the time you put it all together mild hypertension glucose intolerance usually some obesity and you have a very major cardiovascular risk what that tells you is so-called the multiplying effect of <trunc>m</trunc>  of coronary risk factors in other words by the time you add things together they multiply rather than just addition as it happens there are very few patients in this category it seems as if really things can be grouped together in this fashion there by the time you look at if there are hypertensives in fact most of them are from this column to the right which goes back to the concept of so-called glu- glucose intolerance may be a grouped condition are they inherited together or affecting the genes together and this is now the most fashionable hypothesis now it's quite important for you to know this can now be called now the Barker hypothesis that among the peasant Western population i stress that for the moment there there is an increasing prevalence of people with this particular syndrome by themselves each of the risk factors don't seem very severe but they are lumped together as a group anybody ever read the Barker hypothesis as to what is causing this upsurge of group risk and ischemic heart disease in the Western population</u>

<u who="nm5271">yeah may not may not be just with sodium right this the hypothesis is that this is maladaptation right it seems that evolution takes <trunc>c</trunc>  cares of our <trunc>i</trunc>  if our if you like # survival in a very slow way but society is changing in a fast way if you look at it like that it's fine in other words it seems and it is now being shown again and again in other emerging populations and that's why it's very important to understand if you starve a population of mice let's not talk about people for the moment starve a population of mice the next generation of mice if you keep them starved they're alright but if you now feed the next generation very well that generation will suffer tremendous # high # cholesterol <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> problems so it is very easy to understand it could be that genetic or or according to Darwinian explanation this is really how genes are supposed to work if you've got a population exposed to relative malnutrition the next generation is prepared for hardship but then there's the then the environment changes very fast instead of hardship you get Western lifestyle hamburgers and all that it's very bad news now although it may seem you know very cute as it happens it's seriously worrying all the emerging under developed countries which are becoming wealthy and China is a very good good example and even more worrying is the whole of the African continent and South America as well there's an explosion of coronary artery disease diabetes hypertension so i think this is no longer just a cute observation it's a very good animal experiment data very good and in time i'm sure we will establish something about the switching on and off of genes now because it's getting late we haven't got a lot of time i'm going to switch straight over to talk about how heart failure also brings in very interesting evolutionary ideas of maladaptation i'll just briefly hear from your heart failure stories first though</u>

<u who="nm5271">Heberden well done and # he described it very very well as well alright <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> you know definitely associated with severe gripping pain with instruction which is relieved by rest unfortunately for some years it's the cardiologist's fault they come across patients who come in with same pain no E-C-G evidence of a <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> infarct so many years we call this unstable angina then the patients that get very confused and the other doctors get confused and they begin to use the word angina very loosely infarcts are infarcts angina's <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> fortunately we now have very specific cardiac markers called troponin T # C-K is not bad the so-called creatinine kinase in especially the <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> but anyway soon as the introduction of these very sensitive markers we now know in a patient of chest pain at rest they have a small infarct in other words we can get rid of the term unstable angina we might as well call a spade a spade it's a small infarct and chances are unless you pick these up the patient will keep on doing these small infarcts that's how they damage the heart and that's quite worrying it's almost like kidney disease isn't it if somebody has kidney disease the kidneys are losing nephron and i think we have to begin to look at the heart as losing myocytes they're not difficult concept but in medicine it seems that certain concepts are much harder to introduce than others really # possibly because kidneys easy to measure we measure kidney function with a blood test so there you are one group coronary artery disease lose muscle now i'll come back to the concept of <trunc>hy</trunc>  hypertrophy can you enlarge on what you said</u>
<u who="sf5281">i've been thinking about that</u>
<u who="nm5271">you were waiting for me to come back to you</u>
<u who="sf5281"># i guess if you're not if you're not perfusing the myocardium # there may be an <trunc>el</trunc>  element where you're not your output is less so you get a larger end diastolic volume and so there is hypertrophy as a result of that</u>
<u who="nm5271">good okay that's what cardiology have been trying to struggle with for some years yes trying to use the idea that left ventricular hypertrophy eventually runs out of it's blood supply # i think i was taught it when i was when i was medical student it's essentially rather naive idea because we do know that those of you again athletes listen # physiological hypertrophy of the same degree it's got no problem right so therefore if pure <trunc>L</trunc>  L-V-H as such by itself is shouldn't be a problem and do not deal with blood supply it is to do really how should i put it it it has to do with why there is L-V-H in the first place it seemed that if you've got <trunc>o</trunc>  overt pressure overall it's particularly bad for the myocardium if you've got # if you see in this physiological adaptation of the heart most mostly it's due to what we call # endurance exercise the endurance athletes those of you who are runners can feel relaxed because that's been shown again and again to be good left ventricular hypertrophy now by saying that it would imply that the other athletes are not so good in other words what's the opposite of the endurance athlete</u>
<gap reason="inaudible" extent="uncertain"/>
<u who="nm5271">the weight lifters alright and the the the weight lifters will appear to cause more concentric inward thickening of the myocardium and this is a very good example that slide there shows it # that the heart has not enlarged upwards the cavity's interfered with and that wall thickness is thick that introduces a very difficult concept it seems there's some inward thickening of left ventricular hypertrophy due to pressure overload really the the weight lifters you will see that really increases systolic blood pressure like mad when they pump the iron and the runners don't the runners increase cardiac output so again think of evolution it seems that our body is adapted for endurance exercise and not adapted for weight lifting i suppose it's not difficult do you imagine evolutionary process of humans you know we were we were surviving on large plains running from tigers and lions and that's how they survived they don't spend all their time lifting rocks there's another cute story about evolution now because i only want to spend ten more minutes and then we're finished why do i bring in evolution what is wrong with heart failure that we seem to be struggling with okay so we've finished the story now that for some reason pathological left ventricular hypertrophy lead to changes we're beginning to understand now it is to do with the abnormal how should i say its not just blood supply it's obvious that the hypertensive heart has quite adequate blood supply if you do all sorts of checking of ischemia they don't have ischemia and yet the L-V-H lead to heart failure it is something to do with switching on some genes that causes your heart muscle to the the myocyte to fail we haven't got all the answers yet but interestingly it is to it will explained by certain <trunc>genet</trunc>  # gene switching and somehow the thyroid hormone is involved not at body level but local mutilisation of thyroid hormone so it's very strange but we know we will get an answer there and this picture's to illustrate how patients can move from that phase to this phase to show tremendous [dilatation] of the left ventricle this these two slides illustrate the power of a really easy cheap non-invasive test echocardiogram so patients with hypertension patients with heart failure really must have these tests # kidney in heart failure go on then go on then and our list here then what i said earlier on potential causes of heart failure it is very good to have this kind of idea behind when you treat a patient of course ischemic heart disease as i mentioned the damage from coronary artery disease maybe actually environmental hypertension large unknown alcohol features quite high here diabetes systemic disease dilated cardiomyopathy there are known ones there is no history maybe the patient has been hypertensive # sorry the V-H-D valvular heart disease of course this changes a lot depending on what patient population if you are caught in the Far East valvular heart disease will overtake ischemic heart disease for the moment quite a lot of unknowns in fact will have some form of viral heart disease in the past a lot of them but you can't prove it alright right so that's give you an idea i think i will skip that it is largely a disease of old age and this is where i want to bring in the concept of evolution it seems that evolution hasn't taken care of us with respect to heart failure why if anything evolution i'll read it again seems to have caused us trouble in so far as in the treatment of heart failure we're constantly fighting the body's response to heart failure did you touch on that if so i will be brief in other words in treating heart failure what are we treating a lot of the time we can't make the heart beat stronger we're giving diuretics why are we giving diuretics because the body's retaining sodium right we remember not water sodium why does the body retain sodium</u>
<u who="su"><gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> cardiac output increase circulating volume</u>
<u who="nm5271">yeah and where's the heart rate</u>
<u who="su">in the kidney</u>
<u who="nm5271">kidney right so all the time the kidney is in fact driving the heart mad as it were the heart begins to fail the kidney makes it worse no question about it kidney makes it worse why who can give me a good evolutionary explanation why is there such a a hard wire condition as the heart fails the kidney does something crazy and makes things worse not just sodium retention what else does the kidney do wrong which causes the heart to fail more</u>
<u who="ss">vasoconstriction</u>
<u who="nm5271">vasoconstriction <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> system now these two are powerful agents so there must be reason why the kidneys are doing that</u>
<u who="sm5280">is it an attempt to try and increase <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> loads which then</u>
<u who="su">yeah it's a compensation</u>
<u who="nm5271">okay i was waiting for that one alright don't take it personally alright</u>
<u who="sm5284">because there is there is decreased # blood going to the kidneys</u>
<u who="nm5271">yeah and i know that i know that and that's which is a sample of what he's saying attempt to increase the blood pressure in other words we're now ascribing some thinking process in kidneys now aren't we really the kidney wants blood as it were the kidney's very selfish it's i would much prefer the other way i would consider a lot of the if you like the cardiovascular control and responses to various injuries as you like it's hard wired in our genes that how our body's supposed to work hard wire in other words the kidney's not choosing the kidney doesn't say ah well i want a bit more blood now the kidney has got reflex acts built in with hypertension under perfusion then it secretes these why give me the best possible explanation why our body's so stupid</u>
<u who="su">is it because we came from sea</u>
<u who="nm5271">yeah it goes all the way back when we came from the sea first we're lying horizontal creeping around on the ground next we try to stand up it is a very pure concept the price we pay for for being biped is that we get haemorrhoids we get backache we get strokes we get heart failure we get hypertension it's worrying by having a <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> it seems that really the price we pay for for standing on on two legs is pretty high why because in fact there's yet another worrying thing it depends how this thing on heart failure the kidneys doing this there's another major problem causing heart defects which <trunc>al</trunc>  also goes back to evolutionary turn what causes a heart attack clot in artery coronary artery why would there be <trunc>c</trunc>  clot in the coronary artery why should it be what triggers these very tiny if you like erosion of the coronary artery and need to clot this is crazy what for what's wrong in the homeostatic mechanism in our body has lead to such a <trunc>catas</trunc>  catastrophic event that it leads to a death of the organism it doesn't seem right which part of our body is if you like functioning strangely</u>
<gap reason="inaudible" extent="uncertain"/>
<u who="nm5271">it's a coping system yeah agreed it's a coping system if you cut your fingers the same reaction that stops the bleeding is actually happening inside your coronary artery when this tiny fracture in your endothelium now that's worrying but then which comes first the <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> in the coronary artery or bleeding in the evolution in the human evolution bleeding running away from the tigers and lions getting scratched among the bushes <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> this to the early human beings sorry <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> you talk about mammals for the mammalian species bleeding to death was a big risk hence all this reaction in the hard wire it's quite interesting to look at that because really we're now trying to devote very important drugs to fight an <trunc>e</trunc>  an evolutionary process the present conclusion is that human beings were never really meant to live to seventy eighty ninety we're meant to live to child bearing age bring up that child if we're lucky and die of <trunc>e</trunc>  evolutionary if you like forces and the gene is propagated the species is maintained we're not meant to be grandparents that's all</u>
