<u who="nm5219">thanks very much for coming to our symposium on educational research  # as you probably know we were officially named Department of Undergraduate G-P Medical Education on the first of March this year when we have been administering the undergraduate G-P course for the Warwick Medical School of the Leicester-Warwick Medical Schools # so what we do here at the moment is to mirror exactly what happens at the undergraduate department at Leicester University the undergraduate G-P department it's exactly the the same curriculum # inevitably our remit is to provide medical education within primary care and teaching students # competencies in the consultation but that also involves research into medical education and all the different people that are speaking today will be talking about a different aspect of undergraduate medical education that will be related to primary care but we're also joined by the # group of people who are doing a module in effective teaching of the Masters degree in medical education who have joined us today of which i am also a student so about ten of our colleagues from that module have joined us today now i'm handing evaluation forms round i'd be very grateful if you would fill those evaluation forms out as the day goes on and various people are are talking they're the same evaluation forms that we're using for the Masters in in Medical Education so it will it will help us to to evaluate that # inevitably because it's an educational research # symposium it's also become an <trunc>educ</trunc>  educational research project in itself and i'm going to ask <gap reason="name" extent="2 word"/>  from the Centre for English Language Teachers Education to explain to us what is happening <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/></u>
<gap reason="tape cut" extent="uncertain"/>
<u who="of5220">thanks a lot <gap reason="name" extent="2 word"/> # as <gap reason="name" extent="2 word"/> said my name's <gap reason="name" extent="2 word"/>  and i come from the Centre for English Language Teacher Education on main campus and # this is part of a research project into # the language of academic speech # what we're doing is putting together a database of a whole lot of lectures and seminars from a whole # a whole range of subject areas different subject areas around the university and it's # becoming part of a corpus that is going to be made available to researchers into language so # in fact part of the database has already been used in several papers on # academic vocabulary and syntax and the difference between written and spoken English # these sort of projects that are going on # part of # the clips from the <trunc>r</trunc>  # recordings are also being used for another project which is called Essential Academic Skills in English and that's a CD-ROM project that's aimed at  <trunc>univers</trunc>  # students who are coming to university from # foreign countries for the first time and what it aims to do is actually ease them into the university experience give them exposure to the kind of language that they're going to be exposed to when they come to university so as to make the ride easier for them as it were so i just need to make sure that you're ok with being filmed for this is it is it all right</u>
<u who="su">yes </u>
<u who="su">sure <vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" dur="3"/></u>
<u who="of5220">brilliant thanks a lot <vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" dur="2"/></u>
<gap reason="tape cut" extent="uncertain"/>
<u who="nm5219">i should have introduced myself actually right at the beginning but i think you all know who i am # but i'm <gap reason="name" extent="2 word"/> i'm a general practitioner in <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> and a senior lecturer here and i was informed by one of my colleagues at the beginning the longer the title that you have in the university is usually # correlates with your lesser importance <vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" dur="2"/> in the university so i've got this grand title of being Director of G-P Undergraduate Medical Education <vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" dur="2"/> # so that's a <trunc>l</trunc>  # a little bit about myself with relation to the day itself all the # speakers will be allocated half an hour the idea is that they speak for fifteen minutes because hopefully it's going to generate a lot of discussion amongst the group so hopefully <trunc>feef</trunc>  fifteen minutes' discussion at eleven-thirty we'll break for coffee and then at twelve-forty-five we will make our way to the central campus to eat in what is referred to as the Eat restaurant in the Arts Centre where you'll have a very nice meal and # then we'll come back here again at two o'clock # i should also say that i've organised today with my colleague who's sat here <gap reason="name" extent="2 word"/> who is a G-P in Coventry and a lecturer here in the department so he's been putting in a lot of work behind the scenes for today and is also gonna be speaking a little bit later so we should introduce our first speaker # Dr <gap reason="name" extent="2 word"/> who is from <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> University he is an academic G-P registrar but is shortly to become a lecturer in communication skills at <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> university he's also a general practitioner and he's going to talk about student-centred evaluation using the nominal group technique thank you</u>
<u who="nm5221">right thank you very much and it's a it's a pleasure to come here to speak to this group # as as i slowly sort of spread the word of what i've been doing # as the the title says # i submitted this for my # my MSc in primary care and yesterday i was # i was fortunate to receive the news that it has formally been accepted # subject to the final exam boards so it's probably as formally accepted as it possibly can be # whereabouts are the forward and back for the slides on the for the Powerpoint is there # something i'm not seeing aha </u>
<u who="su">just pull it</u>
<u who="nm5221">yes there is there's a hidden drawer <vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" dur="2"/> marvellous right okay so the the nominal group technique i'll come to describe a bit more but just to mention that it was something that perhaps i came upon entirely by accident it may well be something that the people here don't know an awful lot about but hopefully i'll change that as the course of this as we go along some of what i i wanted to talk about really is evaluation and the whole process of evaluation that # for me i i felt that evaluation wasn't always a terribly useful thing in the way that it's being done and <trunc>th</trunc>  this just is just a way of summarising what happens as part of any educational event that you know you want to collect data analyse interpret disseminate it make a decision and this informs then to change your practice # what i found particularly interesting about evaluation was the the aspects really of data collection and and with data collection and <trunc>e</trunc>  evaluation there were two things that i always wanted to know about this is why we were were we collecting this information and who were we collecting this sort of information for and generally what i found was that it probably isn't actually for you that often evaluations are done because somebody has decided that something is important but it might not necessarily be what's actually important to you being the person that's experiencing the learning so i wanted to create something that was a student-centred view # of an educational experience now evaluation is a is a difficult thing and <trunc>i</trunc>  in different circles it's thought of in in sort of very high terms or very low terms some people and if i but to me this is the at the top of the list is that people believe it's a purely administrative task it's done becaues it has to be done because somebody above you says evaluate this you tick the boxes you hand it in and the job is done there can be resistance within a faculty setting towards evaluation again believing that it's that you know it's a waste of time # often there's little opinion in what the students actually think about what's going on yes they tick the boxes they fill in the things but then these things just get cast to one side # if you're asking for self-reported data # i think i'm a wonderful lecturer isn't going to be particularly useful when it comes to evaluation and overall just apathy and disinterest in the whole process so i wanted to create something that was <trunc>th</trunc>  <trunc>w</trunc>  that was as as student-centred as i could possibly make it so i began by taking a focus group of # final year medical students and took them through a semi-structured # focus group asking them broadly about what they were doing # within the the community-based medicine course at Birmingham University then what i did is i used the information from this focus group to devise statements for the use for the nominal group technique and by a statement i mean it's sort of like a stimulus statement so just # <trunc>a</trunc>  an example from outside of medicine is what do you think it's important to do before you go to work in the morning i mean it's a silly example but it just gives you an idea of what a stimulus statement is so that poses a question to which people may then generate lots of ideas  so what is the nominal group technique well the nominal group technique is a a a structured way of generating ideas and it consists of several different phases  the first part is a silent phase so you <trunc>pr</trunc>  you you you provide <trunc>th</trunc>  the participants with a statement and so for instance the one about what you do before you go to work then they work individually # in response to this so they work on paper and they write down a list of everything they can think of in response to that statement and it has to be individual no discussion occurs  the second part is the round robin phase so each person in turn reads out the first thing on their list it gets transmitted # <trunc>trans</trunc>  transmitted transcribed to a chart on the wall where that goes on in in a cycle process each person saying the next thing on their list until you have a grand list of absolutely everything that people have written down again there's no time for # for <trunc>s</trunc>  speaking other than saying what's on your list you can't debate whether or not that's a stupid thing a good thing or a bad thing everything goes on the list  this is the only time at which speaking speaking is allowed and this is the clarification phase so you can get to understand what other people mean by their statements it is also the only time at which anything can be deleted from the list <trunc>s</trunc>  for instance <trunc>a</trunc>  you know <trunc>i</trunc>  identical duplications which do happen a lot during this technique but people can't say i don't agree with that being on the list take it off if it goes on the list it stays on the list and then something that's quite crucial to the nominal group technique is the voting phase so for instance in response to a statement they may be presented with thirty statements you then say to them what are the seven most important things to you so you as the individual learner in this experience what is important to you the most important thing then getting seven votes the next thing six votes five votes four <trunc>fo</trunc>  four votes and so on and then you collected all the votes for all the statements and then you feed that information back to the participants so it's a way of generating a large amount of information but then asking people to whittle it down to what really is important and then using the votes to calculate what the most important thing is to the group as a whole  now the nominal group technique has many advantages  it's a structured way so it's not like filling in evaluation forms and then reading thousands of comments that have been written and trying to tabulate them in some way it's a structured way of doing this  it's non-confrontational if you write it down you say it people can't shout you down for saying things that you don't necessarily agree with it disperses dominance you can't have one voice going on and on about one particular thing you've said it once you can't say it again it's on the list it comes down to the voting as to whether or not that's important to everyone  it's also very easy to produce data as we'll come on to see how much data this sort of thing produces so what statements did i use well through the nominal <trunc>gr</trunc>  through the the focus group we discovered various bits that were quite interesting for the students and things that produced the most debates so we generated three statements and they're quite similar to some other pieces of research that have been done  like this  so we asked them first of all what would you change about the community-based medicine course in the final year  then we asked them what did you enjoy about the community-based medicine course in the final year  and finally what does final year community-based medicine teaching give you that teaching in other settings does not  so  at the nominal group we recruited eighteen students to attend and they were split on the day into two groups purely for logistical reasons in in handling large groups then they were combined towards the end of the process so that they all had their master lists to look at  so in response to the three different statements they generated a hundred and twenty-four separate ideas and from that they voted the top seven in response to each statement so we had twenty-one statements that according to this group were the most important things overall about community-based medicine at Birmingham so you may ask well what does eighteen students mean in comparison to the whole of the year it was about approximately two-hundred students so what we did is we then converted that into a questionnaire so the twenty-one statements we then asked the whole year do you agree or disagree with this as a as an important statement a hundred and eighty students # responded which is a response rate of about eighty percent which we felt was quite acceptable  and overall out of the twenty-one statements that were made twenty of them obtained majority support # what you say is majority support is you know <trunc>s</trunc>  is very much up to you the cut-off for twenty to twenty-one is at fifty percent so over fifty percent of the year agreed but as we'll come on to see that most people did have a very high level of agreement so here we have #  the layout of it so the three colours represent the three different statements with each statement number so these are the seven things in response to each stimulus statement these are the seven items along the bottom and you can see that on the whole if you draw a rough line across eighty percent you still get most of the people agreeing over eighty percent and then down here you've got these two statements which really didn't overall get very good # agreement within the whole year so the poorer scoring items what were they  well the first one was about general knowledge on the opthalmology and dermatology exam and i think this was a specific thing for this group that they were upset about the content of the exam when they had it but assume when it was presented to the whole year that overall that just wasn't agreed with there was a # # just a a <trunc>s</trunc>  slight shift towards agreement with this statement just saying that you know we wanted more formal tutorials in general practice they wanted more <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 word"/> tutorials on audit on screening on cardiovascular disease but again there was a high level of disagreement with that statement so i'll i'll just move on now to the  the supported items and i won't bore you in great detail of absolutely every <trunc>s</trunc>  single thing i just picked out the ones that i thought the most exciting  so  what would yo change about community-based medicine course well they wanted more dermatology teaching there was no doubt about that and i think this harks back to even the days when i was a medical student the dermatology among students is poorly thought of and on thw whole can be quite badly taught there were small numbers who felt that it was being done well and i think that represented small pockets of dermatology teaching within the practices that were being done very well but on the whole it wasn't being done very well at all  the course at Birmingham is split into an inner-city practice and an <trunc>ou</trunc>  sort of an outer-city practice and the students were flitting between the two centres and they actually felt that it was very bitty and # disorganised and they'd much rather have core central blocks at one place rather than being spread out and moving all the time  and finally on this one they wanted feedback on their examination stations they have a voiceless exam where they they rotate round different stations and unless they do particularly badly or there is something of particular concern the students don't get feedback about that station they were very keen to have that cos they do get that in some of the specialities  what did you enjoy about final-year community-based medicine  well they enjoyed the one-to-one tuition which i thought was very very reassuring they found the communication skills role plays very useful # <trunc>th</trunc>  in fact the the words they used were both useful and information so that that was good feedback for us  and also that the voiceless exam was relaxed and fair which again for students to volunteer that <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> about an exam i think is a very positive step  and the final part #  is what i call the Heineken question <vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" dur="2"/> and this was what does final-year community-based medicine give you <vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" dur="2"/> that other settings do not so what's community-based medicine reaching out to that other teaching settings simply aren't getting to so we'll just focus on this one a little bit more cos i think this is the most exciting of them  first of all # they felt that this was the you know the real opportunity to have clinical autonomy and responsibility more than in other settings holding your own consultations they they they seemed to feel that in hospital settings you don't get to hold your own consultations you go in you you take the whole medical history you present it you don't have anything to do with it within the primary care community-based setting that was very different it was less focused on the rare they were fed up of seeing ridiculous # outside things in hospital whereas they're actually seeing normal things happening in community-based setting and also they were being treated as a colleague rather than as a student so they were saying that they could develop this more professional relationship with those around them they were able to to see and experience # continuity of care something they weren't getting in the secondary care setting they were improving their confidence in their patient skills and i think just an important thing for some of us here is that they  had more enthusiastic teachers and support from their mentors i think it's a great thing to hear coming out of out of this setting  so overallas a technique <trunc>w</trunc>  you know <trunc>wha</trunc>  what do i think of this technique well i think it's i think it's a a <trunc>w</trunc>  a wonderful technique  # it's cheap i mean the the whole thing other than supplying <trunc>s</trunc>  # food for the students cos it does take a few hours was was you know the the manpower of me  # it was easy to run it was just simply setting the questions the students went <trunc>a</trunc>  went away made their own data minimum input from me and it <trunc>s</trunc>  it was reasonably quick the students in their feedback to me did suggest that it did take quite a while which was three hours i mean i suppose in student terms three hours is a very long time  # it's a student-centred way they generated this data my only input was to create three things that they could then spill out and talk about whatever they wanted to about  and also they created a large amount of data and that's to say that i know the twenty-one statements are the most important they had the highest votes but they were the # you know a hundred or so other items that were still interesting that were coming out of this  and as the study has has suggested the opinions of the students there and then were representative of the year as a whole and that's jsut to say that's Birmingham and that was that final year i don't know if it would ever # sort of leak out <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 word"/> to be applicable to other settings  as far as community-based medicine is concerned at Birmingham it's thought of highly by the students who have participated in the course it allows personal and professional growth and something that i that i felt was you know very nice is that it does bridge this gap it seems from being a student to becoming a doctor # and it seems that # you're allowed and able to do that in the primary care setting more so than other places  so the future of this i think <trunc>i</trunc>  it can go anywhere and everywhere for those people who wish to use  it # we've already used it evaluating our firm onescheme in in the year four and we're using it soon to look at the communication needs for overseas doctors as to where it's already been for me # it's already been disseminated partially within the university and it's going to be # sent off to the curriculum development and implementation group along with quality assurance as well it's being presented at the R-C-G-P research symposium in Birmingham and it's been accepted as a short communication for AMEE in Bern this year and it's also # sort of in the pipeline for publication</u>
<gap reason="tape cut" extent="uncertain"/>
<u who="su">i've got one hi how are you # i was just <trunc>won</trunc>  what went through my mind # as you as you were talking was it's a great way of collecting a majority view of <trunc>var</trunc> of various # of improving things that need to be need to be dealt with i was i was wondering what happens to the other vast amount of data that gets lost during the deletion process because it seems that's where you might get slightly more interesting off the wall responses <vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" dur="2"/> to the programme</u>
<u who="nm5221">i mean absolutely i mean that's why i mentioned that the fact that you do get this great yield of data # and as yet we haven't done anything with the other data that's there # i mean i don't have the numbers with me but the votes that were allocated to # these particular things that made it into the top twenty-one were head and shoulders way above absolutely everything else that the that the the highest one i think was scoring seventy to eighty votes and then suddenly you get down into the mid-twenties and it will drop off into just being three or four votes in total for all the other items # and it's interesting looking at the data that came out of there there was some # <trunc>r</trunc>  really <trunc>o</trunc>  odd stuff that came out which i which i felt was very good because it does give everyone a voice and i think one of the things said # tutors need to stop taking themselves so seriously # which is of course is not gonna get into the top of the vote but it's something that some students did feel was quite important but <trunc>w</trunc>  i mean qualitatively you could look at the sorts of things then group it together in categories that other things other things people find useful but we've not done anything with it yet</u>
<u who="su">are you gonna send an email round <vocal desc="laugh" iterated="y" dur="2"/> the department about tutors taking themselves <vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" dur="2"/> seriously</u>
<u who="nm5221">probably wouldn't be the best idea <vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" dur="2"/></u>
<u who="su">can you just clarify for me from the how does the focus group decided three statement i'm a bit confused about the process</u>
<u who="nm5221">okay i mean <trunc>i</trunc>  it didn't directly decide the three statements it didn't form the three statements that # # i mean i i had an idea as to what i thought might be important within the or or or what what i i wanted to do something that would create an open enough question that would allow me to to find out what was out there what i thought was out there but at the same time not be so narrow and limited that it didn't give students the breadth enough of opportunity to you know to explore the the # what was going on so i one of the one of the reasons for doing it was to ensure that my questions wouldn't be too narrow and the data that came out of the focus group # on the whole in fact probably all of it was represented in one way or another within the nominal group i just wanted to make sure that there wasn't one specific area that we were going to completely miss by asking those questions</u>
<u who="su">so the three statements you decided the three statements </u>
<u who="nm5221">i did</u>
<u who="su">you asked about enjoyment change something right</u>
<u who="nm5221">that's right i mean part of the reason behind that was <trunc>w</trunc>  when i when i ran the focus group one of the <trunc>f</trunc>  # one of the last things i asked was <trunc>w</trunc>  what what would you change about # the the the C-B-M course and and that just had them # running on and on and on and on it was just such a a big area to be explored that so many ideas came out of it that i thought well i think that will be an important one to do because from the focus group i can't tell what the important things are here but in a voting <trunc>s</trunc>  # setting then perhaps they would be able to narrow it down</u>
<u who="su">thank you</u>
<u who="nf5222">i'm just gonna ask # the three-hour session that you had with the when you did the nominal group was that the whole year or was that a certain selected group</u>
<u who="nm5221">that that was the eighteen students that agreed to participate</u>
<u who="nf5222">i was gonna say do you think you've got sort of responder bias from eighteen people <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 word"/>?</u>
<u who="nm5221">i mean certainly yes because <trunc>th</trunc>  <trunc>obv</trunc>  <trunc>the</trunc>  these are people who are motivated to come along and do this sort of thing and indeed they may well have generated data that to them was important and potentially biased but again it did achieve fairly good support from the year as a whole that's not to say that other things would all would would not have have obtained similar <trunc>r</trunc>  # # overall agreement but i mean <trunc>i</trunc>  <trunc>w</trunc>  it was difficult to find any other way to to reach these people yup</u>
<u who="su"># mine was the same actually i was wondering how you chose your eighteen students and whether you think it would have made a difference if you had a different eighteen students</u>
<u who="nm5221"># it would be really interesting to find out if it had if it would have actually have been different # # for the for the choosing we used email to recruit them because all of the students at Birmingham i'm sure it's true of all universities have an email address allocated to them when they join the first year and # the response rate overall wasn't too bad to the initial email the people who wanted to actually take part was much smaller # but i think the response rates to the the emails after badgering on email was seventeen percent so i mean we thought it was a reasonably good way of recruiting people cos it was free in other words there was no postage no printing</u>
<u who="nm5223">#  if you'd sat down and wrote a twenty-one item questionnaire yourself with three headings yourself how different would it have been from what the students came up with</u>
<u who="nm5221">that's a good question # i honestly don't know </u>
<u who="nm5223">right</u>
<u who="nm5221"># i mean i i'm sure that that the faculty and students alike would create similar sorts of statements # in part but i i still think there are things that they brought up that that have been of surprise to us i suppose we could have put them in # and be surprised by the results but i was i think <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 word"/> was just surprised that they came up with them in the first place</u>
<u who="nm5223">i mean the reason i ask is that we're using the traditional technique of writing a questionnaire from our obviously hopefully good knowledge of what our course entails and then offering free text comments to to harvest the idiosyncratical different # views of students and we're reasonably comfortable with that it gives us reliable results i mean if if i was to <trunc>descrip</trunc> # <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 word"/> students at Leicester i'm absolutely certain one of the items they would come up with is # student support to travel to practices yet i would never ask a question like travel to practices because it's quite <trunc>wi</trunc>  without our control we have to use the practices we have so the students will generate items of and data about something that i can't change where of course </u>
<u who="nm5221">yeah ></u>
<u who="nm5223">i wouldn't put that in my own questionnaire</u>
<u who="nm5221">i i suppose our rationale behind it was because # you can't do anything about it we were still keen to know whether or not the students felt it was important and <trunc>i</trunc>  and indeed they did come up with that that they wanted to have i think they wanted to have closer practices and they wanted to have better # # monetary reimbursements but they got voted out <trunc>the</trunc>  there were things that were more important to the student that came above it</u>
<u who="su">are there actually any incentives for the students to turn up and do your focus group</u>
<u who="nm5221"># the the first focus group # there were no incentives for that # but for the the nominal group the only incentive was food</u>
<u who="su">right cos it does  make a difference to what group of students will turn up cos i always went when i was a student if there was something like ten pound in an envelope or something like there was just # # out of interest sort of <trunc>whi</trunc>  which bias group you get <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/></u>
<u who="nm5221">yeah i mean it was it was quite strange because i i did evaluation with the group at the end and i said you know <trunc>w</trunc>  what did you enjoy what didn't you enjoy about this technique and even though i'd spent a fortune on food hot pizzas and <trunc>i</trunc>  <trunc>s</trunc>  and supplied them all evening several people commented we would like to have had more food # <vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" dur="2"/> several said </u>

<u who="nm5221"># i mean <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 word"/> sort of an allied technique to the nominal group technique is the Delphi technique which is <trunc>aim</trunc>  <trunc>th</trunc>  <trunc>th</trunc>  this <trunc>th</trunc>  this is different cos this is face to face with the Delphi technique involves circulating a questionnaire # <trunc>ei</trunc>  either by mail or electronically and then collating the results formulating a new questionnaire sending it out and refining and and recycling it's something that's that's potentially in the pipeline for me because i i mean i agree with you i think with the the the the growth of electronic use then it would be a very easy and a very cheap way of doing that sort of research</u>

<u who="nm5223">thank you right i've cheated slightly because at the time i was # invited by <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> to give a talk # i was thinking something slightly different from what i'm thinking at the moment but i hope that what i will provide you with is an attitude to <trunc>consid</trunc>  # # an opportunity to consider # what we mean by attitudes and how we might measure them and the means by which i'm gonna do this is i'm going to describe to you hopefully reasonably briefly a course which i developed in conjunction with #  a a development charity based in Leicester called Skillshare International and the # the # principal aim of the charity # is to work in partnership with people # in communities in Africa and India # to promote development and # the means by which they do this is partly by recruiting development workers to go and work and share their skills hence the name # with people in those communities but more recently they've developed # an arm of the charity which looks at development education within the UK and jointly with David Weatherall who was at the time the development # education officer at # Skillshare # we devised and developed a # course for # students in the special study module section of the phase one curriculum # now  # what the aim of the course was was to develop their understanding of issues around health and international development and # David and i were quite open # with the students that we obviously brought to this course a set of attitudes beliefs and orientation towards development issues and we made those explicit we we made it quite clear that we didn't necessarily expect them to agree with us and we were very happy to discuss any conflicting or different opinions or attitudes towards development issues # in order to help you under sort of stand what we did the special study module is a twelve-week course it occ upies twelve consecutive weeks in semester five which in traditional terms is September through to December of the third year and we have a day a week and generally the pattern of teaching that we adopted was we were giving taught sessions in the mornings # and they would have time in the afternoons for self-study and to develop their assessment plans  and we set out # at the outset we had four themes that we wanted to study which sort of kind of drew on the skills and # of the people within Skillshare who were able to teach on this course and partly address some issues perhaps # to do with # things i could bring to it which was issues perhaps more tightly related to becoming a doctor which is about disease control treatment and elimination  and # also # we # we found that this was extremely popular module bcause as you're probably all aware issues of globalisation are have a high priority in the undergraduate student body atthe moment # Med is a very active organisation # and is promoting very heavily the teaching of these sorts of issues within the undergraduate curriculum  # and again what Skillshare can bring is to get people to think about their skills and so # help them to orientate themselves towards # where they're going # in their course # and each theme was taught # around sessions # that looked at different aspects of those themes # and again the particular aspects we chose depended more on the <trunc>availa</trunc>  the interest and availability of the teachers who were going to do the sessions and we expected things like looking at the  disease control of smallpox and malaria to act as paradigm conditions for diseases that are prevalent in developing countries right so that's a quick look at what we did and # we offered it # to twelve students # of whom six were female and five were male the sixth <trunc>stu</trunc>  the <trunc>s</trunc>  the the twelfth student came to our first session# and withdrew because she felt that she didn't have enough expertise in the area # unfortunately she did so by approaching faculty rather than me so i wasn't able to resassure her that we didn't expect her to have expertise what i think went wrong is that in our round of introductions at the very start of the course #  six of the participants had actually lived or # in a developing country during all or part of their childhood  and seven them seven of them had a <trunc>pa</trunc>  parent one or more parent born outside of the U-K and in two cases # these were students one from Africa # one from Nigeria and one from # Egypt whose parents # were were medically qualified so i'm afraid we frightened off the one student who thought that she was <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 word"/> group within a group of experts # as we found out from the assessment process # she was sincerely wrong about that although the students did reasonably good assessments they certainly didn't display any great expertise even after twelve weeks of our effective teaching and the process we used was we asked them to write an individual  essay of two-thousand words on a topic of their own choosing # but # we hadoffered them a menu of different essay titles and in fact three of them # wrote essays about breast-feeding and H-I-V transmission two about access to self water two about prescribing branded drugs # two about education as the key to health and one student wrote an essay about human rights and its effect on health and another about participation  in the second phase of the assessment we divided them into two groups and we asked them # to prepare three different presentations on the same topic one would be a formal fifteen-minute presentation very similar to what i'm doing here the second would be a poster again similar to the thing you might prepare for a for a conference presentation on the theme and the third and most interesting and certainly the one they i think they enjoyed the best was  what we called a resource-poor presentation in other words # we invited them to present on the topic # to a lay audience using no no resources whatsoever  well the topics they ch ose and this may reflect the fact we did quite a lot of teaching about H-I-V at the start of the course  was on the politics of H-I-V control in Kenya and Uganda # and this was the group # doing their little role-play both groups interestingly chose exactly the same <trunc>tea</trunc>  technique  because the group that had wanted to talk about access to H-I-V treatment in South Africa again had prepared a mini drama # and # <trunc>th</trunc>  as i say they certainly enjoyed it <trunc>w</trunc>  i don't know about being resource-poor because # one group # brought a # an inflatable swimming pool a plastic gun and a large amount of props to the presentation <vocal desc="laugh" iterated="y" dur="2"/> <vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" dur="2"/> i've given presentations to audience in Africa and # you're doing pretty well if you've got a # a chalkboard to write on  right moving on to towards what i'm hoping to get to to give you a # # <trunc>w</trunc>  wanting really to develop a discussion # hopefully in this half-hour slot # but we we asked them about their view  of some of the elements within the course # and this slide is is really about oh sorry <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 word"/> back again # had we got the balance right  about teaching between # development topics that related to health and global development and you know did we did they feel that # learning in this special study module which is outside the normal range of the curriculum # we were they were learning enough # and we also wanted them to reflect on the assessment process and as to whether that had helped # to develop their understanding  and the last question was really the the counter <trunc>mo</trunc>  the counter-question to the one about teaching on development topics now # we only got ten responses out of the eleven students because # one responded by email so this is a caution if you send out email questionnaires # <trunc>i</trunc>  if students use a different program to complete them and send them back to you to the one you sent 'em out it you get a garbled response so # his # <trunc>s</trunc>  his responses to the free text questions were perfectly # # translatable but # the the # the crosses had appeared in the wrong boxes so we didn't know what he was actually saying i mean my interpretation of these was that we probably had for the students' view got the balance about right between teaching on specific health-related issues and development issues # and that the course was generally well-received # and that students # enjoyed it and the informal feedback that we got was that they'd had a lot of fun doing the course and they felt they'd learnt a lot so as it's not my job to entertain them but it is my job to educate them i regarded that as a success # and they felt that the presentations that they had prepared had helped them develop their undertanding of the issues they'd chosen to study but of course these students had volunteered <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 word"/> they specifically opted to take this course and because this is a popular topic at the moment in medical education it was significantly over-subscribed and some special study modules may only have two or three applicants # so to have more students wanting to do it than actually did it # is perhaps not # always typical #  and then we wanted to ask them about their attitudes to the course and in in doing this so i think we were hoping that we would get some kind of handle more generally on their attitudes # to the issues that we wanted to talk about  so again we felt that # with a couple of exceptions # they'd enjoyed the course they felt # challenged to think about <trunc>deep</trunc>  deeply about the issues and that they were more motivated # to learn about these issues # in the future now it's not it's it's in no way a an objective of ours to recruit people who wish to go and work in a developing country either to undertake an elective within a developing country # although # we did say that students who <trunc>w</trunc>  were thinking of doing an <trunc>e</trunc>  elective in a developing country would benefit greatly from undertaking our course # but because we knew we were dealing with volunteers and it's certainly one of Skillshare's objectives to get people to offer their skills and work abroad it's gratifying that the majority of them didn't feel put off from the <trunc>note</trunc>  from the idea of doing that so that was their attitude to the course and moving on to whether their general attitudes had changed as a result of the course we asked them  had they changed and ten of them said yes and one said no # and then when i analysed the free text <trunc>quest</trunc>  the responses to the free text question seven of them talked about they felt more aware or more knowledgeable about the issues  three of them felt they had a better understanding  and four of them said they had an increased interest in the topic for the future but actually very few of them had <trunc>ac</trunc>  responded to the question i'd set which is had their attitudes changed  #  these are the kinds of this is just a sample of the responses that they made # and i've chosen one from each category that i ended up with so possibly understanding that this is a much more complex issue than they started is # does represent some sort of attitudinal shift and perhaps becoming more sympathetic to the plight of refugees and asylum seekers again  perhaps an attitudinal shift # and if you increase somebody's motivation to go and do something then you perhaps can infer that there may have been a change in their attitude a positive change in their attitude towards whatever you're asking about  <gap reason="tape cut" extent="uncertain"/> <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 word"/> a student whose attitudes hadn't changed now of course that might not be a bad thing cos he may have entered the course with exactly the kind of attitudes that Dave and i hoped students would develop during the course and all we did was confirm him in his previous attitudes that  were what we were interested in so having sort of done this analysis of the course  and realised that actually i'd absolutely failed in my objective was to measure attitude change amongst my students i wondered  well what's the word attitude mean  so of course i had to  the dictionary like we all do and the first meaning in the dictionary is all to do <vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" dur="2"/> with # body posture so i think i felt that definition wasn't particularly helpful to me the second <trunc>def</trunc>  definition  a state of mind or a feeling a disposition and the example the <trunc>dish</trunc>  the dictionary quotes is had a positive attitude about work and the second # definition which is probably one better understood by teenagers and young people is an arrogant or hostile state of mind or disposition now that i find very interesting because it made me remember something that Leslie Southgate said when she came to Leicester to give a presentation about poorly performing doctors and what she found is that that the <trunc>s</trunc>  the doctors whom that process has identified as poorly performing and whom they were having most difficulty in reforming into doctors who would perform well in future it was to do with attitudes not about their knowledge on the whole these doctors had good knowledge nor was it about their skills they were often quite skillful # surgeons for example where obviously skill is very important and they'd identified this was the particularly different category of doctor to deal with it also made me remember an incident with one of our students who  one of our practice teachers rang up and said we're very concerned about this student because # during the midpoint assessment # which is the clinical assessment with live patients  in the doctor's surgery this student possibly made a mistaken attempt to create a lighthearted environment and told a patient female patient who was getting undressed for not a vaginal examination but an abdominal examination go behind the <trunc>sceen</trunc> screens and get your kit off now this was a student who i by chance i actually had in my small group and he was a student who'd displayed very great <trunc>weak</trunc>  found it very difficult to get him to accept that one of the videotape consultations he'd looked at there were problems in the behaviour and the relationship of the doctor on the tape and the patient and he was insisting that okay the doctor wasn't clinically very competent but he was polite and therefore he thought this doctor was behaving very well with this patient and the entire group eventually ended up siding against him and he wouldn't shift his attitude towards this performance now one of the advantages of our style of teaching and i suspect it's true for all the medical schools represented here is that our general practice teachers are pretty good at picking up on these kind of issues and generally # they'll they'll refer them to us and we will try and get the faculty to take some notice of them often some difficulty to John Cookson's credit when i wrote to him about the student and this instant he did call the student in and speak to him now the problem is as i have really got no idea whether this student i'm sure this student's graduated and although he probably said all the right things to John Cookson i don't really know whether his attitudes have changed very much  so i then wondered  what have other people done about attitudes  so i just did a quick # flip through the Medical Education  using the key word attitudes in the search and came up with seventy-four articles where that's the where that is a key word that the author's used to describe the purpose of that work since January nineteen-ninety-eight forty-six of which relate to undergraduate medical education well twenty-two of these papers essentially are about the students' teaching and learning experience so it's nothing to do with their attitudes nine of them are about their attitudes towards patients or patient groups almost <trunc>pr</trunc>  almost entirely  these papers were written by psychiatrists who <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 word"/> vulnerable there's one paper by an epidemiologist but again that's no surprise there these two groups of specialities in medical schools get a bit sensitive about how students perceive their speciality eleven of the <trunc>paysh</trunc>  # the papers were about particular issues or topics # for example # about the doctor-patient relationship or their attitudes towards terminal illnesses # as a topic on which they were being taught and four related to something about their personal experiences a majority the overwhelming majority of these  # papers had assessed student attitude by use of questionnaires i guess most of them derived <trunc>pr</trunc>  precisely  the way i derive questionnaires rather than the way that # Dr Murdoch does and many of them depended on scale questions and most of them didn't actually attempt to make a change although one of although one or two did so the issues that arose then for me is well i'd wanted to measure attitudes and i hadn't done it well okay we hadn't done a before and after questionnaire but if i'm going to measure attitude shift amongst my students who take the module next September these are all volunteers who want to study this topic so it it may be that they already have all the right attitudes and nothing we can do can shift them so do we need control groups and and although i didn't look in detail at all the seventy-four papers i didn't detect that any of the ones i did look at the abstracts of had actually used control groups when they were talking about attitudes and this then relates back to something that i think is really much more problematic and why i related the anecdote i did about the student who said get your kit off is we talk about measuring knowledge and skills within a medical  education and there's huge vast literature about how you do that effectively and reliably and that's actually quite relatively easy but how do we measure attitude # i come from Leicestershire so the example of Peter Green the doctor who sexually assaulted patients in his surgery is obviously a very live one for us particularly as as he was a partner in one of our teaching practices and this is a doctor who's regarded as very outgoing very cultured regarded as a very competent general practitioner by all his colleagues and but his attitudes towards his patients were about as arrogant as you can get which is that i can inject them with anaesthetics and i can sexually assault them and of course there were concerns about the attitudes of Harold Shipman and because of behaviours in previous practices but yet his colleagues regarded him as a competent doctor and he wasn't being flagged up by any other mechanisms that we generally use to know and we might not use in teaching practices but particular practice for teaching because we're concerned about the professional competence of the doctors there and yet these were two of the most attitudinally dangerous and difficult doctors that we've that have come to light and heaven knows how many more there are out there and haven't come to light  so should we measure whether our students have appropriate attitudes when they start and can we assess their attitudes during medical education and how do we fine define what we mean by good and bad attitudes and if it is desirable to assess them how do we prevent students from playing the game 'cause you can measure their knowledge and that's quite straightforward you can measure their skills and if they haven't got skills then they haven't got the skills but it isn't very difficult if you're as bright as our students to spot what the socially desirable answer to the question might be sorry i'm sorry i've overrun a few minutes sort of eaten into your discussion time but i will now shut up and # hopefully that's sown some seeds of thought in your minds</u>
<u who="su">can i ask  if you if you if you were to do this again would you actually have some sort of measure of attitudes before and after it and</u>
<u who="nm5223">yes if i had the time</u>
<u who="su"><gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 word"/> what what would be what method would you use <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 word"/></u>
<u who="nm5223">well if i had the time i'd i'd in September i will probably try to use three three groups  the students who come on our module the students who expressed a desire to come on our module who don't get a place # and the students who had no wish whatsoever to come on our module # now whether i'll get we've <trunc>of</trunc>  we're offering this course to eighteen students so whether we'll get eighteen students in each group i don't know # and i will design # an an instrument <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 word"/> if i can't find one that measures attitudes towards # issues of  global health and development</u>
<u who="su">i mean as you said Adrian the real problem with # measuring attitudes of medical students is they're all too clever to say say you devise a question like what is your attitude to the asylum-seeking problem no one's gonna say well i think <trunc>no</trunc>  nobody should be able to come to this country at all and they're all gonna say oh i do sympathise and it's difficult and they're all too clever to give an answer which is actually gonna be truthful aren't they which <trunc>i</trunc>  it if it's a if it's an assessment tool and that's the real problem isn't it how how do you measure it</u>
<u who="nm5223">i think that's certainly one of the problems</u>
<u who="su">yeah</u>
<u who="nm5223">yeah</u>
<u who="nf5222">has anybody tried to define good and bad attitudes</u>
<u who="nm5223"># # not that i'm not aware of no</u>
<u who="nf5222">usually that's more subjective</u>
<u who="nm5223">i mean i think the G-M-C has  tomorrow's doctors revisited <u who="su">mm</u>
<u who="nm5223"># it's pretty obvious what would be regarded by the G-M-C as # the appropriate set of attitudes # and i suppose also in the guide to good practice as well # what would be consensus of <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 word"/> attitude is is embedded within them # but of course the more explicit you make it the the the greater the problem <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 word"/> how do you stop people lying to you when you're asking them</u>
<u who="nf5222">the the thing is in attitudes as well is that flexibility in each area i'm just looking at general practice some G-Ps that are happy  refer people for abortion say # and some G-Ps that will not refer now is that a bad attitude or is it a good attitude <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 word"/> it's just very woolly in certain areas isn't it i just feel if you go in to  try and create a scale</u>
<u who="nm5223">yes and i think in a sense that talking about it is the first step because we can agree # obviously it's within nineteen-sixty-eight that we would allow doctors to hold both sets of attitudes and both would be regarded as socially very acceptable they would be regarded  as acceptable what was necessary the doctors were honest and explicit about their attitudes towards the topic of abortion # it's what you do about the the doctors who are not prepared to  to be explicit that they think patients who are a whingeing bunch of losers who shouldn't think of taking up their valuable professional time yup we all <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 word"/> yeah</u>
<u who="su">i was just reflecting on this from the point of view as as you're saying knowledge and skills are very easy things to assess aren't they i'm i'm wondering with the increased culture of if you like political correctness and the issues that are being raised around the questionnaire the the issues the gentleman raised here that nobody's gonna lie on those things whether maybe a questionnaire's the right tool even to assess in this day and age when people are so aware of it one of one of the things that fascinated me earlier on is when you were is that is that your questionnaires themselves seem seem to give you those sorts of answers in terms of attitudes that reflect on the learning cos there was a culture <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 word"/> evaluation that says what did you learn what are the key learning issues that you've taken away from today's event and maybe that's why the response in terms of attitude is that way as well because very often you're saying how do you now feel about working in different environments so perhaps the answer to some of that may be about one to one contact but that is a resource issue clearly </u>
<u who="nm5223"><gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 word"/> yeah <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 word"/> a very different questionnaire and i i think </u>
<u who="su">yeah</u>
<u who="nm5223">your suggestions would be ones i would incorporate in writing it # yeah </u>
<u who="nf5224">yeah i'm i'm really pleased to see this whole issue of attitude coming up because i'm in the middle of doing my well towards the end of actually a very big literature search at the moment about evaluation and various other elements of of communication including # professionalism and attitude which we're trying to encapsulate in assessment at the moment and doing the full literature review the  the results that you've just # shown for medical education are reflected elsewhere and i was i was trying to find examples of papers whereby external assessors or simulated patients had attempted some measure of attitude i found about two papers and that worked on the basis of giving somebody a checklist either an external examiner or a simulated patient that said # <trunc>s</trunc>  on a scale of one to four one bad four very good rate the student's integrity rate the student's altruism on a clinical examination and i i i found myself reflecting on the the impossibility of that task from the point of view of the assessor and it's obviously something that you've thought about as well and i wondered if you have any any <trunc>th</trunc>  i i i would be really interested to know whether you think it's actually possible to externally assess # something like a student's integrity</u>
<u who="nm5223"># <trunc>w</trunc>  i think yes i think it is possible but how realistic it is that we assess this particularly if we were wanting to  make judgements about  the student should progress in their education or not i think that's the big difficulty i mean it's interesting what you say because the process you described in those two papers that have attempted to do this probably is actually measuring patient satisfaction</u>
<u who="nf5224">yes</u>
<u who="nm5223">which i think is a rather different set of concepts to what i mean by appropriate professional attitudes towards patients themselves</u>
<u who="nf5224">indeed <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 word"/> one that i read most recently i can't remember the the names of the authors but i remember reading the paper # they concluded that there was no point in having separate measurement for attitudinal professionalism cos there were so many overlaps with their basic communication  checklist i thought what a shame  because every everything that you've said in your presentation i think highlights a real need to take this subject very seriously and to find somewhere dealing with it sensibly</u>
<u who="su">in in general practice # postgraduate education don't trainers assess their registrars for attitude and and surely that's a more realistic opportunity to assess them by over a year by talking to patients and by observing them and that's when if someone has got an attitude problem or a problem with professionalism then it's gonna get flagged up</u>
<u who="nm5223">i'm sure you're right except it's not a field that i know about cos i'm my practice is entirely undergraduate education i mean i i would say that i get a feel for it in eight weeks of one to one practice-based teaching # with students # there's quite <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 word"/> somebody from the back some postgraduate background wants to</u>
<u who="su">it's quite easy to mix up an attitude problem with a communication problem as well though isn't it patients may perceive that a registrar's attitude is remiss when it actually is their ability to <trunc>come</trunc>  communicate their actual internal attitudes are fine but  it's very difficult to assess isn't it</u>

<u who="nm5223">yes i mean <trunc>i</trunc>  <trunc>i</trunc>  whether things would have been  different you know with more robust and reliable systems of professional evaluation of your peers and your colleagues cos within group practice you would hope it's hard to get away with i mean to bring it back again to the real world and it might be issues like i mean overprescribing just because you want quick simple consultations now you know i think that displays remiss political <trunc>atti</trunc>  # professional attitudes that need to be tackled because # it's it's underperforming quite seriously if your response to every patient is to prescribe them something and finish the consultation in two minutes but it's very common behaviour # i mean one of the things that's interesting is is that if you sit as i have done on finals exam board meetings <vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" dur="2"/> you have this discussion about students # who are failing and usually what <trunc>ha</trunc>  they usually fail because they don't attend and ithink they usually don't attend either because they're ill which is one set of issues or because they're actually they're not motivated to be there # and it's remarkable how people who have been around the system for a long time have actually spotted these students in the first weeks and <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 word"/> sits there and says yes i knew they were gonna be a bad one so  there is something about the comportment the behaviour the attitude even in a group of a hundred-and-eighty students arriving at the medical school people with experience feel they can spot students whose attitudes cause concern and when they're called to account for various reasons for the course and that concern is heightened but the instutution finds it very difficult to do anything with that concern </u>

<u who="nm5223">i would think if i wrote the questionnaire carefully enough i probably could measure real change in attitudes of students who had become much more positive in their views of asylum seekers and refugees or much more positive about # developing countries that want to # <trunc>pr</trunc>  you know # produce <trunc>pate</trunc>  # patented drugs cheaply so you could say well those are the attitudes shifts i want to see as a result of my course # and i'll measure those and i mean i can do a control group and i can check whether they haven't changed in my control group # so you can do that # so you could i think you can change attitude but obviously these are <trunc>r</trunc>  relatively insensitive or relatively safe attitudes to change it's okay to say well i now think more positively of asylum seekers because i've met them and someone's given me a course about them and explained to me why they're here and that's quite safe but how you deal with the much more serious attitudes which is basically patients who are wasters and i don't like sealing seeing them # because it's socially undesirable # to say that and yeah we all know that lots of doctors and even students # think it to a greater or lesser degree so</u>

<u who="nm5223"># i think it's difficult because i would i mean if i assess a student in as i do quite frequently in <trunc>cl</trunc>  using the LAP to assess their consultation skills i get i feel i get a very good insight into the attitudes and i can to some extent i can categorise their attitudes within the the category of behaviour and relationship with patients # because i think students who have good attitudes towards the professional role as a doctor will <trunc>s</trunc>  will score well in that category and <trunc>s</trunc>  and it's unusual for students to score badly partly i think because when they're assessed using the LAP as in the assessment tool a weak student tends to get rewarded for being polite to a patient which is a very different really from what that category should be measuring because it should be trying to measure a much more sophisticated view of the relationship the <trunc>pay</trunc>  the student develops with the patient so i mean you a starting point could well be if you had you know well-trained assessors is to scrutinise students who scored badly in that category because they would be flagged up as giving cause for concern but i think you'd need to go on and develop probably more interactive teaching programmes with them and you're saying you've gotta you've gotta see in behaviour and relationship that's the threshold for us focusing on looking at what you do with patients and exploring your attitudes perhaps i mean i you know psychologists think they can devise questionnaires that spot people who are lying in questionnaires so # maybe we could do that but i i don't think it's easy but given the the havoc that even doctors just not not the obvious criminals but even doctors who just underperform because they have the wrong attitudes create through a whole of a professional lifetime # perhaps we should be making a more serious attempt to do it</u>

<u who="nm5229">yeah thanks very much # mm the earlier session on attitudes of # medical students and # medical professionals is a important lead-in to this particular topic # i'm quite interested in this and # i've been looking into our selection procedure at Warwick Medical School okay  for the purpose of this presentation what i thought i would do is i will look at current issues in the selection process which are in the literature at present time # i will give you an overview of the selection process at Warwick and then now that will be about twenty slides i'll be going fairly fast at that stage and most <trunc>os</trunc>  most of us will been through the # selection process so we'll understand it fairly quickly and # in the third section i'll look at some possible areas of research in the selection procedure and also report on a statistical analysis we've done of the interviewer scores okay  current issues in selection  you may have come across wider access for underprivileged # educational and social background people # then there's the personal qualities assessment and common admissions tests for all graduate entry courses which has really  just been talked about but i thought it would be useful to bring it to your attention the underprivileged # is quite contentious and problematic it is desirable but it's really addressing inequality with further inequality # but it's worth noting that something like seventy percent of medical students are from very privileged sort of backgrounds and the first university who # started looking at this area was Bristol around about two-thousand-and-one  it was reported in the news items # they were giving something like two Bs and a C # gradings for entry into their medical course for pupils from inner-city secondary schools and things like that or comprehensive schools and this year St George's # Hospital have # this sort of policy i don't know whether it's a general policy or whether they're just kind of looking at a certain percentage say ten percent or fifteen percent i'm not entirely sure but it was in the in the press that they are looking at it this year  psychometric testing quite a lot of work currently going on it's quite prevalent and the origins are from U-S-A and Australia and basically it focuses on students who have empathic attitudes and if you are looking at this area one wonders that perhaps you could give lowergrade offers and Durham this year i i think Professor <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> is is reporting that he would look at look at students who have this sort of empathic attitude much more favourably and perhaps give lower grade offers and of course when you're looking at this area you begin to think whether  it might be a useful tool # to look at low numbers to interview because it is very labour intensive # at Warwick we had # five-hundred interviews and <trunc>i</trunc>  <trunc>i</trunc>  it is hard work the Scottish universities have got two cohorts of # five-hundred voluntary P-Q-A assessment # this is the the there are five universities involved and # there is</u>
<u who="su"><gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 word"/> P-Q-A</u>
<u who="nm5229"># P-Q-A personality # personal qualities assessment it's sort of attitudes really # they're they're looking at five-hundred volunteers okay <trunc>h</trunc>  who have taken this P-Q-A test and of course # there is a long study which i'll describe in a minute and the areas of interest # primarily are problem solving capability and personality traits and this study which has yet to be # reported upon the preliminary <trunc>resu</trunc>  results will be out say in the autumn time but the <trunc>prelimi</trunc>  preliminary results are already being talked about and that's where i come in  there's a lady called Dr Lumsden from Glasgow University she's the admissions tutor i guess and they looked at two cohorts of # five-hundred students in two-thousand-and-two intake and the two-thousand-and-three intake and they're hoping to follow up these students # for up to ten years and this is to assess whether pre-admission psychometric scores can accurately predict their medical performance I-E the areas they go into and how high they kind of rise in the ranks as i said the preliminary results will be reported later on this year but the interesting remark was according to the testing they've done so far something like a hundred-and-twenty-eight out of the five-hundred-and-ten now that's quite a high percentage # are judged to be unsuitable for a career in medicine actually just going back  the areas of interest # the P-Q-A test they did find # that the test was much more useful for problem solving capability than it was for personality traits but i ask you to bear in mind that these people are fairly intelligent but they have been chosen okay so they may <trunc>ha</trunc>  already have the right sort of personality traits it's not kind of # # a whole population study it is very much focused on the people who've already been accepted the common admissions test # we have a graduate entry programme at # Warwick and there is a proposal from Oxford for a common admissions test at the present time # i'm aware of another workshop for for development of this common admissions test on fourth of July and i think this is towards the end of June and <gap reason="name" extent="2 word"/> has been invited to this  essentially the workshop # is being held and they hope to agree on what core knowledge skills and values  are important in medical students and they would obviously look at the quality issues and validity and reliability and they will monitor all of that and they're hoping to tender # to a test contractor and they're thinking of implementing this by two-thousand-and-five it's it's a tall order but i'll thought i'll bring it to your attention there these things are being talked about and what the rights and wrongs that may be okay now i'm gonna really speed up # the selection procedure at Warwick it's based on the Leicester model  # this is the fourth year of selection we're going through # it's based on the best current evidence and advice that is available and i make reference to the #  the Committee of Heads of Medical Schools # Tomorrow's Doctors the General Medical Council i think fairly familiar with that and How To Do It # an article in the B-M-J by Powis and it was in nineteen-ninety-eight not nineteen-eighty-eight that's an error on my part the heads of medical schools essentially say that the selection process must be transparent i mean that's political correctness and everything else and fairness too really  # the process must identify core qualities those are both academic and personal and we're looking at # highest standards of personal conduct for obvious reason and it's # incumbent for for # potential students the applicants to disclose criminal records and equally primary <trunc>du</trunc>  duty being to the patient they've got to disclose infectious diseases and any disability now this does not bar them from entering into medical school but there is a panel which assesses what sort of disability and whether they would be suitable for a medical career and i think the same would apply what sort of criminal record there is but it is incumbent for them to disclose that  the entry criteria is as i said academic ability and a suitable personality and the selection process involves # written application through UCAS i'm sure you remember and nowadays # it involves a personal statement # there's a competitive interview  finally it's an admission tutor's decision whether they are offered a place or rejected  # the written application again looking at academic ability # from biological sciences we don't have any Arts students or engineering students here # we're looking at two-one upwards # supportive referee is important and some personal qualities and a strong bias towards works experience in the medical profession and i'll come to that a little bit further on # what do we mean by personality communication skills and empathy with patients are very important # settled and demonstrable motivation to the profession and a suitable personality which is kind of a old  assessment for the pratice of medicine and we judge these through a referee's report  and the written material which they provide i'll come on to that in a minute and of course the interview and it's not an exact science i think everybody admits that # we give them a supplementary # application form  which allows them to expand # on their personal statment in a very structured way and i'm gonna quickly run through the the huge number of question about ten of them we we ask why do they wanna do medicine what sort of recreacrational recreational activities they might be involved with some sort of insight into medicine what's kind of important # ethical issues for the current sort of times # works experience  we're looking at patient-centred  explicit dates and details because somebody can go there for an afternoon versus you know a very close observational and active role in a hospice say and more importantly what did they learn from this and how do they feel about it # more importantly for <gap reason="name" extent="2 word"/> this one is to describe their degree course because you can then assess whether that is suitable for # for for our intake or not and i know for a fact that he goes to great lengths trying to find out you know what the structure of the <trunc>c</trunc>  degree course is at various universities to make a more informed decision and this all of this helps to decide who interview and also how we structure the interview and i'll come to that in a minute  the assessment of the written application is done by a pair of course selectors # up till  this year it used to be two people now there are two pairs involved # if there is a discrepancy # because they give a numerical score # then an adjudicator comes in to decide whether they interview or not # so far i i mean we only had # one pair now we've got two pairs there's fairly good concordance at the present and i'll put a question mark this is something we will be looking at and seeing how it sort of evolves and # something in italics i thought well it's interesting # if you could # look at the concordance between the # the the # numerical scores from the written application and the interview score and if they concord very well one wonders whether we need to interview at all maybe that's just a question <vocal desc="laugh" iterated="n" dur="1"/> why interview historically it's always been # the selection was on academic grounds and it was really to reject the seriously unsuitable and of course there's a lot of literature and a lot of commentary that # # academic performance is not necessarily a good predictor of the personal qualities that we're looking for and those mentioned in the # document Tomorrow's Doctors okay  the interviewers # i did this presentation only two days ago and one comment was well the interviewers they must have certain sort of biases and that sort of thing maybe they should also <sic corr="take">sake</sic> some sort of psychometric <vocal desc="laugh" iterated="n" dur="1"/> testing so that's an interesting comment # last year we had # two training sessions one was a workshop and then we had a training session looking at # simulated # interviews and the aim was to really calibrate numerical scores how to assess the students and # the whole process  # last year we had forty-two interviews # mainly academic staff clinical staff and some medical students and i think the future we may be looking at some lay interviewers not completely lay sort of thinking like maybe social workers maybe nurses and that sort of thing with appropriate training and how that would work out and pan out we don't know this is just a proposal at this stage we have two interviewers we try to mix the clinical and the academic  # it lasts twenty minutes we're not supposed to give any indication to the student how well they've done they might go with the false idea that they've got in and they may not have and could cause problems and we give independent numerical scores # they're on three three three # levels and i'll come to that in a minute but it's important for the interviewers to write down comments of what their base their their scores are so that if there's comeback they're able to actually say why they did well or did not do well i guess it'll be the people who are rejected who might come back so it's important that we do that  this is just a process now <trunc>w</trunc>  we we we the the the two interviewers have a game plan and # one goes out # gets the # candidate tries to make them relax the usual introductions you know have you had a decent journey that sort of thing and in <trunc>cer</trunc>  essentially we pick up on topics and we try and judge all the qualities that we're supposed to be judging through a discussion of topics related to medicine it's not an academic test and that that's an important consideration # Warwick Medical School has no set questions however all the interviews do have ready-prepared questions that we use  and of course the S-F-A which is the # supplementary application form with all the details we use some of the material and we ask questions from that and like i said you need some sort of game plan as to who'sgoing first and what sort of things they might be asking so that #  you're not repeating yourself  the criterion to be judged by are communication skills motivation to do medicine and general suitability  and this is what we mean by communication skills it really comes out as a by-product it's not something you directly ask we're really looking at good presentation and issues about being good listeners and their ability to develop discussion and so forth # we talk about non-verbal communication again it's the way they  the way they come across the way they relate to you it's all important  motivation for medicine obviously important  # we're we expect these candidates to have some idea about the curriculum is and one of the questions asked is what do you think about the sociology modules which # which are # # taught very early on in the course and that is usually a good discussion point realistic # commitment to a career in medicine appreciate the challenge a knowledge of career structures you know sort of houseman  registrar grades and that sort of thing and awareness of current issues in medicine and the sort of things that come up is # if you were the # Minister of Health you know how would you do his job differently and why  general suitability we're looking for determination perseverance tenacity and have an interest in other people and how their decisions may affect other people # ability to manage stress and look for advice and also this feeling that they can share difficult problems with other people okay # the decision well if they they've already passed the written application assessment so if they get high scores like twenty-nine thirty # we score one to five in the three categories  so if they get twenty-nine thirty they're likely to get an immediate offer if their scores are low round the twenty-five they'll probably get a <trunc>r</trunc>  rejection immediately and the one thing between going to the hold list which is dependent on just how the interviews are going how the other people are responding because if we select a candidate they may reject us of course so that's all important and finally to aim at a precise figure  rejected candidates have a right to know why the admissions tutor gives written feedback on request and if they've fallen down on communication skills and things like that they can be encouraged to apply again  do we get it right i guess we need to know # # have some knowledge what happens to the people we reject if they get accepted on other courses maybe they're really are good candidates and we're not picking them up # feedback from those who reject Warwick i know that # some questionnaire has been sent but i haven't got enough # information on that as yet we would look at the drop-out rate and the failure rate in subsequent sort of years  the research question i pose is that there are two interviewers how well do we assess the candidates and what's the level of concordance between the two interviewer scores obviously that would need some sort of regression # data analysis what level of concordance would be acceptable and we really tried focusing on sort of further training of interviewers in terms of how to pose the questions and that sort of thing i think most people are pretty impressed with the way they pose questions in the orals for the M-R-C-G-P examination they use five-minute time slots  and they usually flag up the theme first and then follow it up with the specific question all the usual things open questions first set the scenario and then follow up with discussion and then you close it up with closed questions and they actually say what would you do in that situation and you know get them to sort of commit themselves # this sort of approach may be seen as problematic by some people I-E if you have a theme to discuss and an area to discuss and if this candidate does freeze well do you stick with that same game plan it's open to discussion at the present time # if we do do this sort of training i guess we could follow it up with some qualitative interviews of the selectors has it improved their technique do they feel more comfortable do they think the outcomes are better we could do a further analysis of the concordance factor okay # now this is interesting we did look at # #  the the statistical analysis of # nine interviewers #  these are nine interviewers who have done the majority of the interviews they've done more than twenty each and it's only meaningful if they've done a lot of interviews so it is it's only applicable to those here are the anonymous interviews here these are the number of interviews they actually did and this is their mean scores and this is the standard de viation of their scores now using this particular test called Kruskal-Wallis test you're able to compare the scores of A independently with B C D and so forth and if the difference is significant and for three of them it came as significant from there we identify the three significant outliers of which we two # identify two doves and one hawk so it's a bit of advice from the admissions tutor to them say if they're in any doubt then the the hawk might up the mark and the doves might sort of lower the mark okay i've covered a lot of things here and i'm open to questions <vocal desc="laugh" iterated="n" dur="1"/> and to back me up <gap reason="name" extent="2 word"/> will join in this one thank you</u>

<u who="nm5229">right # the the # there were two areas they primarily focused on okay # one was their ability to problem solve okay from that they did find a good range and the deduction was there was a number who who are good problem solvers and equally with the personality traits but i did point out <trunc>w</trunc>  with the personality traits the attitudes # we had a discussion earlier on they may know how to answer the questions so it may not be an honest response  and the other thing is they're already a selected group okay they've already been admitted so in a way you would expect them to have the right sort of attitudes but if they were given to sixth-formers a thousand sixth-formers say then it might actually help you to discriminate who would be more suitable for the interview stage</u>
<u who="nm5230"># can i jump in about the P-Q-A <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 word"/>  bundle of P-Q-A tests out in that  as you probably know the one that's being used this summer that i know about  was used by Queen Mary University London part of the London Hospital   personal personality personal qualities assessment test is basically aimed at trying to discover whether the candidate has the right abilities of empathy and things like that and the point of the test really is to exclude those who do not have # these suitable traits for medicine rather than to rank-order them so it's a useful thing to get rid of those with two heads but it's not a useful thing to decide those who we should call for interview # the i have actually looked at that test # and the way the sort of questions it formulates really aren't so much problem solving as indeed personality testing the sorts of questions that you that that they pose a scenario scenario where <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 word"/> is that you are aa man with a relatively modest salary <trunc>u</trunc>  <trunc>r</trunc>  living and working in a country where there's no National Health Service and your wife is seriously ill and you need so many thousand dollars in order to buy the treatment you haven't got that money but you have the opportunity to embezzle it from your firm and then a whole string of questions are asked about that  and then the scenario is slightly changed # another string of questions is asked about it and it's actually quite subtle and interesting i <trunc>f</trunc>  well there's no failing but i <trunc>f</trunc>  i <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 word"/> <vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" dur="2"/> # # the point is with this you get you put if you think of a dot plot of personality characteristics you you will get a cluster of dots in the middle with the people that you would regard as suitable and some guys on the periphery who would you you would regard as not suitable at Queen Mary's # they  applied the test to i think a thousand candidates and excluded three-hundred-and-fifty odd # on that basis now that might be a fine way of going about things if you're wanting to homogenise the profession and end up with a bundle of guys and gals who are right sort of touchy-feely sort of things but inevitably by taking that approach you run the risk of excluding those who are going to be excellent histopathologists and so one has that sort of doubt about it you see there are other doubts the other doubts <vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" dur="2"/> are that people can learn how to do these  things and the experience in countries where this sort of testing has been used is that fairly fairly quickly perhaps sprung up private schools which will train you for a price how to pass that test and so on # the question was asked whether it gives us information we don't already know the answer is of course not really but it quantifies it and makes it transparent i mean if you spend enough time in interviewing and and getting people to write essays as they can for example in Oxford spend two or three days with candidates in Oxford don't they if you've got that sort of time available then i'm quite sure you can <trunc>f</trunc>  do the same sorts of things as a P-Q-A test would do quite sure of it we can't don't have the time so there is an argument that to exclude the outliers  if that's what you want to do you can use P-Q-A testing but there's no need to do that it's not not for ranking you were also asking about something about whether we feel that graduates should be more mature indeed we do # # one of the things that Jag has mentioned is this issue about # work experience when we say work experience what we mean is that they should have got real hands-on some sort of caring experience hands-on working with people in some sort of fashion it doesn't have to be in a medical environment although that's obviously preferable thing about our candidates since they're in their early twenties we would have expected them to have got this sort of # experience of their own volition # to candidates that come from school  that have done this they've been told to do this by their teachers okay so there is a difference  and that's how how we look for this sort of more mature attitude # that's how we  i think certainly graduates should be regarded as potentially huh potentially more  more mature than school leavers</u>

<u who="nm5230">you have you have touched on a very serious issue which is training interviewers how do we train interviewers # and to be honest # i'm open to advice <vocal desc="laugh" iterated="y" dur="2"/> <vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" dur="2"/></u>
<u who="nf5224">i was wondering the same thing about communication skills because i think it's it's relatively easy relatively easy for any professional to make a judgement about how they felt about the candidate in front of them but and i think the training issue's really really key <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 word"/> communication skills a shared understanding what would of what level of communication skills can be expected from <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 word"/> candidate would be helpful cos just from observing people i've got a theory that people tend to rate highly communication skills that are similar to their own which means that an interviewer who  whose own personal style is to be very professional sit up very straight and behave in a <trunc>ver</trunc>  in in a particular way would actively prefer a candidate doing the same a very expressive interviewer</u>
<u who="nm5230">well</u>
<u who="nf5224">might feel</u>
<u who="nm5230">yes</u>
<u who="nf5224">naturally drawn to a very expressive candidate</u>
<u who="nm5230">i i again i take your point</u>
<u who="nf5224">i think the training's crucial i mean</u>
<u who="nm5230">training is and the the way we did <trunc>w</trunc>  the way we trained # was we put up #  # dummy interviews # and they're very good dummy interviews cos one candidate interviewed very badly and the other <trunc>candi</trunc>  candidate these are actual students not candidates</u>
<u who="nf5224">yeah</u>
<u who="nm5230">obviously we couldn't do it with candidates # one student interviewed very well and the other student interviewed rather badly # and we got the interviewer # interviewers we were training to score # all the various criteria we were interested in in the way we do in a standard interview and surprisingly the the they were quite tight scores # i should have brought along the data # which i'm going to accumulate overthe coming years but in fact there was not much experience # and it looked as if # the interviewers were all doing much the same thing well now you can come back quite rightly and say well that's not at all surprising because all these interviewers are the same people basically they're all  medics middle-aged mostly white all of them European no not all of them European but but you know what i mean a a rather homogeneous group of</u>
<u who="nf5224">that's where your lay panel come in presumably <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 word"/> think it's a great idea</u>
<u who="nm5230">beg your pardon</u>
<u who="nf5224">that's where you lay panel come in presumably it's <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 word"/> a great idea</u>
<u who="nm5230">well well yes there there are serious restraints on on the whole business of interviewing and and that is resources # because  i feel it's very important that it should be at least one medic <vocal desc="laugh" iterated="y" dur="2"/>on the interviewing panel without any question the other person we only have two i would prefer to have three the other person i feel should be non-medical but  i'm fairly broad-minded about what non-medical means you know i'm not i'm i'm a biochemist by trade # but i've been so much associated with medicine so for such a long time i can't really call myself non-medical  # but i know # # a J-P not a G-P a J-P whom i feel would make a very good interviewer <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 word"/> in this situation so i would like to have the variety in the interviewing panel to do what you what you suggested we do but in practice i think i'm going to be strapped to two interviewers for ever</u>
<u who="nf5224">i hope you get three cos it sounds really <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 word"/></u>
<u who="su">it does it sounds brilliant</u>
<u who="nm5230">yes</u>
<u who="su">Alan can i ask # <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 word"/> how many of these students have had interviewing # done # practice before like for senior registrars and and junior doctors we they ask we train them up for interviewing i'm sure when they go for their interviews they do quite well do the # # schools provide them interviewing it's all very good when you look at their marks everything they do  # they've been selected in a particular way i'm sure if they had training in interviewing and communication skills they'll come and perform better then the second comment was so many  manager and professional one i interviewed one this gentleman said i i'm i'm # from a labouring family and straightaway made me empathic towards him  i i i actually felt # he was making a case # that he's coming from a poor family and and # it's such a small number are there and i think those people will make better doctors i think # # <trunc>a</trunc>  and and i wonderwhether you've got any comments whether we should give them a special # # # approach</u>
<u who="nm5229">well the second part i think Alan will answer # <vocal desc="laugh" iterated="y" dur="2"/>the first part # i will answer we don't have any real idea how much training they actually have had i know for the local schools # i am invited to do some interviews for them and some of the consultant colleagues there so yes they do get a lot of practice so this goes back to the age-old argument that if we're looking for certain personality traits or certain <trunc>ty</trunc>  way to interview we can train them but one could argue and that's just # a view that i hold i mean even attitudes can be taught but certainly communication skills can be taught i mean although there's a little argument over the attitudes but they do shift in a way so if somebody has got bad communication skills  at say point A if they go through clinical methods course the DISC course and all the the ones that are  by the Department of General Practice we improve all of those so they are we are able to teach them that so one wonders <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 word"/> whether that should actually be a bar or whether that's just a value judgement we make at a point in time and we've got to really give preference to the people who've already got these traits and the right sort of communication skills so we don't know what level of # # training they're being given</u>
<u who="nm5230">when when we have a group of candidates in for interview i've <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 word"/> time i often ask them how many of you have been to competitive interview before # and it's about half have had some sort of experience of competitive interviewing being competitively interviewed i should say the other half have not because these days # it's very rare for people to go into serious competitive interviews in a university  # in the Department of Biological Sciences # we wanted to attract them in we aren't trying to sort out sheep and goats <vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" dur="2"/> so i suspect that the answer is that those who have been to competitive interviews especially if they've got a middle-class background and gone to private schools will have had some training a lot of our candidates have not been through that situation and i do not know how we can compensate for that i wish we could compensate for that i don't know how we can # but what i try try to do is if a guy has bounced and he asks me why # and he's done badly in the interview because of his # communication skills i make that very clear to him and i say if you want to do better you've got to do soemthing about that get some practice and advice of how to how to how to # present yourself at an interview so the issue you bring up is very important sadly there's nothing  we can do about it because we can only judge what's in front of us at the time we can't we cannot judge potential <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 word"/> no way we can we we can we can imagine that we could so if a guy communicates badly at the interview sadly that's it however good he might be people ask <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> sorry</u>
<u who="su">yeah sorry # # i mean just just extending on to that point i mean # # # # looking at the # the explanation of the process the the it's a twenty-minute interview but ten minutes are used for paperwork and so effectively it's only ten minutes</u>
<u who="nm5230">No no no </u>
<u who="nm5229">no <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 word"/></u>
<u who="nm5230"><gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 word"/> interview plus plus ten minutes # </u>
<u who="su">oh okay</u>
<u who="nm5230"># the ten minutes is intended so that the interviewers can develop strategy for the interview and think about the assessment afterwards</u>
<u who="su">okay</u>
<u who="nm5230">there are two possible <trunc>ap</trunc>  there are two strategies for interview broadly speaking one is the situation where you the the interviewers go in completely cold without any background information and develop a <trunc>d</trunc>  # # # a discourse with the candidate now that takes time cos you've got to explore and you ask the guy what his name is for example </u>
<u who="su">yeah</u>
<u who="nm5230">the other approach is that you use prior information to structure the interview if you've got lots of time then the first is very good if you haven't got lots of time then you have to use prior information to decide are you going to organise so the five minutes before the interview for the guys to do that </u>
<u who="su">yeah</u>
<u who="nm5230"># so we have a chat you say i've noticed such and such and such from the papers i i will kick off by saying such and such why don't you follow up by such and such and that's how it goes then after the interview we spend two or three minutes thinking about then we put our scores down okay </u>
<u who="su">so so it lasts ten to twenty minutes so</u>
<u who="nm5230">twenty minutes</u>
<u who="su">i i i was going to # my point was you know is it <trunc>i</trunc>  <trunc>i</trunc>  is it # # # enough time <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 word"/> do interviews  is fine and that's sufficient time for doing justice to the candidates</u>
<u who="nm5230">i have thought about this and i have talked to people about this # particularly i # Jag put up very quickly # the name D Powis P-O-W-I-S he is  his background <trunc>i</trunc>  he's English but he's moved to # # Newcastle in New South Wales some time ago he's dean of admissions there and he's been very much involved in development of interviewing techniques and so there's lots of stuff in the literature if you want to find it # he says that if you define the the personality traits you're actually looking for motivation suitability # ten minutes in a properly-organised interview you can make some objective judgement on those traits he says one trait per ten minutes provided it's properly structured properly thought about and the interviewers are trained so in our twenty minutes we can look at two traits communication comes as a bonus you don't need to separately judge communication because if the guy can't answer your questions then he can't communicate so that comes as a bonus so given the limitations of resources # the way we thought about it i think it's practical and works</u>

<u who="nm5230">thank you <vocal desc="laugh" iterated="y" dur="2"/></u>
<u who="nm5223">thinking about it  it seems that training people to be interviewers is very analagous to training medical students to have good consultation skills  an element of interpersonal skills and then there is also an element of problem solving you have got to gather some data and you've gotta analyse it and interpret it and possibly gather  some more data  so it i would have thought that the best training programme would be something that was modelled on how we train consultation skills <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 word"/> we come from medical schools we should be very good at that so i'd have thought that the the training would use a similar <trunc>s</trunc>  range of techniques</u>
<u who="nm5230">i absolutely <trunc>ag</trunc>  you you're right # actually i've only been involved with training once so far previously the training was done from Leicester # and it and i i'm very keen that we should develop our training programme and this is precisely what Jag and i are talking about right now is how we should develop the training process you you're very right to separate the these two things about being able to communicate and being able to assess data you're absolutely right and that's a very sensible structure </u>

<u who="nm5225">that would be terrific</u>
<u who="nf5224">that's what we're up to at the moment next one please Phil  this is my personal area of my main personal area of research at the moment i've got a few things going on but this is the big one  # cos this is my PhD which hopefully i'll be handing in  sometime in the next few weeks # my particular area of interest is assessment # in particular how communication skills are assessed and there's been some references this morning to the interesting areas about consistency in assessing the candidate interview candidate's communication how can we start to begin to make judgements about attitude and professionalism this ties in i think quite nicely with that # it's a five-year project that i'm gonna attempt to describe in two minutes so in its briefest form  in a in in year five as part of their final general practice exam our students have to undertake a long  effectively and two of those stations are full role-play consultations we're a <trunc>mit</trunc>  we're a multi-disciplinary team in the Interactive Skills Unit which means that we're a mixture of commissions non-commissions linguists and a big team of role-players # from different teaching training and theatrical backgrounds # and the role-players are a great resource we use them for teaching right through the curriculum and the most experienced ones # are used for assessment and the way that our voiceless examination works on the communications i mean on sorry on the stations where role-play's happening is # an observing G-P examiner will score the students for clinical topics and areas of clinical management but the communication skills score which is worth a fifth of the station mark is negotiated between the examiner and the role-player  the scoring system that we use i've actually given you a copy of we use a banding system we we we abandoned checklists and rating scales # a while ago because they they don't work in communication in our experience we're trying to move across a sort of more positive assessment # and that's our banding system is A to F and you've got a sample there <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 word"/> band B which i'm happy to talk to anybody about afterwards if they want to basically my PhD is looking at the way that negotiation system takes place and a lot of data was collected over a four-year period where i was recording independent score perception of every role player independent score perception of every examiner and then the mark that they finally agreed on which was the score awarded in the finals to the students and as you can guess basically looking for reliability  next one please Phil  that's the very briefest summary of the most interesting areas of the results that i came across # across a sample of over a thousand consultations # irrespective of whatever <vocal desc="laugh" iterated="y" dur="2"/> variables # we we looked at female students performed consistently higher or if you like were awarded consistently higher scores depending on how you choose to frame that # right across the sample and the that's that female student gender significantly higher score was irrespective of the year of study the age of the examiner the experience of the role player the time of day the month of year all of the exam variables that we looked at that was the one that stayed significant we found that students performed less well on some role play stations than others and we're starting to work towards some theories from that there is a relationship between a student's communications skills performance and the content of the consultation found that students are getting higher marks when they're discussing lifestyle issues than when they're required to discuss a new diagnosis for example</u>

<u who="ss">hello Phil<vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" dur="2"/></u>
<u who="nm5225">thank you very much # the actor in me will never die it # i was reflecting on the way here today that that my journey the journey that brings me here today started back in nineteen-eighty-one September nineteen-eighty-one when i joined the Theatre Studies Department just down the road  and was one of the people who did theatre studies and dramatic arts B-A honours back between nineteen-eighty-one and eighty-four subsequently became an actor millions of other things and bits and pieces in between but over the last seven years have been working with # Connie and the team on the communication skills course at Birmingham so that's some of my background my particular research area is cross-disciplinary it causes all kinds of difficulties because it's not  quite qualititative it's not quite quantitative it adds to knowledge in # hopefully in three different areas i'm not quite sure most of where or what # it's # currently a Masters looking for transfer to a PhD and we're going through that process at the moment so it's far earlier <trunc>inter</trunc>  in the process than than <trunc>y</trunc>  we're at with Connie at the moment  but effectively i'm looking at doctor-patient communication skills i'm applying a linguistic model to look at contextually what is happening within doctor-patient communication skills and then i'm looking at finding a visual representation of what a consultation looks like and applying a chaos theory measurement to that visualisation to then say okay well what does this tell us about it so those of you who are aware of what a fractal is and what a fractal does will understand that those of you who don't i can give you three or four hours later to talk through it is that all right <vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" dur="2"/> that would be great # those of you <trunc>with</trunc>  in the university at Warwick who are aware of Francis Griffiths will perhaps know that this is a big research area of Francis and i've present ed before the complexity in primary care group on a number of occasions on this particular area i don't propose to go into any great depth of it today for for for quite obvious time limitation reasons my hope is that ultimately where this will be leading will be to move towards looking at doctor-patient communication ultimately in terms of complexity theory and this if you like is a doorway in what what is actually happening where is it working okay what's it look like  those are consultations  done in this way those are visualisations of consultations and what you can actually do is you can say a fractal very very briefly is a measurement of irregularity it is a statistical measurement of irregularity of that shape if you think about the coastline of Britain that has a fractal measurement of one-point-two-seven it's in between the first and the second dimension <vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" dur="2"/> we're getting into Doctor Who here do you like it okay so the fractal measurements there are represented by # the the signified D-F equals one-point-three-one so we've got a smaller fractal value on that one than we have on that one my study is looking at why that is what that means what the implications for that are i think given the linguistic model that i've chosen what i'm looking at at the moment and what i'm developing is something that measures style consultation style right it's looking at # what i call thetopography that's the mathematical relationship to to chaos theory so we're looking at the topography of a consultation what is the rocky road that takes you from hello good morning come in and sit down how can i help you through to  yeah thanks doctor that's brilliant what is that road what does that journey look like is it smooth is it rough what does the roughness mean is the roughness appropriate is it not there're all sorts of issues around that # consequently variance of style how important is that how does that work what sort of level of flexibility have we got that is almost a measure of flexibility that one has great flexibility that one has less so lot more in this what's the application reflective practice it's not an assessment tool it can't be done in that sort of way because it's largely a qualitative study and the volume of information that would need to be sat behind it i think would be a problem my hope is to develop something that a doctor can sit down and look at and say hang o n a minute why are these particular why why work in these particular areas more than in other particular areas dependent on the circumstances of the consultation what the presenting condition is how long the consultation is how long the relationship has been with the patient and all those other variables so really that's kind of where i'm going at the moment so # almost within time i'm gonna hand you over for a far more rigorous approach to # <vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" dur="2"/> <gap reason="name" extent="2 word"/></u>
<u who="nm5231">i'm doing discourse analysis of recorded consultations and basically what i'm looking for is why do patients make initiations in consultations so why do they initiate new information in a consultation and i'm using something called the  I-R-F model which was developed at Birmingham in the seventies for educational discourse and I-R-F stands for initiation response and feedback and if you look on your handout on the first page you will see that an initiation basically is when a speaker attempts to engage a listener and then you get a response and what's quite unusual about educational discourse is you get feedback  so you get the teacher evaluating the response of the pupil and this also happens according to literature in medicine so you often get a doctor evaluating what the patient has said so an example from my corpus does it hurt a bit if i <trunc>d</trunc>  does it hurt if i do that i think okay good now why did the doctor say good when when the patient said it hurt is kind of strange to me and i wondered why this would be and as i'm not a G-P nor a doctor in another specialty i don't really know why a doctor would say good when a patient had said i've got pain but maybe he has a reassuring technique i'm not sure so i'd be interested to know what people think afterwards  what i've tried to do then is categorise <trunc>c</trunc>  the communication into exchanges okay which are basically communicative function and each new initiation is also a new exchange so every time you have a new initiation in a consultation it's a new exchange and i've come up with eight categories which i've also put on your handout # i think most of them are self-explanatory # informing exchanges are when the doctor or the patient gives information checking exchanges usually when the doctor usually is checking to make sure the patient's understood but sometimes the pa tient will initiate a check to make sure they have understood the doctor correctly directing exchanges that's when usually the doctor is giving a direction to the patient to <trunc>facili</trunc> to facilitate diagnosis so would you please take your shirt off for example advice exchanges usually when the doctor is talking about prescribing you know i want you to take this once a day twice a day and so on okay could you move on to the next slide thanks Phil</u>

<u who="nm5231">okay so  my main question for my PhD is why do patients initiate  but we're also videotaping the consultations because from pilot studies of audio data we realised we were missing an awful lot of what was happening because a lot of the responses are non-verbal so in some cases we had lots of initiations by the doctor but there didn't seem to be a response so we had to assume therefore that the response was a non-verbal one that the audio tape didn't pick up so we're videotaping for that reason we're also combining this with a patient enablement instrument to see if there are seven exchange categories that influence high enablement scores so we're using John Howie's patient enablement instrument for that purpose because most discourse analysis studies are based just on observation we don't actually use a measure of satisfaction okay we're also using this technique for a few other projects i've done a comparison of general practice with simulated emergency medicine consultations and what was interesting there we found for closed questions that in emergency medicine the doctors tended to stack the closed questions one on top of the one on top of the other and they didn't wait for the patient to respond so they may have they may have asked four questions and it was sometimes puzzling for the patient which question do i answer first and that didn't really happen in general practice it was much slower so i would say that in emergency medicine a consultation is far more dense you have lots more closed questions coming at flying at a patient whereas in general practice it's often more reflective we've also used this technique for evaluation of undergraduate role-play and finally we've just finished a <sic corr="project">projects</sic> to do with evaluation of training interventions for early intervention in psychoses # which is interesting too # if you have any questions i'll i'll answer them afterwards and that's it thanks <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> cheers</u>

<u who="nf5224">yes</u>

<u who="nf5224">there's a lot of parallels in education yeah</u>
<u who="ss">right <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 word"/> <trunc>n</trunc> now what is <trunc>go</trunc>  what is what am i gonna say going wrong i think the females are a superior class of beings i definitely <vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" dur="2"/>have no doubt about that but why does it happen does it <trunc>wh</trunc>  what's what's the microanatomy behind it why is it student you know female students are perform we find that our housemen student # female students do better than our male now what what is the what do you find in your research</u>
<u who="nf5224">well i i i mean i've run into i mean my my my my actual hard research is is looking at really is looing at the numbers and looking at the statistics i <trunc>haven</trunc>  i i i'm not an expert on  some of the clinical factors that lie behind gender gender performance i have a i have a theory from having looked around at other educational sources like # recent government studies on school performance i have a theory that with # # girls maturing faster and apply themselves at an earlier age to learning perhaps in a way that some of their male peers don't but that may continue into higher education but i think we have to be a little bit careful about making generalisations because what we have here is evidence that female students are scoring higher in a communication skills tests than their male colleagues and that's usually by a margin of one-and-a-half to two-and-a-half marks out of a hundred across the board what we don't have yet but i'm collecting is comparative data and what i'd like to know is are those same female students performing better on machine-marked tests all might we find that this is a particular style of examination that suits our female students and there are other areas of the test like audit where perhaps our male students are doing better so what this has sparked off for me as a single result is the need to do a load of comparative studies round voices and around other areas of the curriculum to try and provide the data that you're talking about i mean there's all sorts of speculation that could be made as to why the girls do better in this situation it may be because it's just a a situation where they're they're being # # # assessed on a number of skills simultaneously and that perhaps some of our female students find it easier to think about a number of things consecutively i read #  i read something by a psychologist suggesting that men are much more focused in their thinking that women perhaps are mor e apt at multi-tasking that's one view i don't have # i mean i i don't think myself or any psychiatrist or psychologist or commissioner in the country can give a definite answer to why is this female student no better at this task than this male student what we have got is evidence that it's happening and that what we're realising is that it's important to find out what teaching and learning methods are suiting which groups of students so that we can make sure that we're offering an appropriate range of teaching and testing methods to give all our students the chance of being the best that they possibly can be</u>

<u who="nm5225">Alan?</u>
<u who="su">can i ask Andrew about # the way you tried to map the consultation the process itself i mean you say is very  useful as a reflecting which i agree but how complicate is to map that sort of chart</u>
<u who="nm5231"># it's very time-consuming </u>
<u who="su">it is</u>
<u who="nm5231">because you have to sort of every utterance you have to give a category to # and it takes and what i tend to do is i code a consultation on one day and then i will wait two weeks and then i will code it again on a blank piece of paper and compare the two # so i so i try to get some kind of reliability in my coding system and then i also ask other people to code as well</u>
<u who="su">so i'm just  by one of the function that your  your unit uses for poorly perform doctor</u>
<u who="nf5224">yes</u>
<u who="su"> yeah so if i got a poorly perform doctor  i want to look at his communication or  consulation skills one of the aspect you will have one person look at the consultation yourself chart it and then leave it for a couple of weeks and get another person to chart it and then reflect it back to the doctor</u>
<u who="nm5231"># i don't</u>
<u who="su">i just wonder how complicated the process</u>

<u who="nm5231">one one problem i've noticed with this system is that it's very initiation-focused it's it focuses on the initiation so the exchanges are dictated by the initiations and because in my corpus of data over eighty percent of initiations are made by the doctor it means the patient's voice is kind of not heard so what i'm what i'm doing now is going back and looking at the responses because the responses are what the patient does most of all so that's what i need to do and i'm trying to work with a framework of responses that works in the same way that a <trunc>frame</trunc>  framework initations at this stage?</u>

<u who="nm5225">i don't i don't don't see a problem with going back into it really because it's it's around where it's around where the diagrams are coming from because the key to the key to it is and this is what where there wasn't time to explain although briefly so it's based on four different elements of a consultation which very briefly are meet and greet # patients explain the problem doctor exploring the <trunc>plob</trunc>  problem and consultation resolution so where are we going so which of those areas are we in visually you can tell from that graph which of those contexts the consultation spends most of its time in that i think is a helpful <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 word"/> of # reflection on the pilot study which has looked at thirty consultations of which those are two one of the things that has become very clear and it echoes something that Andy was saying about initiations is that an awful lot of time is spent in the area of the doctor exploring the problem which feels to me is kinda how it should be okay tell me a bit more about that when did the pain first start those sorts of questions where you're exploring what you've been told by the patient now what it's saying is if contextually depending on what the presenting condition is is it useful to be spending i'm not saying is it right i'm saying is it useful to be spending as much time in that are i think at the moment it's a tool for reflection it's very very early days in developing the idea because as Will's just pointed out nobody haven't done it so i i can't say further than that but that's the way the thinking's going and i do think it has a practical aplication in terms of coding the data that can be done very quickly and again it would be a fast training process because you're not looking at an eighty-five point hierarchy or whatever the calibre scale is in terms of marking up a transcript does that sort of make sense </u>
<u who="nm5227">thank you</u>
<u who="nm5223"> not precisely a question but i hope in some ways it's an answer to your question communication skills of course are only one domain of consultation skills</u>
<u who="nm5225">absolutely</u>
<u who="nm5223">and my experience with undergraduates # at Leicester is that the domain our students third and fourth year students struggle with most is in their problem-solving so it's the cognitive aspects of the consultation and what limited work i've done with # qualified doctors also i think that applies too so when consultations go wrong i think it are it often is rooted in the problem-solving and it so i think that's why it's sometimes quite difficult for non-commissions to evaluate what's happening in the consultation </u>
<u who="nm5225">absolutely</u>
<u who="nm5223">which is why i have the immediate answer to your question the reason why the doctor says oh good  is because at the point that the information he gathered the fact it hurt then helped him confirm his diagnostic reasoning at that point so what he's saying is oh good i now know what the diagnosis is not oh good i've hurt you # and it's i think it's the fact that all of this happens in an integrated way makes it i mean it's a particular skill analysing anybody's consulation skills</u>
<u who="nm5225">absolutely</u>
<u who="nm5223">because in a sense you have to have an equal level of skill if not higher in order to make those kind of judgements and certainly i think that's you know where most undergraduates # are really struggling #</u>
<u who="nf5224">yeah i think that's really interesting i'm thinking what you're saying might link in to this this this thing we're finding aboutthe communication marks for the students varying according to the content of the scenario and  definitely more confident and better at communicating when they're discussing a lifestyle  issue or counselling somebody talking to somebody that's got a known long-term illness that the patient has had for a long time put them in a situation where you give them a test result and they have to interpret the test result work out the plan of management and then explain and negotiate with the patient those communication marks are poorer </u>
<u who="nm5223">yeah</u>

<u who="nm5223">i mean we have what we've done in our i don't know i don't know if you know how Leicester-Warwick assesses its students in the clinical methods course but what we have got is a wealth of data because we actually code what their strengths and weaknesses  and we so over about six-hundred seven-hundred assessments we now know what Leicester and some Warwick students so well and do less well and problem solving is usually where they struggle and certainly my anecdotal experience is that that if the student doesn't really know what the diagnosis is their scores on management are gonna be quite low</u>

<u who="nm5219">railroaded at the last moment to talk about the # subject of evaluation when the unit the G-P undergraduate unit was set up here at # Warwick Medical School Liz has been one of the people who has been pivotal in making it move forward because we've had to recruit recruit G-P training practices and we've had to recruit hospital teachers we've had to run training courses for the teachers in general practice and hospital and we're shortly going to be running an examiners' course at # the Warwick end for for Warwick students and Liz is coordinating all of this activity  one of the other important aspects of this and <gap reason="name" extent="2 word"/> raised it right at the beginning was about evaluation who is evaluation for and we do have a system of evaluation at the moment and one of the questions we've been asking is what do we do with it how can we improve the quality of evaluation and the Q-A Q-A-A is going to get to Warwick very shortly and with the evaluation that we're getting we're gonna be seen to have to do something with it that may change the way the course is run at the moment and Liz has run # a project in relation to evaluation our students on the clinical methods course where students are attached in general practice to learn consultation competencies in clinical medical practice but in the general practice setting so Liz is going to explain this to us so i'll hand over to Liz thank you</u>
<u who="nf5226">i'm sorry this is not gonna be as long or as exciting as Catti's would have been but it'll fill a little gap in the agenda #  just to give you some history # i think generally # it's accepted that feedback from students # using the questionnaire is # is not always working  simply because the students don't always return their questionnaires cos there's no incentive for them to do so # so myself and my colleague from Leicester University <gap reason="name" extent="2 word"/> went on a course in London led by # Professor <gap reason="name" extent="2 word"/> to learn about how to gather and respond to student feedback in other ways other than using a questionnaire the reason for making sure that we do get this feedback is that mainly there are there are two issues there the quality assessment assurance agency # which will be coming to Warwick in March # and also because the white paper that was released by the government in January # in # one of their sections chapter four that # underlines the fact that they want information from students the feedback to become more transparent and they want this information out into the public domain as already happens in Australia and the U-S-A # which is a little bit worrying because # as soon as that information gets into the public domain students will start making their choices on what other students have said so we need to make sure that the information we're getting in if it's # if it's not so great we're actually acting on that and  and following it through so the  system # James Wisdom proposes is called the student consultation process # it's not to take away from the value of using questionnaires which does have its place for gathering qualitative information but we still need to think of a way of getting students to make sure they complete thoseforms and fill them back and a good way of evaluating that informatio n when it's in and over this # consultation period i'm gonna cover the the principles of the the consultation how that information's fed back and and conclusions and suggestions so the the way we do this is we get the students together halfway through their course so that and it's always after a lecture they know that we're taking them seriously they think that we're listening to them and we are <trunc>gon</trunc>  we're gonna <trunc>re</trunc>  form a report and we're gonna act upon what they've said and the question that we're always asking them is that that we're interested in in what's affecting their learning  which has a more positive # thought process if you were to phrase a question such as #  what <trunc>i</trunc>  what is <trunc>i</trunc>  good or bad about your teaching they will automatically start thinking of negatives this teacher's this teacher's not teaching us this or we're not getting this # whereas this gets them thinking more in terms of the whole course and you will get negative stuff coming out but it's what tends to happen and from experience they will say well this isn't so good have you thought about doing this so they're making positive recommendations for change themselves so basically # it's an opportunity for the students and the staff to work together in processing ideas and opinions to to come together as a collective to work on ways forward and the idea is that because the students are aware that it's confidential the the sessions are run by somebody who's not involved in the teaching whatsoever so in the case of the clinical methods course i normally run them because i i don't have any influence one way or another and the students aren't afraid just to tell me what they think # and they do tell me what they think <vocal desc="laugh" iterated="y" dur="2"/> # and after that # process has happened the evaluation is built up in the form of a report # that is broken down intosections and from this the student will liaise with me afterwards to to confirm that the report's okay and that they're happy with the report from then on the process is taken to the next level which is almost the most difficult because with the feedback that you get some of it is negative and that has to be fed back to the tutors or the hospitals or the G-Ps concerned but there is a way of feeding it back with again the the highlighting the positive recommendations and the worst for us is always the hospital feedback but # we're we're slowly # making changes and meeting with the undergraduate coordinators so so things are moving along  # one of the things that he says is to make sure you know how you're gonna address a situation should the should they arise so are you gonna discuss it with individuals alone or or in a group and we've been meeting as a G-P group and then # feeding out the information to the hospitals once we've agreed how we're gonna feed it back thereafter   # it's important to have the whole team involved in this and to take on board what is coming back and to all work forwards to to improve the course for in all aspects departmental teaching G-Ps hospitals # and making sure that all the reports that we're building up along the way have these actions closed off so that should anybody from the Q-A-A ever come and look at those reports they're always closed off or we can say that they're in action so we're thinking about doing this we're trialling this # and and so on so that's basically how the student consultation process works and we've just trialled it # in two clinical methods blocks for the moment # and the feedback we've had has been very very productive # and very qualitative and full of suggestions and actually we've taken on board a lot of the students' suggestions so far # and we're trying to work together with the hospitals and the G-Ps to to improve things so that's it </u>

<u who="nf5224">i think it's it's really encouraging to hear that # such you know such steps are being taken to make  student feel that really is activated in particular # i think it's great that the individual tutors are getting individual feedback and i think <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 word"/> a very different situation to the sort of evaluation forms that you mentioned earlier what we'd be really interested to know though is # that is how how that's # perceived by the tutors # i think you made one comment in particular about # with a big smile on your face when you said particularly enjoyable feeding back to the hospital consultants</u>

<u who="nf5224">it does it does certainly does sound like that and we'll touch wood that that that continues for yourselves and for all of us as well one thing that did cross my mind although we all hope it never happens given the sheer volume of doctors that you know are spread across X  number of teaching hospitals if it did arise where perhaps # some quite serious feedback was coming back from a significant number of students then there might be a serious problem with perhaps the attitude of a member of staff or that blocks of teaching were being missed # we hope it doesn't matter but if it did is there some sort of system in place where that that would be addressed</u>
<u who="nf5226">mmhm the mechanism involved would be # the the route through the university so from the consultation process if it came up with a <trunc>pesic</trunc> particular consultant then then my route is to discuss that with Rodger as the G-P </u>
<u who="nf5224">yeah</u>
<u who="nf5226">director and then we would go out and see the director of the particular hospital and discuss it with him # because we won't get involved in other people's managerial structures or or that kind of thing or or or taking a lead on that so it's <trunc>f</trunc>  to remain in the hospital domain but we're just saying just raising an issue that that was raised up by the students</u>
<u who="nf5224">that's really interesting thank you</u>
<u who="su">can i make a comment # the medical school is very young three to four years when we # accidentally <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 word"/> start a meeting up i didn't even realise what we were into the vast majority of  hospital consultants who are teaching our students have never been through this training process this sort of thing will be absolutely normal to some of my surgical colleagues who have never been through courses and we evaluate it in people in the meanwhile now the students is a big generation gap these students have gone through very new methods of teaching the psychologists and the educators are coming up with new methods of teaching out there my colleagues who are teaching clinical methods learnt it from their peer groups without any teachers training college or any approach and we are evaluating consultants students are giving opinions about consultants <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 word"/> and then you mention all the difficulties consultants have resources et cetera </u>
<u who="nf5226">mm</u>
<u who="su">so i think the evaluating process needs to be looked at in a different way too we need to get our consultants back into the educational process  and expose them to the most recent methods of teaching as opposed to and yet we're evaluating their methods</u>
<u who="nf5226">yeah </u>
<u who="su">i wonder if you have comments on that</u>
<u who="nf5226">i remember  that # <gap reason="name" extent="2 word"/> started doing it running # courses for consultants for # that are available to the consultants in the three hospitals that are linked to Warwick University # and we've run one already that we'd had very positive feedback on from the consultants that attended and from the students who then saw the changes # in how they were being taught which was very productive towards their final assessment # and Sarah continues to run those courses so we are</u>
<u who="nm5228">we've exactly that in mind but so it's the most important thing that we're sort of trying to do it's is to get some uniformity across the teaching  and to make sure that everybody's teaching from the <trunc>s</trunc>  singing from the same hymnsheet and doing it in the same way but it has been very well received and it's # it's going well</u>
<u who="su"><trunc>g</trunc>  # you can say it's well-received but i can't imagine in one session or two sessions you can give to those consultants who are teaching # to students what we are getting in the courses over weeks and probably years i think we need to get those consultants out of the # work situation put them into situations like these so that they go back into teaching and modify their methods of # so if you were to analyse like what we  about micro-anatomy of consultation skills i don't think my colleagues are   to that method of <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/></u>
<u who="nm5228">they aren't and but Rome's not built in a day the first <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 word"/></u>
<u who="su">of course</u>
<u who="nm5228">the first <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 word"/></u>
<u who="su"><gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/></u>
<u who="nm5228">the very first thing is is to enter some sort of relationship with your consultants between the general practitioners the department and the consultants so the first  they haven't got time to come on long courses but if they develop an interest and if every time we forge a relationship and we build on that say for instance and we're running these consultant workshops  developing a log i'm very keen when we've got this logbook to send it out to the # fourteen consultants who came to our first workshop and ask them to develop it to think what their skills are and also to ask them what their idea is and how they can take things forward because it we can't get a group of consultants and tell them to do it our way and in fact we can learn from their way if you like but they need <trunc>t</trunc>  to be invited to think about it and to talk to us about it so that's really the aim of it it's really a liaison between consultants and G-Ps and the department and trying to develop that and it's going to be very slow but i don't know any other medical school that's doing that you know i think there are  good links up for instance in Leicester i know that they talk a lot to their consultant colleagues and they have very good relationships # as you say we're a new university so we have to develop that but i don't know anywhere where that's actually sort of you know trying to get consultants in and trying to do that so i hope that we will get benefit of it but i think it's gonna take an awful long time </u>
<u who="su">and it's also extremely encouraging that the students have reported back that the consultants who have been on the workshop are now teaching in a more structured way so although it is # it's only a day's course there is some uniformity coming from it so it's it's it's gonna carry on being run isn't it Sarah just gonna keep on keep on   away</u>
<u who="nm5228">yeah <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 word"/></u>
<u who="su"><gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 word"/> very good but yeah</u>
<u who="nm5228">it's just so far so good i think but yeah</u>
<u who="su"><gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 word"/> # would you protect the confidentiality of the students cos if the students</u>
<u who="nf5226">the students # </u>
<u who="su">received specific feedback </u>
<u who="nf5226">yeah</u>
<u who="su">you could guess where that's coming from</u>
<u who="nf5226">the reports go <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 word"/> collected # the <trunc>w</trunc>  when they're all in here there's twenty-six on each clinical methods block # they just sign in so that i know on a on a completely separate sheet of paper just that i know if everybody has actually been in in the room # but there is no student's name mentioned at all anywhere in the report unless they specifically want me to mention it which i haven't had so far # and the only persons whose name the only person whose name goes on the report is the student that's asked to witness the report is an accurate account of the meeting that i held with them and they volunteer for that position and they just read it through and sign it off otherwise then that is completely confidential it remains between me and the twenty-six students that i spoke to</u>
<u who="su">you don't need a name do you if you if you get <trunc>nega</trunc>  negative feedback from the group of students that you've been teaching </u>
<u who="nf5226">mm</u>
<u who="su">you may well have some idea which particular students have given that negative feedback so how do you protect them from that </u>
<u who="nf5226">well with the hospitals i mean there's a group of eight students in there at one time with the department you have groups of eight students at one time so it's protected that way as regards to students  one on one teaching in a general practice # the feedback is clarified by the questionnaires # which the the G-Ps have access to anyway on <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 word"/> basis so # the information  that's that's come together there is going to be exactly the same as in public  have they not had too  sessions or did they not have enough professional teaching sessions that kind of thing and they're all in this questionnaire anyway and the G-Ps have been receiving # # it's coming from Leicester and Annette has used it very successfully there so that feedback's always been well received and they're keen to receive it so</u>
<u who="nf5224">do you think it's about clarifying your objectives on that  i think perhaps in a situation that crossed my mind then is what if there was a particular  instance with a particular student and a particular tutor where if that was logged it couldn't possibly be any other student but the one that was present at </u>
<u who="nf5226">right</u>
<u who="nf5224">the time when it happened</u>
<u who="nf5226">mmhm</u>
<u who="nf5224">i think that's where you're starting to cross into the boundaries perhaps in personal tutoring or student counselling scheme</u>
<u who="nf5226">mmhm</u>
<u who="nf5224">and so i think as # # <trunc>f</trunc>  it sounds like you've set out very clearly defined boundaries is that what i think </u>
<u who="nf5226">we do have pastoral care as well </u>
<u who="nf5224">right</u>
<u who="nf5226">and any student has <trunc>pesic</trunc>  specific issue has a pastoral care tutor dedicated to them and that pastoral care tutor also liaises between G-Ps and the student and the hospitals and the student </u>
<u who="nf5224">right</u>
<u who="nf5226"># and she's there for all phase two students # as well as te phase two coordinator # and the phase two administrator Teresa at the back # so we have <vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" dur="2"/> # we have # lots of people in place that will deal with specific issues # with the pastoral care tutors involved <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 word"/></u>
<u who="nm5219"><gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/></u>
<u who="su"><gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 word"/> general question do you know that the students' understanding of their objectives from this course are the same as the consultants' or the G-Ps' understanding of the objectives of the course cos when you're getting feedback from the students presumably you're getting feedback as to whether it's meeting the students' objectives on your course</u>
<u who="nf5226">mmhm</u>
<u who="su">now there may be quite a different understanding as  was saying about what the consultants think the students are well what their objectives are # how did you look at that</u>
<u who="nf5226">well there there have been some issues similar to that already raised where there there is clearly a difference in what the students believe and and what the hospitals believe # generally in the level the teaching is pitched or or that kind of thing but we can only reinforce the the way the assessment is carried out and again by by usually introducing the consultant the consultants' workshop that Sarah runs # and making sure that all the objectives of the course outline are <trunc>hi</trunc>  are are sent to everybody so that students and the consultants know and the G-Ps know exactly what the assessment is # made up of and and how are they  going to get there over this eight-week clinical block</u>
<u who="su">the objective ?</u>
<u who="su">the it it's partly asking what the understanding of the consultants of that information is really cos telling them about what the assessment is isn't necessarily telling them the same thing about what the objectives</u>
<u who="nm5219">the objectives are very very clearly defined and the it the students are actually told that on day one </u>
<u who="su">right</u>
<u who="nm5219">there is a handbook that goes to the consultants the G-Ps and the students and the objectives i think appear on the i'm right in saying that they appear on the first page and they're very very clearly defined and certainly during the first week they're repeated and repeated and repeated as to what the objectives of the course are</u>
<u who="su">when you get  feedback is is suggesting that actually the consultants are working to that objective when you're saying you're getting negative feedback and getting</u>
<u who="nf5226">mmhm</u>
<u who="su"><gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 word"/> the hospital is is that illustrating that there is a difference in perception of objectives</u>
<u who="nm5219">the # # i think there is between some of the hospital consultants but that was the reason for us setting up this course for # consultant workshops exactly it's exactly the same course but is run for the G-P teachers in in practice because obviously those G-P teachers if they haven't been on the course would have a different perception of the objectives but i think i'm correct correct in saying that i don't know if Adrian wants to cos you've been doing this for many years i don't know if you want to throw in anything</u>
<u who="nm5223"><gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 word"/> i think we have very similar problems in terms of a discrepancy in student view the teaching they get from G-Ps and consultants now that i think that partly that's a generic problem of delivering teaching in hospital settings generally # but i think # the processes that we've used i think # one pitfall which you are aware of and that i think we've had to avoid it is how you provide negative feedback and essentially it is negative feedback to our consultant colleagues teaching on this course and of course it is perceived as originating in the department of general practice and i think that's made difficulties for us in our relationships with the hospitals and of course we have no no form of control over the activities we have no we don't recruit the consultants for the teaching # we deliver the feedback to the responsible people within the hospital but that's really as far as it goes and i think over a period of time the perception of consultant colleague that i don't want to get involved in this course because i don't want to be compared to G-Ps who get wonderful feedback all the time has made it hard to sustain quality teaching in hospital settings so and we have two or three consultants who are fully signed up to the objectives of the course understand it to teach according to those objectives and get excellent feedback on a par with our G-P teachers now we have a number of conscripts who get terrible feedback because they don't know what they're doing and they don't wanna be doing it</u>
<u who="nm5219">i mean</u>
<u who="nf5226"><gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 word"/> i think that # the the feedback that we got after the first consultants' workshop from the students was that they <trunc>d</trunc>  <trunc>n</trunc>  noticed a visible difference in the teaching of the <trunc>stu</trunc>  # from the consultants in the four weeks previous that they'd been with them <trunc>t</trunc>  to and then there was the consultants' workshop and then they still had four weeks in the in with the same consultants and they noticed # an amazing difference in that it seemed that the consultants and the G-Ps were now headed in the same direction with the level of teaching # and the objectives of it so i i think the the course has been quite productive in in helping to align everything </u>
<u who="nm5219">and and also we're we're very lucky # at this end because Harshab has already mentioned it because of this thing called the Bosworth Consultant Educators' Group we have been working closely together and one of the things that's actually developed from this and that's the reason a lot of people are here today is this Masters in in Medical Education course so that we are trying to work together on it but one of the new ideas that we implemented was this <trunc>con</trunc>  consultant consultants' workshop in relation to clinical methods course we're gonna be running one two in relation to the examiners' course for the intermediate clinical examination and final clinical examination it's been a wonderful opportunity as well for consultants and G-Ps to meet together and share ideas i mean obviously there are different as Maya's pointed out  different perceptions and and objectives but # but i think we're <trunc>war</trunc>  working very closely together on that can i say a really big thank you to Liz for stepping in at the at the last moment <event desc="applause" iterated="y" dur="2"/>just going to break for tea in a second what one of the things that this has also has raised in my mind listening particularly <trunc>t</trunc>  to Liz's talk Leicester and Birmingham are gonna both very shortly be taking graduate entry students and one of the things that we've learnt at the Warwick site about graduate entry students is they're very much educational consumers # because unlike the sixth form entry students a lot of them haven't had to make the same particularly economic sacrifices one of the students at our practice recently was spending half their time working in Costcutter on the university campus to generate enough income to stay on the course so that if they do get teaching which they perceive is not adequate they are very very quick to tell us about that # almost it happens almost instantly so this is one of the reasons we are very keen to # generate a new a new system of evaluation # for those of you that are on the Masters module today i i'm because i'm on it as well i've felt very much that the # presentations that we've been given have given us great insight into what is the title of the module effective teaching i hope you'll agree with me but perhaps disagree with me over at coffee time if necessary we're gonna have one more # talk after coffee because we've talked very much on the the area of effective teachers but as teachers we all have learning needs as well and we're gonna talk a little bit about the issue of writing personal development plans and perhaps meeting our own needs as learners and teachers in a sort of combined way coffee again is in seminar room one and we'll meet again at half-past-three in here for the final final session</u>
<u who="nm5219">are we all ready to to get started <trunc>cou</trunc>  could i just ask <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/>  just to come forward to the front just for a second if that's all right  could i just bring Anne to the front  <gap reason="name" extent="2 word"/> is the secretary of our department and i just wanted to say a big thank you to <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> because without today it wouldn't have happened she's organised everything from you to be here the food the lunch the coffee just to say thank you very much we're <event desc="applause" iterated="y" dur="2"/> very grateful and thank you to everybody who's come today and and shared in the day particularly for representatives from both Birmingham and # Leicester Universities we've been grateful for for the interaction and hopefully some collaborative initiatives will will come from today i want to introduce you to our last speaker <gap reason="name" extent="2 words"/>  i said that a lot of wonderful work had come out of the academic training scheme for G-P registrars Emma used to be an academic G-P registrar here at Warwick but she's gone on to great greater things now and is a lecturer here in general practice within our undergraduate department of general practice  but the project that she's been working on is personal development plans in the postgraduate side of of primary care and she's gonna <trunc>sh</trunc>  share that with us now thanks very much</u>
<u who="nf5222">that's lovely # normally when you give a lecture you usually check that people can hear okay but i think it's probably more important that people can actually see me over the lectern <vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" dur="2"/> # as Rodger said i used to be will but Warwick employed far better looking registrars than Birmingham and # i came here as an academic G-P registrar and it's probably about a year ago eighteen months ago now and was very interested in education especially for postgraduates and looked very much into personal development plans for G-Ps in the area and that's where my sort of area of research lay # i was very aware when i was asked to talk that A this was an undergraduate research symposium # and that not everybody here would be a G-P i don't know how interesting my research would be to people so what i thought i'd do  is this basically discuss the history of portfolios where they've come from # different methods of using portfolios in different # career areas especially medicine really and i apologise to those people that aren't from medical backgrounds obviously when discussing portfolios we do need to bring in an element of reflection # so i'm gonna discuss that as well and then finally move on to the problems and the benefits of using portfolios in medicine and then i can touch on my research if anyone's desperate to go home at that point right so  # i wanted everyone to think of something that reminds them of Italy # it may seem a bit of a strange question # i thought of a few myself obviously food came first # basically the reason why i put this slide in is the word portfolio actually originates from Italy # it started in the eighteenth century and it can be split into two components and i apologise for pronunciation as i don't speak Italian but the first is portare which is to carry and the second is folio which i'm sure there is a proper Italian pronuncation for that meaning leaf or sheet and so really in its basic basic # meaning portfolio means a case for carrying loose sheets of paper and obviously in the artistic world that definition still carries and often you see people going for job interviews with their big portfolios # containing all their <trunc>leaf</trunc>  loose sheets of artwork that they've done basically since this time the definition and the word portfolio has been picked up by lots of different # occupations the commonest one's the government # they basically have developed the word portfolio to mean a case containing official documents for certain departments within the government and that's led to job descriptions such as Minister with Portfolio and Ministers without Portfolio for those people that do have the responsibilities for looking after these cases of documents in the N-H-S or in the educational field in general # the definition of portfolio has really taken on two main areas and that's what i'm gonna discuss today  starting with the first one of a scrapbook a very basic definition # it's a collection of written material or evidence of skills # a person possesses basically <trunc>y</trunc>  years and years ago what used to happen is you used to finish school used to go and get a job down the road where you'd stay really until you retired you'd get married have two children et cetera et cetera things have changed very much so we're now expected to do extra qualifications we're expected to actively move round get different jobs different experiences even specialise in different specific areas within the occupation that we've actually chosen obviously we need to demonstrate to people the expertise and experience that we have so what we use are best doing is collecting certificates evidence of work that we've done # in order to prove where we've been # couple of people that looked into scrapbook type portfolios were Pendleton and Hasler basically they should said that you should be as imaginative as you can be with your portfolios put in anything you think of so that includes video tapes now audits research as we've been discussing today everything to prove where you've been and what you've been doing since you sat your first basic exams  right  so if we go back to the previous one portfolios can also be used as educational tools # and that's really what i'm gonna concentrate on more now because it's what the government want us to do and what's being used most in the field of continuing medical education basically using portfolios as an educational tool you start with your basic scrapbook but you add in the additional dimension of reflection and reflective learning  so what is reflection # here's a definition by Brown basically if we think of reflection it throws up images of mirrors and seeing ourselves how other people see us # in education this extends to visualising or thinking about experiences that we've had courses we've been on making sense of them and perhaps seeing them in a different way or a constructive way # we've all got the ability to look at things we do and make changes to how we do those things in the future # even from when we're born if you think of a small child who puts their hand on a hot radiator they soon learn that it's best not to do that again # and that's really reflection in its very basic form it'sbeen a topic of interest really to lots of educational writers # probably one of the most famous ones is John Dewey  as you can see by the black and white photo he was born in eighteen-fifty-nine he actually became head of philosophy and psychology in <trunc>s</trunc>  Chicago # and his main interest really lay in educational systems in different countries and he actually did considering the year that he was born did quite a lot of travelling to different countries looking at the educational systems that were growing in each country he also felt that education resulted in people fitting reacting in different ways and fitting into different niches within society and taking on different roles within society and he felt that was all educational based # he basically described two main types of learning the first was trial and error type learning # he felt that skills could be developed after practising a task over and over again <trunc>resert</trunc>  resulting in a more of a learnt behaviour # that could be used in just sp ecial circumstances only the commonest one is if someone came to you and said how do you ride a bike # we all know how to ride a bike we've all practised it when we were children with stabilisers and we now know how to ride a bike but try and describe that to someone it's very very difficult <trunc>w</trunc>  because it's a learnt behaviour he also felt there was a second type of learning and that was reflective learning he where information and feedback from previous experiences could then be used to draw conclusions which if ever you came across that experience again could be used # and basically he <trunc>fi</trunc>  was the first one to introduce the concept of learning cycles and learning loops where conclusions from previous experiences could be fed back and used to manipulate experience when you have it again  he's very well known for something called his pedagogic creed and i just put that in really for the people who are interested in education the Masters students in education and as he said he felt education <sic corr="began">becan</sic> unconsciously at birth and went throughout life and shaped that individual and it's that that fitted them into a certain area and function in society so after Dewey had had developed this learning loop David Kolb  and i don't think that's the most flattering photo that i found of him <vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" dur="2"/> # he was another educationalist and he was Professor of Organisational Behaviour and he had a special interest not just in the way that people fitted into social society due to their education he felt that due to your education that made you more likely to pick specific careers and fit within certain organsations and often meant # that's where people ended up working  in nineteen-seventy-one he joined together with Rubin and MacIntyre who were also interested in education and developed Dewey's learning loop a bit further  they produced this  and it's well-known as Kolb's loop he felt that a learner had to be competent in all of these different areas # and started the cycle in order for to be an effective learner the whole cycle had to keep turning and if a person was inadequate in any of the areas they were just unable to learn at all  so moving on <trunc>t</trunc>  from this # the final person that i'm gonna talk about today is Donald Schon he's also well-known # for his techniques of reflection he like Kolb was very interested in individuals and the way they functioned within their working organisations and their working environment he really wasn't that interested in Kolb's cycle he <trunc>wan</trunc>  went back to Dewey's original concept of the fact of # task learning and reflective type learning he felt that # Dewey had got it slightly wrong and instead of being two different ways of learning that it was actually one type of learning and that people actually performed a task and then while they were performing that task they were able to reflect # think about what they were doing and make alterations to their behaviour during the time that they were doing that he also felt that people were also able after they'd finished the task to look back and think about what they'd actually done  from this he developed these three terms reflection in action is where you're doing a task and you actually think about what you're doing at the time and you can alter or modify your behaviour accordingly reflection on action he felt was the ability to look back at what had happened and again make changes for the future and both of those came together in order to provide individuals that had a knowledge in action so they're able to perform both these tasks in order to perform a function it's quite complicated and i think the easiest way for me to describe it and again i apologise to the non-medical ones people here is someone taking out an appendix if a surgeon goes in and takes out an appendix there is the typical way of an <sic corr="appendectomy">appendesectomy</sic> if you read the textbook it's the sheet make the incision here find the appendix here remove it as such if the surgeon goes in and the appendix is in a slightly different position for example behind the secum then the whole process has to be modified the surgeon has to look somewhere else for the appendix take it out in a slightly different way extend the scar slightly and that's reflection in action the surgeon has seen what he's doing a function that modifications need to be made afterwards when the surgeon's stitched up and he's sitting down having his cup of coffee he can actually think about that patient was there any clues when he took the history from the patient on examining the patient that he wasn't gonna find a typical appendix when he went in there if he does find evidence that there were some differences he can actually use that information in the future to be more prepared for the next operation that he comes across and that's more of a reflection on action right so basically reflection's a very complex process there's diferent influences that reflect what we # take home and basically what we choose to take from a situation depends on our personal aspirations our past experiences and where we feel our personal needs or inadequacies lie # and all of these result in modifications hopefully in our behaviour going back to the internal and external influences if you provide a group of delegates with the same lecture and provide them with a sheet where they're able to write home one take-home message the take-home message probably will be very different for everybody in the room # that's because each of us will find part of the talk slightl y more interesting than another depending on our experiences # and that's really the element of the internal and external influences on reflection so what we need to do now is put all those all that information about reflection back into the use of portfolios so if we return to our scrapbook what we're doing now is we're using our reflective techniques to look at each learning experience that we've had so as we mentioned before the scrapbooks can be full of certificates and achievements so when you came today # you might have thought oh well i might have a certificate at the end of the day that i can put in my scrapbook and people will see that i've been to this interesting course at Warwick # however if we're gonna use that to reflect hopefully some people after they look at that certificate will think oh i know a bit more about education now or i know perhaps that i'm inadequate in knowledge in this area of education and i'll go and find out more some people might have just come and actually found out where Warwick is and that it's actually got a medical school in the first place # that's another learning experience some people might have sat next to someone at lunch who's a P-C-T tutor after they start chatting to them and think gosh i've no idea what that is and then go away and actually look that up it's got absolutely nothing to do with the course but it's a learning <sic corr="opportunity">opportunisty</sic> # that has been pcked up on reflecting just on that certificate or the course today so it's not just a scrapbook it's an actual reflection # right so it's not just courses that we can use as learning experiences # lots of different things out there there's feedback from colleagues or patients for the students here today trying to get all this back to an undergraduate level there's the use of simulated patients which give very useful feedback there's patients that they come across on the wards or in G-P practices there're so many opportunities <trunc>f</trunc>  for learning and reflection that often it sort of goes in one ear and out the other cos we're busy doing something else at the same time so what we suggest people do is keep a log diary that's just a to-do list for want of a better word # and basically all that you do is you write down the topic or areas # that you thought oh hang on a minute i should really go and look that up # and you know it's there it's somewhere safe that you can come back to it and look at it at a time that's convenient when you've got the time to look further into it really what that is is the basis of a personal development plan a personal development plan is a log diary I-E a to-do list but wi th the added dimension of actually a list of how you aim to achieve those needs and a final section on reflection again because it's a cycle <trunc>shar</trunc>  saying how you have achieved those needs or whether you have achieved those needs basically the whole of this is due to reflection and self-direction so if we come back now to portfolios in the N-H-S and this is where my interest is is basically at the moment G-Ps that to keep up to date it's suggested that they go and attend lectures and collect points # once they've collected thirty points thanks very much pat on the back money from the government right you're keeping up to date # unfortunately it's been proven that this system of continuing medical education is failing G-Ps are going to <trunc>near</trunc>  the lectures that are nearest by they're going to the lectures that are free to attend they're going to lectures which interest them great but they're probably already exceptionally good at family planning and they're going to more family planning lectures while they know nothing about rheumatology so they're becoming very non-directed more and more evidence is coming out and <trunc>s</trunc>  i'm sure everyone knows that didactic lectures really are not perhaps the best way of learning for everybody also the G-Ps aren't providing any evidence of their learning # which the government aren't happy with # so they are keen for a new system # to come about basically Mathers who i think # is based in Sheffield did some research where he looked at portfolio learning and compared it to the old system of G-P learning and this point-collecting exercise he did a cross-over trial where for six months half the G-Ps did the old-fashioned type of learning and for the next six months the G-Ps did the newer type portfolio self-directed learning and basically the feedback and the outcomes were very good the G-Ps enjoyed greater flexibility # of using portfolios and picking things that were of interest to them they enjoyed the breadth of the the topics which far excelled the local lectures that were being provided # but they did admit that more time and commitment was needed so therefore i thought i'd put up this final slide saying that even though i'm very much for it and have researched it there are some negative points to portfolio learning # the two in brackets really aren't applicable to undergraduates # they're more applicable to my are a of interest which is G-Ps basically the old system and the new system of continuing education are running alongside which is where the confusion's arising # but basically most people are still uncertain about portfolios and reflection and the way that you can learn from them # well obviously it's relatively straightforward i think once people have run with  it for a little while they'll feel more confident and get more out of it and so i'm more than happy to answer any questions on portfolios or if anybody wants to know any more about my research then i'm happy to discuss that as well</u>
<u who="nm5219">any questions at all</u>
<u who="su">how do you control the level of reflecting when you do portfolio learning as you illustrated i could be just reflecting i met # a dental colleague and that will be on that portfolio</u>
<u who="nf5222">mm</u>
<u who="su">having a chat or how deep do i reflect how do you </u>
<u who="nf5222">mm</u>
<u who="su">it's the same as <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 word"/> isn't it i just come and sit down here and i will write a few point </u>
<u who="nf5222">absolutely</u>
<u who="su">but so if you you you think portfolio learning is the way forward how do you know that person just because they reflected</u>
<u who="nf5222">yeah</u>
<u who="su">actually learned</u>
<u who="nf5222">i think the important thing is every single system there's an ability to cheat and not get involved as you need the points-based system great you get a certificate you gain a point but that's not to say that you didn't turn up at the back of the lecture pick your certificate up and walk straight back out the door # and very much with portfolios it's the same you get out of it what you put into it they've tried to minimalise that by proving evidence of learning that you've achieved what you've set out to achieve now that could just be a certificate of attendance <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 word"/> again in one door out the other it's meant to be more documentation of your reflection or changes in practice # attendance at clinics et cetera et cetera but i think there's you're completely right there's an <trunc>abet</trunc>  you know # a possibility of cheating every system #</u>
<u who="su">i just wonder what you need to define what is that evidence of learning because earlier on you </u>
<u who="nf5222">mm</u>
<u who="su">say i might come to this conference</u>
<u who="nf5222">mm</u>
<u who="su">and i learn about P-C-T tutor</u>
<u who="nf5222">mm</u>
<u who="su">might be accurate that is not <trunc>s</trunc>  adequate </u>
<u who="nf5222">mm</u>
<u who="su">in term of # acceptable <trunc>dep</trunc>  public money spend</u>
<u who="nf5222">mm</u>
<u who="su">on learning about P-C-T tutor might well be need to be something change to <trunc>quali</trunc>  patient care </u>
<u who="nf5222">mm i mean they are trying to push that the problem is it's in its very early stage # speaking as G-Ps it's in its very early stages and they're trying to get as many people to run with these P-D-Ps gestures towards screen because of the uncertainty putting people off at the moment so they're not being that specific or critical about what is done # even they're saying that perhaps they're still suggesting that you spend thirty hours a year on continuing medical education whether it be in the form of portfolios or point-collecting # i mean some people have said oh well it's taken me ten hours to write my P-D-P # and again it's hard to justify that because you may have an A-four sheet in front of you that looks like it's taken thirty minutes to throw together but i think you have to try and get people on board and once it's been running for a few years perhaps they're gonna be a bit more critical </u>
<u who="su"># Emma i found it really helpful this # whole idea i didn't know the # the word portfolio how it had originated thank you very much the way i # my students the ones from Warwick attach i use a method # they select the questions the <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 word"/> question then they present it to me </u>
<u who="nf5222">mm</u>
<u who="su">then they provide their portfolio and they got a section that they have to do the research and then later i mark it # so it has given them a chance one to present it to me then they write it and then they have to do some reading and research and then write it back again</u>
<u who="nf5222">mm</u>
<u who="su">so the same portfolio can be used in a very reflective way</u>
<u who="nf5222">mm</u>
<u who="su">to learn to see whether they when they present it and when they finally write it up # and give it back to you and then you sit again so you get a third way of going round the problem is that the students do an eight-week thing and they give their portfolios in the sixth week</u>
<u who="nf5222">mm</u>
<u who="su">it's not enough time you should somehow do you give the students this lecture on portfolio</u>
<u who="nf5222">no</u>
<u who="su">i think it would help them to get # this thing right at the beginning they must get their portfolios in at least one or two right at the beginning </u>
<u who="nf5222"></u>
<u who="su">you otherwise eight weeks go very rapidly</u>
<u who="nf5222">mm</u>
<u who="su">so if we want to get the best out of our students they must do this exercise one or <trunc>t</trunc>  twice earlier on to answer the question about the reflection method otherwise what happens at the seventh week they rush in with three portfolios i have to mark them rapidly and sometime they give it to us after they have left us</u>
<u who="nf5222">mm i think as well the students are seeing it very much as a tick box part of the course thank you very much that's another essay handed in i think they've lost the track of yes it is that but it's summat they can carry with them for life and i think perhaps if early on they realise it's not just for the four years of this course they're gonna be doing this they can keep that as evidence of learning that goes on and on and on unfortunately your portfolio starts to get bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger # but i think that's the problem is they're still perhaps seeing it as that a sort of milestone course </u>
<u who="su">can i just <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> another problem is if everything we do we need to reflect on it like general i read an article i read i will be spending a lot of time writing i find it's quite difficult </u>
<u who="nf5222">mm</u>
<u who="su">everytime i read an article in the B-M-J i need to write another A-four pages i <vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" dur="2"/> just sometime can be over-emphasised </u>
<u who="nf5222">mm</u>
<u who="su">and become paper <trunc>collect</trunc>  collection</u>
<u who="nf5222">yeah # i think mm it's it's considered it doesn't have to be A-four it can even be a couple of lines you can even write i read this article it was completely and utterly useless and not relevant to me it's evidence that you've read that article it's <trunc>elo</trunc>  evidence that you've been self-directed enough to recognise that that hasn't addressed your needs and people are not they're still going to count that as a learning opportunity the problem comes with the fact that now they're trying to use G-P portfolios for revalidation and appraisal and the whole thing about portfolios is <trunc>y</trunc>  that you should be as reflective as possible it's a personal development plan so you can write in there # i don't know how to examine eyes i'm a G-P and i don't know how to examine eyes so i'm gonna go to clinic and learn how to examine eyes and then you can write in an ideal world i went to clinic and i learnt nothing about examining eyes but the problem is people the personal development plan side of it is if someone else is looking in then people are gonna stop being as personal and as reflective that's the worry # in educational terms it was always held by the student not looked at by anyone else unless the student was happy and if they wanted to give part of their personal development plan for a tutor to look at that was fine but unfortunately in medicine that's been taken out of our hands so even though i say to you you can write one line and say it was useless or one line and say it was very good i think # that people are gonna be a bit more wary about what they write in their personal development plans as time goes on</u>
<u who="nm5225">can i kind of echo that as well </u>
<u who="nf5222">mm</u>
<u who="nm5225">this this one has a a slight resonance for me cos at the moment i'm i'm doing postgrad study in Birmingham teaching higher education and there is the portfolio issue around that what you've just said has an amazing resonance because for me i <event desc="cough from audience" iterated="n" dur="1"/> this is great cos <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> today # but for me i i want to be able to write down things these are the things i need to be thinking about and and meant to be able to refer back to at a later date but i have an awareness that part of the process the P-G serves at <trunc>Birm</trunc>  at Birmingham is that that material then is is able to be looked at or should be looked at by the head of department</u>
<u who="nf5222">mm</u>
<u who="nm5225">so i'm saying to myself what areas how much can i declare about my teaching practice</u>
<u who="nf5222">mm</u>
<u who="nm5225">in this thing knowing that the person who is paying my wages could look at it and go he's a crap teacher</u>
<u who="nf5222">yeah </u>
<u who="nm5225">i mean the whole point about reflective practice i think is is to be able to <trunc>se</trunc>  to be able to write down i did this today this didn't work as well as it might have done here is what i <trunc>th</trunc>  here is </u>
<u who="nf5222"><gap reason="inaudible" extent="2 sec"/></u>
<u who="nm5225">how i think it might be improved but the implication is that you did it poorly in terms of an arbiter reading it at some <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> points so i'm sorry that's not a question </u>
<u who="nf5222">no not at all</u>
<u who="nm5225">it's just a reflection</u>
<u who="nf5222">it's a it's interesting because as i say it it's gonna be a real problem <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/></u>
<u who="nm5225">how do you do that how do you that <vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" dur="2"/></u>
<u who="nf5224">you will so <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/></u>
<u who="nm5225">i'm going to write that down now don't use bad jokes <vocal desc="laugh" iterated="y" dur="2"/> <vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" dur="2"/> when</u>
<u who="nf5224">when <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> <vocal desc="laugh" iterated="y" dur="2"/></u>
<u who="nm5225">yeah absolutely my mental one <vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" dur="2"/> cos i've been saying you know haven't i </u>
<u who="nm5219">can i can i just say a big thank you <trunc>t</trunc>  <trunc>t</trunc>  <trunc>t</trunc>  <trunc>t</trunc>  something cos this is a personal research area of mine but i've learnt an awful lot from it so i'm gonna ask <trunc>E</trunc> Emma to print her handout of her # Powerpoint slides for me cos i found it very helpful and i was thinking particularly of your first slide where you put in relation to Italy <trunc>l</trunc>  Italy leaning tower when i first looked at it i wondered if it was a spelling mistake and should actually say learning tower</u>
<u who="nf5222">it was # Andy said that <vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" dur="2"/></u>
<u who="nm5219">so thank you for a super presentation <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> very interesting thank you very much <event desc="applause" iterated="y" dur="2"/> contrary to what Emma has just been saying we're not actually i believe i'm correct in saying we're not giving out certificates of attendance # because in a sense it's not that type of <vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" dur="2"/> it's not that type of course of collecting collecting points and so on there's one person that i haven't thanked and has been so quiet and unobtrusive even though there are lots of cameras here has fallen into the background is is Natalie that <trunc>w</trunc>  # i haven't mentioned because in a sense it's made today's meeting # an educational research project in itself so i'm very grateful for Natalie being here and i'm sure if anybody wants to recall the events of today when Natalie eventually produces a D-V-D of today it will be possible to reflect <vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" dur="2"/> on today </u>
<u who="nm5225">will you be writing that in your portfolio <vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" dur="2"/></u>
<u who="nm5219">i will be <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> thank you very much for everybody coming and thank you for everybody that has contributed and prepared for today and as i say particularly for Liz at the last minute doing her # presentation and again to Anne for for everything that she's done today  thank you and i <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> thing is i gather as a collaborative initiative we've already collaborated in that i'm think my colleagues in Birmingham are going to run the next one of these similar days so we'll be looking very much</u>
<u who="nm5225">all we have to do is persuade the head </u>
<u who="nm5219">that's right <vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" dur="2"/> thank you</u>
