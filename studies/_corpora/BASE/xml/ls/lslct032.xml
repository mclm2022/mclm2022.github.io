just by chance one or two of you in this room should have diabetes <pause dur="1.4"/> okay <pause dur="0.3"/> so it's a very common disease <pause dur="0.3"/> # you need to know a lot about it and that's going to be one of the themes of this talk <pause dur="0.4"/> the second talk is about rare diseases <pause dur="0.3"/> that you <trunc>ha</trunc> know have to know a lot about because it's in your exam but not just <pause dur="0.2"/> not because it's <pause dur="0.4"/> biologically more common or more important <pause dur="1.0"/> so <pause dur="0.4"/> diabetes is very common diabetic nephropathy <pause dur="0.3"/> is quite rare <pause dur="0.5"/> why why do you think it's quite rare <pause dur="0.2"/> lady at <kinesic desc="indicates member of audience" iterated="n"/> the end </u><pause dur="1.2"/> <u who="sf0457" trans="pause"> # </u><pause dur="1.8"/> <u who="nm0454" trans="pause"> if you don't know guess </u><pause dur="1.4"/> <u who="sf0457" trans="pause"> because it takes a long time to get to that stage </u><u who="nm0454" trans="overlap"> yeah very good i mean that's exactly the answer <pause dur="0.5"/> because it takes a very long time to get it <pause dur="0.3"/> and what implication <pause dur="0.4"/> # does that have for most most blacks and Asians <pause dur="0.2"/> why why is that such <pause dur="0.7"/> if you forget everything else <pause dur="0.2"/> that i'm going to say this morning just remember what this lady said so <pause dur="0.3"/>

said at the top eighteen per cent of patients in the U-K <pause dur="0.2"/> on dialysis have diabetes and that's true from the latest data <pause dur="0.3"/> <unclear>generally</unclear> you go to renal-reg-dot-com where <pause dur="0.2"/> all British data is accumulated <pause dur="0.3"/> fascinating for <pause dur="0.2"/> us nerdy <pause dur="0.3"/> nephrological types <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> so <pause dur="0.2"/> it's a common cause of a rare disease which makes it rare <pause dur="0.4"/> but nonetheless it's going to be the focus of the talk this morning <pause dur="1.1"/> # <pause dur="1.1"/> let's get back to basics as John Major once said and let's get into a few definitions <pause dur="0.4"/> so <pause dur="0.2"/> # i've got a definition of diabetic nephropathy down there for you <pause dur="0.2"/> as you can see it's a rather vague one <pause dur="0.5"/> it's i'll read it out to you <pause dur="0.3"/> it's <pause dur="0.3"/> a usually progressive renal disease <pause dur="0.2"/> secondary to <pause dur="0.4"/> diabetes <pause dur="0.6"/> and what's wrong with that definition <pause dur="1.6"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="3"/> why is it so difficult to define <pause dur="3.3"/><kinesic desc="indicates member of audience" iterated="n"/> gentleman there why why is it so difficult to define <pause dur="0.3"/> something like diabetic nephropathy </u><pause dur="0.7"/> <u who="sm0461" trans="pause"> 
it presents in very different forms it can present in many different ways and can have many different causative </u><pause dur="0.6"/> <u who="nm0454" trans="pause"> very good </u><u who="sm0461" trans="overlap"> <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> </u><u who="nm0454" trans="overlap"> very good so it can present in many different ways there are many different forms there are many different causes and when you've got a complicated disease like that it's not like a myocardial infarction <pause dur="0.2"/> which you can define in terms of a C-K rise <unclear>dropped T</unclear> <pause dur="0.3"/> typical symptom signs <pause dur="0.3"/> this is a vague concept <pause dur="0.4"/> and i'll explain a bit later on why it's such a vague concept <pause dur="0.3"/> one of the more fundamental reasons why diabetic nephropathy is difficult to define is 'cause diabetes is difficult to define <pause dur="0.5"/> let's have a go gentleman here <pause dur="0.4"/> have a go at # defining diabetes </u><pause dur="0.3"/> <u who="sm0462" trans="pause"> # which one do you want <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> </u><u who="nm0454" trans="overlap"> # either <pause dur="0.2"/> or all <pause dur="0.3"/> speak up so everybody can hear </u><u who="sm0462" trans="latching"> it's when the pancreas <pause dur="0.2"/> isn't producing insulin </u><pause dur="0.5"/> <u who="nm0454" trans="pause"> or </u><pause dur="0.2"/> <u who="sm0462" trans="pause"> or when the <trunc>s</trunc> tissues aren't responsive to insulin </u><u who="nm0454" trans="latching"> 
very good that's actually probably the best definition i've heard from a <pause dur="0.2"/> a medical student it's # <pause dur="0.2"/> almost impossible to define i mean there are <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> definitions which are nice simple ones <pause dur="0.4"/> a fasting blood sugar of over </u><pause dur="0.7"/> <u who="ss" trans="pause"> seven </u><pause dur="0.2"/> <u who="nm0454" trans="pause"> seven <pause dur="0.2"/> and a random of over </u><u who="ss" trans="overlap"> eleven </u><pause dur="0.8"/> <u who="nm0454" trans="pause"> eleven okay <pause dur="0.3"/> so that's a nice simple one put it in the <trunc>bo</trunc> put it in the back of your brains useful in clinical practice <pause dur="0.3"/> at a deeper level of course diabetes is very difficult to define <pause dur="0.5"/> # and the gentleman there has probably come out with a pretty good one <pause dur="0.3"/> you know <pause dur="0.3"/> <shift feature="voice" new="mimicking northern English accent"/>it's trouble with pancreas <shift feature="voice" new="normal"/><pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> you know either the pancreas doesn't make enough insulin or you can't respond to insulin <pause dur="1.1"/> if you want to have another go at defining it <pause dur="0.3"/> the typical group of symptoms and signs <pause dur="0.4"/> with a variety of causes <pause dur="0.7"/> associated <pause dur="0.3"/> with <pause dur="0.2"/> pancreatic trouble <pause dur="1.2"/> it's getting a bit vague now my 
definition i'm running out of steam it's it's just impossible to define <pause dur="0.7"/> # in any <pause dur="0.2"/> concrete way because you've got gestational diabetes pregnancy-related diabetes <pause dur="0.4"/> is that diabetes it doesn't make you blind ten years later <pause dur="0.2"/> it's diabetes while you've got it <pause dur="0.8"/> so it is a very very difficult thing to define and it's quite interesting actually that one of the diseases that <pause dur="0.3"/> affects your whole course <pause dur="0.6"/> renal eyes heart everything is actually almost impossible to define <pause dur="0.5"/> and we could <pause dur="0.5"/> be defining it all wrong <pause dur="0.8"/> <trunc>b</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> what is the problem with the definition of diabetes related to absolute levels of of blood sugar <pause dur="6.0"/> what's the problem with that <pause dur="0.4"/> it's nice in a box back of the brain <pause dur="1.1"/> simple <pause dur="0.4"/> let us assume <pause dur="0.2"/> demonstrate it <pause dur="0.2"/> in the exams </u><pause dur="0.6"/> <u who="sf0463" trans="pause"> there's lots of variation in the range anyway </u><pause dur="0.3"/> <u who="nm0454" trans="pause"> yeah there's a lot of normal variation very good so <pause dur="0.4"/> by now you should realize that all normal ranges <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="7"/> are a load of rubbish they're 
all based on <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> the standard normal distribution so this could be height blood sugar <pause dur="0.2"/> et cetera et cetera and all normal ranges <pause dur="0.3"/> we take usually are two standard deviations from the mean <pause dur="0.3"/> so we say a normal blood sugar <pause dur="0.3"/> is what <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="3"/> four to six <pause dur="0.3"/> and diabetes <pause dur="0.8"/> is a fastingness of seven <pause dur="0.2"/> or a random of over eleven <pause dur="0.2"/> but there's always going to be tail end Charlie <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="1"/> who's quite normal who doesn't have diabetes <pause dur="0.6"/> but is has diabetes by a number definition <pause dur="0.9"/> and the other reason why it's so difficult to define of course <pause dur="0.3"/> is that the complications of diabetes <pause dur="0.3"/> are really the complications of what </u><pause dur="2.8"/> <u who="sm0464" trans="pause"> persistent hyperglycaemia </u><pause dur="0.3"/> <u who="nm0454" trans="pause"> speak up </u><pause dur="0.2"/> <u who="sm0464" trans="pause"> persistent hyperglycaemia </u><pause dur="0.3"/> <u who="nm0454" trans="pause"> # yeah yeah okay you're right but but <pause dur="0.2"/> what what <pause dur="0.6"/> what constellation of diseases <pause dur="1.0"/> large vessel diseases <pause dur="1.7"/> is <pause dur="0.9"/> the main <pause dur="0.3"/> problem <pause dur="0.8"/> with diabetes or one of the main problems with </u><pause dur="0.5"/> <u who="ss" trans="pause"> <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> </u><u who="nm0454" trans="overlap"> speak up </u><u who="sm0465" trans="latching">

but the <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> and <trunc>f</trunc> for the people of Framingham tend to stay around <pause dur="0.2"/> it's not that large a group it's in the tens of thousands of people rather than <trunc>hun</trunc> and that's <pause dur="0.2"/> maybe also one of the reasons why the study worked and is still ongoing <pause dur="0.2"/> and they've been followed since the sixties <pause dur="0.4"/> and and and a lot of what we teach you <pause dur="0.3"/> about <pause dur="0.3"/> # the <pause dur="0.2"/> pathogenesis <pause dur="0.3"/> and the cause of atheroma and diabetes all comes from the Framingham study there's a massive website that's all about the Framingham study <pause dur="0.3"/> they're publishing papers every week <pause dur="0.4"/> # and and and and much <trunc>o</trunc> <trunc>o</trunc> of <pause dur="0.3"/> of traditional Western medicine actually comes from Framingham <pause dur="0.2"/> i don't think the people of Framingham realize that <pause dur="0.9"/> and what we know about microalbuminuria i don't know <pause dur="0.5"/> how they had the foresight in the early sixties <pause dur="0.3"/> to start looking for very small amounts of protein in the urine but they did <pause dur="0.5"/> and # and and this is a a very # clever idea <pause dur="0.8"/> the reason i emphasize the 
first two stages is that i think <pause dur="0.2"/> that if we're going to do anything about diabetic nephropathy and anything about the other complications the retinopathy <pause dur="0.2"/> it's before Framingham <pause dur="0.3"/> it's before microalbuminuria it's when they're normal <pause dur="0.5"/> it's when they are <pause dur="0.2"/> the IDDMs <pause dur="0.2"/> are <pause dur="0.6"/> four <pause dur="0.5"/> are six <pause dur="0.2"/> are ten years old <pause dur="0.4"/> then you start them on an ACE inhibitor <pause dur="0.2"/> then you do what you need to do <pause dur="0.2"/> to stop them <unclear>from getting any</unclear> complications not when they're twenty not when they're thirty <pause dur="0.8"/> but there lies the rub <pause dur="0.2"/> because the majority of patients i said are NIDDMs and they present late <pause dur="0.4"/> they've had a blood sugar of eight for five years of nine for another five years <pause dur="0.2"/> then it's picked up on routine testing <pause dur="0.4"/> and it's all over by then <pause dur="0.3"/> the eyes are starting to go they they're in stage three more likely stage four of diabetic nephropathy <pause dur="0.2"/> there's nothing you can do <pause dur="0.3"/> so if you want to really help diabetics i think it's <pause dur="0.2"/> it's premicroalbuminuria or at least at microalbuminuria stage <pause dur="1.1"/> and this is 
true for the not just for the kidneys but for the eyes and all the other complications <pause dur="0.9"/> okay <pause dur="0.2"/> so can we isolate specific patients to focus on <pause dur="0.6"/> well <pause dur="0.5"/> not really # <pause dur="0.3"/> race <pause dur="0.3"/> # black and Asian people are more likely to get the small vessel complications that <pause dur="0.2"/> they're more likely to get diabetes and they're more likely to get the bad diabetes <pause dur="0.8"/> there are strong genetic factors which <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> are probably polygenic and haven't really been worked out but <pause dur="0.2"/> there are certainly <pause dur="0.2"/> patients who are born with a predisposition to develop bad diabetes <pause dur="1.0"/> and this is one this is the counter-argument <pause dur="0.4"/> for being a touchy-feely person going out in the community <pause dur="0.2"/> starting all black and Asian people <pause dur="0.2"/> on an ACE inhibitor as soon as they're born <pause dur="0.3"/> <trunc>a</trunc> and that studies <pause dur="0.2"/> such as that have been done there were some islands on the north coast of Australia <pause dur="0.3"/> where <pause dur="0.4"/> people just couldn't get away and they put entire communities with and without <pause dur="0.4"/> # diabetes on ACE inhibitors <pause dur="0.2"/> and this is one of the few things you 
can do for a diabetic <pause dur="0.4"/> and they've dramatically reduced the dialysis rates <pause dur="0.4"/> the mortality cardiac mortality <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> look it up <pause dur="0.6"/> northern Australia islands <pause dur="0.3"/> diabetic nephropathy <pause dur="0.3"/> # you'll find <pause dur="0.2"/> loads and loads of papers <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> and they're actually fascinating studies where you take an entire community <pause dur="0.4"/> and reduce their glomerular capillary pressure and see what happens <pause dur="0.2"/> and a lot happens <pause dur="1.1"/> the reason i emphasize this is i think that <pause dur="0.4"/> racial and family <pause dur="1.0"/> # predisposition to developing bad diabetes <pause dur="0.2"/> is probably the most important factor <pause dur="0.2"/> and that of course we can do nothing about you can't change your parents <pause dur="0.6"/> and it does seem that forty per cent or so of diabetics <pause dur="0.5"/> get <pause dur="0.7"/> bad diabetes including the eyes the kidneys et cetera and so if you were a cynic you'd say well why bother for those forty per cent 'cause they're <pause dur="0.2"/> buggered anyway <pause dur="0.3"/> # but nonetheless i think we have to # adopt a positive approach and try and treat <pause dur="0.2"/> the hundred <pause dur="0.3"/> # not not just the sixty <pause dur="1.0"/> # <pause dur="1.5"/> glycaemic control <pause dur="0.6"/>
