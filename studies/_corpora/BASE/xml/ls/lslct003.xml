bit of the background but i think you'll find it <pause dur="0.3"/> hopefully an interesting story <pause dur="0.9"/> if you want to stop at any time <pause dur="0.6"/> this is <pause dur="0.9"/> an interactive <vocal desc="laugh" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.3"/> discussion with a group as small as this so <pause dur="0.4"/> please if you don't understand any of the background just <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="0.8"/> make yourself heard <pause dur="0.5"/> so this is where it started <pause dur="0.9"/> and this is the <pause dur="0.4"/> the one real plant <pause dur="1.5"/><kinesic desc="turns on overhead projector showing transparency" iterated="n"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> that i'll show you <pause dur="0.5"/> and this is the <pause dur="1.0"/> the commercial and agricultural <pause dur="0.2"/> basis <pause dur="0.2"/> of this whole academic project <pause dur="0.8"/> you might not recognize the plant but it's an oilseed rape plant <pause dur="1.0"/> and the practical project was represented <pause dur="1.1"/> by this area here <pause dur="0.5"/> which is a <pause dur="0.2"/> completely diseased section <pause dur="0.9"/> of an oilseed rape plant <pause dur="0.8"/> and it's a section of a stem <pause dur="0.6"/> that's been attacked by a particular virulent fungus <pause dur="0.4"/> that's destroyed the stem <pause dur="0.8"/> between these two points and it's gone from <pause dur="0.4"/> green to white <pause dur="0.4"/> and the leaf that's attached to the stem <pause dur="0.4"/> has been destroyed by that process <pause dur="0.9"/> and the fungus itself <pause dur="0.6"/> is called Sclerotinia <pause dur="1.2"/> # there's no kind of real English name for it but <pause dur="1.2"/> that's what it's known as <pause dur="0.2"/> and if 
you're a farmer and you have this <pause dur="1.2"/><event desc="student enters room" iterated="n" n="su0216"/> i think we've got <pause dur="0.3"/><vocal desc="laugh" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.5"/> somebody else <pause dur="0.2"/> okay <pause dur="0.5"/> if you're a farmer and you <pause dur="1.9"/> you have you have this type of fungus in your crop <pause dur="0.7"/> then <pause dur="0.2"/> it's bad news <pause dur="0.6"/> it attacks <pause dur="0.3"/> a whole range of agriculturally important crops <pause dur="0.4"/> particularly oilseed so <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> oilseed rape sunflower soya beans <pause dur="1.1"/> it's very difficult to control with fungicides <pause dur="0.7"/> the <pause dur="0.2"/> breeding materials that are available <pause dur="0.5"/> are very limited so <pause dur="0.2"/> although plant breeders have tried to <pause dur="0.5"/> introduce resistance <pause dur="0.6"/> they've # <pause dur="0.4"/> really rather failed <pause dur="0.4"/> over the last ten to twenty years <pause dur="1.6"/><kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="12"/> the biochemistry of the disease is what <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> is where <pause dur="1.8"/> my interest lies <pause dur="0.9"/> and the biochemistry is represented here <pause dur="2.3"/> this is the same disease fungus growing on a petri dish <pause dur="1.5"/> in the lab <pause dur="0.5"/> and you can see that the colour of this is very different <pause dur="0.4"/> the outside is purple <pause dur="0.4"/> the inside orange <pause dur="0.7"/> and the fungus is growing across the surface <pause dur="0.4"/> and the reason that there's a colour change is that the P-H is changing <pause dur="0.5"/> the acidity of that petri dish is changing <pause dur="0.5"/> as the fungus 
grows <pause dur="1.0"/> and it's going from <pause dur="0.8"/> neutral P-H represented by the purple <pause dur="0.6"/> to <pause dur="1.0"/> bright orange which means that the P-H has fallen <pause dur="0.2"/> so acid is being secreted by the fungus <pause dur="0.2"/> and it's the acid <pause dur="0.5"/> that's the major <pause dur="0.4"/> key feature of this fungus <pause dur="0.9"/> and the reason that these sorts of fungi <pause dur="0.5"/> are so <pause dur="0.4"/> successful is that they secrete <pause dur="0.4"/> a lot of acid <pause dur="1.5"/><vocal desc="laugh" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.5"/> and <pause dur="0.3"/> do we have somebody else <pause dur="1.1"/> # <pause dur="1.6"/> and the reason they secrete acid <pause dur="0.6"/> and the acid that they secrete is the basis of this <pause dur="0.3"/> particular <pause dur="0.7"/> story for the next <pause dur="0.6"/><kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="8"/> forty-five minutes <pause dur="1.1"/> and this # <pause dur="4.9"/> this is the acid and this is how it works the acid is oxalic acid <pause dur="1.7"/> and do any of you know <pause dur="0.6"/> of any other plants maybe that <pause dur="1.0"/> have oxalic acid in it <pause dur="0.5"/> in them <pause dur="0.5"/> is it an acid that you <pause dur="0.7"/> know anything about in a biological context <pause dur="1.7"/> no <pause dur="0.8"/> okay well the <trunc>m</trunc> <pause dur="0.3"/> the most <pause dur="0.5"/> famous source of oxalic acid are <pause dur="0.5"/> green vegetables and things like rhubarb <pause dur="1.3"/> so <pause dur="0.5"/> this is the method of <pause dur="0.6"/> action <pause dur="1.8"/> of why oxalic acid is such a powerful toxin <pause dur="0.6"/> why the fungi that secrete this acid <pause dur="0.3"/> are so successful <pause dur="2.0"/> that they <pause dur="0.5"/> primarily act by <pause dur="0.6"/> 
chelating the calcium <pause dur="0.4"/> so the calcium binds to the acid <pause dur="1.6"/> and it removes the calcium from the cell walls in the plant <pause dur="1.3"/> and cell walls of a plant are <pause dur="0.3"/> maintained <pause dur="0.2"/> in structure <pause dur="0.5"/> and the reason that they're <trunc>me</trunc> <pause dur="0.3"/> structure is maintained is <pause dur="1.0"/> through these calcium containing compounds called pectins and pectic acid <pause dur="0.5"/> it's what you put in jam to make it set <vocal desc="laugh" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.6"/> it's a thickening agent that comes from plant wall <pause dur="0.3"/> cell walls <pause dur="1.3"/> once you get the calcium out of the plant <pause dur="0.8"/> cell walls <pause dur="0.5"/> particularly out of these specialized cell types <pause dur="0.8"/> then <pause dur="0.2"/> air can come into the plant <pause dur="0.4"/> 'cause of <pause dur="0.5"/> the rigidity of a plant is maintained by the water inside it <pause dur="0.6"/> once you let <pause dur="0.4"/> air into the vessels in the <pause dur="0.2"/> plant <pause dur="0.2"/> then <pause dur="0.6"/> the plant will start to wilt <pause dur="1.0"/> which is what happens <pause dur="0.3"/> next <pause dur="1.2"/> once the acid <pause dur="0.5"/> <trunc>re</trunc> goes into the plant it reduces the P-H <pause dur="0.9"/> all the other enzymes then that are present in the <trunc>f</trunc> <pause dur="0.9"/> that are secreted by the fungi <pause dur="0.3"/> are activated at low P-H <pause dur="0.4"/> and so the plant then starts to rot <pause dur="1.3"/> and once it's started to rot <vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" dur="1"/><pause dur="0.3"/> that's the end of the 
plant <pause dur="2.0"/> okay <pause dur="1.1"/> so that's <pause dur="0.7"/><kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="15"/> how the oxalic acid works <pause dur="1.3"/> and the question was <pause dur="1.6"/> what could you do about <pause dur="0.2"/> overcoming the <pause dur="0.6"/> the problem <pause dur="0.9"/> so about eight years ago <pause dur="1.4"/> biochemists and the genetics people <pause dur="0.8"/> in <pause dur="0.4"/> what was then Zeneca Plant Sciences at Jealott's Hill <pause dur="1.3"/> were looking for <pause dur="0.3"/> biochemical approaches to reduce the level of acid secreted by the fungus and therefore perhaps to protect the fungus <pause dur="0.5"/> <trunc>pla</trunc> plant from the <trunc>fung</trunc> <pause dur="0.6"/> the fungus <pause dur="1.3"/> and the obvious thing to do was to say <pause dur="0.3"/> could we break down the acid <pause dur="0.5"/> secreted by the fungus <pause dur="1.0"/> and there are two <pause dur="0.4"/> enzymes that are known to <pause dur="0.7"/> to break down <pause dur="0.3"/> oxalic acid <pause dur="0.9"/> and these are <pause dur="0.2"/> oxalate oxidase <pause dur="1.5"/> which converts oxalate to carbon dioxide and hydrogen peroxide <pause dur="2.2"/> and oxalate decarboxylase that converts <pause dur="0.4"/> oxalate to formate <pause dur="0.8"/> and carbon dioxide <pause dur="0.6"/> so those are the two main <pause dur="0.5"/> pathways for breaking down <pause dur="1.0"/> oxalic acid <pause dur="0.8"/> so the immediate question was <pause dur="0.5"/> as a strategic question <pause dur="0.8"/> could we identify isolate <pause dur="1.2"/> and then <pause dur="0.2"/> introduce into a plant <pause dur="1.2"/> one or more of these two enzymes <pause dur="0.6"/> and therefore 
allow the plant <pause dur="0.9"/> to protect itself from the fungus by degrading the acid <pause dur="0.8"/> it's a kind of simple <pause dur="0.8"/> idea simple question <pause dur="2.8"/> and the immediate answer was <pause dur="0.3"/> well we had to make a choice and the <pause dur="0.2"/> first choice was <pause dur="0.9"/> first enzyme which is a plant enzyme <pause dur="0.9"/> the second enzyme here is a fungal one <pause dur="0.6"/> so <pause dur="0.4"/> a lot more was known about this enzyme <pause dur="1.6"/> and over a period of a year or two <pause dur="0.6"/> that enzyme was <pause dur="0.9"/> # the gene that encodes that enzyme was isolated <pause dur="1.9"/> was put in back into a plant through genetic <pause dur="0.3"/> manipulation methods <pause dur="0.6"/> and we produced <pause dur="0.5"/> many transgenic <pause dur="0.3"/> genetically modified plants that now <pause dur="0.5"/> had <pause dur="0.6"/> this enzyme <pause dur="0.3"/> and expressed this enzyme <pause dur="0.5"/> its origin originally was from <pause dur="0.3"/> cereals <pause dur="0.2"/> so we were taking a <pause dur="0.5"/> an enzyme that was found in <pause dur="0.4"/> wheat and barley <pause dur="0.6"/> and introducing it into oilseed rape <pause dur="0.5"/> and what you've then got <pause dur="0.3"/> and this is the end of the <kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="3"/> biology then <pause dur="1.1"/> and go on to the chemistry <pause dur="0.7"/> what you've then got was this these were two leaves of <pause dur="0.2"/> oilseed rape plants <pause dur="0.7"/> the one on the left <pause dur="0.6"/> is the traditional variety <pause dur="0.6"/> infected by <pause dur="0.9"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> a small sample of the fungus <pause dur="0.6"/> and you can see it's extended <pause dur="0.6"/> and produced this so-called lesion this rotten area <pause dur="0.4"/> in the middle of the leaf <pause dur="1.1"/> 
and the acid is spreading out to the edge where it's come becoming crinkled <pause dur="1.5"/> this leaf is a leaf from a transgenic or genetically modified variety <pause dur="0.3"/> where the fungus is <pause dur="0.4"/> no longer growing <pause dur="1.1"/> and this whole idea <pause dur="0.2"/> has been taken <pause dur="0.8"/> and used in over the last five years <pause dur="0.8"/> by companies in North America in particular <pause dur="0.5"/> and this isn't a G-M discussion today but <pause dur="1.4"/> there's a good chance that <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.8"/> a sunflower variety containing this gene <pause dur="0.5"/> will be commercialized over the next few years and will <pause dur="0.3"/> provide <pause dur="0.6"/> very good protection for the first time ever <pause dur="0.3"/> against this very <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> devastating <pause dur="0.5"/> pathogen of plants <pause dur="0.2"/> so that's the background <pause dur="1.4"/><kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="12"/> and now we get to the chemistry <pause dur="0.4"/> and the chemistry says <pause dur="1.7"/> okay what is this enzyme <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> that was where the practical commercial work <pause dur="0.7"/> # was going <pause dur="0.5"/> from an academic perspective <pause dur="0.9"/> what is it about this enzyme that made it worth <pause dur="0.3"/> studying in its own right <pause dur="0.6"/> and these are <trunc>i</trunc> the characteristics that made it so <pause dur="0.5"/> interesting and unusual <pause dur="2.5"/> it was an enzyme <pause dur="0.8"/> in fact that had been <pause dur="0.8"/> 
isolated previously <pause dur="0.8"/> and had been given the name germin <pause dur="0.5"/> about <pause dur="0.2"/> twenty years ago <pause dur="0.9"/> and it was isolated from barley embryos <pause dur="0.2"/> and wheat embryos <pause dur="0.7"/> at that time <pause dur="0.7"/> the protein was isolated <pause dur="0.2"/> but it wasn't known to be <pause dur="0.4"/> this enzyme <pause dur="0.2"/> and we were <pause dur="0.4"/> therefore left with a <pause dur="0.4"/> strange situation of <pause dur="0.8"/> a research group in Canada <pause dur="0.3"/> who'd worked on a protein that they'd <pause dur="0.2"/> given the name germin to <pause dur="0.4"/> and they'd found that it had these characteristics <pause dur="0.3"/> but they had no idea about its function <pause dur="1.9"/> they'd worked on it for a long period of time <pause dur="0.4"/> because it was pepsin resistant <pause dur="0.4"/> most enzymes being proteins are broken down by <pause dur="0.4"/> protein degrading enzymes themselves <pause dur="0.5"/> so <pause dur="0.4"/> this particular germin protein <pause dur="0.8"/> was almost completely resistant to <pause dur="0.2"/> <trunc>t</trunc> <pause dur="0.3"/> being broken down <pause dur="0.5"/> by normal <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="1.0"/> proteases <pause dur="0.6"/> it was also resistant to hydrogen peroxide <pause dur="1.0"/> which again is unusual for a protein <pause dur="0.8"/> usually these two treatments would completely denature a protein <pause dur="0.4"/> and make it unfold <pause dur="1.2"/> it was a glycosylated protein in other words it had sugars attached to it which is <pause dur="0.4"/> quite 
usual in plants <pause dur="0.7"/> it was a multimeric one in other words it had lots of subunits <pause dur="1.1"/> and <pause dur="1.2"/> it was considered to be important because there was a lot of it <vocal desc="laugh" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.5"/> and biologists think <pause dur="0.2"/> well if there's a lot of it <pause dur="0.4"/> it must be important it's a kind of <pause dur="0.4"/> crude analysis of its <pause dur="0.2"/> significance <pause dur="0.9"/> and so <pause dur="0.3"/> the group in Toronto had worked for <pause dur="0.6"/> ten years or more <pause dur="0.3"/> on this germin <pause dur="0.8"/> they had the sequence of it but they'd no way of finding the function <pause dur="0.7"/> we were working on <pause dur="0.9"/> the barley equivalent of this <pause dur="0.9"/> on <pause dur="0.4"/> the idea that it was an enzyme and then we went back to the gene <pause dur="0.4"/> they had the gene and the protein but no function <pause dur="0.6"/> we put the two things together <pause dur="0.4"/> and we were able to tell the group in <pause dur="0.2"/> Canada <pause dur="0.3"/> what they'd been doing for the last ten years was working <pause dur="0.3"/> on an oxalate oxidase <pause dur="1.2"/> and that was quite surprising to them because <pause dur="0.3"/> up to that point <pause dur="0.2"/> nobody had ever isolated an oxalate oxidase from plants <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/><kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="5"/> <trunc>a</trunc> and isolated the gene from a <pause dur="0.5"/> this enzyme <pause dur="1.6"/> if you look <pause dur="0.7"/> then <pause dur="0.5"/> and using the <pause dur="0.4"/> the # <pause dur="0.4"/> bioinformatics techniques <pause dur="0.4"/> 
at the structure of this protein <pause dur="0.7"/> which is what was done <pause dur="0.5"/> very simply <pause dur="0.6"/> it then became <pause dur="0.6"/><kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="8"/> quite clear that this protein wasn't <pause dur="0.7"/> a unique <pause dur="0.4"/> protein but in fact had <pause dur="0.5"/> lots of <pause dur="0.4"/> quite close relatives <pause dur="1.6"/> and this is <pause dur="0.4"/> the analysis as it was <pause dur="0.2"/><vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.4"/> about <pause dur="0.6"/> five years ago <pause dur="0.5"/> and at that time <pause dur="0.5"/> in all the databases in the world <pause dur="1.6"/> wherever you looked you could find a total <pause dur="0.3"/> of ten sequences <pause dur="0.5"/> this is the Prodom <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> protein <pause dur="0.3"/> the main database <pause dur="0.9"/> that showed <pause dur="0.9"/> this <pause dur="0.5"/> pattern of ten proteins <pause dur="1.7"/> but the eight at the top were from plants <pause dur="0.4"/> the two at the bottom were from slime moulds <pause dur="1.5"/> the <trunc>f</trunc> different colours here represent areas of conservation <pause dur="0.7"/> the different colours at the ends are where they're different so <pause dur="0.4"/> we have this family of ten proteins where there was quite a lot of conservation <pause dur="0.5"/> in the middle of them <pause dur="0.7"/> the the blue area <pause dur="2.3"/> some of them had <trunc>diff</trunc> had the same <pause dur="0.3"/> N-terminus which is <pause dur="0.3"/> labelled here <pause dur="0.8"/> but the <pause dur="0.9"/> they were different at the <pause dur="0.6"/> C-terminus at this end of the protein <pause dur="0.8"/> so the cereal proteins were different from the <pause dur="0.9"/> the brassica <pause dur="0.3"/> and dicot 
proteins <pause dur="1.1"/> the slime moulds <pause dur="1.3"/> two on the bottom <pause dur="0.8"/> and the slime mould is one of these <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> eukaryotes that <pause dur="0.7"/> not as <trunc>m</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> much is known about biochemically <pause dur="0.8"/> but it was known that when this slime mould <pause dur="1.0"/> became <pause dur="0.5"/> desiccated became starved <pause dur="0.3"/> it produces very small spores <pause dur="0.4"/> and these spores <pause dur="0.2"/> contained a lot of this protein <pause dur="1.1"/> again there was no particular function assigned to it <pause dur="0.7"/> but it was known to be somehow related to desiccation <pause dur="1.1"/> so there are series of clues here being built up <pause dur="0.5"/> during this story that say <pause dur="1.1"/> we've got a very resistant <pause dur="1.0"/> heat stable pepsin resistant protease resistant <pause dur="0.6"/> hydrogen peroxide resistant <pause dur="0.2"/> protein found in cereals <pause dur="0.8"/> it seems to have some similarity <pause dur="0.5"/> to a desiccation tolerant <pause dur="0.4"/> starvation induced <pause dur="0.9"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> protein from a very <pause dur="0.5"/> primitive <pause dur="0.5"/> eukaryote a <trunc>pri</trunc> very primitive <pause dur="0.5"/> # mould in this case a slime mould <pause dur="0.9"/> so that <pause dur="0.4"/> was interesting because it said <pause dur="0.6"/> there's a <pause dur="0.6"/> a <pause dur="0.2"/> protein connection between <pause dur="0.3"/> a slime mould <pause dur="0.5"/> a barley plant <pause dur="0.6"/> <trunc>a</trunc> and a wheat embryo <pause dur="0.9"/> so <pause dur="0.4"/> that's a <pause dur="1.3"/> an interesting position <pause dur="0.7"/> and about 
that time <pause dur="0.2"/> a group in Germany <pause dur="0.9"/> as well as ourselves <pause dur="0.6"/> started to think more about the evolutionary significance of this <pause dur="0.6"/> and they also <pause dur="0.4"/> found by repeated database searches <pause dur="1.4"/> that this family of proteins which <pause dur="0.4"/> started to become enlarged as time went on from ten to twenty <pause dur="0.7"/> and # i'll tell you what the latest version is at the end of this story <pause dur="2.4"/> they were given the name <pause dur="0.3"/> originally germin from the <pause dur="0.2"/> germination <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="1.1"/> association of the <pause dur="0.3"/> of the wheat gene <pause dur="0.7"/> these # related proteins were then known as germin-like proteins <pause dur="1.3"/> more and more detailed <pause dur="0.3"/> sequence similarity searches <pause dur="0.4"/> showed that there were particular <pause dur="0.6"/> amino acids <pause dur="0.4"/> within these germins and germin-like proteins <pause dur="0.4"/> that were also found in yet another <pause dur="0.9"/> much more distantly related group of proteins that <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> are particularly interesting to <pause dur="0.6"/> to plant scientists <pause dur="0.4"/> and those are the proteins found in <trunc>s</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> in seeds in storage proteins <pause dur="0.6"/> proteins that are part of <pause dur="0.5"/> all our diets <pause dur="0.3"/> because we <pause dur="0.6"/> indirectly or directly <pause dur="0.4"/> we rely upon eating seeds as a <pause dur="0.5"/> form of 
# <trunc>pro</trunc> # vegetable protein at least <pause dur="1.4"/> and if you look at vegetable proteins in seeds <pause dur="0.7"/> particularly the so-called legumin vicilin proteins <pause dur="0.6"/> then you'll see <pause dur="0.4"/> you can identify particular amino acids that are also found <pause dur="0.4"/> in this group of proteins that i've just described <pause dur="1.3"/> and this was a simple attempt to look at <pause dur="0.6"/> the evolutionary significance of these families <pause dur="0.5"/> during time <pause dur="0.3"/> and this was put together <pause dur="0.8"/> by a group in Germany <pause dur="1.2"/> again <pause dur="0.7"/> around this period of <pause dur="0.2"/> five to six years ago <pause dur="0.5"/> and they started <pause dur="0.3"/> with a hypothesis that said <pause dur="1.9"/><kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="5"/> if you believe in evolution then at the beginning of time there <trunc>sh</trunc> <pause dur="0.5"/> should be some so-called ancestral protein <pause dur="0.6"/> from which all these other proteins <pause dur="0.8"/> # were produced <pause dur="0.3"/> during evolution <pause dur="1.5"/> we're <trunc>i</trunc> in a position that said <pause dur="0.8"/> some of them evolved into these <pause dur="0.3"/> slime mould proteins that are known as spherulins <pause dur="1.5"/> some of them <pause dur="0.2"/> involved <pause dur="0.6"/> evolved rather <pause dur="0.4"/> into <pause dur="1.0"/> what we now know as the germin <pause dur="0.4"/> types of protein <pause dur="1.1"/> some of them <pause dur="0.6"/> evolved into <pause dur="1.5"/> they're described here as C-globulins <pause dur="1.4"/> but another <pause dur="0.2"/> 
more important group <pause dur="0.3"/> and these are the ones that <pause dur="0.6"/> found in seeds now <pause dur="0.6"/> went through a duplication event at some stage <pause dur="1.1"/> to form <pause dur="0.6"/> these legumin vicilin <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> precursor proteins <pause dur="0.3"/> because what i haven't said is that <pause dur="0.6"/> the storage proteins are twice as big in length <pause dur="0.7"/> as the germins <pause dur="0.5"/> so at some time <pause dur="0.5"/> they seem to have doubled in size <pause dur="1.2"/> so they have <pause dur="0.3"/> two halves and within each half <pause dur="0.4"/> you can see <pause dur="0.7"/> # the the letters here represent the conserved <pause dur="0.3"/> amino acid residues <pause dur="0.4"/> during this whole period of evolution <pause dur="0.3"/> from <pause dur="0.4"/> the primitive <pause dur="0.4"/> slime mould up to the <pause dur="0.9"/> the higher plant <pause dur="0.6"/> just a few amino acids particularly glycines prolines glycines <pause dur="1.0"/> we've seen phenylalanines <pause dur="1.5"/> particularly those amino acids were conserved in the same place <pause dur="0.3"/> all the way through this process <pause dur="0.9"/> so although you look at these proteins and you don't see very much <pause dur="0.9"/> <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 word"/> perhaps superficial <pause dur="0.4"/> significance in similarity terms <pause dur="0.4"/> they do have these conserved residues strictly conserved at particular points <pause dur="2.4"/> 
so that was an outline a sort of sketch of what <pause dur="0.4"/> the evolutionary pattern might have been <pause dur="2.0"/> and why was it possible to do that <pause dur="0.3"/> was <pause dur="0.8"/> because this three-dimensional structure <pause dur="0.4"/> of the storage proteins was <pause dur="0.5"/> already known <pause dur="3.1"/><kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="5"/> and i'll say why that's important in a second <pause dur="1.2"/> the diagrammatic <pause dur="0.3"/> version of that is <pause dur="0.8"/> summarized on here <pause dur="0.5"/> so again we start with <pause dur="0.3"/> something where there's an ancestor <pause dur="0.4"/> you go through duplications you then evolve into <pause dur="0.6"/> a whole series of different families <pause dur="1.2"/> and this covers a whole <pause dur="0.6"/> a large period of time and it covers a lot of different <pause dur="0.3"/> potential functions <pause dur="0.8"/> so <pause dur="0.4"/> that's the <pause dur="0.6"/> the outline kind of cartoon of history <pause dur="0.8"/><kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="25"/> that <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> i want to build from <pause dur="1.9"/> okay <pause dur="0.9"/> i said that the three-dimensional structure of <pause dur="0.8"/> of the storage proteins was known <pause dur="3.4"/> and this is what you get if you look at the alignment of different storage proteins <pause dur="1.9"/> and i've marked on here just a <pause dur="0.5"/> a couple of the <pause dur="0.4"/> globally conserved amino acids <pause dur="1.4"/> these are two <pause dur="0.4"/> storage proteins <pause dur="0.3"/> the first from <pause dur="0.6"/> 
soya bean <pause dur="0.2"/> the one on the top is this <pause dur="0.6"/> protein called glycinin <pause dur="0.9"/> and the second protein is a <pause dur="0.5"/> storage protein from beans <pause dur="1.1"/> and the <trunc>w</trunc> <pause dur="0.3"/> the <trunc>pro</trunc> the amino acids i've marked in red and blue <pause dur="0.5"/> are two of these globally conserved ones <pause dur="0.3"/> so wherever you <pause dur="0.2"/> find a storage protein from whatever species <pause dur="0.4"/> you'll always find <pause dur="0.5"/> a proline at this position <pause dur="0.3"/> and a glycine here <pause dur="0.4"/> and lots of variations in between but there'll always be a <pause dur="1.0"/> conserved residues another glycine here <pause dur="0.6"/> so these boxes represent these few key residues <pause dur="1.3"/> but the question is <trunc>w</trunc> <pause dur="0.3"/> what function do those few key residues have <pause dur="0.2"/> in determining the structure of a protein because <pause dur="0.7"/> linear sequences of proteins are usually <pause dur="0.8"/> they're useful but they're <pause dur="0.4"/> rather meaningless when you're trying to relate <pause dur="0.5"/> protein sequence to function <pause dur="0.5"/> function depends upon the shape of the protein <pause dur="0.5"/> and the shape of the protein is determined by how it folds up <pause dur="1.1"/> how <pause dur="0.4"/> this linear sequence becomes a three-dimensional structure <pause dur="1.4"/><kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="9"/> and if you look at the three-dimensional structure <pause dur="1.1"/> of a 
storage protein <pause dur="1.4"/> and this is a simple version of it <pause dur="3.7"/> this is <trunc>f</trunc> <pause dur="0.6"/> a sort of diagram of it being folded <pause dur="0.9"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> it's obviously two-D to <trunc>f</trunc> <pause dur="0.6"/> to flatten out here but <pause dur="1.3"/> it's meant it's composed of a series of strands <pause dur="0.5"/> you <pause dur="0.2"/> probably know about <pause dur="1.2"/> # the <pause dur="0.3"/> components of proteins that <pause dur="0.7"/> are made up out of either <pause dur="0.6"/> <trunc>bet</trunc> so-called beta strands <pause dur="0.3"/> or <pause dur="1.1"/> or helices so there's curved <pause dur="0.2"/> helix <pause dur="0.6"/> # components within a protein <pause dur="0.4"/> or there are <pause dur="0.5"/> there are strands which are just short stretches <pause dur="1.1"/> and these two <pause dur="0.8"/> marked residues <pause dur="0.9"/> that were on the previous <pause dur="0.4"/> # overhead <pause dur="0.4"/> the blue and red ones <pause dur="0.7"/> are in key areas <pause dur="0.3"/> that determine the three-dimensional structure of the protein <pause dur="0.5"/> so the glycine <pause dur="1.3"/> is here <pause dur="0.4"/> where the <pause dur="0.2"/> protein bends <pause dur="0.9"/> and the proline is at a key area here <pause dur="0.8"/> that forms an interaction between this part of the protein and this part <pause dur="1.4"/> so the moral <pause dur="0.2"/> to remember all the time is that <pause dur="0.6"/> just <pause dur="0.5"/> occasional amino acids at key points in a protein <pause dur="0.8"/> can determine the three-dimensional structure <pause dur="0.4"/> it doesn't matter too much <pause dur="1.3"/> in many cases what's between <pause dur="0.7"/> this corner and 
this corner <pause dur="0.4"/> as long as in three-dimensional space you can join up one corner another corner <pause dur="0.4"/> over a certain distance <pause dur="1.3"/> so when you're looking at proteins and the elution of proteins you <trunc>th</trunc> <pause dur="0.5"/> have to think all the time about <pause dur="0.8"/> okay <pause dur="0.2"/> linear sequences are fine <pause dur="0.5"/> but it's three-dimensional shapes which are the real key to biology <pause dur="1.1"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> and the it's the chemistry and the structure behind that that i'll <pause dur="0.9"/> go on to <pause dur="0.2"/> to mention <pause dur="0.8"/> so <pause dur="0.3"/> that's a just a <pause dur="0.4"/> a representation <pause dur="0.3"/> of these <pause dur="0.2"/> two amino acids and the <pause dur="0.6"/> the <pause dur="0.2"/> key function that they play <pause dur="0.9"/> in determining <pause dur="0.6"/><kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="13"/> structure <pause dur="1.7"/> so the question <trunc>o</trunc> <pause dur="0.7"/> or the next question was <pause dur="1.2"/> if we looked at a similar alignment <pause dur="0.2"/> of <pause dur="1.4"/> the germins and the germin-like proteins <pause dur="2.2"/> what could we learn by first of all at a <pause dur="0.4"/> <trunc>in</trunc> initial alignment of the different <pause dur="0.4"/> germin <pause dur="0.3"/> family <pause dur="0.4"/> and also <pause dur="0.3"/> could we relate the germin structural <pause dur="0.4"/> sorry <pause dur="0.3"/> could we relate the <pause dur="0.3"/> storage protein structural information <pause dur="0.6"/> to possibly predicting <pause dur="0.4"/> what shape of <pause dur="0.3"/> protein the germin-like proteins might have <pause dur="1.7"/> so the next stage was to do a <pause dur="0.6"/> simple 
alignment of the <pause dur="0.9"/> germin <pause dur="1.1"/> proteins <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> you don't need to read it just kind of look at the colours if you <pause dur="0.7"/> can there <pause dur="1.6"/> and the colours as usual are colour coded according to the type of amino acid <pause dur="0.9"/> so the <pause dur="0.5"/> the yellows are the <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> the sulphur containing amino acids <pause dur="0.5"/> prolines are the green <pause dur="1.9"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> the dark blues are the <pause dur="0.5"/> basic amino acids <pause dur="0.5"/> and you'll see if you go along this sequence there are areas where <pause dur="1.1"/> there are quite good stretches of similarity between all these families <pause dur="2.3"/> there are certain regions there where there's more <pause dur="0.2"/> conservation than others <pause dur="0.8"/> and one area where there are series of successive conserved amino acids is <pause dur="0.5"/> is here <pause dur="0.8"/> and particularly <pause dur="0.5"/> of interest to us because <pause dur="1.2"/> again <pause dur="0.7"/> if you're looking at amino acid you have to think <pause dur="0.7"/> okay some amino acids have an importance in structure <pause dur="0.6"/> some amino acids have an importance <pause dur="0.5"/> in <pause dur="0.4"/> say enzyme activity <pause dur="0.4"/> in things like <pause dur="0.4"/> binding of metals inside a protein <pause dur="1.5"/> and all our particular attention was <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> was drawn to these <pause dur="0.7"/> particularly to these two <pause dur="0.3"/> areas of <pause dur="1.0"/> here 
where there are <pause dur="0.4"/> dark blue lines that you see <pause dur="0.9"/> are conserved <pause dur="0.5"/> histidine residues <pause dur="1.3"/> so there were two there <pause dur="1.8"/><kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="9"/> and there were also <pause dur="0.3"/> if you went on through the protein <pause dur="9.1"/> and this is towards the <pause dur="0.3"/> the end towards the C-terminus of the protein <pause dur="0.2"/> you could see that <pause dur="0.2"/> there was another <pause dur="1.7"/> histidine residue here <pause dur="1.9"/> and the reason why <pause dur="0.4"/> we should always pay attention to <pause dur="0.3"/> things like histidines i say they're <pause dur="0.4"/> well known to being <pause dur="0.3"/> involved in <pause dur="0.3"/> the active site of enzymes <pause dur="1.3"/> so <pause dur="0.3"/> enzymes have a structure <pause dur="0.8"/> but the structure is really only there <pause dur="0.5"/> to form a scaffold <pause dur="1.0"/> in effect <pause dur="0.5"/> and the activity the chemistry in the <pause dur="0.2"/> protein in the enzyme <pause dur="0.4"/> takes place usually in the middle of it <pause dur="0.7"/> where the active site of the enzyme is <pause dur="0.5"/> so you have this <pause dur="0.4"/> rigid structure <pause dur="0.8"/> which provides a shape <pause dur="0.8"/> but the chemistry that goes on in an enzyme <pause dur="0.8"/> takes place in the active site in the usually in the centre <pause dur="0.8"/> where the chemical reactions <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> occur <pause dur="0.9"/> and many chemical reactions particularly <pause dur="0.4"/> if you remember this is an oxidase enzyme <pause dur="0.3"/> an oxalate oxidase <pause dur="1.0"/> many 
oxidases <pause dur="0.6"/> require metals for their activity <pause dur="0.5"/> so there's a <pause dur="0.4"/> they have a metal cofactor <pause dur="1.6"/> so how do metals stick on to <pause dur="1.1"/> on to the insides of proteins <pause dur="0.4"/> they have to be held in position <pause dur="1.7"/> and they have to be held in position through <pause dur="0.6"/> particular amino acids that have a <trunc>sor</trunc> <pause dur="0.6"/> a very rigid geometry <pause dur="1.7"/> so the distance between <pause dur="0.2"/> specific amino acids <pause dur="0.6"/> will hold particular metals <pause dur="0.4"/> and each metal <pause dur="1.2"/> requires <pause dur="0.3"/> different sorts of <pause dur="0.4"/> binding amino acids <pause dur="2.2"/> can anybody tell me what kinds of metals there might be inside oxidase enzymes <pause dur="2.7"/> any guesses </u><pause dur="3.5"/> <u who="sm0212" trans="pause"> iron </u><pause dur="0.8"/> <u who="nm0211" trans="pause"> yep </u><pause dur="0.6"/> <u who="su0213" trans="pause"> <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 word"/> </u><pause dur="0.3"/> <u who="nm0211" trans="pause"> yep <pause dur="0.4"/> # two <pause dur="0.4"/> good ones </u><u who="sm0214" trans="overlap"> zinc </u><u who="sm0215" trans="overlap"> magnesium </u><pause dur="0.4"/> <u who="nm0211" trans="pause"> sorry </u><pause dur="0.3"/> <u who="sm0214" trans="pause"> zinc </u><pause dur="0.3"/> <u who="nm0211" trans="pause"> yep <pause dur="0.7"/> that's three of the major ones <pause dur="0.2"/> pretty good </u><pause dur="1.4"/> <u who="sm0215" trans="pause"> magnesium </u><pause dur="1.3"/> <u who="nm0211" trans="pause"> # <pause dur="0.5"/> not quite magnesium <pause dur="0.2"/> something a bit like <vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" dur="1"/><pause dur="0.5"/> you start with the <trunc>s</trunc> first three letters <pause dur="0.3"/> of <pause dur="0.9"/> manganese is <pause dur="0.9"/> magnesium is <pause dur="0.6"/> not usually found in <pause dur="0.6"/> in oxidases <pause dur="0.8"/> certainly iron <pause dur="0.7"/> zinc <pause dur="1.0"/> particularly iron and copper <pause dur="0.2"/> i suppose are the two most common <pause dur="0.8"/> zinc <pause dur="0.3"/> not quite so much <pause dur="1.8"/> manganese is often found as an alternative to # <pause dur="0.6"/> to iron <pause dur="0.8"/> so <pause dur="0.4"/> just think about those <pause dur="0.5"/> those 
four components <pause dur="0.6"/> things like # <pause dur="0.9"/> amine oxidases are copper oxidases <pause dur="0.8"/> in each case though whether it's <pause dur="0.8"/> iron <pause dur="0.2"/> manganese or copper <pause dur="0.6"/> they're always held in position <pause dur="0.5"/> by <pause dur="0.4"/> histidine <pause dur="0.2"/> amino acids so you get this <pause dur="0.6"/> thing called a histidine cluster <pause dur="1.1"/> and you should always look very carefully if you start to see <pause dur="0.7"/> conservation of histidines <pause dur="0.9"/> in a protein alignment <pause dur="1.1"/> but that's <pause dur="0.2"/> circumstantial evidence for there being a metal binding site <pause dur="0.5"/> and that was our prediction <pause dur="0.4"/> on the basis of this <pause dur="1.2"/> 
# <pause dur="0.7"/> initial survey <pause dur="1.3"/> so <pause dur="0.3"/> were we dealing with a <pause dur="0.3"/> copper containing <pause dur="0.4"/> iron containing or manganese containing <pause dur="1.0"/> enzyme <pause dur="2.4"/> right <pause dur="2.2"/> so how could we answer that without doing any <pause dur="0.7"/> real <pause dur="0.6"/> # difficult <pause dur="0.7"/> biochemistry <pause dur="0.8"/> and the power now of <pause dur="0.5"/> of computing facilities in <pause dur="0.5"/> structural biology <pause dur="0.6"/> is so great that you can do a lot of work <pause dur="0.7"/> without actually going into the lab any longer <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.8"/> many labs are being depopulated because <vocal desc="laugh" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.2"/> computers are taking over <pause dur="0.6"/> and it's a lot easier to <pause dur="0.5"/> run the <pause dur="0.2"/> computer and use the modelling programmes that exist <pause dur="0.6"/> to answer some of these questions <pause dur="0.4"/> rather than saying <pause dur="0.6"/> i want to know <pause dur="0.5"/> whether these three histidines possibly might form a binding site <pause dur="0.3"/> i've got to purify the protein i've got to add metals i've got to do very complex # <pause dur="0.3"/> analytically <pause dur="0.6"/> work <pause dur="0.4"/> and then i might be wrong <pause dur="0.2"/> or i can't get the pure <pause dur="0.3"/> protein pure enough <pause dur="0.5"/> but what you can do in a few days is to <pause dur="0.2"/> say <pause dur="0.8"/> well let's <pause dur="0.7"/> try and produce a model of the protein <pause dur="1.3"/> i mean <pause dur="0.5"/> the best way to produce a model of a protein is if you have an existing structure to 
work from <pause dur="1.4"/> and the <pause dur="0.4"/> great benefit for us is that we had the structure of the storage protein <pause dur="0.8"/> we had the idea that <pause dur="0.4"/> the storage protein structure was <pause dur="0.3"/> probably related to the germin structure <pause dur="0.7"/> so we take <pause dur="0.6"/> the crystal and the three-dimensional coordinates of the <pause dur="0.6"/> <trunc>pr</trunc> of the storage protein <pause dur="0.4"/> and we would try and fit the germin <pause dur="1.1"/> sequence on to that <pause dur="0.3"/> backbone <pause dur="0.3"/> and see what we got <pause dur="1.1"/> and this is what we did <pause dur="0.7"/><kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="4"/> # <pause dur="0.9"/> couple of years ago <pause dur="0.4"/> and this is a summary of the <pause dur="0.4"/> conclusion <pause dur="1.6"/> we used as a model <pause dur="1.3"/> an average between <pause dur="1.1"/> two existing structures and these were the two storage proteins <pause dur="1.0"/> and this case canavalin and phaseolin <pause dur="0.4"/> so we took from the databases <pause dur="0.8"/> three-dimensional structure of the and coordinates of those <pause dur="0.7"/> those proteins <pause dur="0.7"/> if you remember i said that they had two halves to them because they were twice as big as germin <pause dur="0.7"/> so we treated them as independent halves <pause dur="0.7"/> an N-terminal half <pause dur="0.4"/> an N-terminal domain and a C-terminal domain <pause dur="1.1"/> and the red and orange <pause dur="0.3"/> one represents one protein and the other so <pause dur="0.6"/> that's just 
to show if you look sideways at these proteins <pause dur="0.8"/> that they have this <pause dur="0.8"/> beta barrel shape <pause dur="1.5"/> and # <pause dur="4.5"/> and we used the average of those <pause dur="0.4"/> shapes <pause dur="0.9"/> to fit <pause dur="0.5"/> the germin sequence on to <pause dur="0.5"/> and you can this is automatic you <pause dur="0.6"/> do the alignment and the computer will come out and it will try and fold the protein according to the <pause dur="0.6"/> coordinates that are <pause dur="0.3"/> it knows exist here <pause dur="0.9"/> and if you do that <pause dur="0.2"/> you get <pause dur="0.5"/> depending on the <pause dur="0.5"/> quality of the alignment you get a prediction then <pause dur="0.5"/> of the three-dimensional structure of your <pause dur="0.5"/> favourite protein <pause dur="0.7"/> so you don't have to crystallize it <pause dur="0.5"/> you can <pause dur="0.2"/> use the model <pause dur="1.5"/> and the model immediately told us something <pause dur="0.4"/> very interesting <pause dur="0.4"/> this is the crude <pause dur="0.4"/> model here <pause dur="0.6"/> that shows it is very similar to these two <pause dur="1.1"/> but it also told us that if we look in the <pause dur="0.4"/> inside of the <pause dur="0.2"/> barrel of this model <pause dur="1.1"/> and we ask <pause dur="0.3"/> where are those three histidines <pause dur="0.5"/> that we <trunc>th</trunc> <pause dur="0.4"/> saw in the alignment <pause dur="0.3"/> they were quite a <trunc>f</trunc> <pause dur="0.5"/> they were too close together <pause dur="0.3"/> and there was one that was quite a long way apart <pause dur="1.0"/> but once you fold up the protein <pause dur="0.9"/> you 
find that those three <pause dur="0.5"/> and they're represented here by green <pause dur="0.6"/> those three histidines <pause dur="2.0"/> fold together so they're very <pause dur="0.6"/> close to each other <pause dur="0.7"/> the they're adjacent amino acids then <pause dur="1.0"/> so in folding the protein we've brought the third histidine <pause dur="0.4"/> close to the first two <pause dur="0.5"/> which confirms now that you have <pause dur="0.6"/> three histidines together <pause dur="0.6"/> and it's further strong evidence <pause dur="0.6"/> that that <pause dur="0.5"/> is a histidine cluster <pause dur="0.2"/> so-called <pause dur="0.6"/> and that that could act as the site for binding the metal <pause dur="0.5"/> inside the protein <pause dur="1.8"/> and all of that can be done now with <pause dur="0.6"/> these very powerful modelling programmes that <pause dur="0.5"/> i'm sure <pause dur="0.3"/> if you haven't heard about them <gap reason="name" extent="2 words"/> will <pause dur="0.5"/> be showing you later <pause dur="3.0"/> so that was the <pause dur="1.0"/> the computer based research <pause dur="2.6"/> and # <pause dur="0.3"/> just spend a couple of minutes now with a <pause dur="0.5"/> sort of interlude before i go on to <pause dur="0.8"/> is that <pause dur="0.2"/> predicted research really been <pause dur="0.3"/> proven by <pause dur="0.5"/> what's happened recently <pause dur="1.7"/> and i'll go back a bit <pause dur="0.3"/> to the question <pause dur="1.6"/> that i was interested in personally <pause dur="0.4"/> which was if we could <pause dur="1.1"/> imagine that there is an evolutionary sequence 
of these proteins that started <pause dur="1.1"/> somewhere with a <pause dur="0.5"/> ancestral a hypothetical ancestral protein <pause dur="0.6"/> that then evolved through a slime mould protein <pause dur="0.9"/> to things in lower plants and then eventually to seed proteins <pause dur="0.8"/> logic would say <pause dur="0.6"/> well all of those must have had some very ancient ancestry somewhere <pause dur="0.7"/> can can we identify <pause dur="0.7"/> what the oldest surviving member of this protein family is <pause dur="2.0"/> and <pause dur="0.6"/> most people would say well <pause dur="0.6"/> would you go back to the early plants or you go back to the early fungi or <trunc>f</trunc> <pause dur="0.5"/> from which <pause dur="0.4"/> plants are <pause dur="1.0"/> very distantly related <pause dur="1.1"/> but i wanted to push the boundary in time back a bit further <pause dur="0.4"/> and so <pause dur="0.3"/> i started to search for bacterial and <pause dur="0.5"/> primitive <pause dur="0.4"/> archaeol which is a <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> # a related form of primitive bacteria <pause dur="0.5"/> could you find these sorts of proteins <pause dur="0.9"/> # even further back in evolutionary time <pause dur="0.6"/> because after all the <pause dur="0.5"/> proteins that are found in plants and animals now <pause dur="0.6"/> didn't kind of arrive from outer space <vocal desc="laugh" iterated="n"/> <pause dur="0.4"/> unless you <pause dur="0.3"/> are # <pause dur="0.4"/> are a particularly strange religion they came from <pause dur="0.5"/> some <trunc>a</trunc> existing protein 
structures <pause dur="0.8"/> so plants and animals didn't evolve a whole set of new protein structures <pause dur="1.3"/> they took <pause dur="0.4"/> existing ones from more primitive life forms and they <pause dur="0.5"/> amalgamated them they cut and they pasted them and they <pause dur="0.5"/> used them for different things but they didn't <pause dur="0.5"/> in many cases they didn't really invent <pause dur="1.1"/> new <pause dur="0.4"/> three-dimensional structures <pause dur="1.2"/> and if nothing else that's a sort of take home message that <pause dur="1.0"/> every protein in you or i or a <pause dur="0.4"/> vegetable <vocal desc="laugh" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.6"/> really <pause dur="0.3"/> is made up out of <pause dur="0.4"/> quite a small number of <pause dur="0.2"/> three-dimensional structures <pause dur="0.5"/> there's probably <pause dur="0.6"/> you know you have about a hundred-thousand genes <pause dur="1.7"/> # plants have maybe forty or fifty-thousand genes <pause dur="0.7"/> but # <pause dur="0.2"/> each of which encodes <pause dur="0.5"/> a different protein <pause dur="1.2"/> but there aren't a hundred-thousand different proteins <pause dur="0.6"/> in terms of their structures in a <pause dur="0.3"/> in you and there aren't forty-thousand different proteins in terms of structure in a <pause dur="0.4"/> in a plant <pause dur="0.6"/> there are probably five-hundred to a thousand <pause dur="0.8"/> and all the other <pause dur="0.3"/> variation is just minor <pause dur="0.7"/> sort of tinkering with the 
edges or <pause dur="0.4"/> duplications or <pause dur="0.7"/> taking a bit out of a <trunc>s</trunc> existing structure <pause dur="1.4"/> there's a <pause dur="0.2"/> really a <trunc>v</trunc> quite a small number of those underlying structures <pause dur="0.5"/> and now <pause dur="0.6"/> as more <pause dur="1.5"/> sort of organisms are being sequenced it becomes clear that <pause dur="0.8"/> in a <trunc>f</trunc> probably five years we'll know what all those structures are <pause dur="0.5"/> you'd be able to go and say <pause dur="0.7"/> there's <pause dur="0.3"/> you know there's five-hundred structures and they make make life <pause dur="0.2"/> whether it's bacterial or a human <pause dur="1.1"/> and everything else is just <pause dur="0.7"/> rearrangements of those existing <pause dur="0.5"/> it might be less than five-hundred eventually <pause dur="1.4"/> and so <pause dur="0.4"/> the conclusion must be <pause dur="1.0"/> that you will find in bacteria <pause dur="0.8"/> the underlying three-dimensional components of all other proteins that have <pause dur="0.2"/> been produced <pause dur="0.4"/> during evolution <pause dur="1.4"/> and that's in fact what we did do <pause dur="0.5"/> we went back and we <pause dur="0.4"/> looked in all the databases now <pause dur="0.7"/> there are fifty or sixty <pause dur="0.2"/> bacterial species where the complete gene sequence is known <pause dur="0.8"/> therefore you know <pause dur="0.3"/> all the genes therefore if you predict <pause dur="0.3"/> every protein sequence <pause dur="0.5"/> so you know that <pause dur="0.6"/> in E-coli or <pause dur="0.7"/> or B-subtilis 
the two best known <pause dur="0.4"/> bacteria <pause dur="0.5"/> you <pause dur="0.2"/> can now predict <pause dur="0.4"/> the at least the primary sequence of every protein <pause dur="1.1"/> and people are now trying to model <pause dur="0.4"/> and predict the three-dimensional structure of every protein in an organism <pause dur="1.2"/> and in the future <pause dur="0.6"/> the idea will be that <pause dur="0.4"/> you will take a different cell from an organism and be able to say <pause dur="1.0"/> a skin cell of a human <pause dur="0.3"/> has this set of proteins and we know the structure of all of them <pause dur="0.6"/> so that <pause dur="0.4"/> that's <pause dur="0.4"/> not far-fetched people are doing that now <pause dur="1.3"/> so what we did was go back and say can we find these <pause dur="0.7"/> ancestors of these <pause dur="0.2"/> storage proteins of these germins in bacteria <pause dur="0.9"/> and <pause dur="1.4"/> as you might expect the similarities become more and more <pause dur="0.3"/> limited as the further <trunc>y</trunc> <pause dur="0.3"/> back in time you go <pause dur="0.4"/> so you have to look for <pause dur="0.2"/> key <pause dur="0.6"/> conserved amino acids <pause dur="0.6"/> and we knew <pause dur="0.3"/> from this analysis that <pause dur="0.4"/> clearly the conserved <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.8"/> histidines in the centre of the protein <pause dur="0.4"/> were <pause dur="0.2"/> some of the most functionally <pause dur="0.5"/> interesting of the amino acids <pause dur="0.3"/> because they're the ones that determine <pause dur="0.5"/> potentially the binding site to the 
metals <pause dur="0.4"/> and potentially the <pause dur="0.6"/> the enzyme activity of the protein <pause dur="0.4"/><kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="7"/> and this is a <pause dur="1.3"/> initially just a brief <pause dur="1.0"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> outline of that <pause dur="1.4"/> there's lots of letters on here which are just sequences but <pause dur="2.8"/> we <trunc>c</trunc> we categorized this and attempted to categorize it to make the analysis easier <pause dur="0.7"/> and we divided <pause dur="0.5"/> the conserved areas up into two groups <pause dur="0.6"/> we said that there was a conserved <pause dur="1.5"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> motif here <pause dur="0.5"/> with these two conserved histidines which are the grey boxes <pause dur="0.5"/> and there was a conserved motif here <pause dur="0.5"/> where the histidine was conserved all the way down there <pause dur="1.8"/> all the proteins at the top of this list are from bacteria <pause dur="1.5"/> and <pause dur="1.6"/> what we also have in here is a <pause dur="0.3"/> thing that i haven't mentioned <pause dur="0.4"/> which is a space between this motif and this one <pause dur="3.1"/> so in other words the two motifs <pause dur="1.2"/> were at different distances apart <pause dur="0.8"/> in the plant proteins <pause dur="0.2"/> the germins <pause dur="0.4"/> there are about <pause dur="0.4"/> twenty or twenty-five amino acids <pause dur="0.7"/> from the end of this motif to the beginning of this one <pause dur="1.0"/> in the storage proteins that can vary as well <pause dur="0.2"/> which are the <unclear>book</unclear> 
bit on the bottom <pause dur="0.9"/> but in these primitive <pause dur="0.2"/> bacteria <pause dur="0.6"/> that distance was <pause dur="0.6"/> was less <pause dur="0.4"/> so again we have another <pause dur="1.3"/> kind of quantitative way of looking at <pause dur="0.3"/> a protein evolution that we have these two conserved motifs that both had histidines in <pause dur="0.2"/> that we knew when they folded up came together <pause dur="1.9"/> 
that in <pause dur="0.2"/> plants were a certain distance apart in the linear sequence <pause dur="0.4"/> but if you look at the bacteria they were closer together <pause dur="1.4"/> so during evolution certain things had happened <pause dur="1.9"/> the two motifs <pause dur="0.5"/> had in effect moved apart in sequence <pause dur="1.8"/> the protein size itself had also changed because <pause dur="0.3"/> the bacterial proteins were only about a hundred amino acids in length in total <pause dur="1.3"/> whereas the plant ones were twice that length and <pause dur="0.3"/> and the protein <pause dur="0.5"/> some storage proteins were double that length <pause dur="1.1"/> so we had a <pause dur="1.1"/> a model now that said <pause dur="0.5"/> in ancient bacteria we had a <pause dur="0.3"/> <trunc>s</trunc> <pause dur="0.7"/> fairly small protein <pause dur="0.7"/> with these conserved amino acids in it <pause dur="1.0"/> as it <pause dur="0.7"/> moved from a bacteria to a fungus to a plant an animal <pause dur="3.0"/><kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="5"/> and this is a representation of that <pause dur="1.1"/> one 
important thing happened <pause dur="1.3"/> and again this is just a <pause dur="0.2"/> look at the shape rather than the detail <pause dur="0.7"/> the two motifs are the <pause dur="0.2"/> blocks <pause dur="0.2"/> where the yellow residues are <pause dur="0.6"/> these two motifs <pause dur="0.8"/> had moved apart <pause dur="1.4"/> and this is represented by the kind of <pause dur="0.4"/> tower in the middle <pause dur="1.3"/> the bacteria <pause dur="0.2"/> at the front at the top here <pause dur="0.9"/> plants and animals towards the bottom <pause dur="1.0"/> these residues are ones which had been inserted <pause dur="0.3"/> into the middle of a protein <pause dur="0.4"/> during the billions of years of evolution <pause dur="0.7"/> there were also residues <pause dur="0.5"/> stuck on at each end that i haven't shown <pause dur="0.3"/> at this end and that end <pause dur="1.9"/> but because we knew the significance of the two motifs and the histidine residues we could trace them <pause dur="0.9"/> but <pause dur="0.9"/> during evolutionary time <pause dur="0.2"/> proteins had become more and more complex <pause dur="0.4"/> they'd <pause dur="0.3"/> had extra residues inserted into them <pause dur="0.4"/> and they'd had extra residues stuck on either end <pause dur="0.4"/> and then eventually the whole protein had doubled <pause dur="0.6"/> and become a storage protein <pause dur="4.0"/><kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="16"/> so we're getting kind of to the end of the <pause dur="0.7"/> the story now but <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="4.5"/> i just want to show you # <pause dur="1.2"/> 
this which was the next attempt at <pause dur="0.7"/> at our model of <pause dur="1.0"/> what <pause dur="0.7"/> the <pause dur="0.5"/> the germin the oxalate oxidase might look like in real life i've told you what the computer said it would look like <vocal desc="laugh" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.5"/> i've told you the prediction of how it might have changed during <pause dur="0.4"/> evolutionary time <pause dur="0.8"/> but what did it really look like <pause dur="1.5"/> and i go back to the comment that said <pause dur="0.4"/> this protein was a <pause dur="0.6"/> multimeric protein it had different subunits in it <pause dur="1.7"/> for many years for about ten years <pause dur="1.0"/> the biochemists in Canada had said <pause dur="0.9"/> we think that <pause dur="0.8"/> the germin protein is made out of five subunits because when we <pause dur="0.2"/> separate them which you can do <pause dur="0.3"/> we get kind of five and we <trunc>lo</trunc> if we measure the molecular weight <pause dur="0.5"/> we get something that says <pause dur="0.5"/> the molecular weight of the total protein's five times the weight of the subunit <pause dur="0.6"/> and that was <pause dur="0.4"/> what the computer said would be the model of <pause dur="0.4"/> five subunits stuck together <pause dur="2.4"/> we became a bit doubtful about whether that was valid because <pause dur="0.4"/> we already knew from the <pause dur="0.6"/> storage protein structures <pause dur="0.9"/> that <trunc>s</trunc> <pause dur="0.3"/> storage 
proteins in seeds <pause dur="1.3"/> are composed of three subunits <pause dur="1.5"/> and we've <pause dur="0.2"/> if you remember that we said that <pause dur="0.4"/> each subunit is about twice as big as <pause dur="0.5"/> the germin subunit <pause dur="1.0"/> so common sense <vocal desc="laugh" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.2"/> if you believe in biology having common sense would <trunc>s</trunc> <pause dur="0.3"/> argue that <pause dur="1.4"/> if we know that there's a structure of three subunits in each one is twice the size of the one we're interested in <pause dur="0.5"/> it's kind of obvious that say <pause dur="0.4"/> well wouldn't it <pause dur="0.2"/> make more sense to have six subunits of similar <pause dur="0.4"/> size <pause dur="0.3"/> that would then give an equivalent shape <pause dur="0.9"/> if <pause dur="0.3"/> evolution had conserved shapes and i've argued that <pause dur="0.4"/> evolution does conserve protein shapes <pause dur="1.3"/> and the computer model then said <pause dur="1.0"/> if we had <pause dur="0.6"/> in fact six <pause dur="0.6"/> subunits in our shape <pause dur="1.4"/> we would have then have something that we'd described as a <pause dur="0.2"/> trimer of dimers because <pause dur="0.4"/> you have this triangular <pause dur="0.9"/> shape <pause dur="0.8"/> so there's two here two here and two here <pause dur="0.6"/> so it's not <pause dur="0.7"/> there isn't a sixfold axis of symmetry there's a threefold axis of symmetry <pause dur="0.4"/> so <pause dur="0.6"/> and <pause dur="0.4"/> that shape would look very very similar to what we have in a seed 
in a storage protein <pause dur="0.7"/> but here we'd have six bits rather than <pause dur="0.6"/> than three <pause dur="0.2"/> double-sized bits <pause dur="0.7"/> and that's the <pause dur="0.4"/> kind of simple maths of it <pause dur="1.0"/><kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="12"/> so those were our two working hypotheses <pause dur="0.3"/> and <pause dur="0.4"/> the Canadian group were said <pause dur="0.3"/> oh sniff <pause dur="0.6"/> we've spent ten years and we've said it's a pentamer 'cause if you measure the weight <pause dur="0.6"/> then that tells you it's a pentamer <pause dur="1.7"/> and # <pause dur="1.2"/> what i'll now do is show you <pause dur="0.9"/> how we resolved that <pause dur="1.5"/> and we did it through <pause dur="0.6"/> conventional crystallography <pause dur="1.1"/> we had a <pause dur="0.9"/> student who's just finished <trunc>s</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> his PhD successfully <pause dur="0.3"/> who crystallized <pause dur="0.9"/> the germin-like protein the <pause dur="0.4"/> the oxalate oxidase from barley <pause dur="1.3"/> he purified it and purified it and eventually got a <pause dur="0.8"/> a <pause dur="0.5"/> a source of protein that was sufficiently pure to <pause dur="0.2"/> to produce crystals from it <pause dur="0.5"/> and that was a lot harder in this case than <pause dur="0.6"/> than in most cases and i won't go into the biochemistry but <pause dur="0.4"/> eventually <pause dur="0.5"/> he found us <pause dur="0.3"/> a crystal <pause dur="0.3"/> that was good enough to <pause dur="0.6"/> be able to resolve <pause dur="0.4"/> in the <pause dur="0.8"/> in the X-ray beams that you use for this sort of thing <pause dur="1.0"/> 
and this is <pause dur="0.3"/> it's not published yet so <pause dur="0.5"/> not many people in the world have ever seen it before but <pause dur="0.5"/> this is his resolution <pause dur="0.9"/> of that <pause dur="0.8"/> now the definitive <pause dur="0.6"/> three-dimensional structure <pause dur="1.0"/> of oxalate oxidase from barley <pause dur="1.9"/> and <pause dur="0.6"/> if we get it the right way round <pause dur="2.0"/> well if there is a right way round <pause dur="1.8"/> you see there are six colours <pause dur="0.6"/> so we've confirmed absolutely that it is a hexamer <pause dur="0.2"/> it's made of six subunits <pause dur="4.1"/> there are some other very <pause dur="1.0"/> unusual or <pause dur="0.2"/> sort of key features about this that help to explain <pause dur="1.1"/> its <pause dur="0.5"/> # its biological <pause dur="0.5"/> and its chemical properties <pause dur="1.7"/> one is that <pause dur="1.2"/> if you <pause dur="0.3"/> just take for example there's three corners here <pause dur="0.9"/> we've got one <pause dur="0.9"/> two and three <pause dur="0.6"/> these are corners where this subunit <pause dur="0.6"/> the light blue one <pause dur="0.6"/> interacts with the dark blue one <pause dur="0.9"/> and they are held together <pause dur="0.8"/> by <pause dur="1.0"/> very <pause dur="0.6"/> tight <pause dur="0.4"/> linking of the <pause dur="0.4"/> of the helical <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> ends of the each subunit so <pause dur="0.3"/> they're called sort of <pause dur="0.2"/> <trunc>a</trunc> <pause dur="0.6"/> alpha helical clasps they <pause dur="0.4"/> join together <pause dur="0.5"/> very tightly <pause dur="0.9"/> so first of all it's held very tightly at three corners <pause dur="1.3"/> it's also <pause dur="0.2"/> stuck 
together in effect by <pause dur="0.7"/> the centre of the protein <pause dur="0.9"/> this is the beginning of it this is the N-terminus of it <pause dur="0.7"/> the C-terminus is the bit down here <pause dur="2.5"/> the N-terminus <pause dur="0.9"/> is held together <pause dur="0.5"/> in this case the dark blue <pause dur="0.9"/> subunit <pause dur="0.4"/> is attached <pause dur="0.2"/> to this # magenta coloured one <pause dur="1.5"/> and it's held together by very strong bonds between <pause dur="0.7"/> the the amino acids in the centre here <pause dur="0.8"/> so you have <pause dur="1.1"/> these subunits <pause dur="0.4"/> at each corner which are <pause dur="0.2"/> holding each other together tightly <pause dur="0.7"/> you also have <pause dur="1.4"/> the other <pause dur="0.4"/> alternative <pause dur="0.3"/> groupings of this subunit this one and this one and this one or this one <pause dur="0.3"/> are holding each other together <pause dur="0.4"/> so you have a <pause dur="0.2"/> a intensively strong relationship that <pause dur="0.4"/> holds these <pause dur="0.2"/> different units together <pause dur="0.4"/> and that's characteristic of <gap reason="inaudible due to background noise" extent="1 word"/> the fact <pause dur="0.3"/> that this is very thermally stable <pause dur="0.7"/> it's withstands eighty degrees and it still survives <pause dur="0.5"/> so it takes a lot of energy to break those <pause dur="0.7"/> there's the <pause dur="0.7"/> links between it <pause dur="1.3"/> also <pause dur="0.3"/> it has the highest amount of <pause dur="0.6"/> hidden <pause dur="0.3"/> surface if you can imagine this is just on a flat surface 
but <pause dur="0.2"/> you can look at this in three dimensions but <pause dur="0.6"/> a lot of the <pause dur="0.5"/> the surface of each monomer <pause dur="0.7"/> as you join it to the next monomer <pause dur="0.8"/> is not <pause dur="0.6"/> therefore exposed to the outside world to the solvents around the protein any longer <pause dur="1.3"/> so as you stick things together if you can <pause dur="0.5"/> hide <pause dur="0.3"/> the surface <pause dur="0.2"/> by sticking them together <pause dur="0.4"/> you reduce the exposure of the whole protein to the solvents around it <pause dur="1.0"/> and this has more than half of <pause dur="0.5"/> the area of each <pause dur="0.2"/> subunit hidden <pause dur="0.5"/> by the association <pause dur="0.5"/> and that's <pause dur="1.3"/> # i don't know whether it's the world record but it's close to the world record of proteins of <pause dur="0.8"/> of hiding <pause dur="0.3"/> surface <pause dur="0.5"/> by <pause dur="0.2"/> by assembling into a <pause dur="1.0"/> # into a larger <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> order protein <pause dur="0.7"/> and because <pause dur="0.2"/> it doesn't have <pause dur="1.0"/> very many surface loops on the surface these are the <pause dur="0.7"/> the strands that <trunc>joi</trunc> sorry the loops that join the strands together <pause dur="0.4"/> because these are not very many or large <pause dur="0.8"/> and where they are large they're hidden in the middle <pause dur="0.7"/> means that if you want to dissolve this protein with a protease <pause dur="1.0"/> you don't have many sites for the proteases to attack <pause dur="0.6"/> 
so in other words it's a <pause dur="0.4"/> it becomes resistant to degredation by <pause dur="0.3"/> protein attack <pause dur="0.4"/> so it can withstand all sorts of chemical <pause dur="0.5"/> thermal <pause dur="0.9"/> and and other physical <pause dur="0.3"/> breakdown because it's such a tightly conserved <pause dur="1.0"/> and that helps you understand why it's evolved <pause dur="1.4"/> so successfully during <pause dur="0.3"/> throughout # <pause dur="0.4"/> time <pause dur="1.7"/> that in a seed what you want <pause dur="1.2"/> in <pause dur="0.4"/> the proteins in seeds <pause dur="0.2"/> seeds of the dried up part of the plant they have to withstand dehydration desiccation <pause dur="0.4"/> they have to withstand high temperatures <pause dur="1.2"/> and so the functional characteristics of this <pause dur="0.5"/> whole protein <pause dur="0.4"/> superfamily <pause dur="1.9"/> have these different <pause dur="0.2"/> characteristics that <pause dur="1.4"/> it started off in a primitive bacteria <pause dur="0.3"/> as quite a small protein but it had this probably <pause dur="0.4"/> the same thermally stable <pause dur="0.3"/> structure <pause dur="0.8"/> and during evolution <pause dur="1.4"/> where you'd need <pause dur="0.2"/> a desiccation tolerant thermally stable <pause dur="0.4"/> protein structure <pause dur="0.5"/> it's a lot easier to use one that exists in that organism <pause dur="0.4"/> rather than to invent one <pause dur="0.5"/> and it's a bit teleological but <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="1.1"/> plants <pause dur="0.7"/> in seeds have taken this <pause dur="0.4"/> desiccation tolerant 
protein <pause dur="0.3"/> and multiplied it up enormously <pause dur="1.1"/> and they've used it <pause dur="0.5"/> for a different purpose <pause dur="0.8"/> what i'm <trunc>ju</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> going to say now explains two other bits of the <pause dur="0.6"/><kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="16"/> biology <pause dur="1.8"/> and that is to take <pause dur="3.9"/> in in effect a third of that <pause dur="0.2"/> structure that you saw before <pause dur="0.5"/> and i'm going to compare it exactly <pause dur="0.5"/> with a <pause dur="0.2"/> one unit of a storage protein <pause dur="1.5"/> okay <pause dur="0.6"/> so if you can imagine the top here is oxalate oxidase but it's <pause dur="0.6"/> it's a third of the hexamer it's two <pause dur="0.2"/> subunits <pause dur="0.6"/> and we're comparing it directly <pause dur="0.7"/> with one subunit from the storage protein <pause dur="0.7"/> and you can see and you can superimpose this on this <pause dur="0.3"/> and they're almost indistinguishable <pause dur="0.7"/> so although in primary sequence <pause dur="0.5"/> if you match this to this you'd have less than <pause dur="0.5"/> twenty per cent similarity <pause dur="0.6"/> we know that the conservation is <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> important areas <pause dur="1.5"/> we we've got the helices here <pause dur="1.0"/> in the same place <pause dur="1.1"/> so we've got absolute now structural confirmation that our hypothesis that storage proteins were related to this is confirmed <pause dur="0.4"/> by real measurement <pause dur="0.4"/> in space <pause dur="1.0"/> and the two other <pause dur="0.3"/> 
bits that i haven't mentioned are <pause dur="1.0"/> if you can see the green blobs in the middle here <pause dur="0.4"/> that is our metal <pause dur="2.6"/> there's one metal in each subunit <pause dur="0.5"/> this is the <pause dur="0.2"/> the metal that's held together by the histidine residues <pause dur="0.7"/> so manganese that's why i was <trunc>k</trunc> <vocal desc="laugh" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.4"/> keen on mentioning manganese at the beginning <pause dur="0.5"/> so manganese containing oxidase <pause dur="1.0"/> it's a unique manganese containing oxidase 'cause there'd never been any described like it before <pause dur="2.9"/> storage proteins have one histidine <pause dur="0.4"/> i didn't stress that but you if you'd counted the number you might have seen that <pause dur="0.9"/> storage proteins have one histidine <pause dur="0.2"/> they have no metal <pause dur="0.5"/> so they've lost the two other histidines during evolution <pause dur="0.7"/> they've <pause dur="0.3"/> preserved the structure <pause dur="0.7"/> they've lost the metal <pause dur="0.4"/> they're no longer an enzyme <pause dur="1.0"/> so they don't have a <trunc>f</trunc> <pause dur="0.4"/> a chemical function <pause dur="0.4"/> they act as a store of amino acids in a seed <pause dur="1.0"/> so <pause dur="0.3"/> what you eat <pause dur="0.2"/> your diet <pause dur="1.2"/> is made up out of <pause dur="0.4"/> in effect <pause dur="0.2"/> deactivated enzymes <pause dur="1.7"/> that have gone through evolution <pause dur="0.5"/> by maintaining a structure 
that <pause dur="0.5"/> can withstand heat <pause dur="0.4"/> and temperature <pause dur="0.7"/> but it's lost its enzyme activity by losing the <pause dur="0.4"/> histidines that bind the metal <pause dur="1.8"/> the other point i said <pause dur="0.5"/> was if you imagine the <pause dur="0.4"/> two motifs i said they moved apart in evolution <pause dur="1.6"/> they did move apart <pause dur="1.2"/> and that's represented by this loop here <pause dur="1.7"/> the loop here <pause dur="0.2"/> is the distance between the conserved areas <pause dur="0.3"/> and this loop <pause dur="0.4"/> can really be quite large <pause dur="0.3"/> without disturbing at all <pause dur="0.4"/> the structure of the protein <pause dur="1.0"/> so <pause dur="0.4"/> this loop and some of the other loops <pause dur="0.3"/> have changed in size <pause dur="0.3"/> but they haven't altered <pause dur="0.5"/> the structure <pause dur="0.7"/> and as an aside <pause dur="0.6"/> if you're interested in <pause dur="1.1"/> in food studies at all <pause dur="0.8"/> then you know that <pause dur="0.2"/> some storage proteins in seeds are powerful <pause dur="0.2"/> allergens <pause dur="1.0"/> and the best known of those is the peanut allergen <pause dur="0.3"/> if you <pause dur="0.7"/> if any of you are allergic to nuts <pause dur="1.0"/> very dangerous for some people <pause dur="1.1"/> part of the reason for that is that the peanut allergen <pause dur="0.5"/> has a very large loop in this position <pause dur="0.6"/> and that the allergenic <pause dur="0.5"/> amino acids <pause dur="0.4"/> are <pause dur="0.7"/> in these loopy areas <pause dur="1.1"/> so during evolution some 
subset of storage proteins have become allergenic <pause dur="0.5"/> by putting in unfortunately for humans <vocal desc="laugh" iterated="n"/><pause dur="1.0"/> rather unpleasant amino acids here <pause dur="1.1"/> that can be toxic to people <pause dur="0.4"/> but now we understand the structure <pause dur="0.7"/> there are <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> G-M people <pause dur="0.7"/> who are modifying peanut proteins to remove those loops <pause dur="0.3"/> and therefore remove the <kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="19"/> allergic potential <pause dur="0.7"/> of peanuts <pause dur="0.5"/> so <pause dur="0.5"/> the summary now says <pause dur="4.6"/> that <pause dur="2.3"/> # <pause dur="2.0"/> which of these shall i show you <pause dur="0.5"/> is that something like this happened in time <pause dur="1.2"/> # <pause dur="2.4"/> this is a <trunc>f</trunc> <pause dur="0.4"/> brief phylogeny then of the whole story <pause dur="1.8"/> but you had <pause dur="0.5"/> archaeol species you had <pause dur="0.4"/> bacterial species <pause dur="0.7"/> green bacteria <pause dur="2.1"/> fungi plants ferns <pause dur="0.5"/> the it doesn't have animals on here <pause dur="0.4"/> animals also have <pause dur="0.5"/> proteins that are related to C-storage proteins <pause dur="0.5"/> nobody knows what they do yet <vocal desc="laugh" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.5"/> but if you look in a <pause dur="0.9"/> in a human or in a <pause dur="0.2"/> nematode worm <pause dur="0.5"/> they have a <trunc>s</trunc> protein sequence that's quite like the storage proteins <pause dur="0.5"/> we haven't got a clue what it does in an animal <vocal desc="laugh" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.4"/> 'cause # <pause dur="1.0"/> we we suspect it's # 
something to do with <pause dur="0.3"/> with desiccation tolerance but <pause dur="0.6"/> we don't know yet <pause dur="0.9"/> the other thing is that at certain times in evolution <pause dur="0.6"/> we had a duplication event <pause dur="0.6"/> this duplication event led to C-storage proteins there was another one i haven't had time to talk about <pause dur="0.5"/> at the beginning here <pause dur="0.4"/> that led to a different group of proteins <pause dur="0.8"/> and amongst the ones that <pause dur="0.7"/> this duplication led to <pause dur="0.5"/> were <pause dur="0.3"/> the other oxalate oxidase sorry <pause dur="0.3"/> the other oxalate degrading enzyme i showed you <pause dur="0.3"/> right back at the beginning <pause dur="0.6"/> so although we started ten years ago <pause dur="0.2"/> nearly <pause dur="0.9"/> with the choice between <pause dur="0.9"/> should we use oxalate oxidase or oxalate decarboxylase <pause dur="0.5"/> what we didn't have was <pause dur="0.4"/> any clue that in fact <pause dur="0.4"/> the two enzymes <pause dur="0.4"/> are probably very closely related <pause dur="0.7"/> but <pause dur="0.7"/> we go back to here <pause dur="0.8"/> we now know through this evolutionary analysis <pause dur="0.7"/> that oxalate decarboxylase <pause dur="0.4"/> is a duplicated version <pause dur="0.6"/> of oxalate oxidase <pause dur="0.8"/> it's very limited <pause dur="0.3"/> in its <trunc>co</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> conservation <pause dur="0.5"/> but we now know that this <pause dur="0.3"/> is twice of <pause dur="0.9"/> of the size of that <pause dur="0.3"/> and it's a member of the same superfamily so there's a certain <pause dur="0.4"/> kind of symmetry in the story <pause dur="0.7"/> that says <pause dur="1.1"/> throughout all of 
this <pause dur="0.7"/> we followed a <pause dur="0.3"/> kind of academic analysis but it's led to an understanding of <pause dur="1.0"/> of conservation of function <pause dur="0.6"/> of conservation of <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="1.6"/> in some cases conservation of <trunc>s</trunc> sorry conservation of structure <pause dur="1.3"/> but at <pause dur="0.4"/> of a rather broad diversification of function <pause dur="0.6"/> and that's the <pause dur="0.5"/> a message in all of these evolutionary studies <pause dur="0.9"/> that you can start from very <pause dur="0.8"/> apparently very different and distantly related proteins and <pause dur="0.7"/> if you know the structure <pause dur="0.7"/> that's the key thing <pause dur="0.9"/> then you can find that <pause dur="0.5"/> the diversification isn't very that great <pause dur="0.3"/> and that lots of proteins <pause dur="0.5"/> are really members of this small subset of families <pause dur="0.7"/> so # <pause dur="0.8"/> i should finish there <pause dur="0.7"/> i'm sorry about the confusion for the <vocal desc="laugh" iterated="n"/> at the beginning <pause dur="0.9"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/><vocal desc="laugh" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.9"/> <gap reason="name" extent="2 words"/> is <pause dur="0.2"/> obviously the expert in the modelling and i'm sure he's going to <pause dur="0.6"/> tell you and and show you how some of the <pause dur="1.0"/> # these techniques can be used <pause dur="1.1"/> but this is a <pause dur="0.2"/> i think an <pause dur="0.5"/> an interesting framework to build from <pause dur="1.1"/> and <pause dur="0.5"/> i should finish there <pause dur="0.3"/> anyway <pause dur="0.9"/> thank you <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> i hope you have every word of that <vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" dur="1"/>
