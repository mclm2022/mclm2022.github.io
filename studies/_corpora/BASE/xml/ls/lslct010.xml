<u who="nm0253"> welcome # to the first year laboratory class <pause dur="0.3"/> as you know # biological sciences is an experimental science <pause dur="0.3"/> everything we know about biology we have learned either by <trunc>c</trunc> careful observation of living organisms <pause dur="0.4"/> or through experiments # experimental work in in biology <pause dur="0.6"/> what we are doing in this course of biological sciences is training you to become <pause dur="0.3"/> professional biologists <pause dur="0.3"/> so obviously that includes training you in laboratory methods <pause dur="0.4"/> more than that <pause dur="0.2"/> it involves training you in how to observe <pause dur="0.3"/> and how to report <pause dur="0.2"/> your observations <pause dur="0.4"/> so if you intend to become a professional biologist <pause dur="0.3"/> evidently <pause dur="0.3"/> # this laboratory course is extremely important to you <pause dur="0.6"/> even if you don't intend to become a professional biologist <pause dur="0.3"/> we all think that training in laboratory methods is very valuable to you <pause dur="0.3"/> in the sense of transferable skills <pause dur="0.2"/> because <pause dur="0.3"/> the skills of observing <pause dur="0.3"/> understanding and reporting are going to be useful to you in any profession whatever 
profession you choose be it biology <pause dur="0.2"/> or being a policeman <pause dur="0.2"/> or being an accountant <pause dur="0.2"/> or whatever <pause dur="0.3"/> so we think that these laboratory courses are extremely valuable and extremely important to you <pause dur="0.3"/> so you are now launched <pause dur="0.3"/> into your career as a professional biologist i should say <pause dur="1.0"/> there's a number of things that i need to talk to you about as a sort of introduction to the laboratory class <pause dur="0.3"/> # and they're all <pause dur="0.2"/><kinesic desc="indicates board" iterated="n"/> listed on this board here <pause dur="0.3"/> # which i will leave up for you to look at later on perhaps if you need to <pause dur="0.6"/> so the first <pause dur="0.3"/><kinesic desc="indicates point on board" iterated="n"/> point i want to make the first thing i want to talk about <pause dur="0.3"/> is the staff <pause dur="0.3"/> who are going to be running this particular class <pause dur="0.6"/> # you know me i'm <gap reason="name" extent="2 words"/> <pause dur="0.2"/> my colleagues <pause dur="0.2"/> over there <pause dur="0.2"/> # there's <gap reason="name" extent="2 words"/> who will put his hand up <pause dur="0.5"/> <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> <pause dur="0.6"/> <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> <shift feature="voice" new="laugh"/>sorry <shift feature="voice" new="normal"/><gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> she's recently changed her name which always confused me <gap reason="name" extent="2 words"/> <pause dur="0.4"/> <gap reason="name" extent="2 words"/> he has a nickname <vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" n="ss" dur="1"/> which i'm going not going to release <pause dur="0.2"/> to 
you you may you may find out later <pause dur="0.5"/> and <gap reason="name" extent="2 words"/> <pause dur="0.3"/> the first three and <pause dur="0.2"/> and me <pause dur="0.2"/> will be <pause dur="0.4"/> most of the time in the laboratory working with you <pause dur="0.3"/> <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> # will be upstairs in the computer room <pause dur="0.3"/> where he will be offering you assistance in in working with P-Cs i'll come back to that in a moment <pause dur="0.4"/> so those are the staff the other extremely important member of staff whom i don't immediately see <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> <pause dur="0.5"/> there you are over there <pause dur="0.2"/> put your hand up <pause dur="0.3"/> <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> <pause dur="0.3"/> is the a member of the technical staff now her function is extremely important <pause dur="0.3"/> in that if equipment goes wrong or you don't have the right chemicals or something like that <pause dur="0.3"/> you go to <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> and she will always be able to sort you out she's much better at those sorts of things <pause dur="0.4"/> than the members of staff other members of staff are so <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> is the person to look after your <pause dur="0.3"/> technical problems <pause dur="0.2"/> and other problems i'm quite sure <pause dur="0.2"/> technical problems <unclear>here</unclear> <pause dur="0.9"/> right now you have in front of you been given a green folder <pause dur="0.5"/> now that green folder <pause dur="0.2"/> 
contains <pause dur="1.0"/> one or two <pause dur="0.2"/> useful bits for you <pause dur="0.6"/> a floppy disk how about that <pause dur="0.6"/> and <pause dur="0.5"/> a black marker pen <pause dur="0.3"/> these are things that you will be using throughout your laboratory class <pause dur="0.3"/> classes <pause dur="0.2"/> unfortunately if you lose them we shan't be giving you any others <pause dur="0.4"/> # there are other things in here <pause dur="0.4"/> # books about safety <pause dur="0.2"/> and little little # <pause dur="0.2"/> books leaflets about safety <pause dur="0.3"/> which you need to use which we'll have to use we'll talk about that again in a moment <pause dur="0.7"/> # and <pause dur="0.2"/> what else is there <pause dur="1.4"/> <unclear>hazards</unclear> related <pause dur="0.3"/> things like that <pause dur="0.7"/> little odds and ends <pause dur="0.2"/> so there's a few free free gifts that you might like <pause dur="0.2"/> not quite as grand as the free gifts you get when you open your bank account but they will be <pause dur="0.2"/> in this laboratory class perhaps more valuable <pause dur="1.0"/> okay <pause dur="0.8"/> now <pause dur="0.3"/><vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/><kinesic desc="indicates point on board" iterated="n"/> a daybook <pause dur="0.6"/> this is something that we talked about a little bit <pause dur="0.3"/> # when we talked to you initially with <gap reason="name" extent="2 words"/> you remember <pause dur="0.7"/> the purpose of a daybook <pause dur="0.6"/> is an extremely important 
thing <pause dur="0.5"/> # because you <trunc>c</trunc> record in your daybook your immediate observations as you are making your observations so you're noting down data that you are generating <pause dur="0.4"/> and <trunc>i</trunc> more importantly <pause dur="0.4"/> you write down what you've actually done <pause dur="0.5"/> <trunc>i</trunc> <trunc>i</trunc> <trunc>i</trunc> in your experimental work <pause dur="0.8"/> your daybook has to be a working record <pause dur="0.2"/> of your experimental <pause dur="0.4"/> studies <pause dur="0.5"/> working record which has got to be sufficiently quality sufficiently good quality <pause dur="0.2"/> so that if i want to sit down and read it <pause dur="0.3"/> i can learn from that daybook what you have actually done <pause dur="0.6"/> now this is something that you must learn <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> our PhD stdents are obliged to do it even more so <pause dur="0.3"/> # post-doctoral research fellows as a scientist of course we all use a daybook and the daybook <pause dur="0.4"/> has to be <pause dur="0.3"/> so good that you can always know what you've actually done <pause dur="0.5"/> # and more importantly so that somebody else can know what you've actually done in the future <pause dur="0.5"/> okay <pause dur="0.2"/> so that's tremendously important <pause dur="0.3"/> it also <pause dur="0.2"/> is a check for us that you have actually attended the 
class <pause dur="0.4"/> as <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> pointed out in the past some wicked people have come into the class <pause dur="0.3"/> signed on to the list <pause dur="0.3"/> and then gone <pause dur="0.2"/> and nicked the data from somebody else and written it up and got credit now that's obviously <pause dur="0.3"/> not allowed <pause dur="0.3"/> so the daybook <pause dur="0.2"/> has to be checked <pause dur="0.2"/> by a member of the staff before you leave the laboratory and signed <pause dur="0.4"/> now what i like <pause dur="0.4"/> people to do members of staff to do <pause dur="0.3"/> is actually run through the daybook what you've done <pause dur="0.4"/> and ask you <pause dur="0.2"/> # about it <pause dur="0.3"/> # and make sure that it is of a suitable standard and i prefer people not to leave the laboratory <pause dur="0.4"/> until the the staff member is satisfied that your daybook is adequate <pause dur="0.4"/> okay <pause dur="0.2"/> if it's not adequate it won't be signed <pause dur="0.6"/> i think that's <unclear>actually</unclear> quite important <pause dur="0.3"/> and that's some # <trunc>s</trunc> something <pause dur="0.3"/> that you need to be trained in <pause dur="0.5"/> # in some <pause dur="0.2"/> laboratories particularly commercial laboratories <pause dur="0.3"/> # and particularly <pause dur="0.3"/> # laboratories in hospitals where diagnostic # work is being done <pause dur="0.3"/> the daybook <pause dur="0.5"/> takes on a particular importance for commercial 
reasons <pause dur="0.4"/> or for or reasons to do with the the quality of diagnosis in the laboratory or whatever <pause dur="0.3"/> so as a professional biologist you will always be using a daybook <pause dur="0.3"/> so get into the habit of using it properly now <pause dur="1.4"/> okay <pause dur="0.2"/> next point <pause dur="0.7"/><kinesic desc="indicates point on board" iterated="n"/> that i want to talk about <pause dur="0.3"/> is the reports <pause dur="0.7"/> now i won't remind you of the biblical story about hiding your light under a bushel <pause dur="0.3"/> if you have done the most marvellous experimental work discovered the most important things in science <pause dur="0.3"/> but don't report it <pause dur="0.4"/> in a clear fashion so that other people can understand it <pause dur="0.3"/> you have been wasting your time <pause dur="0.5"/> so the importance of the report is communication <pause dur="0.5"/> if you don't write a good report you really are wasting your time <pause dur="0.5"/> okay <pause dur="0.3"/> now <pause dur="0.3"/> we <pause dur="0.2"/> want to train you again <pause dur="0.5"/> # in developing and producing a professional <pause dur="0.3"/> style <pause dur="0.5"/> report <pause dur="0.4"/> we model the laboratory reports on a scientific paper <pause dur="0.3"/> that is the way in which professional scientists report their work in the scientific literature <pause dur="0.6"/> now 
this <pause dur="0.2"/> style of reporting is probably rather different from the style of writing up experiments that you've learned at school <pause dur="0.4"/> we have to <pause dur="0.4"/> encourage you <pause dur="0.3"/> to unlearn <pause dur="0.2"/> what you've learned at school <pause dur="0.3"/> and relearn <pause dur="0.3"/> what you will do <pause dur="0.2"/> as a professional biologist <pause dur="0.4"/> so i <pause dur="0.2"/> sincerely hope that you have all read <pause dur="0.3"/> what is in the manual <pause dur="0.3"/> about how to write a report <pause dur="0.3"/> and i will repeatedly over the next few weeks <pause dur="0.3"/> be <pause dur="0.2"/> alluding to how to present your data and how to write the report because it is so important <pause dur="0.3"/> it's one of those transferable skills that i referred to at the beginning <pause dur="0.6"/> so we lay out the report <pause dur="0.5"/> fairly formally <pause dur="0.4"/> # as <pause dur="0.2"/> with a starting off with a summary which is a summary of the whole of your report <pause dur="0.6"/> all of it <pause dur="1.1"/> then the introduction the importance of the introduction is to set the background to the experimental work you're going to be describing a little bit of description <pause dur="0.3"/> of <pause dur="0.3"/> previously understood facts or whatever <pause dur="0.5"/> then you # <pause dur="0.2"/> bring in a section which is <pause dur="0.4"/> talking about your methodology <pause dur="0.3"/> 
now in general <pause dur="0.3"/> your methodology section in these reports doesn't need to be very long <pause dur="0.3"/> because as you know <pause dur="0.3"/> the methodology is all written down in in the green manual <pause dur="0.3"/> and there's no point <vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/> no point at all <pause dur="0.3"/> in your copying out chunks of the green manual <pause dur="0.2"/> into your report <pause dur="0.3"/> so don't if there is material that's in the green manual <pause dur="0.3"/> just refer to the green manual <pause dur="0.3"/> for example <pause dur="0.2"/> methods were carried out <pause dur="0.2"/> just exactly as in the manual <pause dur="0.4"/> and <pause dur="0.3"/> nothing to add <pause dur="0.3"/> but <pause dur="0.5"/> if you do actually design <pause dur="0.3"/> a little bit of <trunc>i</trunc> # methodology yourself which you will be expected to do to do increasingly <pause dur="0.4"/> or if the methodology is varied from what's in the green book <pause dur="0.4"/> obviously you do need to point out in the in in your <pause dur="0.2"/> # report <pause dur="0.2"/> that you have changed that bit of methodology or developed that bit of <trunc>methodo</trunc> <pause dur="0.3"/> methodology or invented whatever that methodology <pause dur="0.6"/> okay <pause dur="0.5"/> now <pause dur="0.5"/> the next section of your report is the one that is really vital <pause dur="0.6"/> it is <pause dur="0.3"/> results <pause dur="0.2"/> your observation <pause dur="0.3"/> what 
you have discovered from the experiments you have done <pause dur="0.5"/> now <pause dur="0.6"/> very many <trunc>st</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> students actually <pause dur="0.3"/> tend to skimp on this section <trunc>a</trunc> and write it very briefly perhaps they just present a table of data <pause dur="0.3"/> or a diagram and say these are the results full stop <pause dur="0.4"/> that is not adequate <pause dur="0.3"/> in your results section what you have to do is say in words in good concise literate scientific English <pause dur="0.3"/> say <pause dur="0.2"/> what you have observed <pause dur="0.6"/> and you use your diagrams your figures <pause dur="0.3"/> to support and illustrate <pause dur="0.3"/> what you have said in words <pause dur="0.2"/> so <pause dur="0.2"/> what <pause dur="0.2"/> i am trying to put over is that your results section must be an integration <pause dur="0.4"/> of <pause dur="0.6"/> English language description of what you've done <pause dur="0.3"/> and <pause dur="0.6"/> diagrams and figures <pause dur="0.2"/> which support your description this is very important to work the diagrams and your text together <pause dur="0.8"/> okay <pause dur="0.5"/> now <pause dur="0.2"/> what do you report <pause dur="0.3"/> very often people say to me well you know i haven't really <trunc>s</trunc> <pause dur="0.3"/> observed very much <pause dur="0.2"/> i can't there's not much to say <pause dur="0.6"/> # in fact in all these practicals these practicals that we're 
running initially <pause dur="0.4"/> are fairly simple and straightforward practicals and there's not <pause dur="0.2"/> one <pause dur="0.3"/> hell of a bundle of stuff that you can report <pause dur="0.3"/> but very often people leave out <pause dur="0.3"/> quite important little observations which actually are <pause dur="0.2"/> germane germinal whatever <pause dur="0.4"/> to to your observations to to your to your experiment <pause dur="1.1"/> and i shall bring those up as they come around can't talk about them in in advance 'cause that would of course be giving the game away <pause dur="0.7"/> so <pause dur="0.3"/> your results report <pause dur="0.3"/> your observations <pause dur="0.4"/> and finally <pause dur="0.5"/> your discussions <pause dur="0.3"/> or conclusions whatever you like to call it <pause dur="0.3"/> what that section really must do <pause dur="0.2"/> is trying to draw out <pause dur="0.3"/> of your experimental work <pause dur="0.3"/> whatever new findings you have <pause dur="0.3"/> and relate them back to the background material <pause dur="0.3"/> you have presented in your introduction so that you go around the full circle <pause dur="1.2"/> now what i've been doing is really <pause dur="0.3"/> describing the ideal <pause dur="0.4"/> # and <pause dur="0.2"/> until you get a little bit more advanced as an experimental biologist <pause dur="0.4"/> # perhaps there won't be so 
much to say <pause dur="0.4"/> don't worry about that but there is always something to say and that's something i shall be coming back to <pause dur="0.3"/> repeatedly <pause dur="0.4"/> so this skill <pause dur="0.5"/> of <pause dur="0.2"/> writing a scientific report <pause dur="0.3"/> is something that <pause dur="0.2"/> we hope very much will develop <pause dur="0.3"/> over the next <pause dur="0.3"/> weeks <pause dur="1.1"/> sooner the better <pause dur="0.4"/> i reckon <pause dur="1.4"/> so let me just go on <pause dur="0.3"/><vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/> briefly to talk about <pause dur="0.3"/> personal computers P-Cs <pause dur="0.6"/><vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.2"/> as you have noticed <pause dur="0.7"/><vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/> excuse me <pause dur="1.2"/> around the university there are there are plenty of # I-B-M style P-Cs for your use <pause dur="0.3"/> there is in the room above this about twenty P-Cs <pause dur="0.3"/> which obviously <pause dur="0.2"/> are are for your use when <pause dur="0.2"/> when in in the laboratory <pause dur="0.3"/> and there are other rooms around the university <pause dur="0.8"/> you have to get used to using P-Cs to do your work on <pause dur="0.2"/> now <pause dur="0.3"/> i'm quite sure that nearly or most of you <pause dur="0.2"/> are already very familiar <pause dur="0.2"/> # with using I-B-M style P-Cs <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> i'm quite sure that everybody in the room <pause dur="0.3"/> let me let me just check <pause dur="0.2"/> 
is there anybody that's never used <pause dur="0.2"/> a personal computer <pause dur="0.9"/> no <pause dur="0.5"/> course not <pause dur="0.9"/> are there people here who <pause dur="0.4"/> # prefer to work with Macs if so hard luck sorry <pause dur="0.6"/> 'cause you'll have to work with P-Cs 'cause that's what the university uses <pause dur="0.5"/> now <pause dur="0.4"/> most of you as i as i'm quite sure will be fairly familiar with P-Cs but there will be a few of you <pause dur="0.4"/> who are not that familiar <pause dur="0.3"/> or <pause dur="0.3"/> perhaps having been brought up on Macs don't really understand P-Cs don't worry <pause dur="0.3"/> we have help in store <pause dur="0.4"/> as you know <pause dur="0.3"/> the information technology # whatever they call themselves <pause dur="0.2"/> # unit <pause dur="0.3"/> down the road there <pause dur="0.3"/> publish <pause dur="0.4"/> useful <pause dur="0.3"/> guidebooks <pause dur="0.4"/> # to the <pause dur="0.3"/> to the software that we have <pause dur="0.4"/> but more immediately <pause dur="0.4"/> <gap reason="name" extent="2 words"/> <pause dur="0.3"/> the one member <pause dur="0.4"/> who is not going to be in the lab <pause dur="1.2"/> will be the guy <pause dur="0.2"/> who's going to be in the P-C room upstairs <pause dur="0.3"/> waiting for people to come along asking for help <pause dur="0.5"/> he is <pause dur="0.3"/> an expert <pause dur="0.4"/> he knows everything there is to be known about Microsoft and P-Cs and things like that <pause dur="0.4"/> so if you are uncertain how to use Excel to 
draw diagrams uncertain how to use <pause dur="0.4"/> the World Wide Web <pause dur="0.3"/> to get useful scientific information or anything like that <pause dur="0.3"/> go and talk to <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> in the P-C room <pause dur="0.3"/> he'll be there basically from eleven o'clock to three o'clock <pause dur="0.2"/> with a lunch break <pause dur="0.9"/> okay <pause dur="1.6"/> now <pause dur="1.2"/> next <pause dur="0.7"/> point <pause dur="0.5"/> extremely <pause dur="0.4"/><kinesic desc="indicates point on board" iterated="n"/> important point that i want to make <pause dur="0.3"/> is this issue of safety <pause dur="0.6"/> # as <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> <pause dur="0.2"/> pointed out when we talked previously <pause dur="0.4"/> we haven't yet lost permanently <pause dur="0.2"/> an undergraduate through an accident in the laboratory <pause dur="0.3"/> and we never want that to happen obviously <pause dur="0.3"/> there have been occasions where people have been injured <pause dur="0.3"/> and have been hurt quite badly <pause dur="0.3"/> # so <pause dur="0.3"/> we have to be sure <pause dur="0.2"/> have to be very careful <pause dur="0.3"/> # that you are aware of <trunc>s</trunc> <trunc>ri</trunc> safety hazards risks in the laboratory <pause dur="1.2"/> now i do actually <pause dur="0.3"/> formally <pause dur="0.3"/> have to <pause dur="0.3"/> ask you <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/><vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.6"/> well <pause dur="0.9"/> let me go through in order i've got a number of points written down <pause dur="0.3"/> there is one absolute rule for insurance reasons <pause dur="0.3"/>

students here <pause dur="0.3"/> forty pairs we have twenty-something P-H meters <pause dur="0.3"/> i'm sorry about that <pause dur="0.3"/> # the university just couldn't <pause dur="0.3"/> would not countenance <pause dur="0.4"/> # buying forty P-H meters to be used on two two days in the year <pause dur="0.9"/> now this is a problem which scientists all the time are facing they never have enough equipment enough apparatus they never have the most recent piece <pause dur="0.8"/> they always have to go and cadge borrow and share <pause dur="0.7"/> and so that's <pause dur="0.5"/> an important principle that you're <shift feature="voice" new="laugh"/>going <shift feature="voice" new="normal"/>to learn <pause dur="0.4"/> is that you're going to have to <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> share apparatus with other people share equipment particularly P-H meters today <pause dur="0.4"/> so what you will find is that the quick ones will have grabbed the P-H meters <pause dur="0.3"/> the slow ones <pause dur="0.3"/> will be without P-H meters <pause dur="0.7"/> don't despair be patient <pause dur="0.2"/> there are always other things that you can be doing <pause dur="0.2"/> whilst waiting for the P-H meter to become available <pause dur="0.3"/> there are solutions to make up <pause dur="0.4"/> there are daybooks to write up <pause dur="0.6"/> there will be in following weeks <pause dur="0.2"/> # your reports to discuss with
