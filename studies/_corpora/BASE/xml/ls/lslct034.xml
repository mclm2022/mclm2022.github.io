original recordings are held at the Universities of Warwick and Reading, and

other things like proteins some of which are big <pause dur="0.5"/> and some of which are small like albumin <pause dur="1.2"/> but they're bigger than a certain critical pore size <pause dur="1.0"/> and they come <kinesic desc="indicates point on board" iterated="n"/> piling down here <pause dur="0.3"/> and meet the sieve <pause dur="0.8"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> generally speaking they don't get through <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="2"/> and what does get through <pause dur="2.5"/> so proteins and cells don't get through but what does get through </u><u who="sm0585" trans="latching"> ions </u><pause dur="0.3"/> <u who="ss" trans="pause"> ions </u><u who="nm0572" trans="overlap"> ions such as </u><pause dur="0.4"/> <u who="ss" trans="pause"> sodium </u><u who="nm0572" trans="overlap"> sodium <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="6"/> potassium phosphate and all the rest of it <pause dur="0.6"/> most of which are then reabsorbed <pause dur="0.4"/> some of which are then secreted at various points <pause dur="0.4"/> sodium is almost completely reabsorbed ninety-eight per cent of it <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="1.0"/> at various stages in the <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> proximal and distal convoluted tubule <pause dur="0.7"/> # and the cells just <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="2"/> go back again down the medical student's bit <pause dur="0.5"/> # and and just go round again <pause dur="1.0"/>

blood <pause dur="0.3"/> glomerular filtrate and urine <pause dur="0.4"/> and it's got to get through the wall <pause dur="1.1"/> and so it has to go through <pause dur="1.0"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="3"/> the <pause dur="0.3"/> endothelium the basement membrane and the epithelium <pause dur="1.1"/> and this will be true whether it's a blood vessel or whether it's a tubule in a kidney or most tubes in the body <pause dur="0.4"/> it's got to get through there <pause dur="0.8"/> and normally what happens is it doesn't get through it <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="1"/> and it all comes back again all the cells and the proteins <pause dur="0.6"/> but in glomerular disease and diabetes it's it's it's the classic cause of glomerular disease <pause dur="0.4"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="1"/> you get <shift feature="voice" new="mimicking northern English accent"/>trouble at t'mill <shift feature="voice" new="normal"/> <pause dur="0.8"/> and something happens <pause dur="0.3"/> probably <pause dur="0.2"/> to the basement membrane <pause dur="1.1"/> but in other glomerular diseases other bits of it go wrong <pause dur="0.7"/> such as <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="5"/> in minimal change nephropathy the podocytes get defaced or knocked off <pause dur="0.6"/> either way something happens <pause dur="0.3"/> to the wall <pause dur="0.3"/> of the glomerulus <pause dur="1.4"/> and i think it's better not to think of

tea a day you only drink four-hundred mls a day your urine will be concentrated <pause dur="0.3"/> so that will immediately shift all your <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="1"/> values down a bit <pause dur="1.2"/> so depending on how much you drink it affects the sensitivity of the test <pause dur="1.7"/> that's why you can't say 'cause it measures the concentration <pause dur="0.3"/> that that is equivalent to X <pause dur="0.4"/> amount of proteinuria for twenty-four hours and that's equivalent to Y <pause dur="1.0"/> but roughly speaking <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> what we would normally say is a trace <pause dur="0.3"/> you don't necessarily have to investigate but <pause dur="0.2"/> one plus <pause dur="0.3"/> or more of proteinuria you should investigate <pause dur="0.5"/> and <pause dur="0.5"/> <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="7"/> some people say <pause dur="1.3"/> that you start to get one plus when you have greater than three-hundred milligrams per twenty-four hours <pause dur="1.3"/> in other words <pause dur="0.2"/> there are levels of proteinuria which are biologically significant in the difference between <kinesic desc="indicates point on board" iterated="n"/> these two numbers <pause dur="0.3"/> which are missed by a urinary dipstick <pause dur="0.7"/> so in other words <pause dur="0.2"/> you get false positives <pause dur="0.4"/> and you get false negatives <pause dur="0.7"/> # with 
urinary dipsticks <pause dur="0.8"/> false positives <pause dur="0.3"/> because there are non-renal diseases such as pyrexia <pause dur="0.2"/> such as pregnancy such as heart failure <pause dur="0.2"/> various <trunc>hydy</trunc> hyperdynamic <pause dur="0.3"/> states <pause dur="0.3"/> which will give you a trace of proteinuria so <kinesic desc="indicates point on board" iterated="n"/> that's a false positive <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> a false negative <pause dur="0.3"/> is when you miss <pause dur="0.2"/> important <pause dur="0.4"/> biological levels of proteinuria which a dipstick said was a trace <pause dur="0.3"/> and was normal <pause dur="0.5"/> and if the patient happened to drink a bit less it would <trunc>the</trunc> then have become positive <pause dur="1.0"/> but nonetheless <pause dur="0.5"/> it's not a bad screening test <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> and <pause dur="0.6"/> i hope you don't take those words away from you <pause dur="0.2"/> those of you who are going to be G-Ps <pause dur="0.4"/> and # <pause dur="0.3"/> think for the rest of your lives <pause dur="0.3"/> as many G-Ps do when your patient is apparently well has normal blood pressure a normal creatinine and a normal dipstick they don't have <pause dur="0.3"/> renal disease <pause dur="0.2"/> they could easily have polycystic kidney disease <pause dur="0.4"/> there are lots of renal diseases that don't give you <pause dur="0.3"/> normal blood pressure normal <pause dur="0.3"/> # dipstick <pause dur="0.3"/> normal creatinine <pause dur="0.3"/> and that
