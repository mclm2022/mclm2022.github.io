<u who="nf0273"><kinesic desc="projector is on showing slide" iterated="n"/> okay you might notice a slight difference between <pause dur="0.2"/> # this week and last week that's because i am not <gap reason="name" extent="2 words"/> <pause dur="0.8"/> i'm <gap reason="name" extent="2 words"/> i'm a lecturer in medical statistics and i'm doing today's lecture and the next Sources of Variation lecture <pause dur="1.7"/> # first of all a couple of things i realize you've got a lecture at quarter past one <pause dur="0.5"/> so i will be trying to keep to time <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> bear with me <pause dur="0.7"/> the other thing to say <pause dur="0.2"/> is that <pause dur="0.2"/> the # guest lecture from <gap reason="name" extent="2 words"/> <pause dur="0.2"/> is being swapped with Sources of Variation Three <pause dur="0.8"/> so <gap reason="name" extent="2 words"/> was on the twenty-seventh and <trunc>sorc</trunc> Sources of Variation was on the twentieth <pause dur="0.4"/> they're now going to be swapped so <gap reason="name" extent="2 words"/> will be on the twentieth and Sources of Variation Three will be on the twenty-seventh <pause dur="2.3"/> okay so <pause dur="0.5"/> sources of variation <pause dur="1.9"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> hurray <pause dur="0.4"/> the slide changed over <pause dur="1.0"/> the informal <pause dur="0.7"/> objectives of this lecture are to enable you to distinguish between <pause dur="0.2"/> observed data and underlying tendencies which give rise to observed data <pause dur="0.9"/> and to understand the concept of variation 
and randomness <pause dur="1.5"/> # you have some examples in your lecture notes on page a hundred <pause dur="0.6"/> # for example we might observe the proportion of people with diabetes in a sample <pause dur="0.6"/> and that would give us an idea of the underlying <trunc>prev</trunc> prevalence of diabetes in a particular population <pause dur="1.7"/> another example would be breast cancer survival we might observe the proportion surviving who were treated with tamoxifen <pause dur="0.6"/> whereas what we're actually interested in is the effect of survival on treating everybody <pause dur="0.2"/> with tamoxifen <pause dur="0.4"/> if they have breast cancer <pause dur="2.7"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> so that gives you an idea <pause dur="0.6"/> quickly of the difference between observed data and underlying tendencies <pause dur="0.3"/> which give rise to data <pause dur="0.8"/> objective two of understanding concepts of sources of variation and randomness <pause dur="0.6"/> i would hope that <pause dur="0.2"/> most of us have a <pause dur="0.7"/> fairly good appreciation that we're all different without really thinking about it <pause dur="1.1"/> the reason this kind of thing is important to take into account <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> is basically when we're planning for # <pause dur="0.9"/> predicting for 
the future say for example for providing flu jabs <pause dur="1.2"/> we can observe the number of cases of flu per year in the last five years <pause dur="0.7"/> and we wouldn't be surprised <pause dur="0.2"/> to see that those numbers in the last five years were different year on year <pause dur="0.7"/> wouldn't surprise us at all <pause dur="0.9"/> # we we should all be <pause dur="0.6"/> fairly fairly competent at realizing that <pause dur="0.6"/> the number of cases of flu would depend on various factors in a very complex manner <pause dur="0.5"/> and simply because of the <pause dur="0.2"/> the fact that we're all different anyway <pause dur="0.4"/> there'd be a natural variation <pause dur="0.2"/> component in that <pause dur="5.5"/> so <pause dur="0.9"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> the formal objectives of this lecture <pause dur="0.4"/> <vocal desc="sniff" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.3"/> is first that you should be able to distinguish between observed epidemiological quantities such as incidence prevalence incident rate ratio things like that <pause dur="0.7"/> and their true or underlying values <pause dur="1.5"/> and you ought to be able to discuss how observed epidemiological quantities depart from true values <pause dur="0.2"/> because of random 
variation <pause dur="1.5"/> unless we have large resources and can measure absolutely everybody <pause dur="0.2"/> in a particular population we're interested in <pause dur="0.7"/> we'll only ever see <pause dur="0.2"/> an observed proportion of people with diabetes say <pause dur="1.6"/> and that may or may not be equal to the true prevalence of diabetes in our <trunc>sa</trunc> in our population <pause dur="0.8"/> but if we selected our sample properly <pause dur="0.3"/> then that ought to give us a fairly good idea <pause dur="0.2"/> of the basic prevalence of diabetes in the population <pause dur="1.7"/> but that basic idea will vary <pause dur="0.2"/> because of natural variation <pause dur="0.7"/> so consequently we want to be able to say something about <pause dur="0.4"/> how our basic idea of prevalence <pause dur="0.4"/> will vary in reality <pause dur="0.7"/> an idea of the scale of the variation will help us with that <pause dur="4.8"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> and statistical theory will help us to do that <pause dur="0.7"/> objective three we want to be able to describe how observed values help us towards a knowledge of the true values <pause dur="0.9"/> and there are two basic statistical ways of doing that certainly in this module at least <pause dur="0.8"/> the first is to test a hypothesis about a 
true value <pause dur="0.6"/> and that's what we'll be dealing with in this lecture <pause dur="0.9"/> and the second is to calculate a range <pause dur="0.2"/> in which that true value <pause dur="0.3"/> probably lies <pause dur="3.2"/> so <pause dur="0.7"/> today we'll just be talking about hypothesis tests <pause dur="1.7"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> just have a quick drink <pause dur="4.5"/> <event desc="drinks" iterated="n"/> so say we're interested for some reason <pause dur="0.7"/> in the probability of getting a head when we flip a coin <pause dur="1.3"/> so the obvious thing to do do a quick experiment flip the coin ten times <pause dur="0.7"/> see what happens <pause dur="0.8"/> suppose we observe seven heads and three tails <pause dur="1.0"/> then informally we could <trunc>m</trunc> draw several conclusions from that observation given our prior belief <pause dur="0.2"/> about <pause dur="0.3"/> the probability of the coin <pause dur="0.4"/> falling on heads <pause dur="1.8"/> first of all <pause dur="0.4"/> we might suspect that our data was wrong <pause dur="0.3"/> it happens <pause dur="0.7"/> # censuses get miscounted for <pause dur="0.2"/> various reasons <pause dur="1.5"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> another thing could be that we could have artefact which <pause dur="0.7"/> isn't very easy to illustrate in the example of tossing a coin so i'll give you another one <pause dur="1.0"/> if we look at how # deaths from diabetes change with time i believe 
we were discussing that in a <pause dur="0.3"/> couple of lectures ago <pause dur="1.6"/> one of the things that altered <pause dur="0.2"/> the number of deaths <pause dur="0.2"/> <trunc>o</trunc> from diabetes with time <pause dur="0.5"/> was altering the definition of diabetes <pause dur="1.6"/> that had an # an effect on the conclusions that we made about the change in deaths <pause dur="0.6"/> and that is generally known as artefact <pause dur="2.1"/> # another conclusion we might draw is it's just chance <pause dur="0.2"/> the coin's fair we're expecting five heads we've seen seven <pause dur="0.3"/> it's not all that surprising <pause dur="0.6"/> we just put it down to chance and <pause dur="0.4"/> conclude that our coin is fair <pause dur="1.5"/> on the other hand if we're feeling particularly cynical <pause dur="0.5"/> we might conclude that the coin is biased <pause dur="0.5"/> it's difficult to tell seven is that different from five or not <pause dur="1.2"/> we don't know <pause dur="7.1"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> so that provides a simple example <pause dur="0.3"/> of what we observe not being exactly what we expected <pause dur="0.2"/> if we toss a coin ten times we expect five heads given that it's fair <pause dur="0.7"/> but we observe seven <pause dur="1.5"/> the coin will tend to produce an equal number of heads and an equal number of tails <pause dur="0.8"/> but <pause dur="0.2"/> we're not surprised when 
random variation means that we observe something slightly different <pause dur="1.3"/> and <pause dur="0.4"/> similarly it's no surprising that the health of people varies <pause dur="0.7"/> on average four cases of meningitis per month in Leicester some some months we observe ten other months we observe none <pause dur="0.7"/> nobody's terribly surprised about that <pause dur="1.4"/> again smokers tend to be less healthy than non-smokers but <pause dur="0.4"/> if we pick a small sample <pause dur="0.5"/> then we might for some reason have ended up picking healthy smokers <pause dur="0.4"/> just down to chance <pause dur="6.4"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> so tendency versus observations <pause dur="1.5"/> what we practically want to know <pause dur="0.6"/> <vocal desc="sniff" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.8"/> is <pause dur="0.3"/> what is going to happen in the future <pause dur="0.4"/> what are the underlying tendencies of health <pause dur="0.3"/> in our population <pause dur="1.5"/> for example # providing for our flu jabs we want to plan <pause dur="0.7"/> to buy enough flu jabs <pause dur="0.2"/> to vaccinate at least most people at risk in our population <pause dur="1.1"/> we need the underlying tendency of that population <pause dur="0.2"/> to <pause dur="0.2"/> being at risk at flu <pause dur="0.8"/> of flu <pause dur="0.3"/> from flu <pause dur="0.2"/> even <pause dur="1.1"/> so we might take the number of <pause dur="0.2"/> # cases of 
flu <pause dur="0.2"/> in the previous years <pause dur="1.0"/> and logically we might also use any other information that we know to have a bearing on the number of cases of flu <pause dur="0.2"/> that we observe so <pause dur="0.4"/> temperature would be an obvious one <pause dur="0.9"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> the underlying health of the general population <pause dur="0.7"/> but that's slightly more difficult to to quantify <pause dur="0.9"/> so we would take what we've observed in the past <pause dur="0.5"/> and what we know to have a bearing <pause dur="0.2"/> on our probability of someone having flu <pause dur="0.6"/> and try and use it to predict the future <pause dur="4.3"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> so <pause dur="1.0"/> some further examples of <pause dur="0.6"/> attempts <pause dur="0.3"/> # of of the differences between <pause dur="0.4"/> the underlying tendency being related to the observed data <pause dur="0.9"/> if we're <sic corr="interested">interesteded</sic> for some bizarre artificial reason of the proportion of red marbles in a bag with a thousand red and black ones <pause dur="0.8"/> then we could count all thousand marbles <pause dur="0.2"/> and <pause dur="0.3"/> we would know exactly <pause dur="0.2"/> what the underlying proportion was <pause dur="1.1"/> our underlying tendency <pause dur="0.9"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> but obviously we don't have all day and 
we're not particularly interested in counting marbles <pause dur="0.4"/> so we could just take a sample <pause dur="0.3"/> and measure the proportion of reds <pause dur="0.4"/> in <pause dur="0.2"/> that sample that we pick at random <pause dur="0.9"/> if we pick the sample sufficiently well <pause dur="0.5"/> and sufficiently large we'll have a fairly good idea <pause dur="0.2"/> of what the proportion of reds is in the bag <pause dur="1.2"/> similarly we can't ask everybody how they voted in the general election <pause dur="0.8"/> but <pause dur="0.4"/> we ought to be intuitively <pause dur="0.2"/> # confident <pause dur="0.4"/> that asking a thousand people how they voted assuming they didn't lie to us <pause dur="0.7"/> # that we have a fairly good idea <pause dur="0.2"/> of the result of the election <pause dur="1.3"/> and again <pause dur="0.5"/> we're interested in the total number of Leicester diabetic patients who have foot problems <pause dur="0.7"/> so instead of asking all Leicester diabetic <trunc>pr</trunc> patients how their feet are <pause dur="0.4"/> we would just take # a random sample we don't have all day <pause dur="0.4"/> we don't have infinite time we don't have infinite money <pause dur="3.5"/> so if we have an idea of the underlying tendency of diabetes in a population <pause dur="0.6"/> then 
we can predict <pause dur="0.2"/> what we may reasonably observe <pause dur="0.2"/> using probability theory <pause dur="3.0"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> a further example <pause dur="0.4"/> # working out the provision of neonatal intensive care cots <pause dur="1.5"/> we know from the past <pause dur="0.3"/> data <pause dur="0.6"/> that the true requirement in nineteen-ninety-two <pause dur="0.7"/> was about one cot per thousand live births per year <pause dur="1.7"/> and we also know from the past <pause dur="0.5"/> that we observe about twelve-thousand live births per year <pause dur="0.8"/> so on average we'll need about twelve-thousand neonatal intensive cots per year <pause dur="0.6"/> that's the true tendency <pause dur="0.7"/> we've taken a lot of data <pause dur="0.8"/> and <pause dur="0.4"/> measured what we're interested in <pause dur="0.9"/> and that's what we've ended up <pause dur="0.6"/> with <pause dur="1.2"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> however just knowing the average <pause dur="0.5"/> isn't enough we need to know an idea of how it all varies <pause dur="1.0"/> the # slide shows the <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.8"/> requirement of neonatal intensive care <pause dur="0.3"/> <sic corr="cots">costs</sic> in the past <pause dur="0.7"/> you can see that it varies quite a lot <pause dur="1.0"/> it gives us an idea of the variation in the need for a <trunc>neo</trunc> neonatal intensive care cots in the past <pause dur="0.8"/> this is what we've observed in the past not where it what we're <pause dur="0.4"/> 
expecting in the future yet <pause dur="2.0"/> and it has quite a large range <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> we've in the past we've required between two and twenty-four neonatal intensive care cots <pause dur="1.2"/> and most of the time <pause dur="0.2"/> we needed between about eight and sixteen cots <pause dur="1.1"/> so if we provided twelve if we'd just gone with the average and ignored the variation <pause dur="0.5"/> then quite a lot of the time <pause dur="0.4"/> we'd be up to about four cots short <pause dur="1.6"/> so we need an appreciation of the variation <pause dur="2.8"/><vocal desc="sniff" iterated="n"/><pause dur="1.0"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> slide eleven <pause dur="0.2"/> a slight repeat <pause dur="1.4"/> neonatal intensive care cots we often observe eight to six <trunc>c</trunc> # <pause dur="0.2"/> eight to sixteen cots <pause dur="0.2"/> being used <pause dur="0.8"/> and on one day per month more having done some <pause dur="0.2"/> mildly complex calculations using the data in that histogram <pause dur="1.4"/> we needed nineteen or more cots <pause dur="0.8"/> and on one per cent of the days we needed twenty-one <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> cots <pause dur="0.7"/> hardly ever did we need more than twenty-four <pause dur="1.7"/> so logically we provided <pause dur="0.2"/> we <trunc>w</trunc> we looked at <pause dur="0.2"/> that data and thought right let's provide nineteen cots <pause dur="0.7"/> and on average about twelve were occupied so we had sixty-three per 
cent <pause dur="0.4"/> of those nineteen cots occupied <pause dur="0.2"/> usually <pause dur="1.7"/> now that was taking <pause dur="0.4"/> data from our true distribution <pause dur="0.4"/> which we'd observed over a certain period of time in the past <pause dur="0.8"/> and used it to # work out what we would expect to see <pause dur="1.4"/> but in practice what we want to do is entirely the other way round we want to observe something <pause dur="0.3"/> and make an inference about what we expect to see in the future <pause dur="1.3"/> we want to reverse the direction of inference from the observed distribution <pause dur="0.4"/> to the true tendency <pause dur="1.8"/> given what we observe what we might <pause dur="0.2"/> what might we expect to happen <pause dur="0.2"/> in the future <pause dur="5.4"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> and hypothesis tests <pause dur="0.2"/> allows us to do this in a formal way <pause dur="1.5"/> we can take the observed data <pause dur="0.4"/> and make an objective statement about <pause dur="0.4"/> the # true situation <pause dur="0.5"/> we can use we can describe how the observed values will help us towards a knowledge of the true values by testing our hypothesis <pause dur="7.1"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> so formally <pause dur="0.4"/> a hypothesis is a statement <pause dur="0.4"/> that an underlying tendency of scientific interest <pause dur="0.3"/> takes a particular quantitative value <pause dur="3.0"/> we have 
to state our beliefs in a quantitative way <pause dur="0.3"/> in order to use <pause dur="0.2"/> quantitative methods <pause dur="1.5"/> and on the slide are some examples of hypotheses that we might test <pause dur="0.9"/> so first of all we might say that the coin is fair but to put that in a quantitative way <pause dur="0.4"/> we have to put a value on the probability of a head <pause dur="1.3"/> so if the coin is fair <pause dur="0.3"/> we'd expect to see # heads about half the time <pause dur="0.7"/> and that is equivalent to saying that the probability of a head is a half <pause dur="2.0"/> if we want to say that a new drug is no better than a standard treatment then we would compare the survival rates by calculating the ratio <pause dur="1.1"/> if the new drug is no better then the survival rates we would expect to be equal and consequently the ratio would be equal to one <pause dur="2.1"/> and again <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> if we want to make a statement about the true prevalence of tuberculosis in a given population <pause dur="1.5"/> then we have to put a value on that we may observe from the past that it would be two in ten-thousand <pause dur="0.5"/> and use that as our <trunc>help</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> <trunc>h</trunc> our hypothesis to test <pause dur="0.2"/> so 
we're stating our beliefs <pause dur="0.4"/> which may be <pause dur="0.3"/> possibly informal <pause dur="0.5"/> in a formal quantitative way <pause dur="0.4"/> in order to use quantitative methods <pause dur="5.6"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> so now we have our hypothesis what can we do with it <pause dur="1.3"/> say # we have the hypothesis that our success rate for aneurysm repair <pause dur="0.2"/> is eighty per cent <pause dur="0.9"/> and we observe what happens to say six patients who have <pause dur="0.2"/> an aneurysm repaired <pause dur="1.5"/> we need to use what we observe about those six patients to test that hypothesis <pause dur="0.4"/> that the success rate is about eighty per cent <pause dur="0.5"/> is eighty per cent <pause dur="1.6"/> now informally if we had observed <pause dur="0.2"/> # one death in a in those six patients <pause dur="0.9"/> then # <pause dur="0.3"/> we could be reasonably confident <pause dur="0.3"/> of a difference from eighty per cent <pause dur="0.4"/> because that's quite an <trunc>obstre</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> extreme observation <pause dur="1.1"/> if we observe four or five in six <pause dur="0.7"/> then we would be unsure what to conclude because the proportion of four or five out of six <pause dur="0.4"/> is <pause dur="0.2"/> quite close to eighty per cent <pause dur="0.2"/> we're not totally sure <pause dur="1.8"/> so that would give us an informal idea <pause dur="0.7"/> but we want <pause dur="0.2"/> a way of objectively 
distinguishing <pause dur="0.8"/> the instances where our # our observed data is <pause dur="0.2"/> slightly different from our expected data <pause dur="0.2"/> our our null hypothesis <pause dur="0.8"/> from the situations where we have <pause dur="0.3"/> # data which is different from our null hypothesis and constant <pause dur="0.2"/> consequently quite extreme <pause dur="0.6"/> and hypothesis testing <pause dur="0.4"/> allows us to do that objectively <pause dur="2.6"/> so it allows us to compare consistently what we observe <pause dur="0.4"/> with what is actually happening what we think is happening <pause dur="9.6"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> so formally <pause dur="1.2"/> in a hypothesis test <pause dur="0.3"/> we <reading>calculate the probability of getting an <trunc>ar</trunc> an observation as as extreme as <pause dur="0.5"/> or more extreme <pause dur="0.6"/> than the one observed <pause dur="0.2"/> if the stated hypothesis was true</reading> <pause dur="1.4"/> we have our stated hypothesis <pause dur="0.5"/> in a quantitative <pause dur="0.5"/> fashion <pause dur="0.8"/> and we can make some probability statement about that <pause dur="0.7"/> which we can then use to calculate the probability <pause dur="0.2"/> of our observed data <pause dur="1.3"/> the idea is that <pause dur="0.2"/> if what we observe is very unlikely <pause dur="0.8"/> then <pause dur="0.2"/> the probability will be very small <pause dur="1.3"/> so if the probability is very small <pause dur="1.1"/> then either <pause dur="0.5"/> under the null hypothesis something very

really thinking <pause dur="1.0"/> # <pause dur="2.0"/> this is <pause dur="1.5"/> the <trunc>pr</trunc> the quantitative statement about our <trunc>tr</trunc> our prior beliefs <pause dur="1.1"/> so for example <pause dur="0.3"/> if we're supposing that death rates from # <pause dur="0.4"/> a disease on treatment A and treatment B <pause dur="0.6"/> were the same <pause dur="0.6"/> then we would calculate the ratio of the death rates <pause dur="0.5"/> to be <pause dur="0.3"/> # one <pause dur="1.3"/> that would be our null hypothesis we would then observe data and <pause dur="0.3"/> calculate the <pause dur="0.2"/> probability of what we observed occurring <pause dur="1.7"/> for example again the prevalence # in in Warwickshire of a particular disease is the same in Leicestershire another example of a null hypothesis <pause dur="2.3"/> and <pause dur="1.2"/> P being less than or equal to point-nought-five <pause dur="0.4"/> <trunc>s</trunc> is substantial evidence against the hypothesis being tested <pause dur="0.8"/> not that it's definitely false <pause dur="0.4"/> it means what we've observed is unlikely <pause dur="0.2"/> given what we think <pause dur="0.4"/> not that the hypothesis is untrue <pause dur="2.1"/> again by the same token <pause dur="0.4"/> P being greater than point-nought-five <pause dur="0.7"/> is that the data is not inconsistent <pause dur="0.6"/> with the # <pause dur="0.5"/> hypothesis <pause dur="0.4"/> that means that there's not much evidence against 
the <trunc>hy</trunc> the hypothesis being tested <pause dur="0.5"/> but not that it's definitely true <pause dur="0.6"/> meaning that what we've observed is reasonably likely <pause dur="0.2"/> given what we believe <pause dur="6.5"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> as a further experiment again flipping a coin ten times <pause dur="0.5"/> and having our observed results being seven heads three tails <pause dur="1.2"/> we suppose that our null hypothesis is that the coin is is # <pause dur="0.2"/> fair <pause dur="0.9"/> so we make the probability statement that the probability of a head is point-five as before <pause dur="1.0"/> what we're interested in is whether or not the coin is biased <pause dur="1.0"/> what you're seeing there on the slide <pause dur="0.9"/> is the probabilities of observing various different events the first column <pause dur="1.3"/> is the number of heads just let me get the pointer up <pause dur="0.5"/><event desc="finds pointer" iterated="y" dur="2"/> oh <pause dur="0.2"/> where's it gone <pause dur="0.2"/> there we are <pause dur="1.5"/> so <pause dur="0.4"/> the first column is the number of heads we may observe from zero to ten <pause dur="0.2"/> obviously <pause dur="1.5"/> and the second column <pause dur="0.6"/> is the probability of that number of heads occurring <pause dur="0.5"/> under our null hypothesis <pause dur="0.7"/> so if our coin is unbiased if our coin is fair and our probability of a head <pause dur="0.5"/> 
is <pause dur="0.2"/> point-five <pause dur="0.8"/> then <pause dur="0.6"/> the probability of observing no heads <pause dur="0.5"/> is point-zero-zero-one <pause dur="1.2"/> the probability of observing one head <pause dur="0.5"/> is point-zero-one-zero <pause dur="0.8"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> right the way up to <pause dur="0.5"/> ten <pause dur="2.2"/> now what we want to know is how likely <pause dur="0.2"/> is it that we observe <pause dur="0.2"/> seven heads and three tails <pause dur="1.7"/> and we do that by adding up the relevant probabilities and multiplying by two because this is a two-sided test <pause dur="0.7"/> we don't know whether the coin is biased in favour of heads or in favour of tails <pause dur="1.1"/> and that gives us a P-value of point-three-four-four <pause dur="1.2"/> so <pause dur="0.3"/> if the coin were biased <pause dur="0.4"/> about thirty-four per cent of the time <pause dur="0.4"/> we would expect to see <pause dur="0.4"/> seven heads three tails <pause dur="0.7"/> that's not particularly unlikely <pause dur="0.6"/> it's certainly not <pause dur="0.2"/> five per cent unlikely <pause dur="0.7"/> and so <pause dur="0.6"/> we don't reject our null hypothesis that the coin <pause dur="0.2"/> is biased <pause dur="4.7"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> ah <pause dur="0.9"/> and there we are <pause dur="0.8"/> we flipped a coin ten times <pause dur="0.3"/> observed the results seven heads three tails <pause dur="0.5"/> calculated the probability <pause dur="0.3"/> of what we've observed <pause dur="0.7"/> it's reasonably consistent with what we believe that the coin 
is unbiased <pause dur="0.8"/> and that's fairly weak evidence against because it's consistent with the <trunc>nun</trunc> null hypothesis <pause dur="0.9"/> so we don't have <trunc>an</trunc> evidence <pause dur="0.2"/> that the coin is <trunc>unb</trunc> is biased <pause dur="0.6"/> but it doesn't prove <pause dur="0.3"/> that the coin is not unbiased <pause dur="0.3"/> # # <trunc>th</trunc> <trunc>th</trunc> <pause dur="0.3"/> that the coin is unbiased <pause dur="0.6"/> all it does is provide evidence <pause dur="0.5"/> in favour of that hypothesis <pause dur="7.0"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> so <pause dur="3.1"/> just let me <pause dur="0.2"/> collect my thoughts <pause dur="1.4"/> <vocal desc="sniff" iterated="n"/><pause dur="1.7"/> <vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/><pause dur="4.9"/> now rejecting H-nought <pause dur="0.2"/> is not <pause dur="0.2"/> always much use this is <pause dur="0.5"/> this is what i was <pause dur="0.4"/> said i'd get back to you about the P-equals-point-five business <pause dur="0.9"/> we simply choose that as an arbitrary cut-off point <pause dur="0.5"/> there there is nothing amazing happens <pause dur="0.3"/> between <pause dur="0.5"/> # point-zero-four-nine and point-zero-five-one <pause dur="6.9"/> and <pause dur="3.2"/> <vocal desc="sigh" iterated="n"/> <pause dur="1.1"/> hang on a second <pause dur="6.5"/> <event desc="drinks" iterated="n"/><vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/> <pause dur="0.4"/> <vocal desc="sniff" iterated="n"/> <pause dur="0.2"/> so <pause dur="0.6"/> yeah <pause dur="0.2"/> arbitrary P-values <pause dur="1.4"/> we're not all that interested <pause dur="0.9"/> in <pause dur="0.2"/> exact # differences 
between <pause dur="0.5"/> point-nought-five-<pause dur="0.4"/>one and <pause dur="0.6"/> point-nought-four-nine <pause dur="0.8"/> it largely depends on the context of what we're thinking of <pause dur="1.0"/> it it's an arbitrary cut-off rule <pause dur="0.4"/> which we'll use but it depends on our situation <pause dur="1.1"/> if we're testing a hypothesis that a treatment for the common cold <pause dur="0.7"/> # is effective <pause dur="0.9"/> and we observed # <pause dur="0.6"/> a P-value of point-nought-five-one <pause dur="0.7"/> in that particular hypothesis test <pause dur="0.6"/> then <pause dur="0.3"/> because this isn't a particularly you know <pause dur="0.4"/> groundbreaking thing to be testing <pause dur="1.5"/> the fact that we've observed something fairly unlikely probably means that our <pause dur="0.8"/> cure for the common cold isn't <pause dur="0.2"/> isn't all that effective <pause dur="0.6"/> and so we're not all that excited <pause dur="0.7"/> however if we're looking at a cure for AIDS <pause dur="1.2"/> and we observe a P-value of point-nought-five-one <pause dur="0.8"/> then because this is quite an <trunc>im</trunc> important and expensive problem <pause dur="0.7"/> we've observed a fairly unlikely result <pause dur="0.2"/> and <pause dur="0.3"/> we're really very interested in finding a cure for AIDS <pause dur="0.5"/> so even though it's not a significant result <pause dur="0.7"/> it's still an interesting thing <pause dur="0.2"/> and we would want to 
investigate further <pause dur="2.1"/> # <pause dur="3.4"/> false positive results <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="1.2"/> it's a very strange slide i i i <pause dur="0.4"/> can't quite see the connection between <pause dur="0.3"/> rejecting H-nought and and all the other points on the slide anyway <pause dur="0.7"/> # the P-value <pause dur="1.0"/> gives us an idea of <trunc>i</trunc> <trunc>i</trunc> a probability of interpretation of <pause dur="0.5"/> how unlikely what we observe is given what we believe <pause dur="0.9"/> # <trunc>i</trunc> <trunc>i</trunc> it's a it's a simple <pause dur="0.2"/> interpretation <pause dur="0.6"/> # that that we can talk about <pause dur="0.9"/> it also has the nice probability interpretation <pause dur="0.5"/> that it is the probability of getting a false positive result <pause dur="0.8"/> so in other words the P-value is also <pause dur="0.4"/> the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis when it's true <pause dur="1.1"/> which is quite a handy interpretation <pause dur="1.6"/> you should also note that significance depends on the sample size <pause dur="0.9"/> if we flipped a coin three times <pause dur="0.4"/> then the minimum P-value we could observe <pause dur="0.3"/> would be # a quarter <pause dur="0.4"/> point-two-five <pause dur="1.3"/> which <pause dur="0.2"/> means that <pause dur="0.4"/> we're never going to observe a significant result in that test of whether or not that coin is 
unbiased <pause dur="1.8"/> # and so # what we'd <trunc>w</trunc> obviously need there is is a larger sample size for that test <pause dur="2.3"/> # last point to note is that a <trunc>stig</trunc> a statistically significant result is not necessarily a clinically important one <pause dur="1.2"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> again this depends on the context of the problem that we're we're dealing with <pause dur="0.8"/> one that i've # consulted on recently was about A and E admissions <pause dur="1.0"/> # <trunc>alth</trunc> although the result <pause dur="0.4"/> the the reduction in # <pause dur="1.4"/> A and E admissions <pause dur="0.5"/> was really quite small <pause dur="0.8"/> this was actually very very interesting <pause dur="0.5"/> because even a tiny one per cent reduction in A and E admissions rate <pause dur="0.5"/> translated to quite a large money saving <pause dur="0.6"/> and so <pause dur="1.1"/> we were actually very interested in a very small difference <pause dur="1.2"/> however in <pause dur="0.2"/> other situations we might only be interested in a fairly large <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> change in say diabetes prevalence <pause dur="0.4"/> for for practical purposes <pause dur="0.7"/> it's # it's rather down to down to context <pause dur="0.5"/> another example would be looking at <trunc>a</trunc> aneurysm repair # abdominal aortic aneurysm <pause dur="0.8"/> if we have a 
fairly rare <pause dur="0.6"/> problem <pause dur="0.3"/> # <trunc>s</trunc> # say abdominal <trunc>or</trunc> aortic aneurysm having quite a low success rate of repair <pause dur="1.7"/> then <pause dur="0.9"/> sorry # # <pause dur="0.2"/> quite a low death rate of repair and we want to reduce that then if it's low to start with <pause dur="0.6"/> we can only really reduce a low rate <pause dur="0.2"/> by a very small amount simply because of the <pause dur="0.2"/> amount we start with <pause dur="0.4"/> if we start with a five per cent death rate and we want to reduce that <pause dur="0.5"/> for whatever reason <pause dur="0.7"/> # economic or whatever <pause dur="1.4"/> then we can only # reduce a five per cent death rate <pause dur="0.3"/> by a maximum of five per cent <pause dur="0.6"/> which may in other contexts be quite a small reduction <pause dur="2.2"/> so statistically significant does not necessarily mean clinically important <pause dur="0.5"/> but it largely depends on the context of the problem <pause dur="0.3"/> at the time <pause dur="2.1"/> nevertheless P-values <pause dur="0.2"/> are used a lot <pause dur="0.8"/> # most people i i have consulting me at # the Walsgrave Hospital sorry the hospital formerly known as Walsgrave <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="1.1"/> get very excited when they see P-values in papers most most people <pause dur="0.4"/> are very interested in seeing significant 
results <pause dur="0.4"/> but that does not necessarily mean that a significant result in a hypothesis test <pause dur="0.3"/> translates to something <pause dur="0.2"/> which is clinically useful or interesting <pause dur="6.9"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> so to sum up <pause dur="1.3"/> hypothesis tests allow us to describe how our observed values <pause dur="0.7"/> help us towards a knowledge of true values <pause dur="0.7"/> by testing <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> the probability of observing given what we believe <pause dur="2.0"/> and in the next lecture <pause dur="0.3"/> we'll look at how we calculate a range <pause dur="0.6"/> of # <pause dur="1.2"/> in in which the true value probably lies <pause dur="2.2"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> so <pause dur="0.9"/> key points to note in this lecture <pause dur="1.0"/> are that variation exists that that people differ we should all have a fairly good appreciation <pause dur="0.4"/> that <pause dur="0.3"/> such is life <pause dur="0.2"/> that is the way it is <pause dur="1.4"/> # our observed data because of that natural variation <pause dur="0.8"/> is often different from our underlying tendency <pause dur="0.6"/> the observed proportion of people with diabetes in a in a general practice <pause dur="0.7"/> is often different from the prevalence of diabetes in the area that that general practice covers <pause dur="0.6"/> just because of natural variation <pause dur="2.0"/> # <pause dur="0.9"/> various sources of 
variation <pause dur="0.4"/> natural is is the most obvious one to think about <pause dur="0.6"/> but our <pause dur="0.2"/> estimate of <pause dur="0.3"/> # the proportion of people in diabetes in our general practice <pause dur="0.6"/> will depend on how we choose our sample <pause dur="1.0"/> which is another source of variation <pause dur="1.1"/> and we may <pause dur="0.2"/> test hypothesis about <pause dur="0.3"/> hypotheses <pause dur="0.6"/> about our true value <pause dur="0.2"/> of prevalence of diabetes in our population <pause dur="0.2"/> from our general practice area <pause dur="0.7"/> by using what we observe <pause dur="0.3"/> given what we believe <pause dur="1.0"/> and calculating the probability of what we observe <pause dur="0.3"/> given what we believe <pause dur="1.8"/> and after next week's lecture you'll be able to see how confidence intervals <pause dur="0.3"/> can be calculated <pause dur="0.8"/> those are <pause dur="0.2"/> an <trunc>e</trunc> give us an idea of where our true value may lie <pause dur="0.5"/> with a specific probability <pause dur="1.4"/> and that's it for today so <pause dur="0.5"/> you'll be pleased you have a slightly longer break than usual
