team of role players # from different teaching training and <pause dur="0.4"/> theatrical backgrounds <pause dur="0.9"/> # and the role players are a great resource we use them for teaching right through the curriculum <pause dur="0.5"/> and the most experienced ones # are used for assessment <pause dur="1.3"/> and the way that our <pause dur="0.3"/> voices examination works on the communications i mean on sorry on the stations where role play's happening <pause dur="0.6"/> is # a <trunc>t</trunc> an observing G-P examiner will score the students for <pause dur="0.2"/> clinical topics and areas of clinical management <pause dur="0.7"/> but the communication skills score <pause dur="0.7"/> which is <pause dur="0.4"/> worth a fifth of the station mark <pause dur="0.4"/> is negotiated between the examiner and the role player <pause dur="2.5"/> the scoring system that we use i've actually given you a copy of we use a banding system we we <pause dur="1.2"/> we abandoned checklists and rating scales # <pause dur="0.9"/> a while ago because they they don't work for communication in our experience <pause dur="0.4"/> we're trying to move towards this sort of more <pause dur="0.3"/> positive assessment # and that's our banding system is A to F and you've got a sample there of a <trunc>b</trunc> band 
B <pause dur="0.3"/> which i'm happy to talk to anybody about afterwards if they want to <pause dur="1.4"/> basically my PhD is looking at the way that negotiation system takes place <pause dur="0.2"/> and a lot of data was collected <pause dur="0.4"/> over a four year period <pause dur="0.5"/> where i was recording <pause dur="1.2"/> independent <pause dur="0.4"/> score perception of every role player <pause dur="0.2"/> independent score perception of every examiner <pause dur="0.3"/> and then the mark that they finally agreed on which was the score awarded in the finals to the students <pause dur="0.3"/> and as you can guess basically looking for reliability <pause dur="3.0"/> next one please <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> <pause dur="2.3"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n" n="nm0341"/> that's the very briefest summary of the most interesting areas of the results that i came across <pause dur="0.5"/> # across a sample of over a thousand consultations # <pause dur="1.1"/> irrespective of whatever <shift feature="voice" new="laugh"/>variables <shift feature="voice" new="normal"/> # we we looked at <pause dur="0.7"/> female students performed consistently higher <pause dur="0.7"/> or if you like were awarded consistently higher scores depending on how you choose to frame that <pause dur="0.6"/> # right across the sample <pause dur="0.4"/> and the that's that female student gender <pause dur="0.2"/> 
significantly higher score <pause dur="0.2"/> was irrespective of <pause dur="0.5"/> the year of study the age of the examiner the <shift feature="voice" new="laugh"/>experience <shift feature="voice" new="normal"/>of the role player <pause dur="0.2"/> the time of day the month of year <pause dur="0.4"/> all of the exam variables that we looked at <pause dur="0.5"/> that was the one that stayed significant <pause dur="1.5"/> we found that students perform less well on some role play stations than others <pause dur="0.7"/> and we're starting to work towards some theories from that that there is a relationship <pause dur="0.4"/> between <pause dur="0.6"/> a student's communication skills performance <pause dur="0.3"/> and the content of the consultation <pause dur="1.8"/> found that the students are getting higher marks when they're discussing lifestyle issues <pause dur="0.3"/> than when they're required to <pause dur="0.3"/> discuss a new diagnosis <pause dur="0.4"/> for example </u><pause dur="0.8"/> <u who="nm0343" trans="pause"> <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> did you <pause dur="0.2"/> you said they did perform better did you say how much better what percentage or how did you score </u><pause dur="1.2"/> <u who="nf0340" trans="pause"> # i've i i can give you a lot of detail about that <trunc>i</trunc> <trunc>i</trunc> in a few minutes do you do you mind because there's </u><u who="nm0343" trans="overlap">

the awarded marks and the negotiation process <pause dur="0.3"/> to be consistent <pause dur="0.2"/> and it is reliable <pause dur="0.5"/> across the study period <pause dur="0.5"/> and there are some small areas that we're going to be tweaking and modifying and revising <pause dur="0.4"/> # but on the whole we're happy that this form of communication skills marking <pause dur="0.3"/> is currently running without bias <pause dur="0.7"/> thanks <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> </u><pause dur="1.0"/> <u who="nm0341" trans="pause"> you're welcome <pause dur="1.0"/> can i have the microphone </u><pause dur="0.4"/> <u who="nf0340" trans="pause"> you can </u><pause dur="0.6"/> <u who="nm0341" trans="pause"> hello <pause dur="1.8"/> say hello <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> </u><pause dur="0.2"/> <u who="ss" trans="pause"> hello <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> <vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" n="ss" dur="1"/></u><pause dur="0.2"/> <u who="nm0341" trans="pause"> thank you very much <pause dur="0.7"/> # the actor in me will never die it # i was reflecting on the way here today that <pause dur="0.6"/> that my journey the journey that brings me here today started back in nineteen-eighty-one September nineteen-eighty-one when i joined the Theatre Studies department just down the road <pause dur="1.1"/> and was one of the people who did Theatre Studies and Dramatic Arts B-A 
honours back between nineteen-eighty-one and eighty-four subsequently became an actor <pause dur="0.5"/> millions of other things and bits and pieces in between but over the last seven years <pause dur="0.3"/> have been working with # <pause dur="0.3"/> <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> and the team on the communication skills course at <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> so that's some of my background <pause dur="0.5"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> my particular research area is cross-disciplinary <pause dur="0.9"/> it causes all kinds of difficulties because it's not quite qualititative it's not quite quantitative it adds to knowledge in # <pause dur="0.6"/> hopefully in three different areas <pause dur="0.5"/> i'm not quite sure most of where or what <pause dur="0.4"/> # it's # currently a Master's looking for transfer to a PhD and we're going through that process at the moment so it's far earlier <trunc>inter</trunc> in the process than <pause dur="0.4"/> than <trunc>y</trunc> we're at with <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> at the moment <pause dur="0.4"/> but effectively i'm looking at doctor-patient communication skills <pause dur="0.5"/> i'm applying a linguistic model to look at contextually <pause dur="0.2"/> what is happening <pause dur="0.4"/> within doctor-patient communication skills <pause dur="0.5"/> and then i'm looking at 
finding a visual representation of what a consultation looks like <pause dur="0.9"/> and applying <pause dur="0.5"/> a chaos theory measurement <pause dur="0.9"/> to that visualization to then say okay well what does this tell us about it so <pause dur="0.4"/> those of you who are aware of what a fractal is and what a fractal does will understand that those of you who don't <pause dur="0.4"/> i can give you three or four hours later to talk through it is that all right <pause dur="0.8"/> <vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" n="ss" dur="1"/> that'd be great <pause dur="0.5"/> # those of you with in the University of <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> who are aware of Frances Griffiths will perhaps know that this is a big research area of Frances' <pause dur="0.4"/> and i've presented before the complexity in primary care group on a number of occasions <pause dur="0.3"/> on this particular area <pause dur="0.3"/> i don't propose to go into any great depth of it today for <pause dur="0.2"/> for for quite obvious time <pause dur="0.4"/> limitation reasons <pause dur="0.4"/> my hope is that ultimately where this will be leading will be to move towards <pause dur="0.3"/> looking at doctor-patient communication ultimately in terms of complexity 
theory <pause dur="0.3"/> and this if you like is a doorway in <pause dur="0.5"/> what what is actually happening where is it working <pause dur="0.4"/> okay <pause dur="0.5"/> what's it look like <pause dur="1.8"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> those are consultations <pause dur="0.7"/> done in this way <pause dur="1.0"/> those are visualizations of consultations <pause dur="0.6"/> and what you can actually do is you can say <pause dur="1.1"/> a fractal very very briefly is the measurement of irregularity it is the statistical measurement of irregularity of that shape <pause dur="2.1"/> if you think about the coastline of Britain <pause dur="0.6"/> that has a fractal measurement of one-point-two-seven <pause dur="0.6"/> it's in between the first and the second dimension <pause dur="0.9"/> <vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" n="ss" dur="1"/> are we getting into Doctor Who yet <pause dur="0.4"/> do you like it <pause dur="0.2"/> okay <pause dur="0.5"/> so the fractal measurements there are represented by # the <pause dur="0.2"/> the <pause dur="0.6"/> signified D-F equals one-point-three-one so we've got a smaller fractal <pause dur="0.4"/> value on that one than we have on that one my study is looking at why that is what that means what the implications for that are <pause dur="0.8"/> i think given the linguistic model that i've chosen what i'm looking 
at at the moment and what i'm developing is something that measures <pause dur="0.3"/> style <pause dur="0.2"/> consultation style <pause dur="0.7"/> right <pause dur="1.1"/> it's looking at # what i call the topography that's the mathematical relationship to to chaos theory so we're looking at the topography of a consultation what is the rocky road that takes you from <pause dur="0.3"/> hello good morning come in sit down how can i help you through to yeah thanks doctor that's brilliant <pause dur="1.0"/> what is that road what does that journey look like is it smooth is it rough <pause dur="0.6"/> what does the roughness mean is the roughness appropriate is it not there are all sorts of issues around that <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> consequently <pause dur="1.3"/> variance of style how important is that how does that work what sort of level of flexibility have we got <pause dur="0.5"/> that is almost a measurement of flexibility that one <pause dur="0.4"/> has great flexibility that one has less so <pause dur="1.4"/> lot more in this what's the application <pause dur="0.5"/> reflective practice <pause dur="0.6"/> it's not an assessment tool it can't be done in that sort of way because it's largely a qualitative 
study <pause dur="0.4"/> and the volume of information that would need to be sat behind it i think would be a problem <pause dur="0.6"/> my hope is to develop something that a doctor can sit down and look at and say hang on a minute <pause dur="0.6"/> why are these particular why do i work in these particular areas more than in other particular areas dependent on the circumstances <pause dur="0.5"/> of the consultation what the presenting condition is how long the consultation is how long the relationship has been with the patient and all those other variables <pause dur="0.5"/> so really <pause dur="0.3"/> that's kind of where i'm going at the moment <pause dur="0.4"/> so # <pause dur="0.6"/> almost within time i'm going to hand you over for a far more rigorous approach to # <vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" n="sl" dur="1"/> <gap reason="name" extent="2 words"/> </u><gap reason="break in recording" extent="uncertain"/> <u who="nm0342" trans="pause"><kinesic desc="projector is on showing slide" iterated="n"/> i'm <pause dur="0.4"/> doing discourse analysis of <pause dur="0.2"/> recorded consultations <pause dur="0.4"/> and basically what i'm looking for <pause dur="0.5"/> is why do patients make initiations in consultations <pause dur="0.4"/> so why do they initiate new information <pause dur="0.5"/> in a consultation <pause dur="0.6"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> and i'm using something called the I-R-F model which was developed at 
<gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> in the seventies for educational discourse <pause dur="0.6"/> and I-R-F stands for initiation response and feedback and if you look on your handout on the first page <pause dur="0.4"/> you will see that <pause dur="0.4"/> an initiation <pause dur="1.7"/> basically is when a speaker <pause dur="0.3"/> attempts to engage a listener <pause dur="0.7"/> and then you get a response <pause dur="0.3"/> and <pause dur="1.2"/> what's quite unusual about educational discourse is you get feedback <unclear>in</unclear> <pause dur="0.2"/> so you get the teacher evaluating <pause dur="0.4"/> the response of the pupil <pause dur="0.9"/> and this also happens according to literature in medicine <pause dur="0.2"/> so you often get <pause dur="0.2"/> a doctor <pause dur="0.2"/> evaluating what the patient has said <pause dur="0.5"/> so an example from my corpus <pause dur="0.4"/> <reading>does it hurt a bit if i <trunc>d</trunc> does it hurt if i do that <pause dur="0.2"/> does it okay good</reading> <pause dur="0.4"/> now why did the doctor say good <vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" n="ss" dur="1"/> <pause dur="0.4"/> when <pause dur="0.6"/> when the patient said it hurt <pause dur="1.0"/> is kind of strange to me <pause dur="0.4"/> and i wondered why this would be and as i'm not a G-P nor a doctor <pause dur="0.6"/> in another specialty i don't really know why <pause dur="0.3"/> a doctor would say good <pause dur="0.3"/> when a patient had said i've got pain <pause dur="0.7"/> but maybe he has a reassuring technique i'm not sure so and i'd 
be interested to know what people think afterwards <pause dur="1.5"/> what i've tried to do then <pause dur="0.5"/> is <pause dur="0.9"/> categorize <pause dur="0.8"/> <trunc>c</trunc> the communication into exchanges <pause dur="0.6"/> okay which are basically <pause dur="0.9"/> communicative function <pause dur="0.4"/> and each new initiation <pause dur="0.2"/> is also a new exchange <pause dur="0.2"/> so every time you have a new <pause dur="0.2"/> initiation in a consultation <pause dur="0.4"/> it's a new exchange <pause dur="0.5"/> and i've come up with eight categories which i've also put <pause dur="0.3"/> on your handout <pause dur="1.0"/> # i think most of them are self-explanatory <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.8"/> informing exchanges are when <pause dur="0.2"/> the doctor or the patient gives information <pause dur="0.4"/> checking exchanges <pause dur="0.6"/> usually when the doctor usually is checking to make sure the patient's understood <pause dur="0.3"/> but sometimes the patient will initiate a check <pause dur="0.5"/> to make sure they have understood the doctor correctly <pause dur="0.7"/> directing exchanges <pause dur="0.3"/> that's when <pause dur="0.5"/> usually the doctor is <pause dur="0.5"/> giving a direction to the patient to <trunc>facili</trunc> to facilitate diagnosis so would you please take your shirt off for example <pause dur="1.4"/> advice exchanges <pause dur="0.4"/> usually when the doctor is talking about <pause dur="0.3"/> prescribing you

based <pause dur="0.3"/> just on observation <pause dur="0.2"/> we don't actually use a measure of satisfaction <pause dur="1.1"/> okay <pause dur="0.6"/> we're also using this technique for <pause dur="0.2"/> a few other projects <pause dur="0.5"/> i've done a comparison of general practice with simulated emergency medicine <pause dur="0.3"/> consultations <pause dur="0.4"/> and what was interesting there <pause dur="0.9"/> we found <pause dur="0.6"/> for closed questions <pause dur="0.2"/> that in emergency medicine <pause dur="0.2"/> the doctors tended to stack <pause dur="0.2"/> the closed questions ones for the <pause dur="0.2"/> one on top of the other <pause dur="0.4"/> and they didn't wait for the patient to respond <pause dur="0.6"/> so they may have they may have asked four questions <pause dur="1.2"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> it was sometimes puzzling for the patient <pause dur="0.5"/> which question do i answer first <pause dur="0.4"/> and that didn't really happen in general practice <pause dur="0.4"/> it was much slower so i would say <pause dur="0.3"/> that in emergency medicine <pause dur="0.3"/> a consultation is far more dense <pause dur="0.4"/> you have lots more closed questions coming at flying out at a patient <pause dur="0.4"/> whereas in general practice it's often more reflective <pause dur="1.5"/> we've also used this technique for evaluation of undergraduate role play <pause dur="0.6"/> and finally <pause dur="0.4"/> we've just finished a project to do with

elements of a consultation which very briefly are meet and greet <pause dur="0.6"/> # patient explaining the problem <pause dur="0.2"/> doctor exploring the <trunc>plob</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> problem <pause dur="0.4"/> and consultation resolution so where are we going so which <pause dur="0.2"/> of those areas are we in <pause dur="0.4"/> visually you can tell from that graph <pause dur="0.4"/> which of those contexts the consultation spends most of its time in <pause dur="0.9"/> that i think is a helpful <unclear>in</unclear> tool for self <pause dur="0.3"/> # reflection <pause dur="0.3"/> on the pilot study which has looked at thirty consultations of which those are two <pause dur="0.7"/> one of the things that has become very clear and it echoes something that <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> was saying about initiations <pause dur="0.3"/> is that an awful lot of time is spent in the area of the doctor exploring the problem which feels to me is kind of how it should be <pause dur="0.2"/> okay tell me a bit more about that when did the pain first start <pause dur="0.2"/> those sorts of questions where you're exploring what you've been told by the patient <pause dur="0.7"/> now what it's saying is if <pause dur="0.7"/> contextually depending on what the presenting condition is <pause dur="1.1"/> is it useful to be spending i'm not 
saying is it right i'm saying is it useful to be spending as much time in that area i think at the moment it's a tool for reflection <pause dur="0.4"/> it's very very early days in developing the idea because as <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/>'s just <pause dur="0.3"/> pointed out <shift feature="voice" new="mimicking an other's voice"/><gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> done it <shift feature="voice" new="normal"/> <pause dur="0.5"/> so <pause dur="0.4"/> i i can't say further than that but that's the way the thinking's going and i do think it has a practical application in terms of coding the data <pause dur="0.3"/> that can be done very quickly and again it would be a fast training process because you're not looking at <pause dur="0.3"/> an eighty-five point hierarchy or whatever the <unclear>calibre of</unclear> scale is in terms of marking up a transcript <pause dur="0.6"/> does that <pause dur="0.3"/> <trunc>m</trunc> sort of make sense </u><pause dur="0.5"/> <u who="nm0346" trans="pause"> thank you </u><pause dur="1.8"/> <u who="nm0347" trans="pause"> # it's not precisely a question but i hope in some ways it's an answer to your question <pause dur="1.0"/> communication skills of course are only one domain <pause dur="0.2"/> of consultation skills </u><u who="nm0341" trans="overlap"> absolutely </u><u who="nm0347" trans="latching">
