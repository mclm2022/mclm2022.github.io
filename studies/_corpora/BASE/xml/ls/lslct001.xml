<u who="nm0187"> so on the handout you've got this and i don't i'm not going to go through every lecture and and start talking about it but <pause dur="0.2"/> you have got this and hopefully you'll see this develops come along so we'll cover the <pause dur="0.2"/> the general introduction <pause dur="0.2"/> this week <pause dur="0.2"/> and then there's the main <pause dur="0.2"/> types of breeding schemes <pause dur="0.2"/> # and then <pause dur="0.2"/> some more of the of the techniques and backgrounds <pause dur="0.3"/> # and ending up <pause dur="0.3"/> with <pause dur="1.1"/> the releasing of varieties and all the things that go with that about patenting plant breeders' rights and <pause dur="0.5"/> a little bit about the ethics # <pause dur="1.0"/> particularly of course the <pause dur="0.2"/> G-M-Os and this sort of thing <pause dur="0.9"/> okay <pause dur="0.6"/> so hopefully that sort of structure will make sense as we <pause dur="0.2"/> as we go along <pause dur="1.8"/> the <pause dur="1.3"/> the other side of your sheet is trash you can <pause dur="0.2"/> pretty well ignore <pause dur="0.2"/> it's about the # <pause dur="0.7"/> the posters and i've changed it slightly and i'll give you another sheet <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> just now <pause dur="0.2"/> but but basically <pause dur="0.2"/> you've got <pause dur="1.0"/> from this week after the lecture i'll <pause dur="0.2"/> give you a a a list and some information to pick a topic <pause dur="0.7"/> and you each pick one topic <pause dur="0.2"/> you'll 
do your poster and your essay on that one topic <pause dur="0.4"/> you'll then <pause dur="0.2"/> prepare it during the time including using # <pause dur="0.2"/> the computers over in P-S-L to to produce the first draft <pause dur="0.3"/> and then in weeks eight and nine <pause dur="0.7"/> you'll present the posters <pause dur="0.5"/> before we'll ask you questions about and et cetera and hopefully learn from them <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> and <pause dur="0.4"/> then <pause dur="0.3"/> week ten <pause dur="0.6"/> if there's anything to pick up we can do <pause dur="0.6"/> okay <pause dur="1.0"/> yeah</u><pause dur="0.3"/> <u who="sm0188" trans="pause"> # so we <pause dur="0.3"/> give in the posters in week seven <pause dur="0.2"/> # </u><pause dur="0.6"/> <u who="nm0187" trans="pause"> # yeah you'll need to give us the # the posters i'll explain on a disk <pause dur="0.2"/> in week seven so that we can <pause dur="0.7"/> get it # in a state <shift feature="voice" new="laugh"/> that you can <shift feature="voice" new="normal"/>present it on the on the next week <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> and then the # <pause dur="0.3"/> the essays need to come in <pause dur="0.4"/> in week eight on the same subject area <pause dur="0.2"/> i'll go through it a bit more <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> just now okay <pause dur="0.3"/> we'll come back to that <pause dur="1.3"/> okay so that's the main <pause dur="0.9"/> outline of things <pause dur="0.7"/> what i want to do is to start off by giving you some <pause dur="0.3"/> of the <pause dur="0.6"/> general introduction to plant breeding itself <pause dur="0.7"/> okay <pause dur="0.4"/> now if you do have questions then please do feel free to ask them as we <pause dur="0.2"/> go along and i will try and remember 
at the end <shift feature="voice" new="laugh"/>of each <shift feature="voice" new="normal"/> lecture if i don't shout at me <pause dur="0.3"/> to please ask whatever questions you want to okay <pause dur="0.5"/> but <pause dur="0.4"/> otherwise just ask as we go along <pause dur="8.9"/><event desc="passes out handouts" iterated="n"/> okay <pause dur="3.5"/> as i said i'm not sure if you were all here <unclear>when i said</unclear> <pause dur="0.2"/> what i'll try and do is to try and give you handouts of all the overheads so # so you shouldn't have to scribble them down too much but <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> you may want to add <pause dur="0.8"/> more information in various ways <pause dur="11.8"/> oh the other important thing to tell you despite what it says on your timetable <pause dur="0.7"/> next week the lecture is also here <pause dur="1.3"/> because they haven't finished the building <vocal desc="laugh" iterated="n"/> <pause dur="0.5"/> <shift feature="voice" new="laugh"/>okay <pause dur="0.2"/> so <pause dur="0.3"/> <shift feature="voice" new="normal"/>so next week turn up <shift feature="voice" new="laugh"/>here again <shift feature="voice" new="normal"/><pause dur="6.4"/><vocal desc="hum" iterated="y" dur="1"/><pause dur="1.0"/><vocal desc="hum" iterated="y" dur="1"/><pause dur="7.6"/> okay <pause dur="1.9"/> what i'd like to <trunc>s</trunc> <pause dur="0.5"/> start by doing and i hope you don't <pause dur="0.3"/> regard this as too trivial <pause dur="0.3"/> is <pause dur="0.2"/> just to put plants in context a little bit <pause dur="0.4"/> as i <trunc>s</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> as i see them <pause dur="1.0"/> certainly as far as <pause dur="0.3"/> humans are concerned <pause dur="1.5"/> what you have to remember is that we are completely dependent on plants <pause dur="1.2"/> okay <pause dur="0.4"/> we're not completely dependent on animals we are completely dependent on plants <pause dur="0.6"/> we either eat <pause dur="0.3"/> them <pause dur="0.3"/> or eat <pause dur="0.5"/> the thing that ate them <pause dur="0.9"/> 
okay <pause dur="1.3"/> so whatever happens <pause dur="0.3"/> and whenever we're talking about <pause dur="0.7"/> even growing crops or whatever <pause dur="0.3"/> # or whether we're growing ornamental plants we are completely dependent on them in one one <pause dur="0.5"/> sense or another <pause dur="1.3"/> they are the only route <pause dur="0.4"/> or basically the only route that we can go <pause dur="0.2"/> from the inorganics <pause dur="0.4"/> C-O-two et cetera <pause dur="0.4"/> to <pause dur="0.3"/> the organic <pause dur="0.2"/> and use <pause dur="0.4"/> the products <pause dur="0.3"/> okay <pause dur="0.4"/> so they're extremely important in their own right never mind what we're going to do or how we're going to exploit them <pause dur="1.0"/> and food is not the only product we get from <pause dur="0.4"/> from plants <pause dur="0.3"/> i tend to to talk quite a bit <pause dur="0.2"/> about <pause dur="0.4"/> food crops <pause dur="0.4"/> but that's not because they're the only ones it's just it's it's slightly easier to talk about and they're ones i'm more familiar with <pause dur="0.5"/> but of course there are all the ornamentals for a start which are <pause dur="0.3"/> important certainly commercially important <pause dur="0.4"/> but there are also a whole range of other things that we get from plants <pause dur="0.6"/> drugs for instance clothing <pause dur="0.7"/> paper rubber dyes <pause dur="0.2"/> all these sort of products <pause dur="0.4"/> are come from 
plants and are ones which can be subject of course to plant breeding <pause dur="0.4"/> to crop improvement et cetera <pause dur="2.6"/> so <pause dur="0.2"/> they're essential element to sustaining <pause dur="0.5"/> human life <pause dur="0.9"/> and although other organisms has various roles they really are <trunc>s</trunc> central <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> to what we're doing and for our survival <pause dur="2.4"/> so it's important when we go on to talk about <unclear>cropping</unclear> you do <pause dur="0.3"/> realize that central <pause dur="0.2"/> role and <pause dur="0.3"/> as i say a lot of the time we may be talking about quite narrow things <pause dur="0.3"/> but <pause dur="0.2"/> you need to bear in mind the broader context in which plants are <pause dur="0.3"/> are there <pause dur="0.7"/> and the ways that we're going to be exploiting them or could exploit them <pause dur="1.8"/> okay so having <pause dur="0.4"/> said that you'll not be <pause dur="0.5"/> surprised <pause dur="0.4"/> if <pause dur="0.3"/> when we ask the question how long has plant breeding been going on <pause dur="0.2"/> the answer is as long as we've been <pause dur="0.4"/> practising settled <pause dur="0.2"/> agriculture of any <pause dur="0.3"/> shape or form <pause dur="0.6"/> okay <pause dur="1.0"/> <vocal desc="cough" iterated="n"/> <pause dur="0.5"/> so for instance if a farmer went out and collected seed <pause dur="1.1"/> grew them and they did relatively well <pause dur="0.3"/> the chances are he'd go back to the same place to collect seed or use the seed he'd grown <pause dur="0.8"/> okay <pause dur="0.7"/> 
if a neighbour <pause dur="0.4"/> had <pause dur="0.9"/> a crop that was growing particularly well you'd not be surprised if his neighbours <pause dur="0.2"/> had <trunc>a</trunc> <pause dur="0.4"/> acquired seed <pause dur="0.4"/> or were <shift feature="voice" new="laugh"/>given it<shift feature="voice" new="normal"/> <pause dur="0.3"/> by him in <shift feature="voice" new="laugh"/>one way <shift feature="voice" new="normal"/> or another <pause dur="0.2"/> they would get it and particular types <pause dur="0.3"/> would therefore tend to be <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> multiplied <pause dur="0.7"/> and so by this picking of the best <pause dur="0.9"/> then <pause dur="0.6"/> you'd start to get <trunc>qu</trunc> <pause dur="0.3"/> fairly quickly at least over a reasonable <pause dur="0.2"/> times <pause dur="0.3"/> types that were different from the wild <pause dur="0.5"/> # ones growing around them <pause dur="0.2"/> in other words you'd start to get domesticated forms <pause dur="0.8"/> which were <pause dur="0.2"/> different from <pause dur="0.4"/> the general population of of the wild plants around <pause dur="1.6"/> and these would then start to form almost exclusively the basis for <pause dur="0.6"/> the <trunc>p</trunc> <pause dur="0.3"/> plants the crops that were cultivated <pause dur="0.2"/> they would only use those because they wouldn't get such a good yield or they wouldn't get the right sort of <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> product from them <pause dur="0.7"/> from the the wild ones so they'd grow these <pause dur="1.2"/> so certainly before Mendel's experiments were reported most of the crop plants had been domesticated <pause dur="1.3"/> so most of the crops as we 
recognize them today okay they may look <trunc>s</trunc> <pause dur="0.6"/> different to some extent but you'd recognize them as crop <pause dur="0.4"/> were all carried out before we had any knowledge whatsoever of genetics <pause dur="1.2"/> so this was basically a lot of it carried out <pause dur="0.2"/> by people who were simply growing producing things and knowing what they wanted to to grow and produce <pause dur="1.4"/> so i talk about plant breeding as a science and we do put science into it <pause dur="0.2"/> but you do <shift feature="voice" new="laugh"/>have to remember <shift feature="voice" new="normal"/>that a lot of what was achieved <pause dur="0.2"/> was before we even recognized this so <pause dur="0.4"/> i mean that is is the case and i'm not <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> in any way belittling their contribution it's very very big <pause dur="0.7"/> and they did it without <pause dur="0.2"/> the sort of knowledge that mostly we're going to talk about <pause dur="1.8"/> so it kind of puts us in context a bit <pause dur="1.4"/><vocal desc="cough" iterated="n"/><pause dur="1.1"/> okay <pause dur="0.3"/> so moving on from there <pause dur="0.5"/> to ask really the next <pause dur="0.2"/> general question you might ask what would be the objectives <pause dur="0.2"/> of <pause dur="0.2"/> the crop breeder <pause dur="2.0"/><vocal desc="cough" iterated="n"/><pause dur="1.5"/> well <pause dur="0.2"/> in many ways they're still the same objectives in broad terms that were originally the driving force <pause dur="0.6"/> and a major one is increasing 
productivity <pause dur="1.0"/> certainly in most of the crop plants that is still a major consideration <pause dur="1.5"/> the desire and need to produce more <pause dur="0.4"/> per unit area <pause dur="0.8"/> is really just as it's always been <pause dur="0.7"/> in Europe <pause dur="0.4"/> we do get and in a number of the other developed countries <pause dur="0.4"/> we do get surpluses of some crops <pause dur="0.6"/> and we do get <pause dur="0.3"/> quite a lot of discussion about <pause dur="0.4"/> whether this means we should not <pause dur="0.3"/> produce <pause dur="0.8"/> cultivars or types that are more highly productive et cetera <pause dur="0.8"/> but if you think about it there's really no industry no <pause dur="0.2"/> <trunc>i</trunc> system <pause dur="0.3"/> by which <pause dur="0.4"/> increased <pause dur="0.2"/> <shift feature="voice" new="laugh"/>efficiency <pause dur="0.3"/> and productivity <shift feature="voice" new="normal"/>is not sensible <pause dur="0.8"/> you'd be better to go for increased productivity <pause dur="0.3"/> but <pause dur="0.6"/> growing a smaller area than you would the other way around <pause dur="0.2"/> profitability et cetera is still an important consideration <pause dur="1.5"/> but i'm not suggesting that should be the only one i'm not suggesting that we should ignore things like the environmental impact that we're having <pause dur="0.5"/> this is something else that we have to consider <pause dur="0.5"/> but if we're talking for instance about low input <pause dur="0.2"/> 
production <pause dur="0.3"/> then we do need to have cultivars which are suited <pause dur="0.3"/> to that <pause dur="0.5"/> there's no point thinking you can just take any cultivar and put it in a low input system <pause dur="0.6"/> you got to look for ones <pause dur="1.1"/> that grow well for instance <pause dur="0.5"/> without high nitrogen inputs <pause dur="0.6"/> that possibly do grow quite <pause dur="0.3"/> well competitively with weeds <pause dur="0.4"/> that are <pause dur="0.2"/> resistant to many of the pests and diseases if you're not going to control these <pause dur="0.2"/> by chemical means <pause dur="1.3"/> okay <pause dur="0.3"/> so the need <pause dur="0.9"/> for <pause dur="0.4"/> the increase in production is still there and is still a major driving force <pause dur="0.3"/> the other thing which you need to bear in mind this is that much of the world this is not the case <pause dur="0.4"/> they do not have an over-production <pause dur="0.4"/> <unclear>that's absolutely</unclear> sure <pause dur="0.8"/> and you can talk about the total world production and if you spread it out what would happen but that's not reality <pause dur="0.9"/> most of the food crops have to be grown <pause dur="0.3"/> locally <pause dur="0.4"/> to be <pause dur="0.2"/> used effectively <pause dur="0.4"/> so many countries there's still a very real need <pause dur="0.2"/> to feed <pause dur="0.2"/> the people that are there <pause dur="0.9"/> and if you look at the projections for the world population you can see this is not something that's going to go away very quickly or very easily <pause dur="4.9"/> 
so one of the objectives <pause dur="0.6"/> of plant breeding <pause dur="0.4"/> is really to produce lines cultivars or varieties and i use those <pause dur="0.4"/> terms interchangeably <pause dur="0.8"/> <reading>that are # better adapted <pause dur="0.2"/> to the particular <pause dur="0.3"/> environmental <pause dur="0.7"/> conditions under which they're expected to grow</reading> <pause dur="1.7"/> okay so there's not a universal <pause dur="0.3"/> type of cultivar it's got to be <pause dur="0.4"/> cultivars that are <pause dur="0.3"/> suited to the particular conditions under which they're going to grow <pause dur="0.9"/> now these might be climatic conditions which clearly <pause dur="0.3"/> vary quite dramatically <pause dur="0.5"/> around the world they might be <pause dur="0.3"/> # different day lengths <pause dur="0.3"/> they might be different temperatures <pause dur="0.3"/> and just as easily they might be different farming practices different husbandry techniques <pause dur="1.0"/> these are the sort of considerations <pause dur="0.9"/> that you need when you're thinking about <pause dur="0.3"/> what they're going to be adapted to <pause dur="2.4"/> so one of the questions that <pause dur="0.3"/> arises what <shift feature="voice" new="laugh"/> do i really mean by <shift feature="voice" new="normal"/> better adapted <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.9"/> and mostly in plant breeding terms 
this has tended <pause dur="0.5"/> previously <pause dur="0.3"/> to simply mean whether they produce more <pause dur="0.2"/> crude yield <pause dur="0.7"/> whether you get more <pause dur="0.3"/> tatties on the bottom of your plant whether you get more <pause dur="0.2"/> grains of wheat <pause dur="2.3"/> whether you get more <pause dur="0.4"/> tea leaves <pause dur="0.2"/> off the bushes et cetera <pause dur="0.3"/> but this has been modified <pause dur="0.5"/><kinesic desc="puts on transparency" iterated="n"/> recently to be <pause dur="0.3"/> much more sensible <pause dur="0.2"/> or at least i think <pause dur="1.0"/> it's more sensible <pause dur="2.8"/> first of all the main <pause dur="0.4"/> change has been much more <pause dur="0.3"/> towards usable yield rather than total yield <pause dur="1.5"/> so this is the amount <pause dur="0.5"/> that you can actually <pause dur="0.3"/> you get <pause dur="0.5"/> for the purpose that you're considering so <pause dur="0.2"/> the amount that you actually get to eat off it the amount you get <pause dur="0.3"/> processed from it <pause dur="0.8"/> the amount that you <pause dur="0.3"/> can actually use after storage <pause dur="1.3"/> these sorts of considerations <pause dur="1.2"/> so it starts bringing in <pause dur="0.3"/> important other factors like the nutritional <pause dur="0.4"/> # value <pause dur="0.5"/> of the product <pause dur="0.5"/> like <pause dur="0.5"/> the # ability to withstand storage diseases <pause dur="1.7"/> like the reduction in <pause dur="0.2"/> waste <pause dur="0.6"/> for example if you take potatoes if you peel them <pause dur="0.3"/> how much do you lose <pause dur="0.5"/> all these sorts of considerations <pause dur="0.3"/> now impose <pause dur="0.4"/> 
themselves <pause dur="0.3"/> on usable yield <pause dur="0.4"/> rather than simply <pause dur="0.6"/> crude yield <pause dur="1.2"/> okay <pause dur="1.8"/> the next consideration that has become <pause dur="0.4"/> much more recognized <pause dur="0.3"/> is the need for stability of yield <pause dur="1.7"/> now in countries like this mostly or quite a lot of this has been achieved <pause dur="0.3"/> by <pause dur="0.7"/> having inputs <pause dur="0.8"/> chemical inputs mostly by using fertilizers <pause dur="0.3"/> by using sprays <pause dur="1.2"/> so that is one way of stabilizing the the at least the gross <pause dur="0.2"/> yield <pause dur="0.5"/> on a year by year basis <pause dur="1.5"/> but the other <pause dur="0.4"/> way that's also been done is to look at the <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="1.2"/> plant breeding and the resistance to <pause dur="0.4"/> things like biotic and abiotic stresses <pause dur="0.5"/> to cut down the year to year <pause dur="0.3"/> variation <pause dur="0.6"/> i think it's fairly obvious particularly if you're depending on a crop if one year <pause dur="0.2"/> it yields a lot <pause dur="0.5"/> the next year it yields a lot and the one after <pause dur="0.8"/> not very much at all <pause dur="0.4"/> the average of those three years might look all right and you might say that's quite a good variety <pause dur="0.3"/> but in realistic terms if you haven't got anything to eat in the third year is is kind of a bit tricky <pause dur="0.8"/> okay <pause dur="0.6"/> so although it 
seems obvious it's not something that's been too highly <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> stressed before <pause dur="0.8"/> so as i say one of the ways round this is to look very much at things like disease <pause dur="0.4"/> resistance and <pause dur="0.2"/> tolerance to <pause dur="0.2"/> abiotic stresses temperature <pause dur="0.5"/> # drought <pause dur="0.4"/> water-logging <pause dur="0.2"/> any of these types of things <pause dur="3.2"/> the next thing that <pause dur="0.4"/> as i say has been having increasing emphasis is the quality of the product <pause dur="2.3"/> clearly one of the important parts in a food crop is the nutritional <pause dur="0.3"/> quality itself <pause dur="0.2"/> but also aspects like taste <pause dur="0.7"/> i'm sure you've all heard the stories of how the new <pause dur="0.5"/> varieties do not taste anything like the old ones and we've got rid of all the <pause dur="0.4"/> good qualities of these and to some extent it's it's true <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> but it's certainly something that is much more # <pause dur="0.3"/> focused on <pause dur="0.2"/> now <pause dur="0.4"/> there's also things like <pause dur="0.2"/> the calorific value <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> <trunc>co</trunc> protein content <pause dur="0.3"/> fat level vitamin concentration <pause dur="0.4"/> all these things are aspects <pause dur="0.4"/> that do vary <pause dur="0.4"/> between different genotypes and you can select for <pause dur="0.8"/> within the <pause dur="0.4"/> within the crop <pause dur="2.1"/><vocal desc="cough" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.7"/> then there's the 
environmental impact which we've <pause dur="0.3"/> touched on before <pause dur="2.9"/> agriculture <pause dur="0.3"/> when it's practised <pause dur="0.2"/> has raised <pause dur="0.5"/> quite a considerable debate in in quite a number of ways <pause dur="0.4"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> in most developed countries we do the work for intensive <pause dur="0.5"/> agricultural production <pause dur="1.2"/> there is very little <pause dur="0.5"/> in this country which you could call a natural environment <pause dur="0.5"/> it depends # <pause dur="0.3"/> to a despite <pause dur="0.6"/> people protesting <pause dur="0.4"/> about <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> the effects on the countryside the countryside is almost completely agricultural <pause dur="0.2"/> production it's certainly <pause dur="0.3"/> framed and <pause dur="0.3"/> a product of agricultural production <pause dur="0.7"/> so we do <shift feature="voice" new="laugh"/>have to <shift feature="voice" new="normal"/><pause dur="0.2"/> to bear this in mind <pause dur="0.2"/> when you look at other countries and you talk about them <pause dur="0.3"/> not destroying their rainforests and all the rest of it which i <pause dur="0.6"/> fully sympathize with <pause dur="0.2"/> you have to remember that's exactly what we have done <pause dur="0.7"/> we have taken out all our forests <pause dur="0.4"/> and put in agriculture <pause dur="1.5"/> but it's something that # # say we need to to think <pause dur="0.4"/> carefully about we <shift feature="voice" new="laugh"/>need <shift feature="voice" new="normal"/>to think about inputs <pause dur="0.4"/> such as do we need high fertilizer levels do we need 
chemicals et cetera one of the answers <pause dur="0.3"/> is undoubtedly from plant breeding <pause dur="1.4"/> if we can produce yield without such a high level of <pause dur="0.2"/> fertilizer <pause dur="0.8"/> if we can stabilize yield without having to spray <pause dur="0.2"/> pesticides then clearly <pause dur="0.3"/> that is something we should <pause dur="1.4"/> or we could go for and to a certain extent it is being done <pause dur="2.0"/> again you have to <pause dur="0.3"/> look <pause dur="0.5"/> at it in the context that you expect the thing to be grown <pause dur="1.0"/> if it's going to be grown in a high input system then you will have <pause dur="0.8"/> cultivars that will respond and grow in that situation <pause dur="0.3"/> if you're looking at low input then it must be <unclear>in that</unclear> if you're looking in a developing country <pause dur="0.5"/> you have to look <pause dur="0.4"/> at what condition and husbandry practices they're going to do and what effect that's going to have <pause dur="7.3"/> as i said one of the primary aims <pause dur="0.4"/> is to produce varieties which are better adapted <pause dur="0.8"/> but the second part of that <pause dur="0.4"/> is to the particular environmental conditions under which they're expected to grow <pause dur="3.5"/> to produce varieties that <pause dur="0.6"/> are growing under <pause dur="0.5"/> these conditions 
it's quite an easy thing to overlook <pause dur="0.7"/> you do have to think of a whole series of <trunc>th</trunc> of <pause dur="0.5"/> things depending on how broadly you expect the <pause dur="0.8"/> the two that you're producing to grow <pause dur="1.4"/> what are the soil conditions <pause dur="0.8"/> what sort of rainfalls <pause dur="1.5"/> what sort of <pause dur="0.4"/> basic environmental conditions such as # <pause dur="0.2"/> hours of sunlight <pause dur="0.5"/> are you going to <pause dur="0.3"/> be exposed to <pause dur="1.1"/> but very importantly is what type of <pause dur="0.4"/> husbandry practice what type of farming system <pause dur="0.5"/> basically is it going to be <pause dur="0.4"/> to be grown under <pause dur="0.7"/> mostly of course <pause dur="0.3"/> breeders are producing for <pause dur="0.2"/> large-scale <pause dur="0.2"/> production they are not usually <pause dur="0.3"/> selecting for smallholder production <pause dur="1.7"/> but nevertheless there are quite a variety <pause dur="0.3"/> of different ways <pause dur="0.2"/> in which <pause dur="0.5"/> you can grow crops <pause dur="1.5"/> okay so this <pause dur="0.5"/> is something which is important to bear in mind <pause dur="3.5"/> so the <pause dur="0.6"/> <reading>objectives of the plant breeder are to increase usable yield <pause dur="0.3"/> increase stability <pause dur="0.4"/> make the crop more nutritive reduce ecological disadvantages <pause dur="0.5"/> and produce types <pause dur="0.3"/> that basically suit <pause dur="0.2"/> the growing conditions and the needs of the 
people who are growing them</reading> <pause dur="2.3"/> there are however as i <pause dur="0.4"/> pointed out at the start were the number of other factors that you need to worry about and the most difficult one <pause dur="0.5"/> as i said from the start is that you're going to have to predict <pause dur="0.6"/> what <pause dur="0.3"/> this is going to be like in the future not what it is today <pause dur="1.0"/> probably as i said to you the minimum is probably about seven years <pause dur="0.3"/> in the future <pause dur="2.3"/> now <pause dur="0.2"/> in some ways environmentally <pause dur="0.4"/> that might not be too bad even with global warming <pause dur="0.2"/> seven years is a moderately short <pause dur="0.6"/> time scale so you could maybe <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> do a reasonable job on that <pause dur="1.6"/> but how are you going to predict what for instance the political situation is going to be <pause dur="1.0"/> what is going to be <pause dur="0.4"/> the position with regard for instance the subsidies or <pause dur="0.5"/> what have you <pause dur="0.2"/> what crops will <pause dur="0.3"/> farmers want to grow <pause dur="3.8"/> what will the end-user want <pause dur="2.0"/> you only have to think of the changes that have occurred in <pause dur="0.5"/> food consumption <pause dur="0.3"/> in this country or <pause dur="0.3"/> any of the developing ones to see what happens <pause dur="0.7"/> in the in the developed ones i mean in the
developing ones the same thing is true <pause dur="0.5"/> what <pause dur="0.2"/> is going to be the requirements when i started <pause dur="0.4"/> as a plant breeder <pause dur="1.0"/> as a potato breeder at least <pause dur="0.4"/> then <pause dur="0.4"/> the selection was all for a medium-size potato tuber <pause dur="0.2"/> that was what were required by the housewife and all the rest of it <pause dur="0.4"/> all the small ones used to throw away <pause dur="0.5"/> and the great big ones were useless and they were also <pause dur="0.3"/> given for <pause dur="0.2"/> animal feed <pause dur="0.8"/> because there was no <pause dur="0.2"/> real use for them so all the breeding was for <pause dur="0.2"/> this size tuber <pause dur="0.7"/> within a few years <pause dur="0.2"/> of course the big tubers <pause dur="0.3"/> started getting a premium because they're used for bakers <pause dur="0.6"/> and you can sell those and throw the rest away if you want to although you don't you use them so there's a premium on those <pause dur="0.3"/> and they even sell the small ones then they pretend they're Earlies <pause dur="0.3"/> and sell those at a premium <pause dur="0.6"/> so the whole thing reversed within <pause dur="0.2"/> really a few years <pause dur="0.2"/> now as a plant breeder adjusting <shift feature="voice" new="laugh"/>to that is really <shift feature="voice" new="normal"/> <pause dur="0.3"/> quite difficult <pause dur="0.5"/> okay <pause dur="0.4"/> so you have to do some crystal ball gazing and it's difficult 
to get it right <pause dur="0.2"/> you have to bear that in mind so of course one of your strategies <pause dur="0.3"/> may be <pause dur="0.2"/> to put some adaptability into your breeding programme so that you can <pause dur="0.2"/> move in different directions not just <pause dur="0.3"/> selecting for a single <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> particular picture <pause dur="1.9"/> another question that you might <pause dur="0.4"/> # try and ask as a plant breeder is what is going to be the spectrum of <pause dur="0.4"/> pests and diseases <pause dur="0.4"/> in seven years' time <pause dur="0.3"/> and i can assure you these do <pause dur="0.2"/> move and do change <pause dur="0.5"/> quite a lot over <pause dur="0.4"/> time <pause dur="0.6"/> # certainly <pause dur="0.4"/> we produced varieties that by the time we got them to the field <pause dur="0.4"/> were susceptible to one of the most common diseases around and they were useless <pause dur="1.5"/> so <pause dur="0.6"/> the reality of predicting is difficult but you do need to do something about it <pause dur="2.3"/> okay so they're real problems in terms of <pause dur="0.2"/> the breeder defining <pause dur="0.4"/> the aims and objectives <pause dur="0.3"/> but if we ignore that <pause dur="0.9"/> the next question is <pause dur="0.3"/> really how do we go about <pause dur="0.3"/> trying to achieve these aims and objectives <pause dur="0.4"/> and that's really what what the course is about <pause dur="1.9"/> now i'm sure <pause dur="0.2"/> you've all 
got some <pause dur="0.2"/> reasonable ideas from the lectures you've already <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> been to <pause dur="0.2"/> about the some of the general features of <pause dur="0.2"/> plant breeding <pause dur="1.2"/> but basically one of you can break it down <pause dur="0.4"/> into <pause dur="1.9"/><kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="8"/> really three steps <pause dur="3.2"/> and these are common <pause dur="0.6"/> to <pause dur="0.7"/> every breeding programme <pause dur="1.1"/> now the details of them may differ <pause dur="1.3"/> but <pause dur="0.4"/> nevertheless <pause dur="0.3"/> you require all these <pause dur="1.1"/> all these three steps to be able to <pause dur="0.2"/> to to carry out plant breeding <pause dur="6.3"/> the first thing <pause dur="0.3"/> you need to do is to either release or produce genetic variation <pause dur="0.6"/> if you want to select for something that's different <pause dur="0.3"/> you've got to have a difference there to start with <pause dur="0.9"/> if they're all the same then clearly <shift feature="voice" new="laugh"/>there's no point <shift feature="voice" new="normal"/> doing anything <pause dur="1.2"/> now to do that as i say you need variation that is genetical <pause dur="0.2"/> you need things that are inherited <pause dur="1.2"/> the two things may look different <pause dur="0.3"/> and by that we say the phenotypes are different in other words their appearance is different <pause dur="0.9"/> but they need to be genetically different if it's going to be inherited by their offspring and therefore we make 
progress with plant breeding <pause dur="0.8"/> so we need <pause dur="0.4"/> to be able <pause dur="0.2"/> to produce and release genetic variation <pause dur="2.2"/> and i'm sure you're <pause dur="0.3"/> all know <pause dur="0.8"/> very well what is the most <pause dur="0.6"/> obvious and straightforward <pause dur="0.3"/> way to produce <pause dur="0.2"/> genetic variation <pause dur="2.5"/> and it is <pause dur="1.2"/> <vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" dur="1"/><pause dur="2.6"/> no </u><u who="sm0189" trans="latching"> <gap reason="inaudible"/></u><pause dur="0.2"/> <u who="nm0187" trans="pause"> sorry </u><pause dur="0.6"/> <u who="sm0189" trans="pause"> it's hybrids </u><pause dur="0.3"/> <u who="nm0187" trans="pause"> yeah <pause dur="0.4"/> sexual reproduction <pause dur="1.2"/> # <trunc>i</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> <trunc>i</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> <trunc>i</trunc> so yeah it is a very obvious answer <pause dur="0.4"/> so sexual reproduction <pause dur="0.3"/> is the most common <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> form of <pause dur="1.5"/> releasing variation in plant breeding <pause dur="0.4"/> and in <pause dur="0.7"/> virtually all plant breeding programmes that is the source <pause dur="0.8"/> of genetic variation <pause dur="1.5"/> so we take <pause dur="1.2"/> two lines <pause dur="0.3"/> which have <pause dur="0.2"/> between them the characters <pause dur="0.3"/> or the expressions of the characters we want <pause dur="0.3"/> we cross them <pause dur="1.1"/> we produce <pause dur="0.3"/> usually the first generation from that <pause dur="0.5"/> you then <pause dur="1.1"/> have various options but one of the obvious things to do is to sell <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> that <pause dur="0.5"/> to produce <pause dur="1.0"/> segregation <pause dur="1.8"/> so we <pause dur="0.6"/> get the differences to segregate out and we try then to select the ones which have <pause dur="0.3"/> the right combination <pause dur="0.4"/> characters all the plus <pause dur="0.4"/> points together <pause dur="0.3"/> in one <pause dur="0.3"/> in one particular 
genotype <pause dur="0.9"/> in other words we look for recombinants <pause dur="1.2"/> okay <pause dur="1.2"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> it sounds i know very simplistic but that <pause dur="0.3"/> is basically <pause dur="0.4"/> in <trunc>w</trunc> in most plant breeding programmes what you're trying to do <pause dur="0.8"/> you're trying to put together the characters from different lines into one line <pause dur="0.4"/> you have to identify it <pause dur="1.0"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> and therefore do something with it <pause dur="1.7"/> okay so that covers the second part in a way <pause dur="0.3"/> we need to produce the variation we need to select amongst it <pause dur="0.8"/> okay <pause dur="2.3"/> when we have selected amongst it we need to stabilize it to do something with it <pause dur="1.8"/> we're going back up to here <pause dur="1.4"/><kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> sexual reproduction is the commonest <pause dur="0.4"/> way of producing the variation <pause dur="0.3"/> but it's not the only way <pause dur="1.2"/> there are other possibilities <pause dur="0.6"/> one is to induce mutations <pause dur="0.4"/> and we'll talk a bit about <pause dur="0.3"/> that and you can do this <pause dur="0.3"/> in various ways mutations are naturally-occurring events <pause dur="0.3"/> but you can increase their frequency <pause dur="0.2"/> by using a mutagen <pause dur="0.5"/> ionizing radiation for example <pause dur="0.3"/> here's one <pause dur="1.0"/> and this is used in plant breeding in a number of crops quite a few of the clonally-reproduced 
crops like apples for example <pause dur="0.6"/> mutations <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> are used and we'll discuss that a bit in the <pause dur="0.8"/> in the course <pause dur="1.3"/> we can also try <pause dur="0.3"/> and although it's in some ways it's sexual reproduction it usually needs some <pause dur="0.3"/> help <pause dur="0.2"/> we can use <pause dur="0.3"/> wild ancestors or related species <pause dur="0.2"/> to cross with our <pause dur="0.3"/> cultivated <pause dur="0.8"/> species to <pause dur="0.3"/> increase the amount of variation we have 
available <pause dur="0.3"/> to try and perhaps <pause dur="0.2"/> introduce characters where we don't seem to have variation <pause dur="0.6"/> in the domesticated forms <pause dur="1.5"/> and the other possibility of course now is the newer techniques such as for instance genetic transformation <pause dur="0.6"/> genetic manipulation whichever you want to call it <pause dur="0.3"/> and of course that provides us another <pause dur="0.4"/> possibility <pause dur="0.4"/> in this release production of variation <pause dur="7.5"/> really whatever <pause dur="0.4"/> source of variation <pause dur="0.3"/> we use though the <trunc>im</trunc> or or <pause dur="0.2"/> probably the most important <pause dur="0.4"/> # criteria is the selection of the parents <pause dur="2.7"/> unless you selected what parents to start with <pause dur="0.3"/> you've already got <pause dur="0.3"/> a major uphill <pause dur="0.3"/> battle <pause dur="12.7"/><kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="6"/> so on here <pause dur="0.2"/> i've written it as the critical factor <pause dur="1.6"/> okay <pause dur="0.8"/> so unless you have <pause dur="0.4"/> good starting point you're always going to be <pause dur="0.3"/> struggling <pause dur="0.3"/> so you need to choose <pause dur="1.4"/> the parent <pause dur="0.3"/> and that might sound <pause dur="0.5"/> relatively easy and it can be <pause dur="0.4"/> if for example <pause dur="0.2"/> you use a cultivar that's been widely grown so <pause dur="0.3"/> things are known about its performance <pause dur="1.5"/> because the difficulty and i hope this is 
not <pause dur="1.6"/> a <pause dur="0.2"/> completely new concept to you you should have covered it before <pause dur="0.3"/> but what we see <pause dur="0.8"/> is the phenotype <pause dur="1.5"/> okay <pause dur="0.2"/> so what i'm <pause dur="0.2"/> looking at in terms of seeing you is your phenotypes <pause dur="1.2"/> okay <pause dur="0.5"/> it's what you see is the phenotype <pause dur="0.5"/> the phenotype <pause dur="0.8"/> is made up <pause dur="0.6"/> of <pause dur="0.6"/> the genotype <pause dur="0.7"/> what genes you've got <pause dur="0.3"/> and how they're being expressed <pause dur="0.4"/> in other words what's <pause dur="0.2"/> inherited <pause dur="0.5"/> from your parents <pause dur="1.0"/> is being <pause dur="0.2"/> <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 word"/> <pause dur="0.4"/> but it's also <pause dur="0.4"/> a product of your environment <pause dur="1.7"/> okay <pause dur="0.8"/> what conditions you grow in what food you've had all these things which determine <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="1.3"/> then <pause dur="0.2"/> how you appear <pause dur="1.0"/> you can easily for instance affect people's height <pause dur="0.4"/> by their nutrition or at least relatively easily so you only have to look at their <unclear>history</unclear><pause dur="0.8"/> the other complicated factor is that the genotype interacts with the environment <pause dur="0.6"/> different people given exactly the same food react differently <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> different conditions et cetera <pause dur="0.6"/> okay <pause dur="0.4"/> so <pause dur="0.5"/> when we look at something unfortunately <pause dur="0.3"/> we have this complex of underlying factors <pause dur="1.1"/> and the thing that's critical to 
us as a plant breeder <pause dur="0.2"/> okay we can exploit the <pause dur="0.2"/> interactions <pause dur="0.3"/> <unclear>geno times env</unclear> <pause dur="0.2"/> but really what we're interested in is this part <pause dur="1.8"/><kinesic desc="indicates point on transparency" iterated="n"/> okay <pause dur="0.7"/> but these other things can be <pause dur="1.2"/> major and mask <pause dur="0.6"/> which bit is genetic and you don't know <pause dur="1.1"/> so <pause dur="0.3"/> when we're talking about the choice of parent this is a complicating <pause dur="0.2"/> factor and it's a a factor that will come in <pause dur="0.3"/> elsewhere as well when we <pause dur="0.3"/> are looking at this # <pause dur="0.7"/> but this business of wanting the genotype <trunc>be</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> but only being able to <pause dur="0.3"/> observe the phenotype is a <pause dur="0.4"/> is a major drawback <pause dur="1.6"/> okay <pause dur="2.4"/><event desc="takes off transparency" iterated="n"/> so <pause dur="2.2"/> having done that we've chosen the parents we've <pause dur="0.2"/> done something about releasing the variation <pause dur="0.2"/> probably sexual reproduction but <pause dur="0.6"/> could be other things <pause dur="0.4"/> we now need to <kinesic desc="puts on transparency" iterated="n"/> select amongst the variation <pause dur="3.0"/> again <pause dur="0.5"/> on first thought that seems <pause dur="0.2"/> kind of easy <pause dur="0.3"/> just go and have a look see what's good and take it and all the rest of it <pause dur="0.7"/> but the first thing you need to decide is what characters <pause dur="0.3"/> are going to be selected <pause dur="2.2"/> again this seems fairly straightforward <pause dur="1.4"/> but first of all you have to realize 
that many characters are actually quite difficult to measure <pause dur="0.8"/> they either take a lot of time a lot of energy <pause dur="0.5"/> expensive equipment <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.8"/> or really just a very difficult <trunc>t</trunc> to do the second <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="1.4"/> thing <pause dur="0.4"/> you need to bear in mind is that you've got a lot of material to look at <pause dur="0.4"/> a lot of different ones that you want to assess <pause dur="1.4"/> right something we'll come to again <pause dur="0.3"/> in the <pause dur="0.2"/> course <pause dur="0.5"/> and the other problem is that you usually have small quantities of it <pause dur="1.0"/> okay <pause dur="0.2"/> so for instance i mean taking the very obvious thing <pause dur="0.7"/> you might have two plants how are you going to assess yield <pause dur="1.3"/> yield of two plants grown by themselves doesn't # <pause dur="0.8"/> doesn't tell you anything very much it's nothing about <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> what it'll what it'll actually <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> grow like <pause dur="0.7"/> and also for disease <pause dur="1.1"/> for instance <pause dur="0.5"/> so quite often # <pause dur="0.4"/> for disease assessment they will take <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> detached leaves <pause dur="1.6"/> because there simply isn't enough material <pause dur="0.5"/> you cannot have different densities of sowing you cannot <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> plant material <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="1.1"/> that # <pause dur="0.3"/> can be grown exactly <pause dur="0.2"/> as you would like <pause dur="0.7"/> in agriculture <pause dur="0.4"/> so <pause dur="0.8"/> 
the question is <pause dur="1.1"/> how are you going to reproduce the conditions of agriculture <pause dur="0.3"/> you can't totally so you have to pick a single condition <pause dur="0.5"/> and work on that basis and hope it's representative <pause dur="0.5"/> you cannot <pause dur="0.2"/> as i say grow large plots and see how they behave <pause dur="0.4"/> you've only got a small amount of material <pause dur="1.8"/> a small amount of material also means that you have questions about the relevance <pause dur="0.7"/> of what you're measuring <pause dur="0.3"/> and the characters you're assessing to agriculture itself <pause dur="0.9"/> so you can talk to pathologists and they can tell you how they can take <pause dur="0.4"/> single leaves from plants they can expose them to diseases <pause dur="0.6"/> and they get a reaction to it <pause dur="1.3"/> but this doesn't always tie up with field performance <pause dur="0.7"/> so <pause dur="0.3"/> the relevance <pause dur="0.2"/> of the characters as well <pause dur="0.3"/> as the effectiveness that you can measure them <pause dur="0.2"/> is extremely important <pause dur="4.5"/> the next problem we have <pause dur="0.8"/> is really the one that we were talking about a few minutes ago and i said it would come back up <pause dur="0.5"/> and that is the efficiency with which we can select <pause dur="2.1"/> so back to the 
phenotype versus the genotype <pause dur="1.7"/><vocal desc="cough" iterated="n"/><pause dur="4.0"/> as i think is fairly obvious from <trunc>th</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> from the equation <pause dur="0.5"/> <reading>the greater the environmental effects <pause dur="0.4"/> the more the phenotype <pause dur="0.8"/> will be a poor reflection of the underlying genotype</reading> <pause dur="1.1"/> okay <pause dur="0.4"/> so the more something's affected <shift feature="voice" new="laugh"/>by the <shift feature="voice" new="normal"/>environment <pause dur="0.2"/> the less we <shift feature="voice" new="laugh"/>can do anything <shift feature="voice" new="normal"/>about <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> picking it because we won't be picking the genotype at all we'll just be picking the effect of the environment all the time <pause dur="1.8"/> so this creates <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> a real problem particularly as <pause dur="0.2"/> many of the characters we're dealing with are not the simple ones that Mendel had you don't get <pause dur="0.5"/> tall and short <pause dur="0.4"/> pink or white <pause dur="1.3"/> these sorts of characters we get <pause dur="0.3"/> characters <pause dur="0.2"/> like yield <pause dur="0.3"/> like number of ears <pause dur="0.6"/> so if you think for instance <pause dur="0.2"/> the character that's similar in humans is height <pause dur="0.8"/> you are all different heights <pause dur="0.9"/> but <pause dur="0.3"/> the fact there's not one of you here that's a major <trunc>g</trunc> has a major gene difference for height in other words there's no achondroplasic dwarves <pause dur="1.0"/> but <pause dur="0.2"/> they do occur <pause dur="0.3"/> in the population there 
are major genes for height <pause dur="0.4"/> but most of you differ <pause dur="0.3"/> for height <pause dur="0.6"/> by a lot of genes <pause dur="0.7"/> there's a lot of different genes will affect your height <pause dur="0.8"/> and so what we're <pause dur="0.3"/> seeing is the effect of all the genes okay plus the environment and all the rest of it <pause dur="0.5"/> but <pause dur="0.6"/> there's a lot of genes there so it's not easy <pause dur="0.6"/> to say what's genotype and what's phenotype <pause dur="1.1"/> okay <pause dur="1.6"/><vocal desc="cough" iterated="n"/> <pause dur="1.0"/> so to try and get out of some of those problem we have to find ways of trying to get some sort of assessment <pause dur="0.3"/> of what amount of the variation <pause dur="0.3"/> might be genetic and what might be <pause dur="0.4"/> # environmental <pause dur="0.2"/> and we can get a measure of something <pause dur="0.2"/> called the heritability again which we'll <pause dur="0.3"/> come to later <pause dur="0.4"/> in the lecture course <pause dur="0.3"/> which effectively just measures the proportion of the variation or tries to <pause dur="1.0"/> of the total variation that's genetic <pause dur="0.7"/> so it gives us some sort of estimate of how efficient <pause dur="0.3"/> or how effective our selection's going to be <pause dur="2.2"/><vocal desc="cough" iterated="n"/> <pause dur="4.1"/> it's something i'll talk about when we talk about heritability <pause dur="0.3"/> and you get various discussions of this mostly in <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> not <pause dur="0.2"/> 
perhaps quite so much recently but <pause dur="0.2"/> # not too long ago about I-Q in humans of what heritability was and <pause dur="0.3"/> what this meant and how this affected racism and all the rest of it <pause dur="0.6"/> the thing you have to remember is there's no such thing as the heritability <pause dur="0.4"/> the heritability is only estimated for a particular population a particular point in time <pause dur="0.6"/> # so there's no <pause dur="0.3"/> there's no general <pause dur="0.2"/> measure for it <pause dur="1.2"/> but it gives us some <pause dur="0.3"/> some idea about how <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="1.1"/> how we might proceed and the reason i'm stressing that it changes is because we can change it as plant breeders <pause dur="0.8"/> we change it because we're doing the selection but we can also change it by the way we carry out our trials <pause dur="0.6"/> if we replicate things <pause dur="1.0"/> okay <pause dur="0.6"/> we replicate things we can take the mean <pause dur="0.3"/> if we take the mean we know it more precisely <pause dur="0.4"/> the more observations that go into the mean the more precisely we know <pause dur="0.3"/> and the more precisely we know it <pause dur="0.3"/> the more <pause dur="0.5"/> we can increase the heritability <pause dur="1.0"/> okay we reduce the environmental effects <pause dur="1.0"/> <trunc>compar</trunc> compared to 
the genotypic effects <pause dur="1.3"/> now you can do this in various ways you can simply replicate the trials so that <pause dur="0.6"/> decreases the local environmental variation <pause dur="0.7"/> we could replicate it over different trial sites <pause dur="0.2"/> so we start to change <pause dur="0.4"/> the <pause dur="0.4"/> how sure we are about its repeatability <pause dur="0.3"/> over different regions we can do it in different countries we can do it in different seasons <pause dur="1.0"/> okay <pause dur="0.5"/> so we can change <pause dur="0.8"/> the heritability <pause dur="0.4"/> and we can also change the repeatability of our measurements but <pause dur="0.9"/><vocal desc="cough" iterated="n"/><pause dur="1.1"/> but <pause dur="0.2"/> the trouble is each time we do that we increase the workload <pause dur="1.3"/> so <pause dur="0.2"/> if we have two replicates we've already doubled <pause dur="0.2"/> the amount of material we have to grow <pause dur="2.1"/> you then grow it at another site you've doubled it again <pause dur="1.7"/> usually there is a very <pause dur="0.5"/> real limit on how much you can cope with or how much you can grow or how much seed you've got <pause dur="0.6"/> so <pause dur="0.2"/> normally what it means is that you <pause dur="0.9"/> look at less material <pause dur="0.4"/> so if you double the number of replicates you halve the amount of <pause dur="0.6"/> lines you look at <pause dur="0.8"/> so you gain on one thing and you lose on 
another <pause dur="1.1"/> okay <pause dur="0.5"/> so it's again it's something we need to consider as we <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> go through the course that this is a <pause dur="0.3"/> a problem we can increase precision in one way but if we do that <pause dur="0.4"/> we <pause dur="0.8"/> then reduce how much material we can look at and we then reduce the <pause dur="0.3"/> efficiency of selection <pause dur="2.3"/><kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="11"/> <vocal desc="cough" iterated="n"/><pause dur="3.7"/><vocal desc="hum" iterated="y" dur="1"/><pause dur="2.7"/> okay but we carry out our selection in ways that we'll <pause dur="0.2"/> # see as we go through the course <pause dur="0.5"/> having done that <pause dur="0.6"/> you end up <pause dur="0.7"/> with an amount of material <pause dur="0.5"/> which you need to stabilize you need to be able to <trunc>repo</trunc> reproduce <pause dur="0.4"/> this material if it's going to be exploited in <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> any way at all <pause dur="1.3"/> and you need to multiply it <pause dur="0.8"/> so you'd need to multiply it stably <pause dur="1.7"/> okay otherwise <pause dur="0.3"/> i mean what's the point of having one seed which is just what you want what can you do with it <pause dur="1.1"/><vocal desc="cough" iterated="n"/><pause dur="1.0"/> now this is where the different types <pause dur="0.3"/> of <pause dur="0.3"/> crop plants <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> tend to be more different <pause dur="0.4"/> the main <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> criteria that are used for separating plants in terms of plant breeding <pause dur="0.3"/> are to do with their breeding system <pause dur="0.7"/> and three main <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> types <pause dur="0.4"/> that are recognized are <pause dur="0.8"/> inbreeding <pause dur="0.2"/> outbreeding and 
vegetatively reproduced crops <pause dur="1.0"/> and we'll go into these in # <pause dur="0.2"/> in in the next lecture <pause dur="0.4"/> they <pause dur="0.2"/> i think are fairly self-explanatory <pause dur="0.8"/> inbred crops <pause dur="0.3"/> mean that they can be selfed <pause dur="0.4"/> you can <pause dur="0.2"/> therefore <pause dur="0.3"/> make them true breeding <pause dur="0.3"/> therefore of course you can multiply them without too much problem <pause dur="1.1"/> <trunc>vegeti</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> vegetatively reproduced crops <pause dur="0.4"/> are ones <pause dur="0.2"/> which you reproduce asexually <pause dur="0.3"/> and therefore you can multiply them up without changing their genotypes at all <pause dur="0.7"/> potatoes are a good example they produce tubers you plant a tuber you get more tubers <pause dur="0.3"/> they're all the same genotype <pause dur="0.9"/> so they're not too much of a problem <pause dur="0.5"/> the outbred ones <pause dur="0.3"/> <vocal desc="laugh" iterated="n"/><shift feature="voice" new="laugh"/> we need to talk <shift feature="voice" new="normal"/>about as we go along <pause dur="0.3"/> # more these are really <pause dur="0.4"/> because they're all genetically different <pause dur="0.2"/> you need to treat them more as a population so you try and keep the population the same <pause dur="0.3"/> rather than the individuals <pause dur="0.8"/> okay <pause dur="0.3"/> so with inbreeders we can <pause dur="0.5"/> have <pause dur="0.2"/> individuals which are exactly identical <pause dur="1.0"/> for the outbreeders it's really the populations of the things that need to be

there to answer questions but the poster has got to be free-standing <pause dur="0.9"/> it's going to be there and people can look at it and say oh yes you know that's u-huh <pause dur="0.3"/> i see that's interesting i wonder what <pause dur="1.5"/> et cetera <pause dur="0.7"/> okay <pause dur="0.2"/> so <pause dur="0.2"/> it's getting a balance between having it <pause dur="0.3"/> attractive enough to look at and enough information <pause dur="0.6"/> to convey to people the basics of the subject area what it's about <pause dur="0.3"/> what happens what's achieved <pause dur="1.5"/> yeah <pause dur="0.4"/> but not necessarily covering <pause dur="0.7"/> all the things it doesn't matter that you <pause dur="0.5"/> need to produce twenty lines to do this the fact that you've used some lines is okay rather than <pause dur="0.4"/> specifically twenty <pause dur="1.8"/> <trunc>i</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> it's something i think we'll have to see a little bit as it goes along you've got a <shift feature="voice" new="laugh"/>few weeks to <shift feature="voice" new="normal"/><pause dur="0.3"/> to do it till you get some help but it <pause dur="0.2"/> it is that balance is the difficult thing between <pause dur="0.2"/> just providing loads and loads of information which <trunc>i</trunc> is very relevant but is <pause dur="0.3"/> usually boring and not very # <pause dur="0.8"/> easy to take in <pause dur="0.5"/> and providing something which 
is just one colourful picture and actually <pause dur="0.4"/> you've really got no idea till somebody tells you what it's about and what's achieved and how it gets done </u><pause dur="0.5"/><u who="sm0188" trans="pause"> is it a little bit like # produce <pause dur="0.2"/> this <pause dur="0.3"/> for example with Powerpoint </u><pause dur="0.2"/> <u who="nm0187" trans="pause"> yeah <pause dur="0.2"/> you are going to use <shift feature="voice" new="laugh"/>Powerpoint <shift feature="voice" new="normal"/><vocal desc="laugh" iterated="n"/> <trunc>t</trunc> to produce it so <vocal desc="laugh" iterated="n"/> # but it'll be a single <pause dur="0.3"/> it'll be a single page with images on it <pause dur="0.2"/> if you imagine <pause dur="0.4"/> at least a <trunc>me</trunc> we will actually or i'll <trunc>t</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> try <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> to get them printed <pause dur="0.5"/> # for you so you've got a printed poster at the end <pause dur="0.3"/> and if you think of them <pause dur="0.3"/> basically well we'll tell you in the next few weeks but basically like that <kinesic desc="indicates board on wall" iterated="n"/> one board on the wall <pause dur="0.9"/> you have to produce something which has the images and writing on it that's that size <pause dur="0.6"/> including the title your name and <pause dur="0.5"/> you know these sorts of things <pause dur="1.1"/> yeah <pause dur="0.4"/> so what you're aiming to do is produce something physically <pause dur="0.3"/> like that <pause dur="0.2"/> okay quite a lot of the time you'll do it electronically but <pause dur="0.2"/> you've got to see it <pause dur="0.6"/> as that <pause dur="0.8"/> and what we'll basically do is produce that # <pause dur="0.2"/> and also probably 
what we'll do is put it onto an acetate sheet so you'll <pause dur="0.3"/> blow it up like this actually to to talk to <pause dur="0.2"/> because it's a bit easier for me to handle it this way </u><u who="sm0189" trans="overlap"> have you got an old one of these posters just so we can have a look at it and so </u><u who="nm0187" trans="latching"> yeah </u><u who="sm0189" trans="latching"> is that all right </u><u who="nm0187" trans="overlap"> yeah </u><u who="sm0189" trans="overlap"> and we did say we'd give you numbers </u><u who="nm0187" trans="overlap"> yeah </u> <u who="sm0189" trans="overlap"> and then <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/></u> <u who="nm0187" trans="overlap"> yeah <pause dur="0.9"/> yeah <pause dur="0.3"/> # what i've <pause dur="0.2"/> <vocal desc="laugh" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.4"/> what i've <trunc>do</trunc> i'll let me hand out this <pause dur="0.2"/><kinesic desc="passes out handouts" iterated="n"/> it'll be easier if i <trunc>t</trunc> <pause dur="0.3"/> talk about what i'm <pause dur="0.8"/> really thinking about <pause dur="0.2"/> doing <pause dur="0.7"/> this is the timetable <pause dur="0.3"/> # so <trunc>f</trunc> forget the other one this is what i'm <pause dur="1.1"/> we shall be working to <pause dur="2.3"/> so this week i've <pause dur="0.3"/> done a bit of handing out the <pause dur="0.3"/> the lists and the forms and you've got them and you need to start thinking <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="1.5"/> next week <pause dur="0.3"/> if you've made the choice <pause dur="0.2"/> then you can start doing <pause dur="0.3"/> some background <pause dur="0.5"/> reading and thinking about the subject area <pause dur="0.8"/> the week after that <pause dur="1.0"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> then in lab A in P-S-L <pause dur="1.3"/> yeah <pause dur="0.7"/> where the computers are </u><pause dur="0.2"/> <u who="sm0189" trans="pause"> yeah </u><pause dur="0.5"/> <u who="nm0187" trans="pause"> then <pause dur="0.3"/> i've got two people <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> <pause dur="0.2"/> <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> and # <pause dur="1.1"/> <gap reason="name" extent="2 words"/> <pause dur="0.7"/> who <pause dur="0.4"/> will help with the <pause dur="0.4"/> technical parts of the computer side of things and answer questions and they've also got a sheet about producing the <pause dur="0.2"/> posters and a few tips and these 
sorts of things <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> and that's where you'll start actually <pause dur="0.6"/> producing and that's where also <pause dur="0.3"/> we'll try and get <pause dur="0.3"/> # and # i will remember <pause dur="0.2"/> to bring down copies of previous ones so that you can </u><pause dur="0.5"/><u who="sm0189" trans="pause"> <gap reason="inaudible" extent="2 secs"/> </u><u who="nm0187" trans="overlap"> have a look and <pause dur="0.7"/> see <pause dur="0.4"/> yeah in fact # i only if i remember i'll bring them with me next week 'cause i've got some <pause dur="0.2"/> on acetate </u><u who="sm0189" trans="overlap"> yeah </u><u who="nm0187" trans="overlap"> so we can just <pause dur="0.4"/> quickly look at them here </u><u who="sm0189" trans="latching"> yeah</u><pause dur="0.2"/> <u who="nm0187" trans="pause"> # </u><pause dur="0.2"/><u who="sm0188" trans="pause"> <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 word"/></u><u who="nm0187" trans="latching"> yeah <pause dur="0.9"/> but if you go to the <pause dur="0.2"/> P-S-L if you walk around the corridors </u><pause dur="0.2"/> <u who="sm0189" trans="pause"> yeah </u><u who="nm0187" trans="overlap"> the things that are on the walls <pause dur="0.4"/> are what i'm <pause dur="0.3"/> <shift feature="voice" new="laugh"/>talking about you producing <shift feature="voice" new="normal"/><pause dur="1.0"/> okay <pause dur="0.6"/> so that probably would be the best thing if you had a look at that and i'll try and remember to bring some but if you look at those <pause dur="0.4"/> posters they're exactly the sort of thing <pause dur="0.7"/> you know i don't say all of them are good <pause dur="0.6"/> so don't <shift feature="voice" new="laugh"/>take it from me <shift feature="voice" new="laugh"/><vocal desc="laughter" n="ss" iterated="y" dur="2"/> that i'm saying they're the models for it but then <pause dur="0.2"/> they're the sorts of things that you're aiming for the sort of thing that we expect # <pause dur="0.6"/> 
people to do <pause dur="0.2"/> yeah <pause dur="1.1"/> # <pause dur="1.3"/> so <pause dur="0.5"/> after week three <pause dur="0.2"/> and from week three onward there is <pause dur="0.3"/> there are computers booked <pause dur="0.3"/> in lab A so that you get priority on them <pause dur="0.7"/> and the software's there <pause dur="0.2"/> what we'll do is # <pause dur="1.0"/> give you each a zip well <pause dur="0.2"/> you'll have to give us a deposit but we'll give you a zip disk each so you've got something to work on <pause dur="0.5"/> the software's there <pause dur="1.2"/> okay <pause dur="0.4"/> and then <pause dur="0.4"/> you start to go from there <pause dur="0.2"/> and we'll give you what help and advice we <pause dur="0.6"/> we can on you know presentation and things like that <pause dur="0.5"/> come to week eight <pause dur="0.4"/> well week seven you need to hand it in week eight <pause dur="0.4"/> we'll then start <pause dur="0.3"/> presenting it <pause dur="0.3"/> it depends how many there ends up on the <pause dur="0.4"/> course last year i only had <pause dur="0.3"/> about this number when i started by the next week i had nineteen so <pause dur="0.4"/> <vocal desc="laugh" iterated="n"/> <shift feature="voice" new="laugh"/> we'll see how <shift feature="voice" new="normal"/><pause dur="0.3"/> how many we've got we might <pause dur="0.3"/> just do it in one week or two <pause dur="0.5"/> okay <pause dur="0.3"/> so as i say please don't feel <pause dur="0.2"/> nervous about presenting it <trunc>y</trunc> you know it <pause dur="0.2"/> it <pause dur="0.3"/> just <pause dur="0.3"/> the poster up there <pause dur="0.2"/> tell people a little bit about it and they'll ask you questions 
it's the same for everybody and it's really not a <pause dur="0.8"/> a big problem okay <pause dur="1.2"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> and then <pause dur="0.2"/> i say we'll make the assessment of it and that's <pause dur="0.6"/> that's it <pause dur="0.3"/> and this your essay will be on the same <pause dur="0.5"/> subject area so you don't have to go <pause dur="0.4"/> revise the whole or you could look up <pause dur="0.2"/> information on anything else <pause dur="1.0"/> yeah <pause dur="1.4"/> is that okay anybody got any </u><pause dur="1.3"/> <u who="sm0190" trans="pause"> when does the essay have to be in</u> <pause dur="0.6"/> <u who="nm0187" trans="pause"> # in week eight <pause dur="5.7"/> i'm doing that not <pause dur="0.2"/> to make you have a short time doing it but <pause dur="0.4"/> as you know most assessments <pause dur="0.9"/> start piling up at the end of term <pause dur="0.4"/> so <pause dur="0.5"/> A because we need the posters in then <pause dur="0.4"/> i was <pause dur="0.5"/> trying to make it so that the essay <pause dur="0.3"/> in at the same time <pause dur="0.8"/> yeah <pause dur="5.1"/> all right <pause dur="2.5"/> okay <pause dur="1.7"/> excellent well if there are any questions <pause dur="0.5"/> well most of you do you know where i am in <pause dur="0.3"/> P-S-L <pause dur="0.6"/> on the <pause dur="0.2"/> first floor anyway you'll find me if you ask okay if you want to come and see me <pause dur="0.7"/> okay
