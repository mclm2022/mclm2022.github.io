yes there's a mouse <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> </u><pause dur="0.9"/> <u who="nf0279" trans="pause"> i use the mouse </u><pause dur="0.2"/> <u who="nf0280" trans="pause"> yeah </u><pause dur="0.7"/> <u who="nf0279" trans="pause"><event desc="finds pointer" iterated="y" dur="3"/> # well that's great 'cause the screen's gone off so i # <pause dur="0.2"/> oh okay <pause dur="0.2"/> right fine i've got you <pause dur="2.0"/> this is a cartoons of the aorta <pause dur="0.4"/> this is your aorta's nice and young and healthy <pause dur="1.8"/> these are the main branches of <trunc>th</trunc> the renal arteries <pause dur="0.3"/> this is the diaphragm <pause dur="1.9"/> as you get older the i mean i suppose one of the most obvious facial characteristics when people get older <pause dur="0.2"/> apart from greying hair like mine is wrinkles <pause dur="1.1"/> well just like your face wrinkles <pause dur="0.2"/> your blood vessels wrinkle too in a sense <pause dur="0.4"/> and they start sagging <pause dur="0.2"/> and this is what we call ectasia <pause dur="1.9"/> but in some people <pause dur="0.2"/> when they get older <pause dur="0.6"/> they actually balloon out <pause dur="0.5"/> their abdominal aorta <pause dur="0.6"/> and you probably remember from your anatomy if you've got that far <pause dur="0.4"/> that this bit <pause dur="0.3"/> the <trunc>but</trunc> the iliac bifurcation is about at the level of your umbilicus <pause dur="3.8"/> this nice little swelling of the aorta <pause dur="1.5"/> doesn't do anything you don't feel it usually <pause dur="0.4"/> no problems <pause dur="0.5"/> 
in fact many <pause dur="0.3"/> people have no problems <pause dur="0.4"/> until it grows so big <pause dur="0.4"/> that it bursts <pause dur="3.1"/> and the diameters here <pause dur="0.9"/> whoops <pause dur="2.1"/> normal aorta <pause dur="0.4"/> somewhere between one-point-six and two-point-two centimetres <pause dur="0.7"/> and we start to call it an aneurysm <pause dur="0.3"/> when the diameter here exceeds three centimetres <pause dur="1.0"/> and they can grow really very big <pause dur="0.2"/> up to fifteen centimetres or more <pause dur="2.3"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> so this may not provide any symptoms <pause dur="0.4"/> but when this happens <pause dur="0.7"/> and the blood pours out into your belly <pause dur="0.3"/> onto the retroperitoneum <pause dur="1.5"/> extreme pain <pause dur="0.5"/> and collapse <pause dur="0.7"/> and the survival rate <pause dur="0.2"/> is very poor <pause dur="2.4"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> we can detect <pause dur="0.9"/> aneurysms <pause dur="0.9"/> using ultrasonography <pause dur="0.7"/> even though a person may not know they've got them <pause dur="0.5"/> if we do an ultrasonogram <pause dur="0.2"/> of the aorta <pause dur="1.2"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> we can see here <pause dur="0.3"/> this is an example of a very large aorta <pause dur="0.6"/> and in the middle here you've got colours 'cause this is colour flow showing the blood flow <pause dur="0.9"/> so here you've got an aorta <pause dur="0.2"/> slightly irregular <pause dur="0.4"/> but probably about seven centimetres in diameter <pause dur="2.7"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> if you go and do this to the general population <pause dur="1.2"/> and you choose men over 
sixty years <pause dur="1.0"/> you'll find that five per cent of them <pause dur="1.6"/> have a small swelling of the aorta <pause dur="0.2"/> or an <pause dur="0.2"/> occult <pause dur="0.3"/> abdominal aortic aneurysm <pause dur="1.5"/> so it's not rare <pause dur="0.3"/> it's quite common <pause dur="0.7"/> and rupture of an aortic aneurysm <pause dur="0.9"/> is a common cause of sudden death <pause dur="1.1"/> and often <pause dur="1.0"/> you will see on a death certificate <pause dur="1.2"/> died from a heart attack or myocardial infarction <pause dur="0.5"/> actually it would be very difficult to discriminate if you didn't know anything about the history <pause dur="0.8"/> whether it was from a sudden major heart attack <pause dur="0.4"/> or a ruptured aortic aneurysm <pause dur="3.2"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> now the natural history <pause dur="0.7"/> of this condition <pause dur="0.5"/> is that once you've got a swelling <pause dur="0.7"/> it gradually increases in size <pause dur="1.3"/> and just like a balloon <pause dur="0.2"/> you might suspect that as it increases in size <pause dur="1.7"/> there's a bigger chance of it bursting <pause dur="0.3"/> or rupturing <pause dur="1.5"/> we've actually quantified this <pause dur="1.0"/> in <pause dur="0.2"/> over seventeen-hundred patients <pause dur="1.3"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> and the way we've done this <pause dur="0.4"/> is to break these <pause dur="0.4"/> aneurysms down by size <pause dur="0.4"/> we've put them into three groups <pause dur="0.5"/> very small <pause dur="0.4"/> small <pause dur="0.5"/> and larger <pause dur="1.9"/> and we've looked at a crude rupture rate <pause dur="0.4"/> 
per a hundred person years <pause dur="1.9"/> very very small for these aneurysms <pause dur="1.5"/> becoming significant for these aneurysms <pause dur="2.2"/> and <pause dur="1.1"/> more than one in four likely to rupture <pause dur="0.6"/> for these larger aneurysms <pause dur="1.5"/> i understand you haven't learned about hazard ratios <pause dur="0.5"/> but this is another way of quantifying the risk <pause dur="1.3"/> as to how much the risk increases for each centimetre in diameter of the aorta <pause dur="1.9"/> and because various other things might influence rupture <pause dur="0.4"/> such as smoking status and blood pressure <pause dur="0.7"/> we've needed to adjust for those <pause dur="5.3"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> and from these series we looked at a hundred-and-three patients with ruptured aortic aneurysm <pause dur="0.2"/> and this was their fate <pause dur="1.8"/> twenty-six <pause dur="0.2"/> or <pause dur="0.5"/> about a quarter died without even reaching hospital <pause dur="2.0"/> fifty-three arrived in hospital <pause dur="0.5"/> but were too sick or ill to contemplate corrective surgery <pause dur="2.5"/> corrective surgery was planned in less than a quarter <pause dur="2.0"/> and # only a very small proportion <pause dur="0.5"/> about ten per cent <pause dur="0.6"/> were alive thirty days after the surgery <pause dur="1.6"/> so <pause dur="0.6"/> pretty dire consequences <pause dur="0.3"/> if your 
aneurysm ruptures <pause dur="1.3"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> what does the surgeon do <pause dur="0.9"/> well the surgeon opens you up and has a look at your aneurysm and this is one here <pause dur="2.5"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> and he opens it up <pause dur="1.1"/> and he corrects it by inserting a Dacron tube <pause dur="0.2"/> or she preferably <pause dur="1.5"/> she's have got much better hands and more nimble hands than men <pause dur="0.2"/> whatever <gap reason="name" extent="2 words"/> might say in <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> <pause dur="3.3"/><vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" n="ss" dur="2"/> so this is a cartoon of the operation <pause dur="2.0"/> now then <pause dur="0.2"/> you can't do this operation <pause dur="0.9"/> without some risks <pause dur="1.6"/> and it's quite difficult to ascribe <pause dur="0.3"/> a risk to this operation <pause dur="1.1"/> 'cause you can do this operation <pause dur="0.5"/> electively <pause dur="0.7"/> that is if you find <pause dur="0.3"/> by chance <pause dur="0.3"/> a large aneurysm in a patient <pause dur="0.8"/> say an eight centimetre one <pause dur="0.3"/> you might think the risks of this bursting are so high <pause dur="0.7"/> i need to do an operation to correct it <pause dur="2.9"/> if you go and read all those learned journals <pause dur="0.7"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> you will see <pause dur="0.4"/> that the risk of this operation <pause dur="0.9"/> depends very much on the type of study <pause dur="0.4"/> whether it is <pause dur="0.2"/> prospective <pause dur="0.4"/> or retrospective <pause dur="1.6"/> whether it's population <pause dur="0.3"/> based <pause dur="0.6"/> hospital based <pause dur="0.8"/> or 
comes from a very selected hospital <pause dur="0.4"/> such as <pause dur="0.2"/> the National Heart and Lung Hospital <pause dur="3.0"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> perhaps what you'll notice here <pause dur="0.7"/> is that the As <pause dur="0.3"/> the population based studies <pause dur="0.7"/> indicate that the mortality rate for this operation <pause dur="0.7"/> is quite high <pause dur="0.4"/> it's # probably somewhere in the region of eight per cent <pause dur="1.8"/> if you go and look at hospital based studies particularly retrospective ones <pause dur="1.3"/> the mortality rate drops <pause dur="1.6"/> and selected series <pause dur="0.7"/> published in the nineteen early nineteen-nineties <pause dur="0.8"/> from a very smart important hospital suggested that the mortality rate <pause dur="0.6"/> in really good surgeons' hands was only about two per cent <pause dur="2.2"/> now of course how do you report your <trunc>r</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> mortality rates <pause dur="2.4"/> you usually keep <pause dur="0.5"/> a record of consecutive patients that come to see you with this condition <pause dur="2.4"/> you can start that record <pause dur="0.3"/> when you like <pause dur="0.9"/> and you can stop it when you like <pause dur="2.6"/> so supposing <pause dur="0.9"/> that i have <pause dur="0.2"/> approximately two-hundred patients like this come to see me each year <pause dur="1.5"/> at the beginning of two-thousand-and-two <pause dur="1.3"/> the first two patients 
operated on <pause dur="1.5"/> died within thirty days after surgery <pause dur="0.8"/> so i thought it would be better to start my series on the first of February <pause dur="0.4"/> two-thousand-and-two <pause dur="2.0"/> we then did a hundred operations <pause dur="0.8"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> all the patients survived and did wonderfully <pause dur="3.1"/> by the time we came to patient a hundred-and-three in October two-thousand-and-two <pause dur="0.6"/> we had a little bit of run of bad luck <pause dur="0.9"/> and a few more patients died <pause dur="1.7"/> so when we wrote up this series for a learned journal <pause dur="0.7"/> we decided only to include those consecutive patients <pause dur="0.4"/> between the first of February two-thousand-and-two <pause dur="0.8"/> and the thirtieth of September two-thousand-and-two <pause dur="0.4"/> 'cause this gave us a perfect record <pause dur="1.6"/> it's very difficult to work out what the true mortality rate is <pause dur="0.5"/> for this operation <pause dur="3.6"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> but quite clearly <pause dur="0.2"/> given that there is a significant mortality rate <pause dur="1.2"/> if you find one of these aneurysms in somebody <pause dur="0.8"/> what do you do <pause dur="0.9"/> do you let it grow and rupture <pause dur="1.7"/> or do you offer them an operation <pause dur="1.1"/> and where's the balancing point <pause dur="0.5"/> in terms of the size 
of this aneurysm <pause dur="1.3"/> and what else does it depend on <pause dur="1.2"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> and if you ask a vascular surgeon <pause dur="0.4"/> this person who operates on these <pause dur="0.7"/> they'll think it's going to be depend on the age perhaps the sex <pause dur="0.4"/> how fit are these patients can they still walk about <pause dur="0.8"/> have they got very good lung function <pause dur="0.3"/> and other physiological parameters <pause dur="1.6"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> so to find out about this and this was now about twelve thirteen years ago <pause dur="0.4"/> we did a survey of vascular surgeons in Britain <pause dur="1.2"/> and it's very useful <pause dur="0.3"/> to get information <pause dur="0.3"/> via professional bodies <pause dur="2.8"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> and it turned out <pause dur="0.2"/> that surgeons really <pause dur="0.2"/> had no idea what to do <pause dur="0.7"/> what was the best policy <pause dur="0.5"/> if they found a patient who had one of these swellings which was between <pause dur="0.4"/> four and five-and-a-half centimetres in diameter <pause dur="1.3"/> they didn't know <pause dur="0.4"/> this is a grey area <pause dur="0.5"/> and therefore <pause dur="0.3"/> it's an excellent area <pause dur="0.6"/> for a clinical trial <pause dur="1.6"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> and you might ask whether it was better <pause dur="0.4"/> to have a policy of early elective surgery <pause dur="1.0"/> or just monitor the size of the aneurysm there <pause dur="1.7"/> and see <pause dur="0.6"/> which was the best <pause dur="0.5"/> 
treatment method <pause dur="0.6"/> with respect to <pause dur="0.2"/> how many deaths occurred <pause dur="3.0"/> vascular surgeons can't do this by themselves <pause dur="0.9"/> they need a lot of skills to put together a clinical trial <pause dur="0.3"/> including a statistician <pause dur="0.7"/> very good to have an important statistician <pause dur="0.4"/> however much you may think that <trunc>st</trunc> statistics is very difficult <pause dur="3.0"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> once you're doing a big complex trial it's useful to look at more than mortality <pause dur="1.7"/> and we wanted to look at quality of life of two treatments <pause dur="0.5"/> the costs of two treatments <pause dur="0.9"/> and the cost-effectiveness of two treatments <pause dur="2.8"/> also allowed us to look at other things <pause dur="1.1"/> such as the risk of aneurysm rupture <pause dur="0.4"/> perhaps some biological things as genes <pause dur="0.6"/> predicting <pause dur="0.3"/> prognosis or the rate of aneurysm growth <pause dur="0.6"/> and it allowed us to do some real statistical work <pause dur="0.6"/> which the statisticians did <pause dur="0.4"/> on how you model aneurysm growth <pause dur="0.6"/> and depending how the time goes as to whether i'll talk about that later <pause dur="2.3"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> design <pause dur="0.4"/> is always best when it's simple for something like this <pause dur="1.3"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> from our poll of vascular 
surgeons this was the grey area <pause dur="0.5"/> this was the area where they didn't know what to do so they could put their hands on their heart and say to the patient <pause dur="0.5"/> i don't know what to do <pause dur="0.9"/> i think you <pause dur="0.2"/> might have just as good a chance with early surgery <pause dur="0.5"/> or observation surveillance for growth <pause dur="0.9"/> and i'd like you to join us in a trial <pause dur="0.4"/> to see what's best for patients <pause dur="4.4"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> we had to try and work out before we started <pause dur="0.6"/> how many patients we would need <pause dur="1.4"/> and because you'd seen that on the group of people doing this <pause dur="0.9"/> the most populous group was vascular surgeons <pause dur="0.4"/> there was the automatic assumption <pause dur="0.6"/> that surgery <pause dur="0.4"/> would be best for these patients <pause dur="2.0"/> and i said it's quite difficult to know what the operative mortality is <pause dur="0.9"/> but they thought they'd go with the <pause dur="0.2"/> figures that suggested <pause dur="1.3"/> if you did an # <pause dur="0.2"/> operation electively <pause dur="0.4"/> two per cent of these patients would die <pause dur="0.5"/> within thirty days thereafter <pause dur="1.2"/> and because this is an <pause dur="0.4"/> older group of people <pause dur="0.9"/> there's a general mortality which they thought was six per cent per annum <pause dur="2.6"/> 
they thought if you just had your aneurysm watched <pause dur="0.8"/> you probably had a two-and-a-half per cent per annum <pause dur="0.3"/> chance of your aneurysm rupturing <pause dur="0.4"/> and most of you would die if your aneurysm ruptured <pause dur="0.5"/> plus <pause dur="0.4"/> the normal six per cent per annum <pause dur="1.4"/> and on that basis <pause dur="0.9"/> we thought <pause dur="1.2"/> that after five years <pause dur="0.4"/> the survival <pause dur="1.5"/> and the survival is here on the vertical axis <pause dur="0.4"/> would be seventy-one per cent in those that had an early operation <pause dur="1.2"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> sixty-two per cent <pause dur="0.7"/> in those that were just monitored to see whether they grew bigger <pause dur="0.3"/> to arrange where surgeons were convinced you needed an operation <pause dur="2.1"/> i understand that this is something you haven't dealt yet <pause dur="0.3"/> with yet is power <pause dur="1.0"/> but <pause dur="0.4"/> this is something we needed to have any chance of showing this definitively <pause dur="0.4"/> we had to recruit about a thousand patients <pause dur="2.7"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> we had to be careful about how we randomized these patients <pause dur="0.7"/> we couldn't allow any fiddling we couldn't have a series of closed envelopes in each centre <pause dur="0.3"/> where we were going to recruit patients <pause dur="0.3"/> 'cause we had 
to do this through lots of hospitals <pause dur="0.3"/> and in fact we did it through ninety-three hospitals in Britain <pause dur="1.3"/> and so we used a central <pause dur="0.5"/> computer <pause dur="0.3"/> for randomization <pause dur="0.4"/> to avoid bias <pause dur="5.0"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> measurement <pause dur="0.8"/> trial and error <pause dur="0.3"/> and this is where we start talking about error <pause dur="0.9"/> and again this is a cartoon <pause dur="1.0"/> of using an ultrasound probe <pause dur="1.3"/> to measure both the maximum diameter <pause dur="1.0"/> and to see whether we could work out the ratio <pause dur="0.3"/> of the normal diameter here <pause dur="0.5"/><kinesic desc="indicates point on slide" iterated="n"/> to the maximum diameter here <pause dur="1.7"/><kinesic desc="indicates point on slide" iterated="n"/> and although it would be very nice to do this <pause dur="0.4"/> it turns out that <kinesic desc="indicates point on slide" iterated="n"/> here the # images are so fuzzy <pause dur="0.7"/> it's very difficult even for experienced people to measure <pause dur="1.9"/> and if you do it here <pause dur="0.5"/><kinesic desc="indicates point on slide" iterated="n"/> you can measure the diameter either from front to back <pause dur="0.4"/> A-P <pause dur="0.2"/> anterior posterior <pause dur="0.8"/> or from side to side <pause dur="1.0"/> and because of the actual physics of ultrasound <pause dur="0.6"/> you can measure it more accurately <pause dur="0.2"/> from anterior <pause dur="0.2"/> to posterior <pause dur="2.8"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> but we wanted to design this trial to work through five regions in Britain <pause dur="1.1"/> and each one have a dedicated trial coordinator who are going to 
look after the patients and measure the size of their aneurysm <pause dur="1.1"/> so a question that <pause dur="0.3"/> came to our mind was <pause dur="1.2"/> could we be sure that different people <pause dur="0.4"/> would measure an aneurysm <pause dur="0.2"/> in the same way <pause dur="1.7"/> so we actually did <pause dur="0.2"/> a little experiment <pause dur="0.7"/> taking <pause dur="0.2"/> different people <pause dur="0.2"/> who knew how to use an ultrasound machine observers <pause dur="0.4"/> giving them <pause dur="0.3"/> an array of patients <pause dur="0.4"/> with different diameter aortas <pause dur="0.3"/> to see how well they did <pause dur="2.2"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> and we <trunc>h</trunc> <pause dur="0.6"/> the first study we did we had ten patients <pause dur="0.3"/> and then we increased the number of patients <pause dur="1.6"/> and we also looked <pause dur="0.3"/> and i'll tell you about that later on <pause dur="0.3"/> # looking measuring aneurysm diameter using a different modality <pause dur="0.2"/> computed tomography <pause dur="0.3"/> or C-T <pause dur="2.5"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> right <pause dur="0.6"/> here's the ultrasound <pause dur="1.2"/> the one you saw before <pause dur="0.3"/> you can measure this either in this dimension transverse <pause dur="0.5"/> or this dimension <pause dur="1.1"/> A-P <pause dur="4.0"/> using A-P <pause dur="1.1"/> and a large number of different patients <pause dur="0.4"/> we took just two <pause dur="0.3"/> single <pause dur="0.2"/> experienced ultrasonographers <pause dur="1.6"/> and we said <pause dur="0.4"/> measure these aneurysms for us and record them <pause dur="1.9"/> and this shows that data <pause dur="1.4"/> this is the 
difference in aneurysm diameter <pause dur="0.3"/> recorded between <pause dur="0.2"/> ultrasonographer A and ultrasonographer B <pause dur="0.8"/> against the mean aneurysm diameter <pause dur="0.8"/> the mean of those two observers <pause dur="4.5"/> you can see <pause dur="0.3"/> that the distribution <pause dur="0.4"/> of results <pause dur="0.2"/> is around the zero line <pause dur="1.2"/> but for instance <pause dur="1.0"/> in this particular case <pause dur="1.2"/> observer A <pause dur="0.2"/> measured the aneurysm diameter <pause dur="0.9"/> at <pause dur="0.3"/> point-four of a centimetre bigger than observer B <pause dur="1.8"/> whilst here <pause dur="0.8"/><kinesic desc="indicates point on slide" iterated="n"/> they had measured it point-four of a centimetre <pause dur="0.4"/> smaller <pause dur="2.6"/> this type <pause dur="0.2"/> of display of data <pause dur="0.3"/> is known to me at least as a Bland Altman plot <pause dur="0.3"/> after two <pause dur="0.3"/> quite famous <pause dur="0.2"/> British statisticians <pause dur="0.4"/> Martin Bland <pause dur="0.4"/> and his partner Altman <pause dur="1.2"/> not partner <pause dur="0.8"/> domestic partner statistical partner <pause dur="2.9"/> <vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" n="ss" dur="1"/> and it's a very useful way <pause dur="0.2"/> of displaying measurement data <pause dur="0.3"/> for error <pause dur="1.4"/> so <pause dur="0.3"/> we looked at this and we were appalled <pause dur="0.4"/> how could we hope to recruit patients from all over Britain <pause dur="1.3"/> measure aneurysms to make sure that they didn't grow bigger than five-point-five <pause dur="0.4"/> and have 
this done reliably <pause dur="1.8"/> how do you think we could improve on this </u><pause dur="4.0"/> <u who="sm0281" trans="pause"> <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> </u><pause dur="2.6"/> <u who="nf0279" trans="pause"> one suggestion </u><pause dur="2.4"/> <u who="sm0282" trans="pause"> use the same person to measure all your aortas </u><pause dur="0.8"/> <u who="nf0279" trans="pause"> yes <pause dur="1.5"/> now if we're going to recruit people in Edinburgh and Plymouth </u><pause dur="0.2"/> <u who="sm0282" trans="pause"> <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/></u><u who="nf0279" trans="overlap"> they're going to be <pause dur="0.2"/> pretty busy aren't they <pause dur="1.2"/> and interestingly <pause dur="0.7"/> a good way to reduce error <pause dur="0.2"/> and it must be very obvious to you when i say it <pause dur="0.3"/> is training <pause dur="1.1"/> in fact we wanted to make this trial work using just five people <pause dur="1.2"/> and we found if we trained them and trained them and trained them <pause dur="0.6"/> you use this part of the line <pause dur="0.3"/> to place your cursor <pause dur="0.6"/> for your measurement <pause dur="0.6"/> you angle the probe this way so you make really sure <pause dur="0.3"/> you've got the maximum diameter <pause dur="0.7"/> we found that we could do much better <pause dur="1.0"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> and here are just ten patients and five coordinators the ones we used for the trial <pause dur="1.3"/> and you can see that you still get a spread of aneurysm diameter this is now the patient number <pause dur="0.8"/> and this is the aneurysm diameter <pause dur="0.8"/> 
measured by <pause dur="0.3"/> five different coordinators in different colours <pause dur="0.6"/> and you're still getting a spread of about <pause dur="0.4"/> point-three point-four millimetres <pause dur="0.7"/> but it's a lot better <pause dur="0.2"/> than the previous one <pause dur="0.7"/> with no training and no training together <pause dur="3.1"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> so <pause dur="0.8"/> i haven't shown you all of this but you need to measure the anterior posterior diameter <pause dur="1.4"/> you can't measure diameter that <trunc>re</trunc> reproducibly <pause dur="0.7"/> and this measurement error <pause dur="0.3"/> is really important in the way you design <pause dur="0.5"/> any work you do <pause dur="2.7"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> and what about computer tomography <pause dur="0.7"/> this is a C-T scan of an abdomen <pause dur="0.7"/> and this is the abdominal aorta here <kinesic desc="indicates point on slide" iterated="n"/><pause dur="1.5"/> <kinesic desc="indicates point on slide" iterated="n"/> this red line is the transverse diameter <pause dur="1.7"/><kinesic desc="indicates point on slide" iterated="n"/> this grey stuff round the side here <pause dur="0.3"/> is mainly laminated thrombus filling up <pause dur="0.2"/> the centre of the aorta <pause dur="1.7"/> and <kinesic desc="indicates point on slide" iterated="n"/> this is the outline it looks a little bit dark partly <pause dur="0.4"/> and white because partly because this is calcification in the aortic wall <pause dur="4.2"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> here we have <pause dur="2.9"/> a limited number of patients <pause dur="0.8"/> with known C-T aneurysm diameter <pause dur="1.2"/> we've taken our five observers 
we used in the trial <pause dur="0.7"/> and we've asked them to measure it by ultrasound using the anterior posterior diameter <pause dur="1.0"/> and this is what we come up with <pause dur="2.6"/> first of all you will see that <kinesic desc="indicates point on slide" iterated="n"/> this line <pause dur="0.8"/> lies above the zero <pause dur="1.0"/> so the difference between ultrasound and A-P <pause dur="0.5"/> A-P <unclear>in</unclear> the C-T diameter <pause dur="0.4"/> is usually positive <pause dur="0.9"/> I-E <pause dur="0.3"/> we appear to be measuring the aneurysm larger when we use ultrasound <pause dur="0.3"/> than we <trunc>u</trunc> when we use C-T scan <pause dur="2.1"/> in addition there is something we haven't seen before <pause dur="0.8"/> in that there appears to be a positive skew up <kinesic desc="indicates point on slide" iterated="n"/> here <pause dur="1.5"/> that the difference <pause dur="0.8"/> between ultrasound <pause dur="1.5"/> and C-T appears to increase <pause dur="0.3"/> with increasing aneurysm diameter <pause dur="1.8"/> so here we have some evidence that there's some magnification <pause dur="0.3"/> or relative magnification <pause dur="0.5"/> associated with ultrasound <pause dur="0.8"/> but we don't actually know which the gold standard is <pause dur="0.3"/> and which is better <pause dur="1.6"/> this is again is a kind of Bland Altman plot <pause dur="0.9"/> and i suggest to you is much more informative <pause dur="0.4"/> than a straightforward correlation 
line <pause dur="1.1"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> if we'd done a correlation line <pause dur="0.3"/> we'd have seen something lice nice like this <pause dur="0.5"/> oh <pause dur="0.3"/> fantastic agreement between the two different sorts of measurements <pause dur="0.8"/> and when you think about it <pause dur="0.3"/> you're measuring exactly the same thing <pause dur="0.3"/> you're measuring how wide the aorta is <pause dur="0.4"/> and just one you're using a C-T scanner and one you're using ultrasound <pause dur="0.7"/> so <pause dur="0.2"/> if it didn't agree very well <pause dur="1.0"/> well it wouldn't look very good would it <pause dur="0.9"/> and you <trunc>ca</trunc> <pause dur="0.4"/> not very informative at all <pause dur="1.5"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> so <pause dur="0.6"/> measurement <pause dur="0.6"/> <trunc>repea</trunc> <pause dur="0.6"/> random error <pause dur="0.3"/> reproduceability <pause dur="0.5"/> very very important <pause dur="1.5"/> but <pause dur="0.3"/> because ultrasound is safe <pause dur="0.4"/> it's cheap <pause dur="0.2"/> it's non-invasive <pause dur="1.0"/> and there are very few false positives or false negatives <pause dur="0.9"/> and it can detect ninety-nine per cent of aortas <pause dur="1.1"/> it's the chosen method <pause dur="0.8"/> for screening and surveillance <pause dur="0.7"/> of aortic aneurysms <pause dur="2.8"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> right <pause dur="0.6"/> so we did this trial <pause dur="1.2"/> we recruited patients <trunc>w</trunc> slightly more than the thousand we thought we needed <pause dur="0.4"/> over a four year period we followed them up to see how they did <pause dur="1.9"/> we flagged these patients with the 
Office of National Statistics and this is a very valuable resource that we have <pause dur="0.4"/> in Britain <pause dur="1.4"/> whereas you can get <pause dur="0.3"/> at the end of a research project <pause dur="0.9"/> the date of death <pause dur="0.3"/> and the cause of death <pause dur="0.3"/> of patients entered into this 'cause they're all recorded centrally in Southport <pause dur="3.6"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> and this was the principal results of the trial <pause dur="0.3"/> as reported in the Lancet in nineteen-ninety-eight <pause dur="0.7"/> on the vertical axis here <pause dur="0.4"/> we had the proportion of patients surviving <pause dur="0.9"/> this is the time in years <pause dur="0.7"/> and this is the number of patients at risk at each time interval <pause dur="2.0"/> this kind of display is known as a life table <pause dur="1.4"/> we can see here in yellow the patients <pause dur="0.3"/> undergoing <pause dur="0.3"/> surveillance of their small aneurysm <pause dur="0.3"/> as opposed to those with early surgery <pause dur="1.2"/> and what we'd predicted was <pause dur="0.6"/> that the <pause dur="0.2"/> blue line would <trunc>h</trunc> be up here at five years <pause dur="0.3"/> and the yellow line <pause dur="0.5"/> would be <pause dur="1.0"/> down here <pause dur="0.2"/> <trunc>dow</trunc> way down here at five years <pause dur="2.4"/> we didn't find that <pause dur="2.6"/> fairly <trunc>f</trunc> steady attrition in the surveillance arm <pause dur="2.7"/> surgery arm <pause dur="0.9"/> marked attrition early <pause dur="0.9"/> levelling 
off <pause dur="1.8"/> bearing in mind that <pause dur="0.3"/> out here having started with more than five-hundred patients in each arm of the trial <pause dur="0.4"/> not very many patients <pause dur="0.9"/> with so few patients the error around here <pause dur="0.3"/> is probably quite large <pause dur="2.6"/> but <pause dur="0.2"/> the statisticians the trial steering committee <pause dur="0.6"/> the journals and the public <pause dur="0.8"/> were convinced enough to <trunc>s</trunc> <pause dur="0.4"/> that this result suggested <pause dur="0.8"/> that there was no difference <pause dur="0.4"/> in survival <pause dur="0.7"/> if you operated early <pause dur="0.8"/> on this <trunc>condi</trunc> for this condition <pause dur="0.2"/> or whether you left it till later <pause dur="2.4"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> now very often one trial isn't <trunc>en</trunc> <pause dur="0.6"/> sorry <pause dur="1.5"/> we also looked at the health service cost 'cause i said we wanted to look at more things <pause dur="0.6"/> and this were the costs of the two treatments <pause dur="1.5"/> here <pause dur="0.2"/> early surgery and surveillance and you can break this down into how much the surveillance costs how much the hospital treatment for repair costs <pause dur="0.5"/> how much other health service costs are <pause dur="0.8"/> and the bottom line for this is <pause dur="1.1"/> that surgery is a much more expensive treatment option <pause dur="0.4"/> than surveillance <pause dur="1.3"/> and of course we live in 
a <pause dur="0.2"/> cash-strapped <pause dur="0.3"/> National Health Service <pause dur="0.4"/> so this is important <pause dur="1.5"/> it perhaps wouldn't have been so important <pause dur="0.3"/> if quality of life <pause dur="0.8"/> had been <pause dur="0.5"/> different <pause dur="0.3"/> in the two treatment arms <pause dur="0.9"/> but there was almost no different in quality of life between the two treatment arms <pause dur="1.8"/> so therefore with a similar survival <pause dur="1.0"/> similar quality of life <pause dur="0.7"/> but one treatment <pause dur="0.5"/> costing <pause dur="0.2"/> much more <pause dur="0.2"/> than the other <pause dur="1.5"/> what do you think the National Health Service wants <pause dur="1.6"/> surveillance <pause dur="1.8"/> and in fact vascular surgeons across Europe <pause dur="0.6"/> were quite happy <pause dur="0.3"/> with this result <pause dur="1.1"/> and for these reasons <pause dur="0.8"/> probably wouldn't <pause dur="0.4"/> would no longer recommend <pause dur="1.3"/> elective surgery <pause dur="0.7"/> for patients with aneurysms less than five-and-a-half centimetres <pause dur="2.1"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> but you see here <pause dur="1.7"/> that the operative mortality rate <pause dur="0.4"/> in this population based study <pause dur="0.8"/> was far more <pause dur="0.2"/> than we'd used in the power calculations <pause dur="0.4"/> we'd expected two per cent <pause dur="0.4"/> taking from best vascular surgeon series <pause dur="0.6"/> and in fact it was five-point-six per cent <pause dur="5.5"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> and when since we started the trial <pause dur="0.2"/> there were several other <pause dur="0.4"/> 
population based studies <pause dur="0.3"/> reporting the mortality <pause dur="0.4"/> for this operation <pause dur="2.2"/> turns out it for some reason it's lowest in Western Australia <pause dur="0.7"/> and i don't think it's just 'cause they have the most fantastic surgeons in the world in Perth <pause dur="0.4"/> or that it's the most fantastic place in the world to live <pause dur="2.1"/> i think very much probably most of these are very similar <pause dur="2.9"/> and the mortality associated with the elective repair of this condition <pause dur="0.5"/> is probably somewhere between five and six per cent <pause dur="1.3"/> it's not such a safe operation <pause dur="1.9"/> if you <trunc>thi</trunc> think of it another way <pause dur="1.1"/> probably somewhere between one in seventeen and one in eighteen patients <pause dur="0.9"/> that you operate on <pause dur="0.5"/> electively is going to die <pause dur="3.9"/> so we'd # managed to convince Britain and Europe that perhaps you shouldn't operate on these small aneurysms <pause dur="0.9"/> the Americans of course weren't convinced they don't have <pause dur="0.3"/> a <pause dur="0.2"/> National Health Service <pause dur="0.4"/> they have insurance based private <pause dur="0.2"/> care for most of their patients <pause dur="1.1"/> and they mounted a very similar trial <pause dur="0.3"/> 
started the same time as the British trial <pause dur="0.8"/> and it's always nice to beat the Americans <pause dur="0.5"/> 'cause they didn't report their results until two-thousand-and-two <pause dur="0.2"/> four years later <pause dur="2.4"/> but they found exactly the same thing <pause dur="2.1"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> almost exactly the <trunc>sa</trunc> # <trunc>s</trunc> <trunc>s</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> same numbers of patients <pause dur="1.4"/> that in terms of mortality <pause dur="1.1"/> although this is plotted as survival <pause dur="0.4"/> no difference <pause dur="1.4"/> depending whether you operate early <pause dur="0.6"/> or you don't you just watch it <pause dur="2.3"/> but however this was four years later <pause dur="0.8"/> and by that time <pause dur="0.2"/> because of the Office of National Statistics <pause dur="0.4"/> we had four years more information <pause dur="0.4"/> on the patients that we'd had in the British trial <pause dur="2.0"/> and what i'd said to you before was that we didn't have very many numbers out here <pause dur="1.6"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> we didn't we only had about fifty-two and sixty-three <pause dur="3.0"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> by the time we get to two-thousand-and-two <pause dur="0.4"/> we've got large numbers of patients out here <pause dur="0.5"/> we've removed some of the noise in these curves <pause dur="1.0"/> and we can see that these curves appear to be <pause dur="0.3"/> starting to separate <pause dur="1.1"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> ah and the vascular surgeons shout with 
glee <pause dur="0.3"/> now we've got evidence that we can operate on these people <pause dur="0.3"/> 'cause they like operating <pause dur="1.6"/> but actually caution caution caution <pause dur="0.3"/> it doesn't really show that at all <pause dur="1.6"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> and you can look at this data another way <pause dur="0.4"/> you can integrate the areas under those curves <pause dur="0.5"/> and you can look at the average life expectancy of patients since their <trunc>ori</trunc> original enrolment in the trial <pause dur="1.6"/> and you can see that if you have early surgery <pause dur="0.3"/> that's your life expectancy <pause dur="0.6"/> if you have surveillance <pause dur="0.4"/> that's your life expectancy <pause dur="0.5"/> and there's absolutely no difference between the two of them <pause dur="1.5"/> again <pause dur="0.2"/> right out at the long time periods we don't have that many patients <pause dur="0.4"/> there's a large degree of error <pause dur="1.8"/> but there are some interesting reasons <pause dur="0.3"/> as to why those curves <pause dur="0.3"/> might diverge at a <unclear>late</unclear> <pause dur="0.2"/> time points <pause dur="0.6"/> and those reasons are principally attributable to the fact <pause dur="1.1"/> that the operation <pause dur="1.6"/> is quite a major trauma <pause dur="0.7"/> patients are in hospital for more than a week <pause dur="1.1"/> and the one thing it really <trunc>f</trunc> 
does force them to do is to stop smoking <pause dur="1.6"/> and most of these patients <pause dur="0.4"/> smoke <pause dur="1.8"/> or have smoked <pause dur="1.0"/> or will tell you they've stopped smoking and are still smoking <pause dur="1.2"/> a prolonged hospitalization of seven to ten days <pause dur="0.3"/> really enforces that <pause dur="0.6"/> and a lot of the late benefit we might see <pause dur="0.4"/> might be simply attributable to the fact <pause dur="0.3"/> that those who have their operation early <pause dur="0.3"/> stop smoking early <pause dur="4.6"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> so <pause dur="1.5"/> if you come to a consultation at the end of last year or even at the beginning of this year <pause dur="0.9"/> and what's the evidence <pause dur="0.7"/> we've now got two trials <pause dur="0.6"/> and i think the evidence from both trials is <pause dur="1.1"/> don't operate on these aneurysms when they're small <pause dur="0.4"/> the risks <pause dur="0.4"/> of your patient dying <pause dur="0.6"/> afterwards are too high <pause dur="3.9"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> recently we've seen reported <pause dur="1.3"/> a trial of screening 'cause obviously one of the important questions would be <pause dur="0.3"/> well <pause dur="0.3"/> 'cause we can detect these and five per cent of people over sixty have got them men <pause dur="0.5"/> do we need to do a screening programme for them <pause dur="1.4"/> a screening trial was reported recently and suggested <pause dur="0.4"/> might 
be cost-effective <pause dur="2.0"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> but of course if a screening trial's really going to be cost-effective you need to find these things when they're small <pause dur="0.3"/> and you need to stop them growing <pause dur="0.9"/> how can we stop them growing if we don't know how to measure growth <pause dur="2.7"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> now there's a suggestion <pause dur="1.8"/> from retrospective studies <pause dur="1.0"/> that small aneurysms <pause dur="1.4"/> grow <pause dur="0.2"/> <trunc>s</trunc> <pause dur="1.0"/> more slowly <pause dur="0.4"/> than medium <trunc>s</trunc> <pause dur="0.4"/> size aneurysms <pause dur="0.5"/> and the largest aneurysms <pause dur="0.3"/> grow fastest of all <pause dur="3.0"/> we looked at growth rates <pause dur="0.6"/> of again <pause dur="0.3"/> seventeen-hundred patients <pause dur="0.6"/> this was their starting aneurysm diameter so that you can see that the main aneurysm diameter at the start <pause dur="0.4"/> is somewhere about four-and-a-half centimetres <pause dur="1.2"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> this was the nine longest series for aneurysm growth <pause dur="1.6"/> and the first thing you can see is just by looking at the shapes is <pause dur="0.5"/> that actually they're all different <pause dur="0.3"/> and actually <pause dur="0.4"/> one of them even gets smaller <pause dur="2.2"/> tells you we don't know very much about this condition <pause dur="1.7"/> some of them seem to fit nicely to exponential curves some to straight lines <pause dur="2.1"/> if you 
look in the literature the only thing that had ever been used before <pause dur="0.4"/> for modelling aneurysm growths and taking <pause dur="0.2"/> data points and working out how fast do they grow <pause dur="0.3"/> was linear regression modelling <pause dur="0.8"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> and i'm sure you'll have heard of that <pause dur="0.5"/> trying to draw a <trunc>s</trunc> <pause dur="0.6"/> the best straight line <pause dur="0.5"/> between your points <pause dur="1.0"/> and i've drawn three lines on here <pause dur="0.4"/> four lines <pause dur="0.2"/> and you can see how bad they are <pause dur="0.5"/> for most of the cases <pause dur="0.5"/> if you draw just straight lines <pause dur="3.1"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> there's another problem <pause dur="1.0"/> when you've got real people <pause dur="0.5"/> and you've got continuous measures of data <pause dur="0.5"/> and i'm going to talk about aneurysm diameter but it could relate to anything <pause dur="0.8"/> and that's to do <pause dur="0.2"/> with truncation of series <pause dur="0.4"/> what makes <pause dur="0.2"/> you stop looking at someone <pause dur="2.5"/> going to consider a <pause dur="0.9"/> conceptual patient here or a virtual patient who starts with an aneurysm diameter of four centimetres <pause dur="0.8"/> has that diameter measured every six months <pause dur="0.7"/> no change no change <pause dur="0.9"/> no worries <pause dur="0.4"/> suddenly <pause dur="0.5"/> eighteen months <pause dur="1.1"/> there's a high reading and they've gone to 
the five-point-five centimetre threshold where you might think about surgery <pause dur="1.1"/> the person's nice and fit <pause dur="0.3"/> still plays two rounds of golf a week or whatever <pause dur="1.2"/> and the surgeon says <pause dur="0.4"/> come in for an operation <pause dur="2.4"/> now perhaps if that <pause dur="0.2"/> patient had been coughing and spluttering <pause dur="1.4"/> the surgeon would have said <pause dur="0.6"/> i think we need to have a some sort of fitness programme before i think about operating on this <pause dur="0.4"/> come back and see me do this this and this we'll have some physiotherapy <pause dur="0.6"/> come back in so many months <pause dur="0.7"/> next time they come back <pause dur="2.3"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> the reading is <pause dur="0.3"/> ah <pause dur="0.4"/> just under four centimetres <pause dur="1.5"/> trial and error <pause dur="0.2"/> measurement error <pause dur="0.5"/> we can't measure it exactly <pause dur="1.7"/> ah <pause dur="0.4"/> not to worry now <pause dur="0.7"/> we'll keep on following you up <pause dur="0.3"/> and this is what happens <pause dur="1.8"/> and you can see that if you draw straight lines between these points <pause dur="0.3"/> you get quite slow aneurysm growth <pause dur="1.0"/> if you draw it between these <kinesic desc="indicates point on slide" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.5"/> you get quite high aneurysm growth <pause dur="0.8"/> you truncated your series here <pause dur="0.5"/> and you've got an artifically high growth rate <pause dur="0.4"/> using this approach <pause dur="1.7"/> of course 
that's not the only thing that happens to patients <pause dur="0.6"/> patients die <pause dur="1.7"/> let's take another patient <pause dur="2.0"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> four measures <pause dur="0.8"/> and suddenly they die <pause dur="0.3"/> from a myocardial infarction <pause dur="1.5"/> so <pause dur="0.7"/> you simulate their growth <pause dur="1.2"/> you get a nice line across here <pause dur="0.9"/> but if they hadn't died <pause dur="0.5"/> perhaps this would have happened <pause dur="1.2"/> and the growth rate would have been quite different <pause dur="1.3"/> so by not having this <pause dur="0.2"/> continuity that you can have in laboratory experiments <pause dur="0.3"/> where you can go and watch cells dividing <pause dur="0.7"/> for <pause dur="0.2"/> days on end <pause dur="0.9"/> people are different and there are other problems <pause dur="0.3"/> when it comes to trying to measure things and work things out <pause dur="1.5"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> statistician very clever no equations here <pause dur="0.4"/> use some flexible modelling <pause dur="0.5"/> i don't understand what any of this means and if <pause dur="0.2"/> you do you're all <trunc>h</trunc> absolute heroes and heroines <pause dur="1.6"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> but <pause dur="0.2"/> we can try and make some pragmatic rules <pause dur="0.6"/> using this modelling <pause dur="0.4"/> we want to know how to use data in clinical practice <pause dur="1.6"/> and we can therefore say that if you've got an aneurysm of four centimetres <pause dur="0.9"/> on average <pause dur="2.4"/> after five 
years <pause dur="0.5"/> seventy per cent of them <pause dur="0.4"/> will have reached the five-point-five centimetres threshold where you can consider surgery <pause dur="2.6"/> if you start <pause dur="0.2"/> at four-point <pause dur="0.4"/> sorry i showed you four-point-five centimetres <pause dur="0.6"/> if you start higher # bigger find aneurysms bigger <pause dur="0.4"/> you'll probably know that <pause dur="0.3"/> your chance of reaching <pause dur="0.3"/> the <trunc>fi</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> the threshold <pause dur="1.8"/> the surgery <pause dur="1.0"/> within five years is almost a hundred per cent for big aneurysms <pause dur="1.1"/> so it can tell you <pause dur="0.6"/> start to be able to give you information so that you can sit down with a patient with a five centimetre aneurysm and say <pause dur="0.6"/> well i suspect your aneurysm's going to keep on growing <pause dur="0.3"/> and the likelihood is <pause dur="1.0"/> that probably in about five years' time <pause dur="0.3"/> we might have to think of an operation <pause dur="0.7"/> but don't worry about it at the moment <pause dur="0.5"/> and there's another reason not to worry about it at the moment <pause dur="1.1"/> now i'm going to go quite quickly <pause dur="0.3"/> 'cause having said that i want to get to the end <pause dur="0.4"/> and i know that it's nearly lunchtime <pause dur="2.1"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> but just to reinforce <pause dur="0.2"/> let's show you what <pause dur="0.2"/> 
smoking does to aneurysm growth <pause dur="0.5"/> flexible modelling <pause dur="0.5"/> most of these patients with aneurysms have smoked <pause dur="0.7"/> this is the growth rate millimetres per year <pause dur="0.6"/> people who never smoked <pause dur="0.7"/> only twelve of those might as well forget about them <pause dur="0.7"/> ex-smokers <pause dur="0.4"/> some of these probably still smoking smokers don't like to tell you they can't stop smoking <pause dur="1.5"/> growth rate <pause dur="0.2"/> about two-point-four <trunc>millini</trunc> metres a year <pause dur="1.0"/> those who are actively smoking <pause dur="1.3"/> two-point-nine millimetres a year <pause dur="0.4"/> big difference <pause dur="0.3"/> so if you keep smoking <pause dur="0.3"/> you're going to grow faster <pause dur="0.3"/> you're going to come to surgery faster <pause dur="1.1"/> your lungs are going to be in worse shape <pause dur="0.2"/> and you're probably more likely to die <pause dur="2.0"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> if you'd used linear regression modelling <pause dur="0.4"/> this is what we'd have seen <pause dur="1.4"/> linear regression modelling <pause dur="1.2"/> exaggerates <pause dur="0.5"/> the effects of smoking <pause dur="1.4"/> and the possibility of giving up smoking <pause dur="0.7"/> in terms of helping your aneurysm growth <pause dur="1.6"/> and if we're going to be fair to patients we have to tell them this is what happens <pause dur="0.9"/> and not this <pause dur="0.6"/> and the reason this has 
arisen <pause dur="0.6"/> is probably because of truncation of patients <pause dur="4.5"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> right <pause dur="0.3"/> good reasons for your patients to wait <pause dur="1.0"/> technology <pause dur="0.5"/> is moving very very fast <pause dur="1.9"/> you no longer have to repair aneurysms using conventional open surgery <pause dur="0.6"/> and you can use endovascular repair <pause dur="1.9"/> you can insert a device <pause dur="1.1"/> through the femoral artery <pause dur="1.3"/> sometimes under local anaesthesia <pause dur="1.6"/> anchor it here with expandable stents <pause dur="2.1"/> probably don't anchor it here <trunc>y</trunc> most of the new devices come down into the iliac arteries <pause dur="0.4"/> and look a bit like this <kinesic desc="indicates point on slide" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.2"/> pair of trousers <pause dur="0.5"/> or like this <kinesic desc="indicates point on slide" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.8"/> and you can <trunc>s</trunc> insert these <pause dur="0.5"/> through quite small catheters through the femoral artery <pause dur="1.1"/> new technology <pause dur="1.6"/> how do we find out whether it works <pause dur="8.3"/> blind faith from the manufacturers <pause dur="1.3"/> Johnson and Johnson to the success again making more money <pause dur="0.5"/> i'm now going to charge you <pause dur="0.6"/> oops <pause dur="0.9"/> i'm now going to charge you five-thousand pounds for one of these <pause dur="0.3"/> whereas a little bit of Dacron tube i sold you previously was only fifty quid <pause dur="1.1"/> fantastic <pause dur="2.1"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> this is one of those # <pause dur="1.5"/> 
endovascular grafts being placed with a measuring device you can see all the little buttons going up there in the aorta to try the thoracoscopy when you place one <pause dur="1.1"/> and actually <pause dur="1.5"/> in population terms the health of the population <pause dur="0.3"/> we've got to find out <pause dur="0.6"/> whether the new technology is any good <pause dur="1.2"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> so we're starting all over at the beginning again <pause dur="0.2"/> although it's now been ongoing for two or three years <pause dur="0.5"/> with a new <pause dur="0.3"/> trial <pause dur="1.3"/> this time <pause dur="0.2"/> surgeons don't know whether it's better <pause dur="0.4"/> to treat these larger aneurysms <pause dur="0.5"/> with either the conventional open <pause dur="0.3"/> operation which everybody's been trained to do <pause dur="0.4"/> or with the new technology <pause dur="0.9"/> and this is being evaluated <pause dur="1.2"/> again <pause dur="0.2"/> we have to be aware of trial and error <pause dur="0.4"/> and measurement <pause dur="0.9"/> and we're very reliant on our statisticians <pause dur="0.9"/> to keep us in order give us the correct trial design <pause dur="0.3"/> and analyse the results correctly <pause dur="1.5"/> and even though i haven't <unclear>referred</unclear> to you <pause dur="0.3"/> any equations <pause dur="0.5"/> statisticians are absolutely vital <pause dur="0.5"/> for getting it right <pause dur="0.5"/> and getting the right information for the patients <pause dur="1.2"/> thank you for your attention <kinesic desc="applause" iterated="y" n="ss" dur="5"/>
