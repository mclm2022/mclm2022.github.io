level of the population <pause dur="0.2"/> last week <pause dur="1.3"/><vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.2"/> and at the level of the gene <pause dur="0.8"/> undefined idealistic gene <pause dur="0.5"/> Mendel's gene <pause dur="2.2"/> which we've identified so far with a locus on a chromosome <pause dur="1.8"/> but always at the back of our minds has been the fact that we all know that we live in the post-D-N-A age <pause dur="1.0"/> and there is another way of explaing genetic behaviour <pause dur="0.5"/> and that is to explain it at the molecular level <pause dur="0.7"/> to explain it in terms of this molecule <pause dur="0.5"/> deoxyribonucleic acid <pause dur="1.5"/> D-N-A <pause dur="2.1"/> and at about the same time that we discovered that D-N-A was the genetic <trunc>informa</trunc> the genetic # material <pause dur="1.4"/> we also <pause dur="0.6"/> were powerfully influenced by a theory <pause dur="0.5"/> that said genetic material must consist of information <pause dur="0.8"/> this was <pause dur="0.4"/> a theory <pause dur="0.8"/> which was based on <pause dur="0.8"/> early computer theory <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> but was much supported by <pause dur="1.3"/> the famous physicist Erwin Shr√∂dinger <pause dur="0.9"/> who during the last war <pause dur="0.4"/> lived understandably away from Germany in Dublin <pause dur="0.5"/> and he gave a very powerful <pause dur="0.2"/> series of lectures in Dublin called What is Life <pause dur="0.8"/> in which he propounded the 
view <pause dur="0.7"/> that <pause dur="0.3"/> at the bottom of life was genetics <pause dur="0.4"/> and at the bottom of genetics had to be some sort of information <pause dur="0.5"/> so we'll look at that information <pause dur="0.3"/> paradigm or model <pause dur="0.6"/> of # <pause dur="0.6"/> genetics alongside <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> information about D-N-A <pause dur="1.3"/> now i know that there are some of you <pause dur="0.6"/> who will have been talking about D-N-A <pause dur="0.5"/> for many years now and will be <pause dur="0.4"/> if <trunc>an</trunc> if <trunc>y</trunc> if it's possible to be <pause dur="0.6"/> and since i'm a D-N-A biochemist i don't think it's possible to be <pause dur="0.8"/> # may actually be bored with it <pause dur="0.7"/> well we'll try and <pause dur="0.3"/> # liven it up as much as we can <pause dur="0.2"/> when we talk <pause dur="2.6"/> the substance of this lecture <pause dur="1.0"/> has three parts <pause dur="1.0"/> # we're going to remind ourselves what the evidence is <pause dur="0.4"/> for D-N-A as the genetic material <pause dur="0.9"/> then we're going to look at nucleic acids as molecules <pause dur="1.1"/> and finally we're going to look at the functionality of D-N-A <pause dur="1.0"/> how this model of D-N-A as information maps onto biochemical mechanisms <pause dur="1.4"/> and in my second talk this afternoon we'll move on to talk a bit more about that <pause dur="3.6"/> so the evidence first of all then for D-N-A 
as the genetic material <pause dur="3.3"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> and there are two <pause dur="2.3"/> two canonical experiments <pause dur="0.9"/> # <pause dur="1.1"/> which <pause dur="0.5"/> are described <pause dur="0.2"/> in <pause dur="1.1"/> chapter sixteen of Campbell <pause dur="0.9"/> # and one of which we have already talked about so i will talk about the second today <pause dur="1.1"/> the first one is the transformation experiment <pause dur="0.8"/> which we talked about when we were talking about transformation <pause dur="0.5"/> in our consideration of bacterial genetics <pause dur="0.6"/> remember transformation is when <pause dur="0.3"/> an external D-N-A source <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> is added to a bacterium the bacterium takes up the D-N-A <pause dur="0.4"/> and changes <pause dur="0.2"/> its # <pause dur="0.7"/> phenotype <pause dur="0.3"/> in response to that new genetic information <pause dur="1.2"/> and you'll remember <pause dur="0.6"/> that this was originally <pause dur="0.3"/> studied by the <pause dur="0.2"/> English bacteriologist Griffith <pause dur="0.9"/> when he looked at rough and smooth pneumococci <pause dur="0.5"/> bacteria that caused <pause dur="0.3"/> lung disease <pause dur="0.5"/> and killed <pause dur="0.2"/> mice <pause dur="1.4"/> if they were smooth but not if they were rough <pause dur="0.8"/> and then he showed that an extract of D-N-A from the smooth bacteria <pause dur="0.4"/> could transform the rough bacteria <pause dur="0.3"/> to make those equally pathogenic <pause dur="1.3"/> now of course at that point you remember <pause dur="0.3"/> he didn't 
know anything about what it was <pause dur="0.4"/> that was the transforming agent as he called it <pause dur="1.1"/> # but <pause dur="0.3"/> subsequently <pause dur="0.4"/> three researchers <pause dur="0.2"/> in Baltimore <pause dur="0.9"/> Avery MacLeod and McCarty <pause dur="0.4"/> went through a series of experiments <pause dur="0.3"/> where they digested <pause dur="0.6"/> that <pause dur="0.4"/> # preparation of transforming agent <pause dur="0.5"/> with different enzymes <pause dur="0.7"/> so they <pause dur="0.2"/> digested it with <pause dur="0.2"/> enzymes which <pause dur="0.7"/> # broke down protein <pause dur="0.4"/> which broke down R-N-A <pause dur="0.3"/> which broke down sugars <pause dur="0.3"/> which broke down D-N-A <pause dur="0.5"/> and they discovered that the only set of enzymes which killed <pause dur="0.7"/> the ability of the extract to transform <pause dur="0.4"/> were the <pause dur="0.5"/> D-N-A <pause dur="0.2"/> breaking down enzymea D-N-A-ases <pause dur="0.6"/> nucleases <pause dur="1.2"/> and so they came to the conclusion that D-N-A <pause dur="0.3"/> must be <pause dur="0.4"/> the transforming agent <pause dur="0.5"/> and hence <pause dur="0.3"/> what it was <pause dur="0.7"/> that was in <pause dur="0.9"/> the smooth bacteria <pause dur="0.3"/> which <pause dur="0.5"/> when donated to the rough bacteria made them pathogenic <pause dur="2.4"/> the second <pause dur="1.0"/> experiment <pause dur="0.5"/> is known <pause dur="0.3"/> throughout biochemistry as the blender experiment <pause dur="1.4"/> because <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> a material part in the experiment is taken by an ordinary kitchen blender <pause dur="2.4"/> and that is described <pause dur="1.1"/><kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="2"/> on this overhead which you have a 
copy <pause dur="0.4"/> of <pause dur="1.3"/> in your handout <pause dur="1.2"/> it's more properly known at the Hershey-Chase experiment <pause dur="1.3"/> not for those of you who come from the other side of the water because it has anything to do with chocolate bars <pause dur="0.5"/> but because <pause dur="0.9"/> there was a man called Hershey and a man called Chase <pause dur="0.3"/> in fact a woman called Chase <pause dur="0.6"/> # who did this experiment <pause dur="1.6"/> and this brings us back <pause dur="0.5"/> again <pause dur="0.5"/> to our consideration of bacterial genetics because it involves one of those organisms <pause dur="0.4"/> we talked about in bacterial genetics <pause dur="0.3"/> that is the bacteriophage <pause dur="1.1"/> and you'll remember this picture <pause dur="0.5"/> of a bacteriophage looking rather like <pause dur="0.6"/> a lunar module <pause dur="1.5"/> here attaching to a host bacterium <pause dur="1.9"/> well what Hershey and Chase tried to do <pause dur="0.5"/> was to show what it was <pause dur="0.9"/> that a phage <pause dur="0.3"/> injected into <pause dur="0.4"/> the host bacterium <pause dur="0.6"/> which enabled that host bacterium to become then <pause dur="0.4"/> a machine <pause dur="0.3"/> for constructing new phage <pause dur="1.8"/> and they did that using what was at that time very new technology <pause dur="1.6"/> they <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> radioactively labelled <pause dur="0.3"/> their phage <pause dur="1.1"/> and they used <pause dur="0.7"/> two radioactive labels <pause dur="0.9"/> thirty-five-sulphur <pause dur="0.7"/> 
and <pause dur="0.4"/> thirty-two-<pause dur="0.2"/>phosphorus <pause dur="1.1"/> so the <pause dur="0.2"/> the upper line of this <pause dur="0.3"/> describes what happens <pause dur="0.4"/> # with thirty-five-sulphur <pause dur="0.7"/> and the bottom line <pause dur="0.4"/> describes what happens with thirty-two-phosphorus <pause dur="0.8"/> the reason they used the two labels <pause dur="0.6"/> is <pause dur="0.5"/> that <pause dur="0.4"/> there is <pause dur="0.2"/> quite a lot of sulphur <pause dur="0.5"/> in <pause dur="0.9"/> proteins <pause dur="0.3"/> coming from the amino acids methionine and cysteine <pause dur="1.2"/> and very little phosphate <pause dur="1.3"/> whereas there is a great deal of phosphate <pause dur="0.6"/> in nucleic acids <pause dur="0.3"/> and no sulphur <pause dur="1.4"/> so using these two labels <pause dur="0.6"/> the thirty-five-S showing what the protein is doing <pause dur="0.5"/> and the thirty-two-P <pause dur="0.3"/> showing what the <pause dur="0.3"/> nucleic acid is doing <pause dur="0.4"/> they hoped to be able to show what it was <pause dur="0.3"/> that got into the bacterium <pause dur="0.5"/> and caused <pause dur="0.4"/> the # <pause dur="2.2"/> caused the # <pause dur="1.0"/> genetic changes in the bacterium <pause dur="1.2"/> so <pause dur="0.8"/> in both experiments what you do is to take your radioactively labelled phages <pause dur="0.6"/> in a a flask you infect <pause dur="0.2"/> some E-coli bacteria with those radioactively labelled phages <pause dur="0.4"/> and you allow them to attach <pause dur="1.6"/> and even after they've injected their genetic information into the host cell <pause dur="0.4"/> they will 
remain attached so we have to detach them <pause dur="0.6"/> and the way we do that is to use the sheer forces generated by an ordinary kitchen blender <pause dur="0.8"/> so you put your mixture <pause dur="0.2"/> into <pause dur="0.3"/> the blender <pause dur="0.7"/> and you whirl it around a bit <pause dur="0.9"/> and then you use a centrifuge <pause dur="0.5"/> to separate <pause dur="0.2"/> the supernatant <pause dur="0.4"/> which contains the phage particles that have broken off from the outside of the bacteria <pause dur="0.5"/> and the pellet <pause dur="0.2"/> which contains the bacteria <pause dur="1.6"/> and when you do that <pause dur="0.6"/> and you do it with thirty-five-sulphur <pause dur="0.8"/> then all the <pause dur="0.5"/> radioactivity remains in the supernatant <pause dur="0.7"/> but when you do it with radioactive phosphorus <pause dur="0.5"/> all the radioactivity <pause dur="0.5"/> is in the pellet <pause dur="0.8"/> so you know that it's the phosphorus <pause dur="0.4"/> from the bacteria from the phage that's entered the bacteria <pause dur="0.3"/> and not the thirty-five-<pause dur="0.4"/>S <pause dur="0.5"/> and so we conclude <pause dur="0.3"/> that it's the nucleic acids in the phage <pause dur="0.4"/> that are carrying the genetic information <pause dur="0.2"/> and not the protein <pause dur="1.3"/> okay <pause dur="0.4"/> another very <pause dur="0.2"/> simple experiment it looks <trunc>t</trunc> almost trivially simple to us now <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> but it was very instrumental <pause dur="0.5"/> in showing <pause dur="0.5"/> that D-N-A 
was the genetic information so now we were able to show <pause dur="0.6"/> that in bacterial transformation <pause dur="0.2"/> and in phage infection <pause dur="0.7"/> the genetic information that was being transferred <pause dur="0.7"/> was <pause dur="0.3"/> a nucleic acid <pause dur="0.4"/> and in particular <pause dur="0.2"/> D-N-A <pause dur="5.2"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> so we now know that D-N-A is the genetic material <pause dur="0.7"/> what sort of stuff <pause dur="0.5"/> is D-N-A <pause dur="3.2"/> and in general what sort of <pause dur="0.4"/> stuff <pause dur="0.3"/> are nucleic acids <pause dur="2.4"/> well nucleic acids <pause dur="0.5"/> as you all know are polymers <pause dur="1.5"/> and in the case of D-N-A strikingly long <pause dur="0.2"/> polymers <pause dur="0.5"/> polymers being <pause dur="0.2"/> chemicals which are constructed from repeating simpler units <pause dur="4.9"/> the base unit <pause dur="0.7"/> of a nucleic acid is what we call a polynucleotide <pause dur="1.8"/> okay and so <pause dur="0.3"/> this is an appropriate point to remind ourselves what a nucleotide is <pause dur="11.1"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> 
and basically a nucleotide <pause dur="1.3"/> is a combination of three things <pause dur="0.5"/><kinesic desc="writes on transparency" iterated="y" dur="4"/> a base <pause dur="0.7"/> a sugar <pause dur="0.6"/> and a phosphate <pause dur="0.9"/> and for those of you who like like like their chemistry really simple and i'm sure that applies to a lot of you <pause dur="1.3"/> we can think <pause dur="0.2"/> of a nucleotide <pause dur="0.2"/> as being constructed in a very simple way <pause dur="1.2"/> with a base <pause dur="0.9"/> here <pause dur="0.8"/> bonded <pause dur="0.8"/> by a single bond <pause dur="0.7"/> to a sugar <pause dur="5.2"/> and that sugar being again bonded <pause dur="0.6"/> by a single bond <pause dur="0.2"/> to a phosphorus <pause dur="1.9"/> okay <pause dur="1.2"/> now this bond here <pause dur="0.2"/> is an oxygen <trunc>phos</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> # carbon-oxygen-phosphorus bond <pause dur="0.6"/> this bond here <pause dur="0.4"/> is a carbon-nitrogen bond <pause dur="0.5"/> but # <pause dur="0.3"/> that's for the chemists to worry about most of us <pause dur="0.8"/> not too worried about that <pause dur="2.7"/> but those of us who <pause dur="0.6"/> <trunc>w</trunc> <pause dur="0.7"/> and all of you should have at least some familiarity with what those chemicals look like <pause dur="0.4"/> whether you like it or not <pause dur="6.8"/><kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="13"/> we'll look at <pause dur="0.8"/> a slightly more complicated version <pause dur="0.3"/> of what those chemicals look like <pause dur="5.1"/> okay so <pause dur="0.4"/> our bases <pause dur="1.7"/> right <pause dur="0.4"/> can be any of <pause dur="0.9"/> in the case of D-N-A <pause dur="0.5"/> four <pause dur="0.2"/> different bases <pause dur="0.5"/> 
adenine <pause dur="0.2"/> guanine cytosine <pause dur="0.3"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> thymine <pause dur="2.7"/> and in the case of R-N-A <pause dur="0.5"/> any of the four bases adenine guanine cytosine or uracil <pause dur="4.3"/> the difference between those <pause dur="0.4"/> different bases <pause dur="0.8"/> what we have there is a picture of thymine and uracil <pause dur="2.1"/><kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="8"/> but adenine <pause dur="2.5"/> is a typical base <pause dur="0.7"/> of the other kind so let's just draw <pause dur="1.2"/> the two kinds of D-N-A bases you've seen thymine which looks like this <pause dur="12.4"/><kinesic desc="writes on transparency" iterated="y" dur="26"/> okay that's thymine <pause dur="1.5"/> and thymine is what we call a <trunc>pur</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> a pyrimidine base <pause dur="3.6"/> and it just has a single <pause dur="1.4"/> aromatic ring <pause dur="1.5"/> okay <pause dur="0.2"/> and that aromatic ring contains two nitrogens <pause dur="0.9"/> the difference between thymine <pause dur="0.4"/> cytosine and uracil <pause dur="0.3"/> which are the three pyrimide bases <pause dur="0.4"/> lies in what substituents we have <pause dur="0.6"/> in the case of thymine and uracil it's two oxygens <pause dur="0.5"/> in the case <pause dur="0.2"/> of # cytosine it's an oxygen and a nitrogen <pause dur="2.2"/> if we look at the pyrimidine bases they're slightly different and slightly more complicated <pause dur="17.6"/><kinesic desc="writes on transparency" iterated="y" dur="30"/> just try and draw the bonds right <pause dur="0.7"/> okay that's adenine <pause dur="3.5"/> which is the simplest of these more complex bases which are 
called purines <pause dur="2.2"/> okay <pause dur="0.3"/> so there are two types of bases purines and pyrimidines <pause dur="2.1"/> one is a single ring <pause dur="0.7"/> and the slightly longer name <pause dur="0.4"/> smaller structure longer name <pause dur="0.5"/> and the other one has a double ring <pause dur="0.5"/> and a shorter name <pause dur="1.2"/> okay as well as thymine in this class we have <pause dur="0.6"/> cytosine <pause dur="1.0"/> and uracil <pause dur="1.3"/> and as well as adenine in this class we have guanine <pause dur="4.1"/> and the differences as i said are in the number of substituents in the ring <pause dur="0.5"/> if you want to know more <pause dur="0.2"/> about that <pause dur="0.3"/> chapter sixteen of Campbell <pause dur="0.4"/> is where you look <pause dur="1.9"/> so those are the bases <pause dur="1.4"/> those bases are linked <pause dur="0.2"/> to sugars <pause dur="2.0"/> deoxyribose <pause dur="0.2"/> in the case of D-N-A <pause dur="0.3"/> ribose <pause dur="0.4"/> in the case of R-N-A <pause dur="0.5"/> both of them sugars containing <pause dur="0.3"/> five carbons <pause dur="0.6"/> one two three four five <pause dur="0.3"/> one two three four five <pause dur="0.3"/> arranged in a five-membered ring <pause dur="0.5"/> with one of their oxygens <pause dur="1.1"/> and then this is linked <pause dur="0.9"/> to a phosphate group <pause dur="0.6"/> and that phosphate group is linked through this carbon here <pause dur="0.5"/> the so-called five-prime carbon <pause dur="3.3"/> and as you see <pause dur="0.5"/> these nucleotides are linked together in a strand <pause dur="0.2"/> up to a 
polynucleotide <pause dur="0.5"/> by bonds <pause dur="0.4"/> between <pause dur="0.7"/> the phosphate which is on the five-prime <pause dur="0.5"/> on the five-prime carbon of this <pause dur="1.1"/> sugar <pause dur="0.6"/> is linked <pause dur="0.4"/> to the three-prime carbon <pause dur="0.5"/> of the next sugar <pause dur="0.5"/> so what we have is a chain going sugar phosphate sugar phosphate sugar phosphate sugar phosphate sugar phosphate <pause dur="0.4"/> and off it we have the bases <pause dur="0.7"/> so it's like a ladder structure <pause dur="0.6"/> sugars and phosphates <pause dur="0.5"/> but with bases intervening <pause dur="1.4"/> so if we <pause dur="0.4"/> were to put that back on my simple minded diagram <pause dur="1.1"/> okay here's base sugar phosphate <pause dur="0.6"/> what i would have <pause dur="0.7"/> then <pause dur="0.2"/><kinesic desc="writes on transparency" iterated="y" dur="15"/> is this sugar here <pause dur="0.6"/> joining on to another phosphate here <pause dur="0.8"/> and then <pause dur="0.3"/> another sugar <pause dur="1.1"/> here <pause dur="0.4"/> and another base <pause dur="0.6"/> here <pause dur="1.4"/> and then this sugar <pause dur="0.3"/> again joining on <pause dur="0.9"/> to another phosphate <pause dur="1.0"/> and so on and so on <pause dur="0.9"/> phosphate sugar phosphate sugar phosphate sugar <pause dur="4.9"/> so that in very simple terms <pause dur="1.1"/> is how you make a nucleotide <pause dur="0.5"/> something about the nomenclature <pause dur="2.2"/> well we found that there are five bases adenine guanine thymine cytosine and <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> uracil <pause dur="1.2"/> in fact <pause dur="0.2"/> as nucleotides they all change their names just to be very 
awkward <pause dur="1.6"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> adenine changes to adenosine <pause dur="1.2"/> cytosine to cytidine <pause dur="0.5"/> guanine to guanosine <pause dur="0.8"/> and uracil and thymine <pause dur="1.0"/> well there is no no uracil changes to uridine and thymine to thymidine <pause dur="0.3"/> again this is something you don't have to take in now <pause dur="0.6"/> <trunc>perha</trunc> # any book will tell you those names <pause dur="3.9"/> and we've looked at how to build a polynucleotide we build a polynucleotide by joining these units through <pause dur="0.2"/> base # through sugar phosphate <pause dur="0.2"/> linkages <pause dur="4.4"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> we've also in talking about nucleotides <pause dur="0.4"/> discovered some of the differences <pause dur="0.3"/> between D-N-A and R-N-A <pause dur="1.0"/> we've discovered that D-N-A <pause dur="0.3"/> has thymine as one of its bases whereas <trunc>r</trunc> R-N-A has uracil <pause dur="0.3"/> that D-N-A has deoxyribose <pause dur="0.5"/> <trunc>ra</trunc> where <pause dur="0.6"/> # uracil <pause dur="0.3"/> <trunc>ha</trunc> # where <pause dur="0.3"/> R-N-A has ribose <pause dur="0.7"/> but there are one or two other <pause dur="0.5"/> structural differences that perhaps we might like to look at <pause dur="0.9"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> and one of those <pause dur="6.8"/> while we're looking at it <pause dur="5.1"/> is that D-N-A <pause dur="0.5"/> in general <pause dur="1.1"/> forms a double helix <pause dur="0.4"/> of two chains of polynucleotide <pause dur="1.3"/> and is in general <pause dur="0.2"/> a very long polymer <pause dur="0.5"/> which has a fibrous structure <pause dur="1.4"/> 
whereas R-N-A <pause dur="0.7"/> is normally <pause dur="0.2"/> consist of one polynucleotide chain it is single stranded <pause dur="0.8"/> whereas D-N-A is double stranded <pause dur="0.5"/> and in general R-N-A <pause dur="0.3"/> chains tend to be <pause dur="0.2"/> short <pause dur="0.6"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> therefore fold upon themselves <pause dur="0.3"/> to make globular molecules a bit like proteins <pause dur="0.9"/> okay so D-N-A is a double helix long and fibrous <pause dur="0.3"/> R-N-A a single stranded molecule <pause dur="0.3"/> short <pause dur="0.2"/> and globular <pause dur="2.3"/> don't know whether you've ever thought <pause dur="0.4"/> how big <pause dur="0.4"/> D-N-A might be <pause dur="0.3"/> it's a long molecule <pause dur="1.3"/> # <pause dur="1.1"/> my my <pause dur="0.4"/> favourite model for it is a <pause dur="0.6"/> a piece of <pause dur="0.8"/><kinesic desc="holds up reel of cotton thread" iterated="n"/> ordinary sewing cotton <pause dur="0.4"/> which is a roughly one in a hundred-thousand scale model <pause dur="0.8"/> okay it's one in it's a hundred-thousand times larger than a piece of D-N-A <pause dur="1.1"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> and on this model <pause dur="1.1"/> # the amount of D-N-A in a bacterium <pause dur="1.0"/> would be a couple of hundred metres <pause dur="0.2"/> of this <pause dur="0.5"/> okay <pause dur="0.7"/> couple of hundred metres is actually <pause dur="0.3"/> more or less the contents of this # <pause dur="0.8"/> this rather large <pause dur="0.8"/> bit of cotton <pause dur="0.6"/> if you can imagine me unravelling all this of course you can see what a problem D-N-A is to keep anywhere <pause dur="0.5"/> okay <pause dur="0.7"/> such a 
long molecule clearly although # one draws it conventionally as a nice little tiny circle <pause dur="0.5"/> is # <pause dur="0.2"/> somewhat complex and rather inclined to get muddled <pause dur="0.2"/> and twisted <pause dur="0.5"/> and that's a problem <pause dur="2.0"/> for a bacterium as i said about two-hundred metres of this stuff <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> in each cell in your body <pause dur="1.1"/> right using this model <pause dur="0.6"/> you have a hundred-and-six <pause dur="0.2"/> kilometres <pause dur="1.5"/> okay <pause dur="0.7"/> of this stuff <pause dur="0.3"/> okay <pause dur="1.0"/> it's it's actually if the real stuff <pause dur="0.3"/> okay so we scale this down a hundred-thousand times <pause dur="0.6"/> is around one-point-six metres <pause dur="1.7"/> okay <pause dur="1.2"/> one-point-six metres <pause dur="0.5"/> so it's roughly the height of a less than average man that's me <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> okay # roughly my height in D-N-A <pause dur="0.7"/> if you can imagine <pause dur="0.2"/> an a D-N-A molecule my height and <pause dur="0.2"/> ten-thousand <pause dur="0.3"/> hundred-thousand times thinner than that <pause dur="0.7"/> # that's how much D-N-A you've got inside every one of your cells i said a hundred-and-six kilometres didn't i <pause dur="0.4"/> it's a hundred-and-six miles <pause dur="1.2"/> to well it makes it more familiar <pause dur="0.6"/> a hundred-and-six so a hundred-and-sixty kilometres <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> roughly from here to Bristol <pause dur="0.5"/> so i 
would have to stretch this stuff from here to Bristol <pause dur="0.3"/> to model <pause dur="0.3"/> the D-N-A inside each one of your cells <pause dur="0.9"/> so it's very long <pause dur="0.7"/> and even given <pause dur="0.5"/> that inside every one of your cells there are actually forty-some chromosomes so <trunc>th</trunc> it's not <pause dur="0.7"/> one molecule <pause dur="0.6"/> a hundred-and-six miles long <pause dur="0.6"/> it's # forty molecules adding up to a hundred-and-six miles <pause dur="0.9"/> # forty-eight molecules of course <pause dur="1.0"/> # <pause dur="0.8"/> but # that does give you some idea of scale <pause dur="1.9"/> that contains <pause dur="0.4"/> three-<pause dur="0.3"/>thousand-<pause dur="0.2"/>million <pause dur="0.9"/> nucleotides <pause dur="0.7"/> okay roughly we believe that <pause dur="0.3"/> each <pause dur="0.3"/> each D-N-A <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> D-N-A <pause dur="0.6"/> in one <pause dur="0.8"/> haploid amount of D-N-A <pause dur="0.2"/> in one of your cells is three-<pause dur="0.3"/>thousand-<pause dur="0.2"/>million nucleotides <pause dur="1.6"/> whereas for a our poor old friend <pause dur="0.4"/> # the # <pause dur="0.3"/> E-coli bacterium it's only some four-million <pause dur="0.5"/> a trifling amount <pause dur="3.5"/> just to go back to the molecules for a minute <pause dur="1.4"/> looking at D-N-A <pause dur="0.5"/> you know that D-N-A <pause dur="0.2"/> is a double helix <pause dur="1.4"/> okay there are some pictures of the double helix there <pause dur="5.0"/> two things about the double helix i think we need to # <pause dur="0.5"/> well at least two things we need to 
talk about <pause dur="0.4"/> one of them is how the double helix is bonded together <pause dur="1.0"/> there are two sorts of bonds which hold the double helix together <pause dur="0.8"/> one of those are so-called <pause dur="0.6"/> # base pairs <pause dur="0.8"/> which are relatively weak bonds what we called hydrogen bonds <pause dur="0.4"/> which bond across the centre of the molecule <pause dur="1.0"/> always between adenine and thymine <pause dur="0.6"/> and between guanine and <trunc>cytodi</trunc> cytosine <pause dur="1.3"/> with two <pause dur="0.4"/> bonds between adenine and thymine <pause dur="0.4"/> and three bonds <pause dur="0.3"/> between guanine and cytosine <pause dur="0.5"/> that means <pause dur="0.4"/> that a G-C base pair is roughly fifty per cent stronger <pause dur="0.4"/> than a A-T base pair <pause dur="1.7"/> however that's not the only thing that holds the D-N-A molecule together <pause dur="0.8"/> as you see from this <pause dur="0.4"/> picture <pause dur="0.4"/> those D-N-A bases are <trunc>s</trunc> on top of each other <pause dur="0.3"/> stacked on top of each other in fact this bit of the picture shows you that better <pause dur="0.6"/> in this space filling model here we see the bases <pause dur="0.4"/> stacked on top of each other <pause dur="1.0"/> okay those bases being stacked on top of each other <pause dur="0.3"/> they actually interact with each other <pause dur="0.5"/> like this <pause dur="0.3"/> and that gives an 
extra <pause dur="0.3"/> layer of stability to the molecule that's called base stacking <pause dur="0.6"/> so base pairing <pause dur="0.3"/> added to base stacking <pause dur="0.4"/> stablilizes the double helix <pause dur="2.9"/> looking at this diagrammatic <pause dur="0.2"/> model of the double helix here <pause dur="2.3"/> some of the details we can count that there are one two three four five six seven eight nine ten bases per turn <pause dur="1.2"/> off the double helix <pause dur="0.6"/> and that amounts to a distance <pause dur="0.4"/> of some three-point-four nanometres <pause dur="2.0"/> and the width of the double helix <pause dur="0.4"/> is about two nanometres <pause dur="2.3"/> a nanometre remember <pause dur="0.3"/> is one <pause dur="0.5"/> times ten-to-the-minus-nine <pause dur="0.3"/> of a metre <pause dur="2.6"/> and the other thing i need to tell you about <pause dur="0.6"/> is if we go back <pause dur="1.3"/> one thing i need to stress and it's one of the mysteries of nucleic acid structure <pause dur="0.6"/> that always mystifies people <pause dur="4.3"/><kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="3"/> 
if we <pause dur="0.4"/> look at that structure <pause dur="0.2"/> as we've draw it here in very simple terms <pause dur="1.1"/> with our <pause dur="0.3"/> sugar <pause dur="0.3"/> phosphate sugar phosphate sugar phosphate backbone <pause dur="1.2"/> okay <pause dur="0.3"/><kinesic desc="writes on transparency" iterated="y" dur="16"/> we have at one end of the molecule here <pause dur="0.7"/> a <pause dur="1.2"/> something with no phosphate on it <pause dur="0.8"/> we conventionally call that the three-prime end <pause dur="0.6"/> because there's a free three-prime carbon <pause dur="0.5"/> stuck here <pause dur="0.7"/> and at the top here we have a free phosphate <pause dur="0.8"/> and that's attached to a five-prime carbon here <pause dur="0.5"/> so we call that end of the molecule the five-prime end <pause dur="1.1"/> okay <pause dur="0.7"/> so just as proteins have two different ends we call them the amino terminus and the carboxy terminus of a protein <pause dur="0.7"/> we talk about the five-prime and the three-prime end of a nucleic acid <pause dur="1.4"/> okay <pause dur="0.9"/> and if we draw a double helix <pause dur="1.2"/><kinesic desc="writes on transparency" iterated="y" dur="30"/> whereas one of the strands is moving from five-prime to three-prime in this direction <pause dur="0.6"/> the other strand <pause dur="0.2"/> is moving from five-prime <pause dur="0.6"/> to three-prime <pause dur="0.5"/> in the opposite direction <pause dur="3.4"/> that is <pause dur="1.3"/> a double helix with its <pause dur="0.7"/> bonds in between <pause dur="1.1"/> we call it an anti<pause dur="0.6"/>parallel <pause dur="0.8"/> double helix <pause dur="2.2"/> 
okay because we have two parallel chains <pause dur="0.3"/> one running in one direction <pause dur="0.3"/> and the other one <pause dur="0.2"/> running in the other <pause dur="1.6"/> and half of the problems that people get into thinking about D-N-A <pause dur="0.3"/> has got <pause dur="0.6"/> to do with forgetting <pause dur="0.3"/> that they two run in different directions <pause dur="0.6"/> that was the thing that most people got <pause dur="0.4"/> wrong <pause dur="0.2"/> for instance in the diagnostic test where you were able <pause dur="0.5"/> to <pause dur="0.3"/> to write me <pause dur="0.3"/> the complement of a D-N-A molecule <pause dur="0.3"/> you normally wrote it the wrong way round <pause dur="0.8"/> because the convention is <pause dur="0.3"/> that we always write D-N-A sequences starting at the five-prime and ending at the three-prime <pause dur="0.6"/> so the five-prime is always on the left <pause dur="1.0"/> my right in this case okay and we put out the sequence <pause dur="0.3"/> running <pause dur="0.3"/> from left to right with the five-prime there <pause dur="0.4"/> and the three-prime there <pause dur="4.7"/><kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="10"/> now that's <pause dur="0.4"/> a molecule of D-N-A <pause dur="1.3"/> what about a molecule of R-N-A <pause dur="0.3"/> what i just wanted to show you <pause dur="0.5"/> as i said they're short <pause dur="0.4"/> and # <pause dur="0.5"/> generally <pause dur="1.4"/> globular <pause dur="1.3"/> and this picture which you haven't got a copy of <pause dur="0.3"/> but you can look up in figure <pause dur="0.4"/> if you see it's in 
chapter seventeen of Campbell <pause dur="0.6"/> it's a picture of a T-R-N-A which we'll be talking about <pause dur="0.3"/> again <pause dur="0.5"/> # in the next # <pause dur="0.2"/> part of <pause dur="0.3"/> in the next talk <pause dur="1.0"/> but a T-R-N-A <pause dur="0.5"/> is a short molecule <pause dur="0.6"/> if you could count it's about seventy-five nucleotides long it's trivial compared with the <pause dur="0.5"/> length that we've been talking about in terms of D-N-A <pause dur="1.5"/> okay <pause dur="0.4"/> and as you see it <pause dur="0.2"/> although it's single stranded <pause dur="0.5"/> there's only a single molecule there it coils back on itself <pause dur="0.4"/> making double helical <pause dur="0.3"/> # making base pairs across here <pause dur="0.5"/> and making little bits of double helix <pause dur="0.7"/> as you can see here <pause dur="0.5"/> in this molecule <pause dur="0.3"/> making it in fact <pause dur="0.9"/> almost <pause dur="0.3"/> a a little blob <pause dur="0.2"/> shape like a protein <pause dur="0.5"/> okay <pause dur="0.6"/> so rather than those enormous great molecules three-thousand-million nucleotides long for a piece of D-N-A <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> we've got something seventy-five base pairs long <pause dur="0.3"/> well <pause dur="0.4"/> R-N-A molecules get larger than that but not a lot larger <pause dur="2.1"/> perhaps a few thousand at most <pause dur="2.2"/> okay so that's looking at the differences between D-N-A and R-N-A <pause dur="0.9"/> and while we were looking at 
those differences <pause dur="1.2"/> we <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> talked a little about <pause dur="0.8"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> these forces that bound the D-N-A <pause dur="0.3"/> together <pause dur="1.0"/> okay and you've got that on one of your <pause dur="0.3"/> overheads <pause dur="0.5"/> base pairing <pause dur="0.4"/> with hydrogen bonds two for an A-T base pair three for a G-C base pair <pause dur="0.5"/> and the base stacking <pause dur="0.4"/> bonds which hold <pause dur="0.3"/> the structure together <pause dur="3.5"/> at this point <pause dur="0.9"/> we've talked <pause dur="0.4"/> almost as much as anyone can bear i think about structure <pause dur="0.5"/> so we'll take a two minute break there <pause dur="0.8"/> okay and then we'll go on to talk a bit more about the function of D-N-A </u><gap reason="break in recording" extent="uncertain"/> <u who="nm0238" trans="pause"> 
<kinesic desc="projector is on showing slide" iterated="n"/> so D-N-A has to function as the genetic material <pause dur="0.9"/> in most <pause dur="0.4"/> cells <pause dur="0.2"/> and most organisms <pause dur="0.8"/> there are a few organisms very simple organisms who use R-N-A as genetic material <pause dur="0.8"/> most obviously some viruses <pause dur="0.6"/> and some rather odd things that plants have called <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 word"/> <pause dur="2.1"/> but for most organisms D-N-A is the genetic material <pause dur="2.5"/> and that means that he has to do two things <pause dur="3.1"/> it has to act as a store <pause dur="1.5"/> we have to be able to store information <pause dur="1.6"/> and we have to be <trunc>tra</trunc> be able to transmit information <pause dur="1.6"/> and there are basically two modes of transmitting information <pause dur="0.6"/> there's transmitting information from one cell to another <pause dur="1.9"/> and there's what we call expressing information <pause dur="0.6"/> that is <pause dur="0.5"/> moving from genetic information <pause dur="0.6"/> stored <pause dur="0.4"/> to <pause dur="0.2"/> phenotype information <pause dur="0.2"/> expressed <pause dur="2.3"/> which as you remember in the case of <pause dur="0.4"/> molecules is talking about <pause dur="0.3"/> moving <pause dur="0.3"/> from D-N-A <pause dur="0.3"/> to proteins <pause dur="2.9"/> so <pause dur="0.2"/> D-N-A how does it function as an information store we have an 
incredibly long molecule <pause dur="1.1"/> a copolymer <pause dur="1.1"/> right <pause dur="0.5"/> which links together <pause dur="1.5"/> four different <pause dur="0.6"/> nucleotides <pause dur="1.0"/> adenine the bases you paired your bases adenine guanine cytosine and <pause dur="0.6"/> thymine <pause dur="1.2"/> A <pause dur="0.5"/> G C and T as we call them <pause dur="1.7"/> okay <pause dur="1.6"/> what we have and people <pause dur="1.1"/> # <pause dur="0.8"/> very soon realized this <pause dur="0.4"/> is basically <pause dur="0.4"/> a <pause dur="0.3"/> piece of linear <pause dur="0.6"/> coded <pause dur="0.2"/> information <pause dur="0.6"/> and the best analogy that i can think of <kinesic desc="holds up strip of cassette tape" iterated="n"/> is magnetic tape <pause dur="1.2"/> okay <pause dur="0.4"/> now you all vaguely know that what we have in magnetic tape is a series of iron atoms <pause dur="0.7"/> okay which are laid out on this plastic tape <pause dur="0.6"/> in some sort of <pause dur="0.2"/> order <pause dur="0.8"/> okay and the <trunc>m</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> the magnetics the magnetization of those iron atoms <pause dur="0.7"/> is <pause dur="0.3"/> some indication <pause dur="0.6"/> of <pause dur="0.6"/> information it can be read <pause dur="0.2"/> somehow <pause dur="0.3"/> by a machine <pause dur="0.3"/> and interpreted as sound <pause dur="1.0"/> okay we have a linear <pause dur="1.9"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> a linear <pause dur="1.0"/> succession of these things which we can pull <pause dur="0.2"/> so we can <pause dur="0.3"/> have these sounds in a linear <pause dur="0.6"/> # arrangement <pause dur="0.2"/> as we like music to be <pause dur="1.3"/> okay <pause dur="0.2"/> well you can imagine D-N-A like this <pause dur="0.3"/> so that the linear sequence of the bases along the strand <pause dur="1.0"/> okay <pause dur="0.6"/> is is the information <pause dur="0.7"/> that is the information 
the sequence of bases on a D-N-A strand <pause dur="1.8"/> okay <pause dur="0.7"/> and exactly like this cassette tape <pause dur="2.0"/> you neither you nor i <pause dur="0.8"/> can tell <pause dur="0.9"/> whether <pause dur="0.5"/> this is Cerys Matthews <pause dur="0.2"/> or Dame tiri game Dame <pause dur="0.2"/> Kiri Te Kanawa <pause dur="0.6"/> whether it's <pause dur="0.2"/> Beethoven <pause dur="0.6"/> or <pause dur="0.3"/> # Catatonia <pause dur="1.7"/> # <pause dur="1.3"/> because <pause dur="0.3"/> just like this <pause dur="0.4"/> the information is <pause dur="0.2"/> redundant <pause dur="0.2"/> useless <pause dur="0.4"/> okay <pause dur="0.8"/> this information is no good unless interpreted <pause dur="0.3"/> by some sort of interpreter which in the case of a cassette tape of course <pause dur="0.5"/> is a cassette player <pause dur="0.9"/> but in the case <pause dur="0.3"/> of <pause dur="0.2"/> D-N-A genetic information is the cell <pause dur="1.4"/> okay <pause dur="0.4"/> so that information <pause dur="0.2"/> only has sense in the context of the cell in which it finds itself <pause dur="1.4"/> okay and if you want to think mechanistically <pause dur="0.2"/> you could think of a cell <pause dur="0.3"/> as a cassette player <pause dur="0.4"/> but it's not really helpful <pause dur="0.2"/> i don't think mechanistic <pause dur="0.3"/> analogies really work <pause dur="0.7"/> okay <pause dur="0.2"/> but something needs to <unclear>interpret</unclear> that genetic information that clearly is the cell <pause dur="1.8"/> so the information store consists of the sequence <pause dur="0.5"/> of the bases <pause dur="0.2"/> in the chain <pause dur="1.5"/> the transmission of information as i see it happens in two 
ways <pause dur="1.3"/> first of all i'm going to talk about <pause dur="0.2"/> transmission by <pause dur="0.2"/> expression <pause dur="0.6"/> and then we'll talk <pause dur="0.2"/> later <pause dur="0.5"/> about what i've called on this slide <pause dur="0.4"/> maintenance <pause dur="0.3"/> of <pause dur="0.2"/> information but it's also transmission to the next generation <pause dur="0.9"/> okay <pause dur="0.3"/> and its replication <pause dur="3.0"/> in order to <pause dur="0.2"/> look at <pause dur="0.2"/> transmission of information i'm going to go <pause dur="0.4"/> to what <pause dur="0.7"/> i've shown you i think once already <pause dur="0.4"/> which is what <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.9"/> Francis Crick immodestly called the central <kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> dogma of molecular biology <pause dur="0.8"/> this little diagram <pause dur="0.5"/> which shows you the information flow inside a cell <pause dur="0.5"/> from the D-N-A store <pause dur="0.6"/> of genetic information <pause dur="0.7"/> through a temporary <pause dur="0.9"/> resting place in R-N-A <pause dur="0.4"/> particularly messenger R-N-A <pause dur="0.9"/> to the protein <pause dur="0.3"/> which is equivalent to the phenotype so from genotype <pause dur="0.4"/> to phenotype within a cell <pause dur="1.0"/> when <pause dur="0.5"/> Crick <pause dur="0.2"/> wrote this out first of all <pause dur="0.3"/> he wrote that diagram with simple arrows on it <pause dur="0.5"/> showing that the information moved from D-N-A to R-N-A to protein <pause dur="2.1"/> okay <pause dur="0.2"/> and that's equivalent to the move from genotype to phenotype <pause dur="2.6"/> now that's <pause dur="0.3"/> although <pause dur="0.3"/> Crick would <pause dur="0.3"/> deny it heartily 
that's actually a very simplified form of the central dogma <pause dur="0.4"/> and we'll look <pause dur="0.4"/> at a more complex form in the next lecture <pause dur="1.1"/> okay <pause dur="0.3"/> but that's basically <pause dur="0.2"/> how the information was transmitted <pause dur="0.5"/> inside the cell <pause dur="0.5"/> to interpret <pause dur="0.3"/> the <trunc>ph</trunc> genotype as a phenotype <pause dur="2.0"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> what i want to <pause dur="0.6"/> concentrate on <pause dur="0.5"/> in this lecture <pause dur="0.6"/> is the next stage <pause dur="0.5"/> which is replication <pause dur="0.8"/> what the cell has to do <pause dur="3.2"/> because that cell is going to divide <pause dur="0.2"/> and have daughter cells <pause dur="0.3"/> what that cell needs to do <pause dur="0.2"/> in order to pass on that information to maintain <pause dur="0.6"/> a decent store of information <pause dur="0.6"/> in its daughter cells <pause dur="2.8"/> one of the big differences between these two processes transmission <pause dur="0.7"/> and maintenance <pause dur="0.8"/> is that it is much more important <pause dur="0.4"/> for this one to be accurate <pause dur="0.4"/> than it is for this one to be accurate <pause dur="1.3"/> okay <pause dur="0.5"/> when we're trying to maintain the information <pause dur="0.3"/> every time we copy the information if there are mistakes <pause dur="0.8"/> introduced <pause dur="0.4"/> then we've got mutations <pause dur="0.4"/> and we've got a change in our genetic information <pause dur="0.8"/> okay so we want to make absolutely sure if we can 
that replication <pause dur="0.2"/> is as accurate as <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 word"/> be made <pause dur="0.9"/> with transmission of information moving information within a cell <pause dur="0.4"/> from <pause dur="0.2"/> our D-N-A to R-N-A to protein <pause dur="0.3"/> we're not so worried <pause dur="0.2"/> because we're going to throw that R-N-A and that protein away at the end of the day <pause dur="0.2"/> we're going to make new copies <pause dur="0.3"/> and those new copies may be more accurate <pause dur="1.8"/> so although accuracy is the important consideration <pause dur="0.3"/> for both transmission and maintenance it's really the prime <pause dur="0.4"/> problem <pause dur="0.3"/> for maintenance <pause dur="2.4"/> so the process <pause dur="0.5"/> whereby we take <pause dur="0.2"/> a D-N-A double helix and make two D-N-A double helices <pause dur="0.4"/> is the process we refer to as replication <pause dur="0.5"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> and that's what i want to spend the rest of this lecture talking about <pause dur="4.6"/> 
and D-N-A replication <pause dur="1.3"/> in very simple terms <pause dur="0.2"/> has four important characteristics <pause dur="1.5"/> the first is that it is semiconservative <pause dur="1.7"/> what's that mean <pause dur="0.7"/> one usually makes a political joke here but i won't make a political joke <pause dur="0.5"/> # you can work out a political joke for yourself <pause dur="1.7"/> semiconservative means <pause dur="0.3"/> that if you take a D-N-A double helix <pause dur="0.3"/> and here i'm going to <pause dur="0.4"/> turn to my other favourite model <pause dur="0.3"/> of a D-N-A double helix which is a piece of Velcro <pause dur="2.0"/><kinesic desc="pulls apart piece of Velcro" iterated="n"/> okay <pause dur="0.5"/> the important thing about a piece of Velcro is as you know is that it has two sides <pause dur="0.3"/> which <unclear>better</unclear> bind to each <pause dur="0.3"/> themselves <pause dur="0.2"/> but which bind to each other <pause dur="0.5"/> this entirely mimics <pause dur="0.3"/> the fact that <pause dur="0.2"/> one <pause dur="0.8"/> chain of a D-N-A double helix <pause dur="0.3"/> absolutely specifies and will only bind to # the other chain <pause dur="1.4"/> okay <pause dur="0.4"/> and we say that the chains of a D-N-A double helix are complementary <pause dur="0.3"/> to each other <pause dur="0.4"/> 
that's complementary with a E <pause dur="1.1"/> C-O-M-P-L-<pause dur="0.3"/>E-<pause dur="0.4"/>M-E-N-T-R-Y-T-A-R-Y <pause dur="0.5"/> okay they're complementary to each other <pause dur="1.2"/> right <pause dur="0.6"/> we can describe that in very crude terms and say they stick to each other <pause dur="0.4"/> and some people <pause dur="0.3"/> and we do in molecular biology refer to these strands as sticky <pause dur="1.2"/> okay <pause dur="1.4"/> but we've got <pause dur="0.5"/> here's our double helix it's not helical but you could imagine it <pause dur="0.7"/> what happens <pause dur="1.0"/> do we part this double helix <pause dur="1.1"/> make a new chain on here and make a new chain on here and join it up again <pause dur="0.9"/> which would be a conservative model <pause dur="0.2"/> because this helix would remain exactly the same <pause dur="1.7"/> okay <pause dur="1.0"/> or do we <pause dur="0.2"/> throw away both strands of this helix and make a new one well that would be wasteful and clearly we don't do that <pause dur="0.6"/> what we do do <pause dur="0.2"/> is semiconservative replication that is we take these two strands <pause dur="0.5"/> and on each of these two strands we build a new one <pause dur="0.9"/> so for each strand <pause dur="0.5"/> half of it is old there's half of it new <pause dur="0.2"/> and hence semiconservative <pause dur="2.9"/> and that's very clearly shown in the diagram which i think you've got a 
version of <pause dur="0.5"/><kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="8"/> on your handout <pause dur="1.3"/> okay <pause dur="3.6"/> this as i said will be a conservative model where we started with a double helix <pause dur="0.6"/> when we made a new double helix that was entirely new and the old one was kept <pause dur="1.6"/> right <pause dur="1.0"/> that's a conservative model <pause dur="0.5"/> the semiconservative model is where we start with a double helix <pause dur="0.3"/> we part the two strands and make a new one from each <pause dur="0.6"/> and again <pause dur="0.6"/> when we make that one we part the two strands and <pause dur="0.3"/> and # make a new one on each <pause dur="0.2"/> don't worry about the dispersive model i don't think it's worth <pause dur="0.7"/> thinking about at the moment <pause dur="1.5"/> okay <pause dur="0.7"/> so we say that D-N-A <pause dur="0.3"/> synthesis is semiconservative what evidence do we have for that <pause dur="0.9"/> the evidence that we have for that <pause dur="0.4"/> is the evidence of the Meselson-Stahl experiment <pause dur="0.6"/> which again you have <pause dur="0.3"/> on your handout <pause dur="6.6"/><kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="7"/> okay this was an experiment which was done <pause dur="0.8"/> in # the nineteen-fifties <pause dur="1.0"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> in which what the # <pause dur="0.3"/> the two <pause dur="0.4"/> authors Meselson and Stahl did <pause dur="0.8"/> was to label <pause dur="0.6"/> the strands of D-N-A this time in the Hershey-Chase experiment remember we <trunc>s</trunc> <pause dur="0.3"/> labelled D-N-A <pause dur="0.4"/> and 
labelled protein <pause dur="0.8"/> in the <trunc>men</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> Meselson-Stahl experiment what we do <pause dur="0.3"/> what we did <pause dur="0.6"/> was to label the old strands of D-N-A <pause dur="0.3"/> with one isotype <pause dur="0.2"/> not a radioactive one in this case <pause dur="0.7"/> of nitrogen <pause dur="0.8"/> okay and the new strands with the new isotope <pause dur="0.8"/> okay <pause dur="1.4"/> and <pause dur="1.1"/> we then <pause dur="0.2"/> look at <pause dur="0.7"/> the <pause dur="0.3"/> D-N-A molecules that were formed <pause dur="0.6"/> in fact what what they did <pause dur="0.6"/> was to start <vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.5"/> with nitrogen fifteen <pause dur="0.9"/> and then they substituted it with nitrogen fourteen <pause dur="0.5"/> nitrogen fourteen is lighter than nitrogen fifteen <pause dur="0.3"/> so the density of the molecule went <pause dur="0.4"/> decreased <pause dur="1.3"/> and they showed that density <pause dur="0.4"/> by <pause dur="0.2"/> running <pause dur="0.6"/> the D-N-A molecules in an ultracentrifuge <pause dur="0.9"/> so here's what they started with in the ultracentrifuge this is heavy D-N-A <pause dur="1.3"/> okay <pause dur="0.8"/> and what you see happening <pause dur="1.0"/> is that as we run <pause dur="0.3"/> through one <pause dur="0.4"/> cell cycle <pause dur="1.1"/> the D-N-A moves from this position <pause dur="0.8"/> to all be at a new position here <pause dur="1.2"/> okay <pause dur="0.3"/> and as we run through a second cell cycle <pause dur="0.3"/> it moves to being at two positions <pause dur="2.1"/> if we go back to our model <vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/><pause dur="2.3"/> we'll see that that's exactly what we 
expect <pause dur="0.9"/> from our semiconservative model <pause dur="1.1"/> we start <pause dur="0.5"/> with dark blue heavy <pause dur="0.8"/> and we move through in one <pause dur="0.3"/> cell cycle <pause dur="0.3"/> to everything being a mixture of light <trunc>an</trunc> and dark blue <pause dur="0.3"/> that is the same density <pause dur="0.5"/> whereas in the conservative model <pause dur="0.3"/> we would move <pause dur="0.3"/> from blue <pause dur="0.7"/> to <pause dur="0.4"/> dark blue and light blue two different <pause dur="0.4"/> densities <pause dur="0.8"/> so at the end of the first generation you have two different densities <pause dur="0.5"/> whereas at the end of the first generation here we <pause dur="0.3"/> just have one density <pause dur="0.8"/> at the end of the second generation <pause dur="0.5"/> however in both cases <pause dur="0.6"/> we will have two densities <pause dur="1.2"/> okay <pause dur="1.2"/> <trunc>ar</trunc> in conservative <pause dur="0.5"/> three of them will be light one of them heavy <pause dur="0.5"/> in the case <pause dur="0.2"/> of semiconservative two of them <pause dur="0.5"/> will be mixtures <pause dur="0.3"/> and one of <pause dur="0.2"/> # two of them light <pause dur="0.7"/> and if you again look at the Meselson-Stahl experiment <pause dur="0.6"/> you'll see that that's what happens in the second generation <pause dur="0.4"/> we move from this position here <pause dur="0.3"/> to a mixture of things of that density and some lighter things <pause dur="0.6"/> okay <pause dur="0.6"/> so by measuring the density <pause dur="0.6"/> of D-N-A <pause dur="0.3"/> during the experiment in which we 
substituted <pause dur="0.4"/> a light nitrogen isotope for a heavy nitrogen isotope <pause dur="0.5"/> we were able to prove or Meselson-Stahl were able to prove <pause dur="0.3"/> that semiconservative <pause dur="0.2"/> was the correct model <pause dur="0.4"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> for D-N-A replication <pause dur="2.8"/> what other characteristics <pause dur="0.5"/> do we need to know about D-N-A replication well first of all <pause dur="0.8"/> does it go all over the place no it doesn't it always starts in one place <pause dur="0.6"/> starts at what we call an origin <pause dur="1.5"/> and in the case of # a bacterial <pause dur="0.4"/> chromosome there is only one origin <pause dur="0.9"/> okay there's only one place where we start and replicate bacterial chromosome <pause dur="0.7"/> in the case of your and our my chromosomes which are infant as we saw <pause dur="0.2"/> a thousand times or so larger <pause dur="1.2"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> i'm afraid we don't start from one origin but we have many origins otherwise it would take us forever to replicate our D-N-A <pause dur="2.9"/> however from that origin <pause dur="0.5"/> we can very easily show <pause dur="0.3"/> that the D-N-A <trunc>r</trunc> is replicated in both directions <pause dur="1.0"/> okay <pause dur="0.2"/> that replication is bidirectional <pause dur="1.8"/> so if we imagine <pause dur="0.4"/><kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="5"/> that we're going to start making a piece of D-N-A <pause dur="2.5"/><kinesic desc="writes on transparency" iterated="y" dur="7"/> 
so here i have a piece of D-N-A here's a double <pause dur="0.7"/> strand of D-N-A <pause dur="0.7"/> and here is the origin <pause dur="0.8"/> okay <pause dur="0.6"/> obviously the first thing that must happen at the origin is <trunc>w</trunc> <sic corr="we">me</sic> must <pause dur="0.5"/><kinesic desc="writes on transparency" iterated="y" dur="47"/> dissociate the strands like that <pause dur="1.3"/> and you can in fact see that happening in an E-M photograph a little bubble will appear <pause dur="1.5"/> in the D-N-A <pause dur="0.8"/> okay and then we start making D-N-A in both directions that is we make it on this strand <pause dur="0.8"/> okay and we make it on that strand <pause dur="2.8"/> and D-N-A is always made in the same direction <pause dur="1.0"/> it's always made <pause dur="0.2"/> starting <pause dur="0.2"/> with the five-prime of the new strand and moving towards the three-prime of the new strand <pause dur="1.3"/> which since those two strands <pause dur="0.2"/> as i said are antiparallel <pause dur="1.2"/> this strand has a three-prime here and a five-prime there this strand has a three-prime there and a five-prime there <pause dur="1.9"/> okay <pause dur="0.4"/> those two directions will be the opposite directions <pause dur="1.7"/> here we have <pause dur="0.9"/> the snag <pause dur="0.7"/> of D-N-A replication <pause dur="0.7"/> because unless <pause dur="0.6"/> when i replicate bidirectionally i'm going to be satisfied <pause dur="0.7"/> with going this way all 
the way round my circular D-N-A <pause dur="0.2"/> if i'm a bacterium <pause dur="0.8"/> okay and come back to meet myself here which will take me a long time <pause dur="0.5"/> and do the same in the opposite direction for the other strand <pause dur="1.2"/> i'm <pause dur="0.2"/> i'm <pause dur="0.6"/> if i'm satisifed with that it will be a very long process <pause dur="0.6"/> and also <pause dur="0.2"/> i will have a single stranded piece of D-N-A hanging around for an awfully long time <pause dur="0.5"/> which you can imagine what it looks like like this you can imagine the <pause dur="0.2"/> problems you'd get into <pause dur="0.9"/> # <pause dur="1.1"/> we need a way of replicating the other strand at the same time <pause dur="2.0"/> and as i've told you <pause dur="0.9"/> we can only replicate D-N-A in one direction <pause dur="1.1"/> and the solution that D-N-A has <pause dur="1.7"/><kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="3"/> is that although <pause dur="0.3"/> it replicates D-N-A continuously on one strand <pause dur="0.5"/> it <trunc>reputat</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> replicates the other strand <pause dur="0.3"/> discontinuously <pause dur="1.9"/> okay <pause dur="1.6"/><kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="6"/> and that means we make the other strand in fragments <pause dur="2.7"/> so if you imagine the other strand being made <pause dur="0.5"/> what i do <pause dur="0.4"/> is to start here <pause dur="0.7"/> and make a little bit of D-N-A <pause dur="0.8"/> and then i jump back and i start here and make another little bit of D-N-A <pause dur="0.5"/> and then i jump back and 
start here and make another bit of D-N-A and so on <pause dur="1.6"/> a motion i've described and it will only mean something to the <pause dur="0.3"/> girls among you i guess as being something like blanket stitch <pause dur="1.1"/> okay in out round the back in out round the back <pause dur="0.4"/> okay <pause dur="1.1"/> those of you who think i've got the nomenclature of the stitch wrong can come up and tell me later but <pause dur="0.5"/> i assure you there is a stitch <pause dur="1.7"/> okay <pause dur="1.1"/> but you see we're going forwards <pause dur="0.3"/> the general direction of synthesis is going in this direction <pause dur="1.1"/> okay but i'm always actually making the molecule in this direction <pause dur="0.5"/> that is the five-prime to three-prime direction <pause dur="0.7"/> i clearly i'm going to make a lot of fragments <pause dur="1.3"/> and those fragments have a special name they're named <pause dur="0.5"/> after the Japanese scientist <pause dur="0.6"/> who first discovered them <pause dur="0.5"/> they're named <pause dur="0.3"/> Okazaki fragments <pause dur="4.1"/><kinesic desc="writes on transparency" iterated="y" dur="4"/> so D-N-A replication is <pause dur="1.1"/> semiconservative <pause dur="0.7"/> we retain one old strand in each new double helix <pause dur="0.7"/><kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="6"/> it starts from a single place of origin of replication <pause dur="0.9"/> it moves in both directions from that origin <pause dur="0.8"/> moving continuously on one 
strand <pause dur="0.3"/> and discontinuously <pause dur="0.4"/> on the other <pause dur="3.2"/> of course what's happening <pause dur="1.2"/> on that strand <pause dur="0.2"/> is something very simple <pause dur="1.4"/> okay and the basic mechanism of D-N-A replication is very simple <pause dur="0.8"/> we have <pause dur="0.2"/> a double stranded helix <pause dur="0.4"/> we part it <pause dur="0.7"/> and then we simply match <pause dur="0.6"/> new bases <pause dur="0.8"/> to replace the new strand so where there's an A we put a T where there's a C we put a G <pause dur="0.4"/> and so on <pause dur="0.5"/> until we get two new strands <pause dur="0.4"/> we're matching <pause dur="0.4"/> bases <pause dur="4.6"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> how <pause dur="0.2"/> do we do that <pause dur="0.6"/> how do we do the whole thing what is the mechanism of D-N-A replication <pause dur="4.0"/> and that's where <pause dur="0.8"/> where i want to stop with thinking us through the mechanism of D-N-A replication <pause dur="0.8"/> and we'll then look at the diagram that you've got <pause dur="0.4"/> lastly on your handout which illustrates it <pause dur="0.9"/> so firstly <pause dur="0.2"/> obviously <pause dur="0.2"/> we need to unwind that double helix we need to make our replication bubble as we sometimes call it <pause dur="4.0"/> nature uses two mechanisms to <trunc>underwi</trunc> unwinding the double helix it uses an enzyme which actually physically unwinds it <pause dur="0.6"/> it's called a helicase <pause dur="1.3"/> okay and it actually does that by untwisting <pause dur="0.4"/> 
the Watson-Crick double helix <pause dur="2.0"/> and it uses the device of having a protein in the cells <pause dur="0.4"/> which binds strongly to single stranded D-N-A but not to <pause dur="0.3"/> double stranded D-N-A at all a single stranded binding protein <pause dur="0.7"/> okay so as soon as we part the strands <pause dur="0.5"/> this protein binds hard <pause dur="0.3"/> and the <pause dur="0.2"/> the strands are disinclined to come back together <pause dur="0.5"/> then we use two mechanisms <pause dur="0.3"/> for keeping the strands apart <pause dur="3.4"/> then we need to start making some D-N-A <pause dur="0.9"/> and we have a problem <pause dur="1.1"/> we have a problem <pause dur="1.3"/> that problem is <pause dur="2.1"/> clearly we need <pause dur="0.2"/> to get <pause dur="0.3"/> our <pause dur="3.5"/><kinesic desc="puts transparency on top of current slide" iterated="n"/> mechanism right so that we get the right base pairs <pause dur="1.2"/> and the best way to get the right base pairs matching <pause dur="1.0"/> is to have an enzyme <pause dur="0.9"/> which knows <pause dur="0.2"/> roughly <pause dur="0.7"/> how wide a D-N-A double helix is going to be <pause dur="0.5"/> and can fit it <pause dur="0.4"/> okay fit <pause dur="0.2"/> to the helix we've got <pause dur="0.2"/> fit to the distance <pause dur="0.4"/> because an A-T base pair and a C-G base pair are the same size as each other <pause dur="1.2"/> okay <pause dur="1.6"/> and <pause dur="0.6"/> the enzyme can't do that <pause dur="0.3"/> at the same time <pause dur="0.5"/> as starting a strand on its own <pause dur="1.8"/> the enzyme which makes D-N-A <pause dur="0.2"/> will not start a strand on its own <pause dur="0.9"/> so it needs to be helped <pause dur="0.9"/> and it needs to build a primer first <pause dur="1.5"/> okay <pause dur="0.6"/> and that primer's always made of R-N-A <pause dur="1.3"/> 
okay so we have to first in order to make D-N-A make some R-N-A <pause dur="2.1"/><kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="2"/> and what this means basically is going to this <pause dur="0.7"/><kinesic desc="writes on transparency" iterated="y" dur="30"/> going over here <pause dur="0.6"/> let's imagine we have our <pause dur="0.6"/> piece of D-N-A <pause dur="1.0"/> okay <pause dur="0.3"/> imagine this is the five-prime of it and this is the three-prime of it and we're going to make <pause dur="1.0"/> # <pause dur="1.0"/> some D-N-A here we're at the origin <pause dur="0.7"/> we start with a piece of R-N-A <pause dur="0.9"/> which <pause dur="1.0"/> bonds like that <pause dur="0.9"/> okay made from five-prime to three-prime <pause dur="1.7"/> and then the enzyme which makes D-N-A takes over from this point <pause dur="0.7"/> and makes D-N-A <pause dur="0.4"/> in the right direction <pause dur="1.5"/> okay <pause dur="1.7"/> so at the beginning <pause dur="1.2"/> of <pause dur="0.2"/> our <pause dur="0.2"/> D-N-A we have <pause dur="0.3"/> a combination of a primer made of R-N-A <pause dur="1.7"/> and an old strand <pause dur="0.4"/> of D-N-A which we're using <pause dur="0.2"/> to read <pause dur="0.4"/> the correct sequence which we call a template <pause dur="0.9"/> okay so at the beginning we have a template and a primer <pause dur="6.4"/> so we start the chain with R-N-A <pause dur="0.2"/> we make a primer <pause dur="0.4"/> and then we continue D-N-A synthesis <pause dur="0.9"/> on the continuous strand that we call 
the leading strand <pause dur="1.2"/> okay because it's always slightly ahead <pause dur="0.2"/> of the other strand in making D-N-A <pause dur="1.3"/> okay <pause dur="0.3"/> and on the other strand the lagging strand as we call it 'cause it is slightly behind <pause dur="0.7"/> okay <pause dur="0.7"/> we make those fragments those Okazaki fragments and we need one more process to go on and that is we need to join the fragments together <pause dur="1.2"/> okay so we need a ligase <pause dur="0.3"/> a joining together enzyme <pause dur="0.3"/> to join the fragments together <pause dur="2.0"/> so we can incorporate all that information <kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="7"/> about the mechanism of replication <pause dur="0.6"/> on the diagram here <pause dur="0.6"/> that i've given you a copy of <pause dur="2.4"/> okay which gives you a brief summary <pause dur="0.4"/> of D-N-A replication here's the parental D-N-A which has started <pause dur="0.7"/> it's being unwound at this point <pause dur="0.7"/> and there are single stranded binding proteins these are the pink fingers <pause dur="0.6"/> binding to the single stranded D-N-A <pause dur="2.1"/> all right <pause dur="0.2"/> then we <pause dur="1.0"/> we have D-N-A being made <pause dur="0.4"/> continuously in this direction <pause dur="0.9"/> okay by the enzyme 
which makes D-N-A the D-N-A polymerase <pause dur="1.3"/> and on this <pause dur="0.3"/> strand <pause dur="0.4"/> we're making bits of D-N-A <pause dur="1.7"/> but starting with R-N-A primers <pause dur="0.6"/> to make our Okazaki fragments <pause dur="0.6"/> we're then extending our Okazaki fragments <pause dur="0.9"/> and in the end <pause dur="0.6"/> here's the D-N-A ligase enzyme joining two Okazaki fragments together <pause dur="1.1"/> so we unwind <pause dur="0.9"/> continuously make D-N-A on this strand <pause dur="0.5"/> five-prime to three-prime direction <pause dur="0.4"/> we discontinuously make it on this strand starting with an R-N-A primer <pause dur="1.5"/> and then making our D-N-A until it bumps into the next one basically it just falls off and it bumps in <pause dur="0.8"/> and then we have to join up our two Okazaki fragments <pause dur="0.3"/> using a ligase <pause dur="1.1"/> so that is the basic mechanism <pause dur="0.3"/> of D-N-A replication and that's where we shall end <pause dur="0.6"/> this first <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="1.1"/> talk for this afternoon <pause dur="0.7"/> okay <pause dur="0.3"/> i'll be putting out some more handouts for you for the second talk in just a second <pause dur="0.8"/> we'll take a five minute break
