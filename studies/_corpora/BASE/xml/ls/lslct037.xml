<u who="nm0607"><kinesic desc="projector is on showing slide" iterated="n"/> right then <pause dur="0.4"/> okay that's great <pause dur="0.8"/> yeah so i said in Finland <pause dur="0.8"/> about thirty per cent of cases are only thirty per cent of cases are acquired out of country and the rest acquired in country <pause dur="1.5"/> so the next thing <kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> i want to show you is the <pause dur="1.6"/> it says the situation in the U-K <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> current situation in the U-K <pause dur="1.3"/> # that's a bit grim <pause dur="2.8"/> # <pause dur="1.5"/> i was just going to explain <pause dur="6.5"/><event desc="looks through slides" iterated="y" dur="25"/> you've got them in your handout </u><pause dur="0.3"/> <u who="sm0608" trans="pause"> yeah </u><u who="sf0609" trans="pause"> u-huh </u><u who="nm0607" trans="latching"><vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/> <pause dur="4.7"/> now <pause dur="1.7"/> i haven't put them on this copy i can't get onto my hard disk it's # <pause dur="1.0"/> let's shut this off a minute and we'll talk about that when we move on </u><gap reason="break in recording" extent="uncertain"/> <u who="nm0607" trans="pause"> so if we look at the first table this this gives you the most up to date information for the U-K <pause dur="0.4"/> okay <pause dur="0.6"/> and what you can see is cumulatively <pause dur="1.6"/> at the end of last year <pause dur="1.4"/> about fifty-two-thousand people <pause dur="0.8"/> had been diagnosed or fifty-three-thousand almost fifty-three-thousand down in the bottom <pause dur="0.3"/> right-hand corner <pause dur="0.4"/> had been diagnosed with H-I-V <pause dur="1.0"/> and of those roughly thirty-thousand <pause dur="1.1"/> were homosexual spread <pause dur="1.2"/> men-men <pause dur="1.0"/> and roughly fifteen-thousand so 
slightly under a third <pause dur="0.9"/> were <pause dur="0.2"/> heterosexual spread <pause dur="1.0"/> and then <pause dur="0.6"/> intravenous drug abuse comes next and then a relatively small number from blood products <pause dur="0.6"/> about a thousand just under a thousand mother to infant transmission and then a couple of thousand where it's not quite clear how the transmission occurred <pause dur="0.9"/> the thing that you should notice along the bottom <pause dur="1.1"/> is that up until around about ninety-ninety-seven <pause dur="1.0"/> the number of newly acquired infections each year is relatively stable <pause dur="1.0"/> and then it starts to accelerate again <pause dur="0.8"/> and in fact in the period September two-thousand-and-one to September two-thousand-and-two <pause dur="0.4"/> there's been some five-thousand-three-hundred <pause dur="0.4"/> new <pause dur="0.6"/> infections diagnosed <pause dur="1.4"/> so you can see that after a period of about ten years of relatively stable new infection rates <pause dur="1.2"/> the epidemic is <pause dur="0.4"/> in this country <pause dur="0.3"/> is increasing again <pause dur="0.2"/> not dramatically but it is going up at the rate of <pause dur="0.6"/> roughly <pause dur="0.8"/> fifteen to twenty per cent increased incidence a year <pause dur="2.8"/> and if you look at table 
two <pause dur="2.3"/> what table two shows you is <pause dur="0.9"/> diagnosis by <pause dur="1.0"/> exposure category <pause dur="2.0"/> for <pause dur="0.6"/> just for one year just for the last year September <pause dur="0.5"/> two-thousand-and-one to September two-thousand-and-two <pause dur="2.5"/> and you can see that <pause dur="1.3"/> this <trunc>sh</trunc> this <pause dur="0.8"/> table shows you two things it shows you <pause dur="0.7"/> the distribution according to what type of category the infection was <pause dur="0.6"/> in so men-men <pause dur="0.6"/> and heterosexual spread and various subdivisions of heterosexual spread and you can see in there the figure that shows <pause dur="1.0"/> for heterosexual # <trunc>s</trunc> # spread acquired abroad <pause dur="0.7"/> no evidence of a high risk partner <pause dur="0.9"/> okay <pause dur="0.6"/> <trunc>acquir</trunc> U-K acquired no evidence of a high risk partner <pause dur="0.7"/> and you can see it broken down by region <pause dur="1.5"/> and the thing i want to come out of the broken down by region is you can see that both in terms of <pause dur="0.5"/> the acquired infections last year and the total number of infections acquired <pause dur="1.0"/> London is an epicentre <pause dur="1.3"/> yeah <pause dur="3.5"/> and then the final table i've given you <pause dur="3.1"/> is <pause dur="1.0"/> again <pause dur="0.2"/> year is is more total figures this is <pause dur="0.4"/> year of <trunc>infectio</trunc> <pause dur="0.5"/> year of infection over 
the last ten years <pause dur="1.5"/> and the area where the infection was acquired <pause dur="0.3"/> or was diagnosed in fact not necessarily acquired <pause dur="0.5"/> and again what emerges from that is you can see that across the total epidemic of the <pause dur="0.3"/> fifty-odd-thousand cases <pause dur="0.8"/> some were over thirty-thousand thirty-two-thousand <pause dur="0.4"/> were acquired in the London area <pause dur="1.7"/> what that's telling you is <pause dur="0.4"/> even in the epidemic in this country <pause dur="0.7"/> the <pause dur="0.2"/> the risk <pause dur="0.3"/> varies according to where in the country you are <pause dur="0.7"/> okay and that would be true in most countries <pause dur="0.8"/> risk is not uniform <pause dur="1.3"/> okay and it's it's a it's an important message to get across to you <pause dur="2.7"/> okay <pause dur="0.8"/> so you can see the situation globally <pause dur="0.6"/> is we've got some forty-million people <pause dur="1.5"/> infected <pause dur="0.9"/> but actually the U-S-A the U-S the U-K's contribution to this forty-million <pause dur="0.5"/> is pretty small <pause dur="0.7"/> it's only fifty-two-thousand <pause dur="1.8"/> in fact it's less than fifty-two-thousand really because <pause dur="0.5"/> you're talking about <pause dur="0.5"/> a significant fraction of the fifty-two-thousand diagnosed cases in this country will already be 
dead i can't remember <pause dur="0.4"/> what the total is it's around about thirty-thousand of them have already died <pause dur="0.8"/> so we're only contributing about twenty-thousand <pause dur="0.6"/> between twenty and thirty-thousand <pause dur="0.2"/> to that forty-million figure <pause dur="0.7"/> in this country <pause dur="1.6"/> okay <pause dur="1.4"/> all right that's all i'm going to say about the <pause dur="1.0"/> the epidemic <pause dur="0.8"/> okay <pause dur="0.7"/> the important message you've got to take across about the epidemic is <pause dur="1.1"/> it's a <trunc>c</trunc> huge global problem <pause dur="1.5"/> it's still an escalating <sic corr="global">grobal</sic> problem <pause dur="1.1"/> okay <pause dur="0.2"/> the numbers are going up rapidly they are not stable or going down <pause dur="0.7"/> okay <pause dur="0.6"/> and it's predominantly a problem in the developing world <pause dur="0.9"/> particularly sub-Saharan Africa <pause dur="0.7"/> where you've seen from some of the incidence figures i showed you in the last lecture <pause dur="0.5"/> that there are quite frightening consequences for social structures in some of those countries <pause dur="0.9"/> you know <pause dur="1.6"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> less of a problem in the developed world more under control in the developed world <pause dur="1.1"/> more under more <trunc>un</trunc> control 
more under control still in this country <pause dur="1.3"/> most of the spread in this country is still <pause dur="0.3"/> homosexual spread although heterosexual spread <pause dur="0.3"/> is the most rapidly growing <pause dur="0.2"/> category <pause dur="1.3"/> and most of that heterosexual spread <pause dur="0.5"/> is <pause dur="0.2"/> infection acquired <pause dur="0.2"/> out of the country <pause dur="1.0"/> so by somebody going from this country and having a sex partner <pause dur="0.3"/> in a country where the generalized epidemic is <trunc>a</trunc> is going on <pause dur="0.3"/> at a high level <pause dur="0.8"/> rather than spread within the country <pause dur="2.2"/> all right what i want to do now is move away from talking about the epidemic in a broad sense and start talking about <pause dur="0.5"/> the virus <pause dur="1.2"/> okay and the infection <pause dur="0.7"/> so we have another <pause dur="0.4"/> chunk of handouts and i'll try and get <pause dur="0.6"/> this up while you hand those around <pause dur="2.6"/><event desc="passes out handouts" iterated="n"/> if i can find me <pause dur="0.2"/> pointer again <pause dur="1.3"/> i've put the bally thing down <pause dur="0.2"/> here we go </u><gap reason="break in recording" extent="uncertain"/> <u who="nm0607" trans="pause"><kinesic desc="projector is on showing slide" iterated="n"/> right <pause dur="2.4"/> i hope you will already have seen a <trunc>v</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> a version of this sort of slide maybe not a precisely <pause dur="0.2"/> this but a version of this <pause dur="0.8"/> so this is the virus we're talking about H-I-V <pause dur="0.8"/> H-I-V <pause dur="0.3"/> 
is a retrovirus to remind you <pause dur="0.6"/> what that means is that is that unusually for a <trunc>vir</trunc> <kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> oops let me back up here <pause dur="7.2"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> oh <pause dur="0.2"/> bother <pause dur="5.1"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> unusually for a virus it has a diploid genome <pause dur="0.2"/> there are two pieces <pause dur="0.6"/> of single strand <pause dur="0.8"/> positive sense <pause dur="0.5"/> R-N-A <pause dur="0.4"/> contained within the virus particle <pause dur="5.1"/> the R-N-A is approximately ten kilobases in length <pause dur="0.6"/> just under ten kilobases in length <pause dur="2.0"/> it is <pause dur="0.5"/> it is surrounded <pause dur="2.0"/> by a <pause dur="0.6"/> capsid structure <pause dur="0.9"/> composed of <pause dur="0.6"/> a number of proteins <pause dur="0.6"/> P-twenty-four being the major protein <pause dur="0.9"/> and when H-I-V is diagnosed <pause dur="0.9"/> it is in fact antibodies against P-twenty-four <pause dur="1.2"/> that form the main basis of <pause dur="0.3"/> diagnosis <pause dur="2.8"/> so <pause dur="0.2"/> the bulk of H-I-V diagnosis does not involve <pause dur="0.3"/> looking directly for the agent itself for looking for the virus itself <pause dur="0.6"/> that usually comes <pause dur="0.3"/> as a confirmatory test <pause dur="0.8"/> the bulk of diagnosis is looking <pause dur="0.3"/> by looking for antibodies against this <pause dur="0.4"/> major structural protein <pause dur="0.9"/> P-twenty-four <pause dur="0.5"/> that makes up the inner capsid shell <pause dur="3.5"/> this <pause dur="0.6"/> capsid shell has a 
toroid <pause dur="0.2"/> type of structure a sort of <pause dur="0.3"/> bit like a a flattened ended cone <pause dur="2.8"/> <trunc>m</trunc> <pause dur="0.7"/> on the R-N-A is the reverse transcriptase enzyme <pause dur="1.1"/> this is a retrovirus so which group in the Baltimore classification scheme is this in </u><pause dur="0.6"/> <u who="sm0610" trans="pause"> six </u><pause dur="2.2"/> <u who="nm0607" trans="pause"> didn't hear it very loud </u><pause dur="0.3"/> <u who="sm0610" trans="pause"> six </u><u who="nm0607" trans="latching"> six that's right six <pause dur="0.7"/> so it goes through a D-N-A intermediate so the first thing that it's got to do when it gets inside the infected cell is convert its <pause dur="0.5"/> single strand <pause dur="0.4"/> positive sense R-N-A <pause dur="0.5"/> into duplex D-N-A <pause dur="0.6"/> and it's transcription from that duplex D-N-A <pause dur="0.6"/> that gives rise to the viral messenger R-N-A <pause dur="2.5"/> the <pause dur="1.1"/> toroidal <pause dur="0.2"/> capsid is surrounded if i can ever find my pointer again there we go <pause dur="0.4"/> is surrounded by matrix protein <pause dur="0.7"/> shown <kinesic desc="indicates point on slide" iterated="n"/> here in green <pause dur="1.4"/> that's then surrounded by a lipid envelope <pause dur="0.3"/> so this is a lipid containing virus <pause dur="1.3"/> and embedded in that lipid envelope <pause dur="0.5"/> is the <pause dur="0.6"/> envelope 
protein of the virus <pause dur="1.1"/> and the envelope protein is synthesized as a precursor <pause dur="3.7"/> called <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="3"/> G-P-<pause dur="1.4"/>one-sixty <pause dur="1.5"/> the G-P standing for glycoprotein because this envelope <pause dur="0.7"/> protein <pause dur="0.5"/> is a glycoprotein <pause dur="1.2"/> and after synthesis G-P-one-sixty is cleaved <pause dur="0.8"/> to produce G-P-one-twenty <pause dur="1.0"/> which forms the head <pause dur="2.4"/> of the <pause dur="2.0"/> envelope protein sticking outside the lipid envelope <pause dur="1.9"/> and G-P-forty-one which is kind of like the stalk <pause dur="1.3"/> that through non-covalent interactions <pause dur="0.3"/> holds the <pause dur="0.3"/> G-P-one-twenty in place <pause dur="0.7"/> and the G-P-forty-one is a transmembrane protein it <pause dur="0.2"/> it goes through the lipid bilayer membrane <pause dur="2.0"/> okay <pause dur="1.0"/> down here at the bottom <pause dur="1.6"/><kinesic desc="indicates point on slide" iterated="n"/> is the gene organization <pause dur="0.3"/> of this virus <pause dur="2.1"/> and <pause dur="1.3"/> it's like any other retrovirus it <pause dur="0.6"/> but has some additional genes what genes do normal retroviruses carry </u><pause dur="1.9"/> <u who="sf0611" trans="pause"> gag pol and env </u><pause dur="1.0"/> <u who="sm0612" trans="pause"> gag pol and env </u><u who="nm0607" trans="latching"> gag pol and env and you can see here <pause dur="0.9"/><kinesic desc="indicates point on slide" iterated="n"/> gag <pause dur="1.3"/><kinesic desc="indicates point on slide" iterated="n"/> pol <pause dur="1.1"/> and <kinesic desc="indicates point on slide" iterated="n"/> env <pause dur="1.2"/> okay <pause dur="0.7"/> but H-I-V is unusual 
in having a number of <trunc>othe</trunc> additional proteins usually referred to as accessory proteins <pause dur="3.1"/> and the degree to which we understand what these accessory proteins actually do for the virus <pause dur="0.5"/> varies according to which protein we are talking about <pause dur="1.5"/> so for example you will already have heard in this lecture series quite extensively about tat and rev <pause dur="1.0"/> tat and rev are involved in the regulation of gene expression by this virus <pause dur="0.9"/> okay <pause dur="0.7"/> but you won't have heard anything yet for example <pause dur="0.5"/> about vif <pause dur="1.4"/> okay <pause dur="0.8"/> vif is another accessory protein <pause dur="0.4"/> that overlaps <pause dur="0.3"/> the carboxy terminal end of the coding region of <pause dur="0.9"/> the R-T gene the polymerase gene <pause dur="0.7"/> and the amino terminal region of the V-P-R gene <pause dur="1.8"/> and vif stands for virus infectivity factor <pause dur="4.5"/> it's the protein that <trunc>m</trunc> <pause dur="0.3"/> of H-I-V that the limited amount of H-I-V work that i do that's the protein that we work on vif is an interesting protein <pause dur="0.5"/> in that <pause dur="1.7"/> as the name implies it's required <pause dur="0.6"/> for virus infectivity <pause dur="1.6"/> and if this protein is absent <pause dur="0.9"/> and you try and grow 
virus in the <pause dur="2.5"/> normal host cells for this virus <pause dur="0.7"/> which are C-D-four-positive lymphocytes <pause dur="0.5"/> then the progeny virus that is produced is non-infectious <pause dur="4.5"/> it turns out <pause dur="0.7"/> that vif <pause dur="0.5"/> is actually required to overcome a normal cellular <pause dur="0.4"/> protein that's an inhibitory factor <pause dur="0.7"/> for H-I-V replication <pause dur="0.9"/> and i don't have time to go into the detail and anyway the detail is not pertinent to <pause dur="0.2"/> the rest of what i'm going to say <pause dur="1.0"/> so there are a number of accessory proteins down here <pause dur="1.4"/> and three <pause dur="0.4"/> major normal retrovirus proteins gag which <trunc>m</trunc> <pause dur="0.6"/> is a <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="1.2"/> is made as a polyprotein initially <pause dur="1.3"/> called <pause dur="3.2"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="6"/> # <pause dur="3.0"/> P-R-fifty-five <pause dur="1.3"/> 'cause of the fifty-five kilodalton <pause dur="4.2"/> precursor <pause dur="1.0"/> and that precursor is cleaved through the action of a <pause dur="0.5"/> virion encoded protease gene <pause dur="1.6"/> that undertakes the major cleavages necessary to convert <pause dur="0.7"/> P-R-fifty-five <pause dur="1.0"/> into <pause dur="1.3"/> P-seventeen P-twenty-four P-six P-one P-seven a number of <pause dur="0.8"/> structural proteins that make up this <pause dur="0.3"/><kinesic desc="indicates point on slide" iterated="n"/> capsid shell here that i'm 
pointing to <pause dur="2.9"/> okay <pause dur="1.5"/> so that's the virus we're talking about <pause dur="1.3"/> let's move on then to look at the pattern of this infection <pause dur="4.2"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> now you can divide H-I-V infection <pause dur="0.8"/> into three broad stages <pause dur="1.9"/> there's the primary infection <pause dur="2.3"/> which occurs over a few weeks <pause dur="2.6"/> there's a long period of what is usually called clinical latency <pause dur="2.9"/> and then there's the <pause dur="0.5"/> terminal stage of disease <pause dur="0.4"/> which we usually refer to as AIDS <pause dur="2.4"/> and the important point to see <kinesic desc="indicates point on slide" iterated="n"/> down here is the scale <pause dur="1.9"/> you can see that the primary infection <pause dur="0.7"/> occurs over a matter of weeks <pause dur="2.8"/> the latent period <pause dur="1.8"/> can be years <pause dur="0.8"/> there are certainly people around who have <pause dur="0.7"/> been well <pause dur="0.5"/> for more than a dozen years <pause dur="0.7"/> and then for some reason that's not entirely clear <pause dur="0.4"/> gone into full-blown AIDS <pause dur="2.5"/> the point about this <pause dur="1.3"/> is <pause dur="0.2"/> once you go into AIDS you are going to die <pause dur="1.2"/> okay <pause dur="1.7"/> you may you may be it may be possible to hold you <pause dur="0.9"/> through <pause dur="0.2"/> using antivirals that i'll talk about in a minute <pause dur="1.0"/> in <pause dur="0.2"/> in some sort of semblance of reasonable health for a period of time <pause dur="1.4"/> but for example <pause dur="0.5"/> when <pause dur="0.5"/> 
A-Z-T zidovudine the main <pause dur="0.3"/> R-T antiviral inhibitor was <trunc>u</trunc> used extensively in the United States in monotherapy <pause dur="0.9"/> it improved your life expectancy as an AIDS victim from ten months to twenty months <pause dur="2.1"/> so it had an effect <pause dur="0.5"/> one shouldn't underestimate its effect <pause dur="0.7"/> but <pause dur="0.8"/> it didn't mean that you were going to survive <pause dur="0.9"/> for <pause dur="0.2"/> a long period of time and have a natural lifespan <pause dur="1.4"/> okay i want to talk <pause dur="0.8"/> a little bit about <pause dur="0.4"/> the division of these different <pause dur="0.6"/> # stages of the disease <pause dur="0.8"/> by symptomology <pause dur="1.6"/> and <pause dur="0.3"/> this really <pause dur="2.3"/> deals with the <pause dur="0.3"/> the clinical pattern of disease <pause dur="0.9"/> okay <pause dur="1.3"/> and i want to <pause dur="0.3"/><kinesic desc="indicates slide" iterated="n"/> keep referring back to this as i talk about the clinical pattern of disease <pause dur="0.4"/> okay <pause dur="1.7"/> now of course once <pause dur="0.6"/> people started to diagnose H-I-V it became important <pause dur="0.5"/> to have available to clinicians <pause dur="0.4"/> some sort of definition <pause dur="0.9"/> of what stage of this process <pause dur="0.4"/> a particular patient that might present to them <pause dur="0.5"/> was at <pause dur="0.7"/> okay <pause dur="0.8"/> and <pause dur="0.4"/> two systems grew up <pause dur="0.7"/> quite quickly <pause dur="0.6"/> one was proposed by the C-D-C 
the Centre for Disease Control remember the place in Atlanta i said that is the sort of <pause dur="0.3"/> American equivalent of the P-H-L-S <pause dur="1.1"/> okay <pause dur="1.3"/> and the other grew up <pause dur="1.2"/> through <pause dur="0.5"/> a major <pause dur="0.2"/> hospital in the United States in Washington called the Walter Reed Hospital now the Walter Reed Hospital has a very long history of dealing with tropical diseases <pause dur="1.4"/> okay <pause dur="0.9"/> and these two <pause dur="0.8"/> # organizations proposed a staging <pause dur="0.9"/> system <pause dur="0.4"/> to allow clinicians to <pause dur="1.0"/> define when a patient presented to them what stage of disease that patient was in <pause dur="1.5"/> the C-D-C system <pause dur="2.1"/> defined people <pause dur="0.7"/> as being in stage one <pause dur="0.6"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="3"/> through <pause dur="0.2"/> to four <pause dur="1.3"/> and this was romanic one through to romanic four <pause dur="4.2"/> the Walter Reed system <pause dur="0.7"/> allowed you to divide <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="2"/> people <pause dur="0.3"/> in a stages zero to six <pause dur="6.9"/> now it's important of course <pause dur="0.4"/> when a new disease comes along <pause dur="0.2"/> to have some sort of system of clinically defining the disease <pause dur="0.5"/> why is that <vocal desc="belch" iterated="n"/> important excuse me <pause dur="0.7"/> well it allows you to do surveillance studies that's the 
first thing it allows you to do it allows you to actually survey the disease <pause dur="0.8"/> particularly when you've got a disease that you know is going to <pause dur="0.6"/> is going to develop over a long period of time <pause dur="0.9"/> it allows you to survey its development <pause dur="0.5"/> it allows you to do epidemiological studies what is the incidence of infection <pause dur="1.5"/> and of course it will if you've got some sort of therapeutic intervention <trunc>metha</trunc> <trunc>measur</trunc> measure method <pause dur="0.4"/> it will allow you to measure how how good that therapeutic intervention is <pause dur="2.0"/> now these two schemes the C-D-C scheme <pause dur="1.6"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="7"/> and the Walter Reed scheme <pause dur="1.6"/> when they were first proposed <pause dur="1.0"/> in the middle nineteen-eighties they were both used <pause dur="3.1"/> they each have advantages and disadvantages <pause dur="1.8"/> the C-D-C system <pause dur="0.9"/> is largely based on clinical observation of the patient <pause dur="3.0"/> so basic simple clinical observation of the patient <pause dur="1.1"/> weight <pause dur="1.1"/> # symptomology <pause dur="1.1"/> okay <pause dur="0.5"/> very little lab very little involvement of lab indicators 
or immune system indicators <pause dur="1.2"/> by contrast the Walter Reed system <pause dur="0.7"/> is <trunc>ba</trunc> is mainly based <pause dur="0.4"/> on laboratory diagnostic assays <pause dur="6.3"/> now on a global scale <pause dur="0.6"/> the C-D-C system <pause dur="0.7"/> took over relatively quickly <pause dur="0.9"/> from the Walter Reed system and the main reason for that <pause dur="0.2"/> was because <pause dur="0.6"/> the disease grew rapidly <pause dur="0.4"/> in countries that were not well set up <pause dur="0.5"/> to do the laboratory diagnostic assays that could easily be done in the United States <pause dur="1.5"/> and so the C-D-C system is the system that you will most often hear about today and is the system that's broadly used <pause dur="0.4"/> to define what stage someone is in <pause dur="3.7"/> so <pause dur="0.3"/> in this system then stage one <pause dur="4.0"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="1"/> is the acute <pause dur="0.4"/> phase of infection <pause dur="6.6"/> and this acute primary infection <pause dur="0.6"/><kinesic desc="indicates point on slide" iterated="n"/> period <pause dur="1.3"/> is most usually asymptomatic <pause dur="2.2"/> so the person is infected <pause dur="1.6"/> but most commonly they have no idea that they are infected they they exhibit no symptomology <pause dur="1.0"/> if they do <trunc>exhibtib</trunc> # exhibit symptomology <pause dur="0.7"/> it's basically a flu-like syndrome <pause dur="2.1"/> they might get some fever they might get a bit of nausea they might 
be a little bit lethargic perhaps a little bit of diarrhoea <pause dur="0.4"/> a sore throat et cetera <pause dur="0.8"/> but nothing that's very specific i mean there are lots of things that would cause that <pause dur="0.8"/> you know a bad night on the bevvy would cause most of those symptoms <pause dur="0.3"/> okay so <pause dur="0.6"/> in the acute phase there really # <trunc>ev</trunc> if there's any symptomology at all <pause dur="0.8"/> it's nothing that you can kind of put your finger on and say ah you know i know this person is probably infected with H-I-V because they've got this symptom <pause dur="1.1"/> okay <pause dur="3.1"/> the only lab indicators you get in this acute phase <pause dur="0.3"/> are a transient leukopenia and <trunc>lympha</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> lymphopenia <pause dur="1.2"/> so a transient drop <trunc>leukope</trunc> penia <pause dur="0.5"/> means drop basically <pause dur="1.0"/> so a transient drop in leukocyte numbers and lymphocyte numbers <pause dur="5.7"/> you might get an inversion <pause dur="0.9"/> of the ratio of C-D-four to C-D-eight cells in the bloodstream <pause dur="2.7"/> but it's important to realize that at this stage in the <trunc>fect</trunc> infection that is not due to a drop in C-D-four cells it's due actually to an increase in C-D-eight cells <pause dur="6.9"/> okay <pause dur="1.7"/> you may 
see some atypical lymphocytes in blood smears but you may not <pause dur="1.7"/> okay <pause dur="0.3"/> so the picture i'm painting then of stage one <pause dur="0.6"/> is somebody who's infected <pause dur="2.1"/> probably has no idea they're infected has no symptomology <pause dur="1.7"/> okay <pause dur="1.4"/> and will take <pause dur="0.5"/> somewhere between <pause dur="1.6"/> a few days <pause dur="1.2"/> and as long as three months <pause dur="1.4"/> to seroconvert <pause dur="2.9"/> now you remember i said to you that when people are diagnosed as being H-I-V positive <pause dur="0.8"/> the main form of diagnosis is seroconversion the production of antibodies against one of the structural proteins of the virus <pause dur="2.1"/> so in the period up to three months <pause dur="0.8"/> after the person has been infected <pause dur="1.5"/> there are probably no indicators either to that individual <pause dur="1.7"/> through symptomology or indeed <pause dur="0.5"/> to the health authorities <pause dur="0.6"/> through some sort of diagnostic assay <pause dur="0.2"/> that they've actually been infected <pause dur="2.8"/> unless <pause dur="0.6"/> the diagnosis is looking specifically for virus <pause dur="1.8"/> the reason for that is as you can see <pause dur="0.5"/><kinesic desc="indicates point on slide" iterated="n"/> from the virus count here in the blue line <pause dur="0.7"/> it is 
during this period <pause dur="1.4"/> that virus titres in the bloodstream <pause dur="0.7"/> are probably at their highest level until you get right to the terminal stages of disease <pause dur="3.3"/> okay <pause dur="1.2"/> so what does that tell you about this individual <pause dur="0.8"/> in terms of <pause dur="0.4"/> societal risk </u><pause dur="2.5"/> <u who="sm0613" trans="pause"> they're at their most infectious </u><pause dur="0.3"/> <u who="nm0607" trans="pause"> yeah and </u><pause dur="0.8"/> <u who="sm0613" trans="pause"> they don't know </u><pause dur="0.4"/> <u who="nm0607" trans="pause"> and what does that mean for society </u><pause dur="0.5"/> <u who="sm0613" trans="pause"> that <pause dur="0.2"/> you're going to get a lot of spread </u><pause dur="0.4"/> <u who="nm0607" trans="pause"> exactly <pause dur="1.3"/> it's people in this phase here <pause dur="1.0"/> that as far as society is concerned <pause dur="0.3"/> are the greatest danger to society <pause dur="1.5"/> okay <pause dur="0.9"/> because these people <pause dur="0.9"/> don't know they're ill <pause dur="1.3"/> don't know that they've become infected <pause dur="0.9"/> are probably <trunc>con</trunc> going to continue in the lifestyle that they had <pause dur="0.3"/> prior to getting infected <pause dur="1.0"/> and so are probably going to continue to do <pause dur="0.8"/> the very acts that resulted in 
them being infected and so are very much more likely <pause dur="0.5"/> to infect other people and they're particularly likely to infect other people <pause dur="0.4"/> because they have the highest level of virus <pause dur="0.3"/> in their bloodstream so they have the greatest chance <kinesic desc="indicates point on slide" iterated="n"/> at this point <pause dur="0.4"/> of passing on the infection <pause dur="2.5"/> okay <pause dur="5.9"/> as far as seroconversion is concerned okay <pause dur="0.8"/> what is the first antibody you would expect to detect after a seroconversion <pause dur="3.3"/> what are the main classes of antibody that you get in the bloodstream <pause dur="2.5"/> there are three <pause dur="2.9"/> huh </u><pause dur="0.9"/> <u who="sf0614" trans="pause"> <unclear>I-G-G</unclear> </u><pause dur="0.5"/> <u who="nm0607" trans="pause"> I-G-G's one </u><pause dur="0.9"/> <u who="sm0615" trans="pause"> I-G-M </u><pause dur="0.3"/> <u who="nm0607" trans="pause"> I-G-M's two <pause dur="2.6"/> what's the third one </u><pause dur="1.6"/> <u who="sm0616" trans="pause"> I-G-N </u><pause dur="0.5"/> <u who="nm0607" trans="pause"> I-G </u><u who="sm0616" trans="latching"> N </u><u who="nm0607" trans="latching"> okay so which out of these three then <pause dur="0.5"/> are you most likely to detect <pause dur="0.7"/> first <pause dur="1.8"/> after

long term antibody response that you will see in a human <pause dur="1.4"/> peaks <pause dur="1.3"/> okay <pause dur="1.1"/> so that's all i'm going to going to <sic corr="say">stay</sic> about stage one <pause dur="1.5"/> other than to say that <pause dur="1.7"/> you must <pause dur="0.3"/> notice <pause dur="0.3"/> that what happens at the end of stage one as far as the virus titre is concerned <pause dur="1.0"/> is that it drops <pause dur="2.1"/> and you should remember that this <kinesic desc="indicates point on slide" iterated="n"/> graph over here <pause dur="0.6"/> the virus titre is a log scale <pause dur="1.9"/> so it's a it's <pause dur="0.2"/> it's a little bit misleading to look at this graph and think oh well it doesn't actually go down very much <pause dur="1.9"/> it drops about a hundredfold <pause dur="2.1"/> to a thousandfold in terms of titre <pause dur="0.9"/> that means that at the end of the acute phase <pause dur="0.6"/> the person is going to be <pause dur="0.2"/> a hundred to a thousand times less likely <pause dur="0.7"/> to transmit the virus <pause dur="0.7"/> than they are at the peak of the acute phase <pause dur="2.2"/><kinesic desc="indicates point on slide" iterated="n"/> this drop in virus <pause dur="0.5"/> is as a response of the <trunc>immu</trunc> is is <pause dur="0.8"/> comes from the immune response <pause dur="0.8"/> that has been activated against the virus both a <pause dur="0.3"/> humoral and cell-mediated immune response <pause dur="0.7"/> that is able to some degree to get the virus under 
control and eliminate it <pause dur="1.5"/> but the crucial thing is it's to some degree <pause dur="1.7"/> like all persistent virus infections <pause dur="0.4"/> the immune response in this case is not able to completely eliminate the virus <pause dur="2.9"/> it gets it under control but it doesn't eliminate it <pause dur="3.1"/> okay <pause dur="0.4"/> so that takes us from stage one then <pause dur="0.5"/> into stage two <pause dur="2.8"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="1"/> now stage two of infection <pause dur="0.7"/> is this period of what is usually referred to as clinical latency <pause dur="5.8"/> now what you can see in clinical latency <pause dur="1.8"/> is that first of all it can be very long <pause dur="2.1"/> okay <pause dur="1.2"/> it can also be relatively short <pause dur="3.0"/> so of course when it was realized <pause dur="1.2"/> that this period <pause dur="1.1"/> was of variable <pause dur="1.2"/> and somewhat indeterminate length <pause dur="1.1"/> the first thing that people started looking for <pause dur="0.6"/> were prognostic indicators <pause dur="2.0"/> was there any indicator during this period <pause dur="0.7"/> that would tell you how long it's going to last <pause dur="2.8"/> and why would that be important well it would be important because <pause dur="0.4"/> during <kinesic desc="indicates point on slide" iterated="n"/> this period <pause dur="0.5"/> the people are well <pause dur="2.0"/> they're not <trunc>a</trunc> they're not exhibiting any disease symptoms <pause dur="0.3"/> they are 
well <pause dur="1.2"/> okay <pause dur="0.8"/> if you acquire the infection <pause dur="0.6"/> at twenty years of age <pause dur="1.0"/> and somebody <sic corr="tells">sells</sic> you well according to your prognostic indicator <pause dur="0.4"/> you're not likely to go out of this <pause dur="0.2"/> period of clinical latency for fifty years <pause dur="0.9"/> you're not going to worry about it too much right 'cause you're probably going to be killed by something else before you get to seventy <pause dur="0.6"/> yeah <pause dur="0.7"/> but if somebody says to you <pause dur="0.4"/> according to your <trunc>prostic</trunc> prognostic indicators your clinical <trunc>peri</trunc> period of clinical latency is going to be two years <pause dur="1.2"/> then you're going to start <pause dur="0.2"/> you know living life and spending money pretty quick because <shift feature="voice" new="laugh"/>in<shift feature="voice" new="normal"/> five years you're going to be dead <pause dur="0.4"/> probably in four years you're going to be dead <pause dur="0.6"/> okay <pause dur="1.5"/> i i've i've laid it out in a in a dramatic fashion <pause dur="0.3"/> so that you realize that there was an enormous amount of pressure in the mid-eighties <pause dur="0.4"/> to try and come up with prognostic indicators because that's what people were worried about <pause dur="1.0"/> i am sick doctor you know <pause dur="0.3"/> i am 
infected with something doctor when am i going to get sick is the question that was being asked <pause dur="0.7"/> okay <pause dur="1.9"/> now what you can see that is going on during this period <pause dur="1.1"/> is <pause dur="0.6"/> there is a very slow but almost imperceptible rise <pause dur="0.6"/> in the viral load <pause dur="2.7"/> the level of virus in the bloodstream <pause dur="1.4"/> okay <pause dur="3.4"/> but at the same time there is a clear drop going on <pause dur="1.1"/> in the level of C-D-four-positive lymphocytes <pause dur="1.3"/> in the bloodstream <pause dur="4.8"/> and in fact the <pause dur="0.4"/> the first sort of indicator <pause dur="1.3"/> that people started to use <pause dur="4.3"/> were <pause dur="2.9"/> this level of C-D-four count <pause dur="0.9"/> i should just back up a second and just <pause dur="0.3"/> tell you a little bit about in the in the epidemic in the United States which was the <trunc>e</trunc> area where the long <trunc>ter</trunc> first long term studies were done <pause dur="1.6"/> they started by looking at <pause dur="0.6"/> about seven-thousand homosexuals <pause dur="0.6"/> over a ten year period <pause dur="0.9"/> yeah <pause dur="0.4"/> so the first ten years from the <pause dur="0.7"/> from the <pause dur="0.3"/> early nineteen-eighties through to the early nineteen-nineties <pause dur="0.6"/> and in that ten year period <pause dur="2.3"/> thirty-six per cent of them <pause dur="0.3"/> thirty-six per cent of 
the people had developed AIDS within that ten year period <pause dur="4.2"/> forty-four per cent of them <pause dur="1.0"/> were showing symptoms of going into AIDS by the end of the ten year period <pause dur="0.7"/> so these were people who were recruited early they were already infected early in the <pause dur="1.1"/> epidemic <pause dur="0.5"/> and followed over ten years <pause dur="1.4"/> so by the end of that ten years <pause dur="0.5"/> somewhere close to eighty per cent of them <pause dur="0.9"/> were already showing symptoms of going into disease <pause dur="2.7"/> but twenty per cent of them one in five <pause dur="0.4"/> were completely asymptomatic at the end of a ten year period <pause dur="1.0"/> and this is in the period where there was really virtually no <pause dur="1.1"/> # antiviral <trunc>immuno</trunc> # antiviral therapy going on <pause dur="2.0"/> okay <pause dur="3.2"/> now <pause dur="0.3"/> prognostic indicator <pause dur="1.3"/> C-D-four counts <pause dur="3.4"/> people in the early phase <pause dur="1.5"/> of <pause dur="0.7"/> the next stage stage three <pause dur="2.0"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="2"/> now stage three if you look at the recent literature <pause dur="0.4"/> stage three has kind of fallen into disrepute <pause dur="1.2"/> it used to be a period where <pause dur="0.5"/> people were said to have what's called either ARC <pause dur="0.5"/> AIDS Related Complex <pause dur="1.9"/> or P-G-L Progressive 
Generalized <sic corr="Lymphadenopathy">Lymphoadenopathy</sic> <pause dur="3.2"/> and in a sense what it was measuring was people starting to <pause dur="0.4"/> tip over into AIDS <pause dur="5.6"/> and <pause dur="0.9"/> one study for example <pause dur="0.6"/> looking at homosexual men who were already in P-G-L <pause dur="0.5"/> so were already at the end of stage two beginning of stage three <pause dur="1.3"/> followed them over twenty months so only two-and-a-half years <pause dur="1.2"/> and if their C-D-four count at the beginning of that twenty months was less than two-hundred <pause dur="1.1"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="2"/> per ml <pause dur="1.9"/> by the end of the twenty month period sixty per cent of them had progressed to AIDS <pause dur="3.7"/> by contrast <pause dur="0.8"/> if their <pause dur="1.5"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="5"/> C-D-four count was greater than three-hundred-and-fifty <pause dur="1.8"/> per ml <pause dur="2.0"/> only ten per cent of them <pause dur="0.7"/> were in full-blown AIDS </u><pause dur="2.3"/> <u who="sm0619" trans="pause"> sorry what was the percentage of the first one </u><u who="nm0607" trans="latching"> sixty <pause dur="0.2"/> sixty per cent of the people after twenty months <pause dur="0.4"/> were in full-blown AIDS if their C-D-four count at the beginning was <kinesic desc="indicates point on board" iterated="n"/> this level <pause dur="1.8"/> and <pause dur="1.0"/> only ten per cent if it was <kinesic desc="indicates point on board" iterated="n"/> this level <pause dur="1.9"/> 
it's important to point out to you that in these early studies there was a lot of controversy <pause dur="0.6"/> because people were not used to measuring <pause dur="0.5"/> C-D-four counts in humans <pause dur="0.7"/> and it took a little while to realize that actually your C-D <pause dur="0.2"/> your C-D-four count <pause dur="0.5"/> actually has a daily rhythm <pause dur="0.9"/> it goes up and down each day <pause dur="0.7"/> so of course if you were <trunc>mea</trunc> # <trunc>d</trunc> the count you were getting would depend on when in the day you measured it so there was quite a lot of confusion in the literature <pause dur="0.5"/> 'cause people were quoting different figures because they were measuring the counts at different times of the day <pause dur="1.0"/> okay <pause dur="1.1"/> once that was figured out once the diurnal rhythm <pause dur="0.5"/> of C-D-four counts were was figured out of course they started measuring at the same time each day <pause dur="0.3"/> so they could get comparative data <pause dur="4.4"/> so what about <pause dur="1.1"/> so that's stages <pause dur="0.2"/> one two and three and as i've said to you <pause dur="0.6"/> three <pause dur="0.5"/> has largely fallen into disrepute <pause dur="2.6"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="2"/> that takes us on to stage four <pause dur="2.1"/> stage four <pause dur="1.4"/> is <pause dur="0.4"/> what is now 
commonly referred to <pause dur="1.2"/> as full-blown AIDS <pause dur="6.5"/> how do you define the entry into stage four <pause dur="0.8"/> well three main criteria <pause dur="3.1"/> have been used <pause dur="1.3"/> the first is <pause dur="1.1"/> fever for <pause dur="0.3"/> persisting for more than a month <pause dur="6.8"/> involuntary weight loss <pause dur="0.2"/> at greater than ten per cent of baseline <pause dur="2.3"/> so this is not somebody going on a diet and managing to lose one stone in ten <pause dur="0.7"/> because they're on a diet this is somebody losing <pause dur="0.2"/> one stone in ten without trying <pause dur="2.2"/> okay <pause dur="1.5"/> and diarrhoea for more than a month <pause dur="4.1"/> and you've got to have <pause dur="1.6"/> all of these symptoms <pause dur="1.6"/> without any other <pause dur="0.4"/> concurrent reason other than the fact that you're infected with H-I-V <pause dur="3.8"/> so it's not just that you've <pause dur="0.3"/> kept on going to the same Indian restaurant and eaten you know a pretty <pause dur="0.3"/> nasty meal that's been giving you a <pause dur="0.2"/> you know <pause dur="0.8"/> bad diarrhoea for a month and you've not learned you know you'd better change your restaurant i mean it's it's <pause dur="0.4"/> you haven't got any other reason why this is happening to you other than that you're infected with H-I-V <pause dur="4.0"/> okay let's ask 
something about then the viral dynamics that are going on during these different phases <pause dur="4.3"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> if we look at the virus what's going on in in # <pause dur="0.3"/> the primary infection phase <pause dur="3.4"/> is the virus is growing flat out <pause dur="0.2"/> there's no immune response there of <trunc>a</trunc> of any <trunc>s</trunc> consequence <pause dur="0.5"/> the virus is just growing in a completely unrestricted fashion <pause dur="0.5"/> it has a doubling time of about ten hours <pause dur="1.4"/> peak viraemia will occur at about three weeks <pause dur="1.4"/> and each infected cell is going to <pause dur="0.9"/> seed roughly twenty <pause dur="1.8"/> new cells <pause dur="0.8"/> to become infected <pause dur="2.3"/> but the last sentence is quite important <pause dur="0.4"/> the virus load starts to drop rapidly <pause dur="0.5"/> as the immune response is activated <pause dur="0.8"/> so you should not <pause dur="0.4"/> be under the impression that <pause dur="0.5"/> the immune response that we amount to H-I-V is completely useless <pause dur="0.2"/> it's not <pause dur="1.2"/> it does a pretty good job <pause dur="0.5"/> at controlling the initial acute infection <pause dur="1.6"/> it reduces the viral load between a hundred and a thousandfold <pause dur="1.2"/> okay <pause dur="0.8"/> the only problem is it doesn't completely eliminate the virus <pause dur="2.1"/> during the 
asymptomatic phase <pause dur="3.3"/> you have something like ten-to-the-ten virus particles being made every day <pause dur="3.2"/> and you have something like ten-to-the-nine <pause dur="0.4"/> C-D-four-positive lymphocytes <pause dur="0.5"/> being made and eliminated every day <pause dur="1.5"/> so you can see that virus replication <pause dur="1.2"/> and elimination because remember if a C-D-four is cell is eliminated you're going to eliminate the virus that's replicating in that cell <pause dur="1.3"/> you have a rough balance here <pause dur="0.9"/> and this is sometimes referred to as the steady state <pause dur="4.3"/> what that means is that <pause dur="2.0"/> the whole infection <pause dur="0.7"/> is actually being sustained by only about ten-to-the-six to ten-to-the-seven <trunc>ce</trunc> T-cells in the body <pause dur="2.3"/> these are productively infected activated T-cells <pause dur="4.2"/> the <trunc>si</trunc> the size of the latent H-I-V reservoir <pause dur="2.1"/> okay <pause dur="1.1"/> is mostly in resting T-cells <pause dur="0.8"/> and it's about similar in size <pause dur="8.8"/> it's important to point out to you <pause dur="0.2"/> just to remind you <pause dur="0.9"/> that when somebody goes into stage four <pause dur="1.4"/> the immune system loses control of the virus replication again <pause dur="0.8"/> and virus replication takes off <pause dur="2.8"/> and so 
in <pause dur="0.4"/> stage four <pause dur="0.5"/> there's again a <trunc>s</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> the <trunc>previo</trunc> one of the previous slides showed you <pause dur="0.4"/> a viraemia a strong viraemia <pause dur="1.8"/> okay <pause dur="1.4"/> a lot of virus in the bloodstream <pause dur="1.4"/> a high chance <pause dur="1.0"/> of <pause dur="0.2"/> potential virus spread <pause dur="0.9"/> if <pause dur="1.6"/> the individual was indulging in activities that would be likely to spread the virus <pause dur="2.0"/> but remember there's a big contrast <pause dur="0.7"/> between somebody who's in the acute phase <pause dur="0.5"/> and somebody who's in the symptomatic end phase <pause dur="1.2"/> this is essentially a sexually transmitted disease <pause dur="0.7"/> if you don't know you're infected <pause dur="0.5"/> as will be the case in the acute phase <pause dur="0.6"/> you will be undertaking your normal sexual activity be it <pause dur="0.3"/> you know once a day once a week once a month once a year <pause dur="0.6"/> okay <pause dur="1.0"/> if you're in late stage AIDS <pause dur="1.1"/> you're not interested in sex i mean sex is the last thing you've got on your mind you 
know <pause dur="0.4"/> you've got on your mind coping with the symptomology <pause dur="0.4"/> that you're suffering from <pause dur="0.5"/> rapid weight loss <pause dur="0.6"/> you've got diarrhoea you've got fever <pause dur="0.4"/> as i explained to you on the first lecture you might have an <trunc>opportusisti</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> opportunistic infection like athlete's foot up to the knee <pause dur="0.4"/> it's <trunc>sym</trunc> in symptom terms <pause dur="0.3"/> it's a very unpleasant # end stage infection <pause dur="0.9"/> and so actually people in full-blown AIDS <pause dur="0.3"/> are not a major risk <pause dur="0.7"/> to society <pause dur="1.3"/> they might be a risk to the people who are actually treating them <pause dur="0.6"/> and the people who are treating them have to be careful <pause dur="0.4"/> that they don't come into contact with blood <pause dur="0.9"/> remember these people may be bleeding from a number of orifices <pause dur="1.0"/> but they they don't pose a large risk to society <pause dur="1.5"/> okay my time's up i'll stop there and continue next <pause dur="0.8"/> Tuesday </u><pause dur="0.2"/> <u who="sf0620" trans="pause"> mm-hmm </u><pause dur="0.2"/> <u who="nm0607" trans="pause"> <trunc>tuesd</trunc> Tuesday i think it is <pause dur="2.5"/> okay
