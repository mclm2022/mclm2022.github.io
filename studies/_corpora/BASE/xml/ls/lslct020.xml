what i found particularly interesting about evaluation was the the the aspects really of data collection <pause dur="1.0"/> # and with data collection and <trunc>e</trunc> evaluation <pause dur="0.8"/> there were two things that i always wanted to know about this is <pause dur="0.4"/> why we were <pause dur="0.2"/> were we collecting this information <pause dur="0.4"/> and who were we collecting this sort of information for <pause dur="0.5"/> and generally what i found was that it probably isn't actually for you <pause dur="0.5"/> that often evaluations are done because somebody has decided that something is important <pause dur="0.5"/> but it might not necessarily be what's actually important to you the the person that's experiencing <pause dur="0.6"/> the learning <pause dur="1.3"/> so i wanted to create something that was a student centred view <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> of an educational experience <pause dur="2.1"/> now <pause dur="0.8"/> evaluation is a is a difficult thing and <trunc>i</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> in different circles it's thought of in in sort of very high terms or very low terms <pause dur="0.4"/> some people <pause dur="0.2"/> and if i but to me this is 
the at the top of the list is that people believe it's a purely administrative task <pause dur="0.3"/> it's done because it has to be done because somebody above you says <pause dur="0.4"/> evaluate this <pause dur="0.3"/> you tick the boxes you hand it in and the job is done <pause dur="1.4"/> there can be resistance within a faculty setting towards evaluation again believing that it's that you know it's a waste of time <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> often there's little opinion in what the students actually think about what's going on yes they tick the boxes they fill in the things <pause dur="0.4"/> but then these things just get cast to one side <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> if you're asking for self-reported data # i think i'm a wonderful lecturer <pause dur="0.3"/> isn't going to be particularly useful when it comes to evaluation <pause dur="0.6"/> and overall just apathy and disinterest in the whole process <pause dur="1.3"/> so i wanted to create something that was <trunc>t</trunc> <trunc>th</trunc> <trunc>w</trunc> that was as as student centred as i could possibly make it <pause dur="0.5"/> so i began by taking a focus group of <kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> # final year medical students and took them through a semistructured <pause dur="0.5"/> # focus group 
asking them broadly about what they were doing <pause dur="0.4"/> # within the the community based medicine course at Birmingham University <pause dur="2.2"/> then <pause dur="0.2"/> what i did is i used the information from this focus group <pause dur="0.7"/> to devise statements for the use with the nominal group technique <pause dur="0.5"/> now by a statement i mean it's sort of like a stimulus statement <pause dur="0.4"/> so just # <trunc>a</trunc> an example from outside of medicine is <pause dur="0.3"/> what do you think it's important to do before you go to work in the morning <pause dur="0.4"/> i mean it's a silly example but it just gives you an idea of what a stimulus statement is so that poses a question <pause dur="0.4"/> to which people may then generate lots of ideas <pause dur="1.7"/> <kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> so what is the nominal group technique well the nominal group technique <pause dur="0.4"/> is a a a structured way of generating ideas <pause dur="0.3"/> and it consists of several different phases <pause dur="1.3"/> the first part is a silent phase so you <trunc>pr</trunc> you <trunc>y</trunc> you you <pause dur="0.2"/> provide <trunc>th</trunc> the the participants with a 
statement <pause dur="0.4"/> and <pause dur="0.4"/> so for instance the one about what you do before you go to work <pause dur="0.3"/> then they work individually <pause dur="1.0"/> # in response to this so they work on paper <pause dur="0.4"/> and they write down a list of everything they can think of in response to that statement and it has to be individual no discussion occurs <pause dur="1.3"/> the second part is the round robin phase so <pause dur="0.7"/> each person <pause dur="0.2"/> in turn reads out the first thing on their list it gets transmitted # <trunc>trans</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> transmitted transcribed <pause dur="0.3"/> to a chart on the wall <pause dur="0.6"/> where <pause dur="0.5"/> that goes on in in a cycle process each person saying the next thing on their list until you have a grand list of absolutely everything that people have written down <pause dur="0.4"/> again <pause dur="0.2"/> there's no time for # <pause dur="0.5"/> for <trunc>s</trunc> speaking <pause dur="0.3"/> other than saying what's on your list you can't debate whether or not that's a stupid thing a good thing or a bad thing <pause dur="0.3"/> everything goes on the list <pause dur="1.9"/> this is the only time at which <trunc>speak</trunc> speaking is allowed and this is the clarification phase so you can get to understand what 
other people mean by their statements <pause dur="0.6"/> it is also the only time at which anything can be deleted from the list <pause dur="0.4"/> so for instance <pause dur="0.2"/> <trunc>a</trunc> you know <trunc>i</trunc> identical duplications which do happen a lot during this technique <pause dur="0.4"/> but people can't say i don't agree with that being on the list take it off <trunc>b</trunc> if it goes on the list <pause dur="0.2"/> it stays on the list <pause dur="1.1"/> and then something that's quite crucial for the nominal group technique <pause dur="0.2"/> is the voting phase <pause dur="0.9"/> so for instance in response to a statement they may be presented with <pause dur="0.3"/> thirty statements <pause dur="0.2"/> you then say to them <pause dur="0.4"/> what are the seven most important things to you <pause dur="0.4"/> so you as the individual learner in this experience <pause dur="0.2"/> what is important to you <pause dur="0.6"/> the most important thing then getting seven votes the next thing six votes five votes four <trunc>fo</trunc> four votes and so on <pause dur="0.8"/> and then you collect in all the votes for all the statements <pause dur="0.5"/> and then you feed that information back <pause dur="0.3"/> to the participants <pause dur="0.3"/> so it's a way of generating a large amount of information <pause dur="0.3"/> but 
then asking people to whittle it down to what really is important <pause dur="0.3"/> and then using the votes to calculate what the most important thing is <pause dur="0.3"/> to the group as a whole <pause dur="2.2"/> <kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> now the nominal group technique has many advantages <pause dur="0.7"/> it's a structured way <pause dur="0.3"/> so it's not like filling in evaluation forms and then reading thousands of comments that have been written and trying to tabulate them in some way <pause dur="0.2"/> it's a structured way of doing this <pause dur="1.0"/> it's non-confrontational if you write it down you say it people can't shout you down for saying things that you don't necessarily agree with <pause dur="0.8"/> it disperses dominance you can't have one voice going on and on about one particular thing <pause dur="0.3"/> if you've said it once you can't say it again it's on the list it comes down to the voting <pause dur="0.3"/> as to whether or not that's important to everyone <pause dur="1.8"/> it's also very easy <pause dur="0.2"/> to produce data as we'll 
come on to see how much data this sort of thing produces <pause dur="0.8"/> so what statements did i use <pause dur="0.9"/> well through the nominal <trunc>gr</trunc> through the the focus group we discovered various bits that were quite interesting for the students and things that provoked the most debates so we generated three statements and they're quite similar to some other pieces of research that have been done <kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> like this <pause dur="0.8"/> so we asked them first of all what would you change <pause dur="0.3"/> about the community based medicine course in the final year <pause dur="1.2"/> then we asked them what did you enjoy <pause dur="0.6"/> about the community based medicine course in the final year <pause dur="0.7"/> and finally <pause dur="0.2"/> what does final year community based medicine teaching give you <pause dur="0.5"/> that teaching in other settings does not <pause dur="3.1"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> so <pause dur="0.2"/> <vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.3"/> at the nominal group we recruited eighteen students to attend 
and they were split on the day into two groups purely for logistical reasons and and handling large groups <pause dur="0.8"/> then they were combined <pause dur="0.3"/> towards the end of the process so that they all had their master lists to look at <pause dur="0.4"/> so in response to the three different statements <pause dur="0.2"/> they generated a hundred-and-twenty-four separate ideas <pause dur="0.8"/> and from that <pause dur="0.2"/> they voted the top seven in response to each statement so we had twenty-one statements <pause dur="0.3"/> that according to this group <pause dur="0.4"/> were the most important things overall <pause dur="0.5"/> about community based medicine at Birmingham <pause dur="0.9"/> so you may ask well what does eighteen students mean in comparison to the whole of the year it was about approximately two-hundred students <pause dur="0.6"/> so what we did is we then converted that into a questionnaire <pause dur="0.5"/> so the twenty-one statements we then asked the whole year do you agree or disagree <pause dur="0.3"/> with this <pause dur="0.2"/> as a as an important statement <pause dur="1.0"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> a hundred-and-eighty students # responded which is a response rate of about eighty per cent which we felt was quite 
acceptable <pause dur="0.8"/> and overall out of the twenty-one statements that were made twenty of them obtained majority support <pause dur="1.2"/> # what you say is majority support is you know <trunc>s</trunc> is very much up to you <pause dur="0.5"/> the the cut-off for twenty <unclear>year</unclear> to twenty-one is at fifty per cent so over fifty per cent of the year agreed <pause dur="0.4"/> but as we'll come on to see that most people did have a very high level of agreement <pause dur="1.8"/> <kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> so here we have <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="1.0"/> the layout of it so the three colours represent the three different statements <pause dur="0.4"/> with <pause dur="0.2"/> each statement number <pause dur="0.4"/> so these are the seven things <pause dur="0.2"/> in response to each stimulus statement these are the seven items along the bottom <pause dur="0.7"/> and you can see that on the whole if you draw a rough line across eighty per cent you still get most of the people <pause dur="0.5"/> agreeing over eighty per cent and then down here you've got these two <pause dur="0.5"/> statements which really didn't overall get very good # agreement within the whole year <pause dur="2.5"/> so the poorer scoring items what were they <pause dur="0.3"/> <kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> well the first one was about general 
knowledge on the ophthalmology and dermatology exam and i think this was a specific thing to this group that they were upset about the content of the exam when they had it <pause dur="0.5"/> but it seemed when it was presented to the whole year <pause dur="0.2"/> that overall that just wasn't agreed with <pause dur="1.5"/> there was a # # just a <trunc>s</trunc> a slight shift towards agreement with this statement just saying that you know we wanted more formal tutorials in general practice they wanted more set taught # tutorials on audit <pause dur="0.3"/> on screening on cardiovascular disease <pause dur="0.4"/> but again <trunc>y</trunc> <trunc>n</trunc> there was a high level of disagreement with that statement <pause dur="0.8"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> so i'll i'll just move on now to the the supported items and i won't bore you in great detail of absolutely every <trunc>th</trunc> single thing i just picked out the ones that i thought were the most exciting <pause dur="1.5"/> <kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> so <pause dur="0.2"/> what would you change about community based medicine course well they wanted more 
dermatology teaching there was no doubt about that and i think this harks back to even the days when i was a medical student the dermatology <pause dur="0.5"/> among students is poorly thought of and on the whole can be quite badly taught <pause dur="1.3"/> there were small numbers who felt that it was being done well and i think that represented small pockets of dermatology teaching within the practices that were being done very well <pause dur="0.3"/> but on the whole <pause dur="0.2"/> it wasn't being done very well at all <pause dur="2.3"/> <kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> the course at Birmingham is split into an inner city practice and an <trunc>ou</trunc> sort of an outer city practice <pause dur="0.5"/> and the students were flitting between the two centres and they actually felt that it was very bitty and # disorganized <pause dur="0.3"/> and they'd much rather have <pause dur="0.3"/> core central blocks <pause dur="0.4"/> at one place rather than being spread out and moving all the time <pause dur="2.8"/> <kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> and finally on this one they wanted feedback on their examination stations 
they have a voices exam where they they rotate round different stations <pause dur="0.3"/> and unless they do particularly badly or there is something of particular concern the students don't get <pause dur="0.3"/> feedback about that station they were very keen to have that <pause dur="0.3"/> 'cause they do get that in some of the specialties <pause dur="1.4"/> <kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> what did you enjoy about final year community based medicine <pause dur="0.2"/> well they enjoyed the one to one tuition <pause dur="0.3"/> which i thought was very very reassuring <pause dur="0.6"/> they found the communication skills role plays very useful <pause dur="0.3"/> # <trunc>th</trunc> they found the the words they used were both useful and informative so that that was good feedback for us <pause dur="0.9"/> and also that the voices exam was relaxed and fair <pause dur="0.2"/> which again for students to volunteer that <unclear>something</unclear> about an exam i think is a very positive step <pause dur="1.7"/> then the final part <pause dur="0.9"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> <kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> is what i call the Heineken question <pause dur="0.6"/> <vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" n="ss" dur="1"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> this was <pause dur="0.3"/> what does final year community based 
medicine give you <pause dur="0.2"/> <vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" n="ss" dur="1"/> that other settings do not so what's community based medicine reaching out to <pause dur="0.3"/> that other teaching settings <pause dur="0.2"/> simply aren't getting to <pause dur="0.4"/> so we'll just focus on this one a little bit more 'cause i think this is the most exciting of them <pause dur="1.2"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> first of all # they felt that this was the <trunc>f</trunc> you know their real opportunity to have clinical autonomy and responsibility more than in other settings <pause dur="0.8"/> holding your own consultations they they they seemed to feel that in hospital settings <pause dur="0.3"/> you don't get to hold your own consultations you go in you you take the whole medical history you present it you don't have anything to do with it <pause dur="0.4"/> within the primary care community based setting that was very different <pause dur="0.9"/> it was less focused on the rare they were fed up of seeing ridiculous <pause dur="0.4"/> # outside # things in hospital whereas they're actually seeing normal things happening in community based <pause dur="0.3"/> setting <pause dur="0.8"/> and also they 
were being treated as a colleague rather than as a student so they were saying that they could develop this more professional relationship with those around them <pause dur="1.9"/> <kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> they were able to to see and experience # continuity of care something they weren't getting in the secondary care setting <pause dur="0.6"/> they were improving their confidence in their patient skills <pause dur="0.5"/> and i think just an important thing for some of us here <pause dur="0.2"/> is that they were had more enthusiastic teachers and support from their mentors <pause dur="0.3"/> which again i think it's a great thing to hear coming out of out of this setting <pause dur="1.8"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> so overall as a technique <trunc>w</trunc> you know <trunc>wha</trunc> what do i think about this technique well i think it's i think it's a a <trunc>w</trunc> a wonderful technique <pause dur="0.5"/> # it's cheap i mean the the whole thing other than supplying <trunc>s</trunc> # food for the students 'cause it does take <pause dur="0.2"/> a few hours <pause dur="0.3"/> was was you know the the manpower of me <pause dur="0.5"/> # it was easy to run it was just simply setting the questions the students 
went <trunc>a</trunc> went away made their own data <pause dur="0.3"/> minimum input from me <pause dur="0.6"/> and it so it was reasonably quick the students in their feedback to me did suggest that it did take quite a while which was three hours <pause dur="0.6"/> i mean i suppose in student terms three hours is a very long time <pause dur="1.0"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> it's a student centred way they generated this data my only input was to create the three things <pause dur="0.2"/> that they could then <pause dur="0.3"/> spill out and talk about whatever they wanted to about <pause dur="0.7"/> and also they created a large amount of data and that's to say that <pause dur="0.4"/> i know the twenty-one statements are the most important they had the highest votes <pause dur="0.4"/> but they were <pause dur="0.3"/> the # you know a hundred or so other items <pause dur="0.2"/> that were still interesting that were coming out of this <pause dur="1.0"/> and as the study has has suggested <pause dur="0.5"/> the <trunc>s</trunc> the opinions of the students there and then were representative of the year as a whole <pause dur="0.4"/> 
and that's just to say that's Birmingham and that was that final year <pause dur="0.3"/> i don't know if it would ever <pause dur="0.2"/> # sort of leak out in to be applicable to other settings <pause dur="1.5"/> <kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> as far as community based medicine is concerned at Birmingham it's thought of highly by the students who have participated in the course <pause dur="0.7"/> it allows personal and professional growth <pause dur="0.4"/> and something that i that i felt was you know very nice was that it does bridge this gap it seems <pause dur="0.3"/> from being a student to becoming a doctor <pause dur="0.4"/> # and it seems that # you're allowed and able to do that in the primary care setting more so than other places <pause dur="1.3"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> so the future of this i think <trunc>i</trunc> it can go anywhere and everywhere for those people who wish to use it <pause dur="0.4"/> # we've already used it evaluating our firm one scheme in in the year four <pause dur="0.3"/> and we're using it soon to look at the communication needs for overseas doctors <pause dur="0.9"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> as to where it's
