briefly <pause dur="0.3"/> mentioning phase one of the course <pause dur="0.3"/> and how they fit together <pause dur="0.2"/> would that be useful for people </u><pause dur="0.3"/> <u who="nf0446" trans="pause"> yes </u><pause dur="0.2"/> <u who="nm0445" trans="pause"> yeah <pause dur="1.6"/> as hopefully you're aware <pause dur="0.6"/> this is a <pause dur="0.2"/> four year <pause dur="0.3"/> accelerated <pause dur="0.4"/> graduate entry <pause dur="0.6"/> medical school <pause dur="1.1"/> and <pause dur="0.3"/> we are <pause dur="0.6"/> the only <pause dur="0.4"/> pure graduate entry medical school <pause dur="0.4"/> at the moment <pause dur="0.7"/> # although there are a number of graduate entry streams <pause dur="0.5"/> that operate either <pause dur="0.6"/> fairly well integrated to school leaver streams <pause dur="0.2"/> or relatively as separate entities just within the same school <pause dur="0.3"/> in other places <pause dur="0.9"/> and <pause dur="0.4"/> compared <pause dur="0.5"/> to <pause dur="0.8"/> other graduate entry streams and they're slowly coming online round the country <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> we are <pause dur="0.3"/> probably <pause dur="0.2"/> the narrowest in terms of the sorts of graduates <pause dur="0.3"/> we take in that we accept <pause dur="0.4"/> biomedical <pause dur="0.3"/> science <pause dur="0.2"/> graduates <pause dur="1.1"/> there is a separate stream that's just started off <pause dur="0.3"/> at <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> this summer <pause dur="0.3"/> which is obviously following a fairly similar course and certainly with the same assessments <pause dur="0.2"/> which 
is taking <pause dur="0.3"/> healthcare <pause dur="0.2"/> science <pause dur="0.2"/> graduates <pause dur="0.7"/> but we here are only currently taking biomedical science graduates <pause dur="1.2"/> we can discuss over coffee afterwards if that's a good thing or a bad thing or or whatever but <pause dur="0.2"/> that's <pause dur="0.3"/> who we currently get in <pause dur="1.6"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> so for instance you could get into ours <pause dur="0.2"/> with <pause dur="0.2"/> biochemistry <pause dur="0.5"/> genetics physiology those kind of things as first degrees <pause dur="0.2"/> but we wouldn't let you in <pause dur="0.5"/> with a physiotherapy degree <pause dur="0.4"/> or with a pure <pause dur="0.4"/> chemistry degree <pause dur="0.4"/> or a pure physics degree <pause dur="1.1"/> so we're taking a relatively narrow tranche of students <pause dur="1.4"/> we're giving them a four year course <pause dur="0.8"/> as opposed to the five year <pause dur="0.2"/> course # that <pause dur="0.3"/> runs for the school <pause dur="0.4"/> leavers at Easter <pause dur="0.7"/> and <pause dur="0.3"/> all <pause dur="0.2"/> the time we've chopped off the course <pause dur="0.2"/> is chopped off the early <pause dur="0.4"/> part of the course <pause dur="1.3"/> the school <pause dur="0.2"/> leavers who go to <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> do five years <pause dur="0.3"/> they do <pause dur="0.2"/> two-and-a-half years of phase one <pause dur="0.5"/> two-and-a-half years of phase two <pause dur="1.3"/> broadly speaking <pause dur="0.6"/> phase one is university based <pause dur="0.3"/> and broadly preclinical <pause dur="1.0"/> and phase two <pause dur="0.3"/> is pretty 
much hospital based <pause dur="0.4"/> and broadly clinical <pause dur="0.7"/> having said that <pause dur="0.3"/> as i'm sure you're aware <pause dur="0.3"/> everybody integrated their courses years ago so we're not actually allowed to use those labels <pause dur="0.4"/> but in terms of understanding <pause dur="0.2"/> where the students are and what they're doing <pause dur="0.2"/> that's broadly the case although clearly there was clinical exposure <pause dur="0.2"/> from the beginning within phase one <pause dur="1.6"/> phase one <pause dur="0.4"/> is modular <pause dur="0.5"/> mainly systems based modules but also a number of <pause dur="0.3"/> # social science based modules and <pause dur="0.3"/> health policy and other such such modules <pause dur="0.5"/> and <pause dur="1.0"/> the <pause dur="0.3"/> students that come here <pause dur="0.3"/> broadly <pause dur="0.4"/> miss <pause dur="0.2"/> the basic <pause dur="0.2"/> science modules <pause dur="0.4"/> because the presumption is that we've collected a stream of people <pause dur="0.2"/> who have <pause dur="1.0"/> either that to a great depth or the ability <pause dur="0.3"/> to <pause dur="0.4"/> get up to that level relatively rapidly <pause dur="1.3"/> as an interesting aside <pause dur="0.5"/> irrespective <pause dur="0.4"/> of your first degree <pause dur="0.7"/> you do the same course <pause dur="0.7"/> so we don't run all modules and we chop and change depending on where people's strengths and weaknesses are <pause dur="0.2"/> they all do the same stuff <pause dur="0.6"/> 
they all miss out <pause dur="0.2"/> the same modules from phase one <pause dur="2.6"/> as a sort of reaction to that or perhaps a way of of dealing with that a lot of phase one <pause dur="0.4"/> is based around <pause dur="0.4"/> group learning <pause dur="0.9"/> and <pause dur="0.6"/> the groups are deliberately structured <pause dur="0.5"/> to have a range of <pause dur="1.1"/> students with a range of first degrees <pause dur="0.3"/> so hopefully as they go through phase one <pause dur="0.7"/> if they operate nicely within their groups the strengths of those individuals <pause dur="0.2"/> will help the group <pause dur="0.4"/> and the balance between the groups <pause dur="0.6"/> should <pause dur="0.2"/> help hopefully ensure that <pause dur="1.1"/> # <pause dur="1.0"/> perhaps that works well perhaps in some groups that doesn't there's a lot of dynamic <pause dur="0.3"/> industry going on there <pause dur="2.1"/> after they've done <pause dur="0.2"/> that <pause dur="0.2"/> eighteen months of phase one <pause dur="0.2"/> shortened from two-and-a-half years <pause dur="0.3"/> they come into phase two <pause dur="0.4"/> which is in effect the full-time <pause dur="0.2"/> clinical placements <pause dur="1.8"/> that's pretty much all i planned to say about phase one <pause dur="0.4"/> because that's not the main topic of what i'm talking about here <pause dur="0.8"/> but can i just pause for a second just in case there is anything that <pause dur="0.2"/> people want 
clarification <pause dur="0.3"/> bearing in mind i'm not the phase one coordinator and it's not my prime role but if there is anything <pause dur="0.4"/> that <pause dur="0.9"/> that people will <trunc>al</trunc> be always be desperate to know or that doesn't make sense of what i've just said <pause dur="3.6"/> okay <pause dur="0.2"/> thank you very much so i'll <pause dur="0.2"/> i'll <pause dur="1.3"/> carry on with with perhaps the sort of main meat of what i was going to say <pause dur="1.5"/> what i'm hoping to do <pause dur="0.6"/> is <pause dur="0.4"/> tell you why <pause dur="0.2"/> the clinical course <pause dur="0.3"/> at <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> Medical School is arranged in the way it is <pause dur="0.4"/> because as will become <pause dur="0.7"/> fairly clear <pause dur="0.3"/> fairly quickly <pause dur="0.7"/> unless <pause dur="0.2"/> you're a recent <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> graduate <pause dur="0.2"/> it will be <pause dur="0.9"/> fundamentally different <pause dur="0.8"/> from <pause dur="0.2"/> the majority <pause dur="0.2"/> of medical courses running <pause dur="0.2"/> in the U-K at present <pause dur="0.6"/> it is an unusual model <pause dur="1.3"/> some would say it's quite a brave and dynamic model some would say that causes some problems but we'll go through that in a bit more detail <pause dur="0.4"/> but it is different <pause dur="0.8"/> and i think that's important <pause dur="2.3"/> having <pause dur="0.4"/> started on that i'll then hopefully give you enough information so at least you know the structure <pause dur="0.2"/> and how it's 
put together <pause dur="0.6"/> and then <trunc>o</trunc> <pause dur="0.3"/> we'll lead on to a period of discussion <pause dur="0.3"/> which hopefully will bring out some of the issues <pause dur="0.2"/> that <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> was mentioning at the beginning <pause dur="0.3"/> about learning styles <pause dur="0.3"/> and about self-directed learning <pause dur="0.4"/> and <pause dur="0.3"/> the sorts of students <pause dur="0.4"/> who find our course a good way <pause dur="0.6"/> of doing things and the sorts of students that struggle <pause dur="0.7"/> and hopefully that'll come <trunc>u</trunc> <pause dur="0.4"/> up in discussion a bit <pause dur="3.0"/> i'll also <pause dur="0.7"/> try and underline some of the challenges <pause dur="0.2"/> that this particular way of doing things gives us <pause dur="0.2"/> which may or may not be a little bit different <pause dur="0.2"/> from <pause dur="0.8"/> other medical courses <pause dur="3.7"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> going right back to the beginning <pause dur="1.8"/> there is a stated philosophy <pause dur="0.2"/> for our curriculum <pause dur="0.6"/> which broadly is the sort of thing that's come out of the G-M-C anyway and broadly <pause dur="0.2"/> is the sort of the thing <pause dur="0.2"/> that the majority of medical schools will <trunc>sta</trunc> state that they're trying to do <pause dur="0.4"/> but i think as will become clear <pause dur="0.4"/> # perhaps <pause dur="0.2"/> the curriculum we are running here has really bitten the bullet and actually tried to 
develop <pause dur="0.5"/> on the basis of these principles <pause dur="1.3"/> being <pause dur="0.2"/> that doctors must be lifelong learners the sort of thing that gets thrown out on many many occasions <pause dur="0.7"/> but perhaps <pause dur="0.2"/> it does mean something perhaps there's something we can do about that in the course <pause dur="1.2"/> and <pause dur="0.8"/> it's stated that our curriculum is designed <pause dur="0.2"/> to help students take charge of their own learning <pause dur="3.0"/> and <pause dur="0.6"/> that phase one <pause dur="0.3"/> which is broadly <pause dur="0.2"/> group work <pause dur="0.3"/> with a variety of levels of support <pause dur="0.6"/> is <pause dur="0.2"/> a preparation <pause dur="0.5"/> for the self-directed learning that they will have to do <pause dur="0.4"/> if they're going to <trunc>s</trunc> be successful in phase two of the course <pause dur="0.6"/> in the clinical environments <pause dur="4.5"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> the majority <pause dur="0.4"/> of us who are medically qualified in this room will have gone <pause dur="0.7"/> to a variety of medical schools if you graduated <pause dur="0.3"/> from the U-K in the last ten to fifteen years you will have done <pause dur="0.4"/> an integrated course of some sort <pause dur="0.2"/> probably <pause dur="0.3"/> although there were examples of of people holding on to even older models <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="1.3"/> but <pause dur="0.5"/> you will probably <pause dur="0.3"/> have had a course 
which attempted <pause dur="0.3"/> to teach you <pause dur="0.5"/> a lot of different things <pause dur="0.9"/> that was <pause dur="0.5"/> loaded with content <pause dur="0.2"/> to <pause dur="0.2"/> # up to a point <pause dur="1.7"/> and <pause dur="1.0"/> tried <pause dur="0.2"/> to gain experience for the students over a number of specialties <pause dur="0.9"/> certainly <pause dur="0.5"/> i remember as a student having my fortnight in E-N-T <pause dur="0.7"/> and i remember learning not very much there <pause dur="0.9"/> certainly as a year we were shuffled through <pause dur="0.7"/> in phases of our clinical course <pause dur="0.2"/> a lot of brief <pause dur="0.2"/> clinical experiences <pause dur="0.4"/> in relatively large groups <pause dur="0.7"/> where <pause dur="0.3"/> the teachers didn't particularly know us <pause dur="0.3"/> because we were coming on so quickly <pause dur="0.7"/> and <pause dur="0.5"/> it very much felt we were being given a sort of cycle of teaching <pause dur="0.4"/> on a rapid basis and in a fortnight <pause dur="0.4"/> it's actually relatively easy to just miss the point and not get anything out of it <pause dur="1.1"/> and <pause dur="1.2"/> with the increasing subspecialization of hospital medicine <pause dur="0.5"/> this was a trend that was continuing and continuing <pause dur="0.6"/> it was no longer good enough to spend send students to general medicine <pause dur="0.4"/> you had to spend send them <pause dur="0.2"/> to <pause dur="0.2"/> chest medicine <pause dur="0.2"/> and cardiology <pause dur="0.7"/> and 
gastroenterology <pause dur="0.8"/> and <pause dur="0.4"/> as divisions <pause dur="0.2"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> more and more subdivisions <pause dur="0.2"/> appeared <pause dur="0.3"/> the tendency was to cut courses into smaller more smaller segments <pause dur="0.2"/> trying to gain <pause dur="0.2"/> the breadth of experience for the students <pause dur="0.2"/> by rushing them round all the specialties <pause dur="3.1"/> one of the upshots of this was that something that's always said about U-K medical education is it runs on an apprenticeship model <pause dur="0.9"/> and that almost certainly broadly is not true <pause dur="1.3"/> # and certainly the model of rushing everybody round in groups of six or eight <pause dur="0.5"/> briefly through a <trunc>n</trunc> <trunc>l</trunc> a large number of short clinical experiences <pause dur="0.4"/> gave little chance <pause dur="0.2"/> for the students to get to know the teachers the teachers to get to know the students <pause dur="0.3"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> the students to model themselves on the teachers in any <pause dur="0.2"/> meaningful way <pause dur="0.4"/> which would be the elements if apprenticeship was going to actually work as a concept <pause dur="3.4"/> there was also <pause dur="0.4"/> little opportunity <pause dur="0.2"/> for self-directed learning <pause dur="1.0"/> on your timetable you were shuffled off to E-N-T <pause dur="0.4"/> got to 
learn a bit of E-N-T <pause dur="0.8"/> a few seminars packing some information in <pause dur="0.5"/> not a lot of opportunity <pause dur="0.2"/> for students to work out where they are <pause dur="0.2"/> what they're doing <pause dur="0.2"/> where their strengths are where their weaknesses are where they need to be working <pause dur="4.0"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> on the basis of this <pause dur="0.5"/> the <pause dur="0.2"/> new <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> curriculum which has subsequently <pause dur="0.2"/> become <pause dur="0.3"/> the <gap reason="name" extent="2 words"/> curriculum which is the curriculum we follow <pause dur="3.4"/> was made up of <pause dur="0.8"/> what perhaps are a series of relatively <pause dur="0.7"/> old ideas <pause dur="0.7"/> rather unusually <pause dur="0.2"/> for a medical course <pause dur="0.2"/> it was made very very explicit <pause dur="0.5"/> exactly what the learning outcomes for the whole clinical course were <pause dur="0.8"/> so there was a book <pause dur="0.7"/> it's there i should have brought a copy with me to wave at you actually but if you haven't otherwise seen it it's The Objectives of Phase Two Curriculum <pause dur="0.5"/> and <pause dur="0.4"/> if you want a copy if you can get in touch with us we can send you it <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> and it shows <pause dur="0.2"/> everything <pause dur="0.3"/> in a list <pause dur="0.2"/> that we expect of the students <pause dur="0.6"/> and <pause dur="0.3"/> it's based on the competencies required of a new P-R-H-O which is what 
the G-M-C tell us we should be doing <pause dur="0.6"/> but <pause dur="0.4"/> we are <pause dur="0.3"/> completely explicit <pause dur="0.3"/> on paper <pause dur="0.2"/> there it is <pause dur="0.2"/> this is what they've got to learn they've got two-and-a-half years to learn it <pause dur="0.5"/> and it's listed <pause dur="0.3"/> and the assessments are based on that document and therefore <pause dur="0.3"/> if they know what's in there they should pass <pause dur="0.2"/> in theory <pause dur="4.0"/> there was also a move <pause dur="0.9"/> from <pause dur="0.4"/> away a very strong move away from lots and lots of short attachments <pause dur="0.7"/> and this is perhaps <pause dur="0.9"/> the boldest <pause dur="0.2"/> part <pause dur="0.3"/> of <pause dur="0.2"/> the phase two curriculum that we operate here <pause dur="0.7"/> in that instead <pause dur="0.4"/> of <pause dur="1.0"/> taking the students in groups round lots of short attachments <pause dur="0.8"/> we <pause dur="0.2"/> attach them currently in pairs although that may need to go up to threes at some point with expanding numbers <pause dur="1.0"/> of students <pause dur="0.3"/> to two consultants <pause dur="1.1"/> in hospital <pause dur="0.2"/> for the hospital attachments <pause dur="0.5"/> and therefore we attach them at a ratio <pause dur="0.3"/> of one to one <pause dur="1.7"/> two students two consultants <pause dur="0.5"/> and <pause dur="0.3"/> we give them eight weeks <pause dur="0.6"/> to get on and do something useful <pause dur="0.6"/> so we're using long attachments <pause dur="1.0"/> where a small number of students <pause dur="0.2"/> are 
attached to an equal number of consultants <pause dur="2.2"/> the argument being <pause dur="0.7"/> that that gives <pause dur="0.2"/> time <pause dur="0.3"/> for the students to know learners <pause dur="0.2"/> the sorry learners to know the teachers teachers to know the learners <pause dur="0.7"/> for them <pause dur="0.2"/> to actually plan what learning's going to take <pause dur="0.5"/> be undertaken during that eight weeks for them to implement that <pause dur="0.2"/> for some degree of apprenticeship or <unclear>wardling</unclear> or that kind of thing to go on <pause dur="0.8"/> and also <pause dur="0.2"/> for at the end of the process hopefully the teacher to be able to say something sensible <pause dur="0.2"/> about the student <pause dur="0.2"/> having known them for <pause dur="0.4"/> a period of time and not just had them rush around with the group for two weeks <pause dur="0.8"/> <vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/> <pause dur="1.3"/> those of you <pause dur="0.4"/> who are good at quick maths will realize <pause dur="0.4"/> that if we've got two-and-a-half years and they're being attached in blocks of eight weeks <pause dur="0.5"/> you don't actually <pause dur="0.2"/> get that many eight week blocks <pause dur="0.8"/> and indeed in total <pause dur="0.3"/> in addition to the medical elective which is still within the curriculum <pause dur="0.9"/> they have twelve <pause dur="0.3"/> eight week blocks <pause dur="1.1"/> now there were certain 
elements <pause dur="0.7"/> that were felt to be tangibly different that had to be taught as a specialty block <pause dur="0.7"/> and those <pause dur="0.3"/> are <pause dur="0.2"/> psychiatry <pause dur="1.0"/> clinical methods <pause dur="0.5"/> obs and gynae <pause dur="0.8"/> and child health <pause dur="1.6"/> and they are taught as eight week blocks <pause dur="1.5"/> everything else <pause dur="0.8"/> is taught <pause dur="0.2"/> in the remaining <pause dur="0.8"/> now we're just down to eight <pause dur="0.5"/> eight week blocks <pause dur="0.7"/> and once i get into the sort of <pause dur="0.7"/> the <pause dur="0.6"/> descriptions of how those are actually worked out we can talk a bit more about those in detail <pause dur="4.4"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> these <pause dur="1.7"/> what actually goes on <pause dur="0.6"/> in these eight week blocks <pause dur="0.8"/> has varied to a degree over time <pause dur="0.7"/> from the inception to curriculum <pause dur="0.4"/> to where we are now <pause dur="1.5"/> the original notion was <pause dur="0.6"/> that if you gave a good student to teacher ratio <pause dur="0.5"/> and you gave them <pause dur="0.7"/> eight <pause dur="0.2"/> long attachment blocks <pause dur="0.5"/> almost on a random basis <pause dur="0.6"/> and you told them what they needed to learn <pause dur="0.4"/> then lots of good learning would go on <pause dur="1.7"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> that didn't work very well <pause dur="0.9"/> because <pause dur="1.0"/> the students could really have <pause dur="0.4"/> a very <pause dur="1.3"/> very different sequence of attachments <pause dur="0.3"/> and could for 
instance spend an awful lot of time with dermatologists <pause dur="0.6"/> and no time at all <pause dur="0.3"/> with certain other <pause dur="0.3"/> important areas <pause dur="0.8"/> so <pause dur="0.6"/> after a while efforts were made <pause dur="0.2"/> to <pause dur="0.7"/> take <pause dur="0.4"/> them through some sort of sequence <pause dur="0.6"/> where <pause dur="0.2"/> where <pause dur="0.2"/> there were <pause dur="0.6"/> surgically labelled eight week blocks and medically labelled eight week blocks <pause dur="0.2"/> some of which were more specialist than others <pause dur="0.6"/> and this culminated in there actually then being an extra specialist block invented which was kind of a rehab block <pause dur="0.3"/> which goes under the <pause dur="0.2"/> unedifying title of Geri-ortho <pause dur="0.3"/> because it's # elderly care physician and an orthopaedic surgeon <pause dur="1.1"/> so having gone from this very <pause dur="0.3"/> out of the grey superrandomness great things will happen <pause dur="0.5"/> an increasing amount of structure was put in <pause dur="0.4"/> and this is before we got started at this end this is very much at the <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> end <pause dur="1.1"/> and <pause dur="0.4"/> as the numbers have become more pressured <pause dur="0.8"/> the elements of structure that are in there <pause dur="0.2"/> have actually started to creak a little bit at the edges and look a 
little bit <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> suspect <pause dur="3.7"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> so this is what it looks like <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.9"/> that is <pause dur="0.5"/> the timeline <pause dur="1.0"/> from left to right <pause dur="0.2"/> of the phase two curriculum <pause dur="2.2"/> with the various elements <pause dur="2.7"/> they start off <pause dur="1.6"/> with a junior <pause dur="0.3"/> period <pause dur="1.5"/> they have an exam <pause dur="0.6"/> and they go into a senior period <pause dur="1.8"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> and within the junior and senior periods <pause dur="0.3"/> there are <pause dur="0.2"/> big blocks of general <pause dur="0.2"/> clinical education <pause dur="0.8"/> within the junior <pause dur="0.4"/> they have four <pause dur="0.8"/> eight week blocks <pause dur="1.0"/> and within the senior they have a further four <pause dur="2.9"/> the specialties are <pause dur="0.4"/> also <pause dur="0.8"/> there <kinesic desc="indicates point on slide" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.7"/> Clinical Method <pause dur="0.4"/> and Psychiatry <pause dur="0.4"/> coming in <pause dur="1.4"/> for the most junior students <pause dur="0.6"/> Child Health and Obs and Gynae <pause dur="0.2"/> coming in for the more senior <pause dur="4.4"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> going back to <pause dur="0.2"/> the general clinical education blocks because i think these are the most interesting <pause dur="1.8"/> i've already said <pause dur="0.9"/> that at the beginning <pause dur="0.9"/> there was very little structure as to how these were organized <pause dur="3.0"/> we are <pause dur="0.2"/> at the moment looking at that <pause dur="0.2"/> quite active plan <pause dur="0.6"/> because <pause dur="0.4"/> there still isn't that much structure <pause dur="0.7"/> to it <pause dur="1.1"/> because <pause dur="0.2"/> at the moment <pause dur="1.2"/> 
there is actually the last block they get block twelve they get a bit of choice <pause dur="1.4"/> as to what they do which is a nice thing <pause dur="0.5"/> but that means our four and four eight blocks are now down to seven <pause dur="1.6"/> one of those is the so-called Geri-ortho <pause dur="0.2"/> which gets us down to six <pause dur="1.2"/> and of the remainder <pause dur="0.8"/> i've lost some in my maths somewhere <pause dur="0.7"/> i've remembered <trunc>clini</trunc> </u><u who="nf0447" trans="overlap"> <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> yes </u><u who="nm0445" trans="overlap"> <unclear># just that</unclear> <pause dur="0.6"/> <unclear>you see</unclear> <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> there is also one of those senior blocks is <trunc>tau</trunc> is taken up with the some generic teaching <pause dur="0.3"/> and a little bit of choice which is something called the clinical special study module <pause dur="0.4"/> so that gets us down to five blocks <pause dur="1.3"/> now at the moment <pause dur="0.8"/> the general clinical education that isn't geri-ortho <pause dur="0.4"/> is arranged to either be specialist medicine sorry general medicine <pause dur="0.6"/> or <trunc>spe</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> or general surgery <pause dur="0.4"/> or specialist medicine <pause dur="0.2"/> which is divided into specialist medicine one and specialist medicine two <pause dur="0.4"/> or specialist surgery one and specialist surgery two <pause dur="1.4"/> so <pause dur="1.0"/> three medical <pause dur="0.5"/> three surgical <pause dur="0.7"/> types of blocks 
available <pause dur="0.5"/> five slots in which to do it <pause dur="1.0"/> basically means <pause dur="0.2"/> that not all students do all types of blocks <pause dur="1.8"/> which and in addition to that <pause dur="0.2"/> they can do <pause dur="1.3"/> any of those blocks <pause dur="0.3"/> in either junior <pause dur="0.4"/> or senior <pause dur="0.8"/> which actually means <pause dur="0.3"/> that <pause dur="0.4"/> one particular group of teachers could have one group of students <pause dur="0.2"/> who were brand new to the clinical course <pause dur="0.2"/> for one <trunc>w</trunc> eight weeks <pause dur="0.3"/> and the next eight weeks they might have some that have just finished <pause dur="1.3"/> which may keep their life interesting <pause dur="0.3"/> but it also means <pause dur="0.3"/> that we can't <pause dur="0.2"/> put together <pause dur="0.5"/> teaching partnerships with consultants <pause dur="0.2"/> that are particularly suitable <pause dur="1.0"/> for students at the beginning of the course <pause dur="0.2"/> or particularly suitable for students at the end of the course <pause dur="0.3"/> because at the moment <pause dur="0.6"/> they could undertake them at any point in the course <pause dur="3.6"/> the other thing to say about this is i've already said <pause dur="0.9"/> that <pause dur="1.5"/> one of the problems was the number of specialties students had to rush through <pause dur="1.7"/> now clearly on this <trunc>m</trunc> model <pause dur="0.7"/> they are only going to get exposed <pause dur="0.2"/> to 
five plus an optional <pause dur="0.2"/> six different <pause dur="0.3"/> things <pause dur="1.2"/> they're not all going to get E-N-T <pause dur="0.8"/> although there are E-N-T surgeons in both the partnerships as some will know <pause dur="0.4"/> they're not all going to get opthalmology <pause dur="1.1"/> they are going to get some general medicine but they're not all going to get cardiology respiratory medicine gastroenterology <pause dur="1.5"/> and this is one of the fundamental things to understand about this way of delivering our curriculum <pause dur="0.7"/> that <pause dur="0.4"/> we are <pause dur="0.2"/> not aiming <pause dur="0.2"/> to fulfil <pause dur="0.2"/> their learning needs by rushing them round a bunch of specialists <pause dur="0.2"/> who happen to have specialist knowledge in particular areas <pause dur="0.8"/> we are looking <pause dur="0.2"/> to address their learning needs <pause dur="0.5"/> by giving them a list of what they need to learn and putting them in a series <pause dur="0.2"/> of clinical situations <pause dur="0.5"/> where there are opportunities <pause dur="2.7"/> but <pause dur="1.0"/> if they just sit back and wait for it to wash over them <pause dur="0.9"/> they are not going to meet everything by a long shot <pause dur="1.7"/> they <pause dur="0.5"/> not only are encouraged to take control of their learning <pause dur="0.4"/> but if they don't they're 
not going to do very well <pause dur="2.7"/> do people see what i'm saying about that <pause dur="0.4"/> that it is quite <pause dur="0.5"/> a radical and different way of looking at things <pause dur="0.8"/> and it's a <trunc>w</trunc> <pause dur="0.6"/> way that <pause dur="0.3"/> some of the students get and some of them don't <pause dur="1.1"/> a lot of them say oh well we were never taught such and such <pause dur="1.0"/> they might be coming to you <unclear>today</unclear> you know we <pause dur="0.3"/> we we've not done E-N-T <pause dur="0.6"/> so i don't know it <pause dur="0.3"/> so i'm not prepared to think about it <pause dur="1.0"/> is that something that people have come across in their practice oh we we didn't we didn't do that <pause dur="0.4"/> we didn't do head and neck <pause dur="0.9"/> yeah <pause dur="1.0"/> we just don't do it <pause dur="0.8"/> it's not important can't matter <pause dur="2.1"/> i think in discussion we can talk a little bit more about <pause dur="0.3"/> how different <trunc>stu</trunc> types of students cope with this <pause dur="0.9"/> but that <pause dur="0.4"/> is the theory of what we do <pause dur="0.2"/> and how it's actually practically arranged <pause dur="1.6"/> the specialist blocks are much more like your <pause dur="0.2"/> traditional <pause dur="0.6"/> blocks <pause dur="0.2"/> you know eight weeks of obs and gynae eight weeks of psychiatry <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="1.1"/> although interestingly these are our most pressured 
blocks in terms of finding new <pause dur="0.3"/> new placements for increasing student numbers <pause dur="0.8"/> up to a point we are protected in the general clinical education <pause dur="0.2"/> block end <pause dur="0.4"/> because as far as our curriculum's concerned we could send them to nearly anybody <pause dur="0.6"/> although actually there's probably <pause dur="0.3"/> some sort of <pause dur="0.3"/> moral compulsion on us to actually send them to reasonably good people in reasonably good combinations in a reasonably good order <pause dur="0.9"/> but there's no compulsion for us to find X number <pause dur="0.5"/> of <pause dur="0.8"/> opthalmologists or X number <pause dur="0.2"/> of <pause dur="0.2"/> E-N-T surgeons <pause dur="2.2"/> the elective still exists and it comes just after <pause dur="0.3"/> phase one and they've done Intermediate Clinical Examination <pause dur="1.1"/> just as an aside <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="1.7"/> medical student electives <pause dur="0.2"/> are a very interesting beast <pause dur="0.3"/> they've been around since the seventies <pause dur="1.1"/> we are <pause dur="0.8"/> # in effect although we're not <pause dur="0.2"/> officially a new medical school because we're set up with <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> <pause dur="0.9"/> but we're certainly a university <pause dur="0.2"/> that is new to having medical students around <pause dur="0.6"/> and quite sensibly are asking lots of 
sensible questions about <pause dur="0.3"/> safety security supervision <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> consistency of marking <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> institutional <pause dur="0.2"/> responsibility all that kind of thing about the medical student elective <pause dur="0.7"/> which are all the sorts of questions <pause dur="0.2"/> that actually all the other medical schools should probably be asking themselves anyway <pause dur="0.5"/> so who knows what's going to happen with that <pause dur="0.2"/> but watch this space <pause dur="0.4"/> we are currently in the process of getting a legal opinion as to quite where we stand and all that <pause dur="1.4"/> but anyway <pause dur="2.1"/> there are two summative assessments the intermediate clinical exam and the final professional exam <pause dur="0.4"/> which come between <pause dur="0.2"/> junior and senior <pause dur="0.4"/> and then <pause dur="0.9"/> after senior <pause dur="0.7"/> and <pause dur="0.7"/> if people are particularly interested in those we can chat afterwards about quite how they're structured <pause dur="0.7"/> but broadly <pause dur="1.0"/> the intermediate clinical exam <pause dur="0.4"/> is a version <pause dur="0.3"/> of the <trunc>s</trunc> assessments you are doing <pause dur="0.3"/> within <pause dur="0.2"/> clinical methods of the observed consultation type assessments <pause dur="0.4"/> and final professional exam <pause dur="0.3"/> is the same again <pause dur="0.2"/> only at a 
slightly higher level <pause dur="0.3"/> plus <pause dur="0.2"/> a written paper <pause dur="4.3"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> we've got a number of challenges at the moment in the system <pause dur="0.7"/> i've already <pause dur="0.7"/> said <pause dur="0.2"/> that <pause dur="0.2"/> capacity is a challenge <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="1.0"/> it's a challenge up and down the country i think # <pause dur="0.6"/> we're trying to run a medical school on a population of about eight-hundred-thousand which is not a desperately large <pause dur="0.3"/> population to try and run a relatively large medical school <pause dur="0.6"/> but capacity although it is a particular local problem is also a national issue as there are new medical schools popping up all over the place <pause dur="0.5"/> # <trunc>pu</trunc> <pause dur="0.3"/> taking up those pools of population that the other medical schools use to feed students who <pause dur="0.2"/> on an in <unclear>creeping</unclear> basis and keep their courses running <pause dur="0.9"/> but there are also the specific challenges of areas like <pause dur="0.2"/> child health for instance <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> which are problematic <pause dur="0.3"/> not because of availability of teachers <pause dur="0.2"/> particularly <pause dur="0.3"/> but the availability <pause dur="0.3"/> of <pause dur="0.3"/> young children <pause dur="0.7"/> because there aren't enough children <pause dur="0.7"/> or there aren't as many children as there used to be 
out there and they're in better health <pause dur="0.5"/> so <pause dur="0.7"/> we need to think perhaps more radically about how addressing some of those issues <pause dur="0.4"/> or perhaps we should just cancel the immunization programme and then we'll get # <pause dur="0.3"/><vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" n="ss" dur="1"/> much iller <pause dur="0.2"/> and # <pause dur="0.3"/> we could teach our students much better <pause dur="3.1"/><vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" n="ss" dur="1"/> there is a challege here <pause dur="1.5"/> though that's much more inherent to the structure of our course <pause dur="0.5"/> about the quality <pause dur="0.3"/> of experience they get <pause dur="1.6"/> clearly <pause dur="1.4"/> they get <pause dur="0.3"/> a <pause dur="0.2"/> hopefully <pause dur="0.5"/> deeper <pause dur="1.3"/> more personal experience <pause dur="0.2"/> within their eight week attachments <pause dur="0.5"/> but they don't get the breadth of the specialty experience <pause dur="0.4"/> that other medical students get up and down the country <pause dur="0.3"/> and that is a direct trade-off <pause dur="1.3"/> but we have to look <pause dur="0.5"/> about whether there are particular things that they struggle to get <pause dur="0.7"/> whether there are particular skills <pause dur="0.2"/> particularly like <pause dur="0.7"/> ophthalmoscopy <pause dur="0.2"/> or E-N-T examination i keep using those as examples <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> that we have to put in structurally in another way <pause dur="0.2"/> to bridge 
certain gaps <pause dur="0.9"/> but up to a point that's a direct trade-off if we're going to give them long attachments at a low ratio <pause dur="0.8"/> they are never ever ever going to get round everything <pause dur="0.8"/> but then <pause dur="1.0"/> the majority of medical schools <pause dur="0.6"/> are <pause dur="0.4"/> doing the same thing in a much softer way we've just taken the big bold step <pause dur="0.2"/> perhaps <pause dur="1.4"/> there is an issue of equity <pause dur="0.9"/> in <pause dur="0.4"/> that <pause dur="0.2"/> if you've only got five allocated general clinical education attachments <pause dur="0.6"/> if you get two bad ones <pause dur="0.3"/> that's a pretty big proportion of your course <pause dur="1.2"/> and also if you get two that are pretty similar <pause dur="0.8"/> although <pause dur="0.4"/> all patients have abdomens chests ears <pause dur="0.2"/> eyes mostly <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> and therefore <pause dur="0.2"/> there is <pause dur="0.2"/> always stuff to examine and always <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> people to take histories from and all that kind of thing <pause dur="0.7"/> certainly students feel if they spend too much time with <pause dur="0.3"/> a particular type <pause dur="0.3"/> of doctor <pause dur="0.5"/> that they've had an unequal experience <pause dur="1.7"/> and <pause dur="0.4"/> there are also particular quality issues <pause dur="0.3"/> around attaching students in very small numbers to a huge pool of 
teachers <pause dur="0.7"/> at a very small ratio <pause dur="0.8"/> clearly <pause dur="0.6"/> in the perfect world <pause dur="0.2"/> that's a very high quality experience <pause dur="0.5"/> the <trunc>stude</trunc> the learner <pause dur="0.2"/> and the teacher <pause dur="0.3"/> get to sit together <pause dur="0.3"/> think <pause dur="0.3"/> plan be very individual be very observant give direct feedback et cetera et cetera <pause dur="1.1"/> but it also means <pause dur="0.4"/> it's much harder for us to <trunc>u</trunc> <pause dur="0.3"/> us to survey quality in a way we could in a much more organized teaching programme <pause dur="0.6"/> such that we could be observing the session specialty X is providing <pause dur="0.4"/> or <pause dur="0.2"/> reviewing <pause dur="0.4"/> a specialty at a given time in a <trunc>d</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> given way <pause dur="1.0"/> whereas we've got our students scattered over a huge number of <trunc>lo</trunc> of teachers <pause dur="0.6"/> and those teachers <pause dur="0.2"/> are going to vary and there's a big question of how we <trunc>m</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> feed back to them in a meaningful way <pause dur="0.5"/> in a way that the students are happy with <pause dur="0.6"/> that doesn't bring their confidentiality that allows them to be # honest <pause dur="0.6"/> and also <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="1.1"/> issues <pause dur="0.2"/> about <pause dur="0.3"/> how we give support to such a big diverse group <pause dur="1.0"/> because <pause dur="0.2"/> they are teaching in such small groups scattered all over the 
place <pause dur="5.5"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> the new directions <pause dur="0.8"/> really <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="1.0"/> was just to say that <pause dur="1.6"/> we are currently looking at doing a number of things <trunc>wi</trunc> <pause dur="0.4"/> with <pause dur="0.2"/> the way we organize phase two <pause dur="0.6"/> which have some relevance to <pause dur="1.3"/> certainly a lot of relevance to what the students might be saying to you but probably won't affect clinical methods that much <pause dur="0.8"/> we are aiming <pause dur="0.5"/> to rearrange <pause dur="0.7"/> the <pause dur="0.5"/> general clinical attachments such that <pause dur="0.4"/> some are specified to being done <pause dur="0.2"/> in the junior phase and some are specified to be done in the senior phase <pause dur="0.7"/> this allows us to put together more challenging partnerships for more experienced students <pause dur="0.2"/> and it allows us to put together attachments <pause dur="0.3"/> that are <pause dur="0.5"/> more introductory <pause dur="0.2"/> for more junior students <pause dur="1.9"/> we are also <pause dur="0.4"/> looking <pause dur="0.2"/> to iron out some of the anomalies in the system that we've inherited <pause dur="0.3"/> from <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> in that <pause dur="0.2"/> to give an example <pause dur="0.6"/> there is currently <pause dur="0.2"/> a <pause dur="0.4"/> general <pause dur="0.2"/> surgery attachment on the general surgical list <pause dur="0.3"/> which is paediatric <pause dur="0.2"/> surgery <pause dur="0.3"/> and maxillofacial surgery <pause dur="0.6"/> which is a combination i think sounds 
pretty specialized <pause dur="0.8"/><vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" n="ss" dur="1"/> i don't know about you <pause dur="1.5"/> # <pause dur="1.9"/> we are also looking <pause dur="0.3"/> at rearranging what the orthopaedic surgeons are up to <pause dur="0.3"/> and drawing in <pause dur="0.5"/> # more anaesthetists which is partly an <trunc>un</trunc> underutilized area but i don't think that's of too much <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="1.7"/> # importance to yourselves <pause dur="2.5"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> # <pause dur="1.0"/> what our aim <pause dur="1.2"/> throughout <pause dur="1.0"/> is <pause dur="1.0"/> to get the students to <pause dur="1.0"/> do <pause dur="0.5"/> basically these things take history <pause dur="0.3"/> examine the patient <pause dur="0.3"/> problem solve <pause dur="0.8"/> explain and manage <pause dur="0.5"/> and behave professionally throughout <pause dur="0.9"/> and you can actually learn to do that in a whole number of different settings <pause dur="2.2"/> and they should do that in the context of common clinical presentations <pause dur="0.2"/> and uncommon <pause dur="0.2"/> but serious situations <pause dur="0.6"/> which is one of the ways we justify <pause dur="1.2"/> not rushing around <pause dur="0.4"/> all these specialty experiences <pause dur="2.7"/> do people want to talk about any depth of clinical assessments or shall we just <pause dur="0.3"/> break for a moment and have a chat more about learning styles and things like that 'cause i think that's possibly more useful <pause dur="2.8"/> yeah <pause dur="2.0"/> can i take 
some guidance from the chair </u><pause dur="0.9"/> <u who="nm0448" trans="pause"> yeah <pause dur="0.4"/> let's <trunc>t</trunc> talk about <pause dur="1.1"/> the the the what what the ethos of <pause dur="0.4"/> <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> Medical School is in relation <pause dur="1.3"/> to # is it a problem based <pause dur="0.2"/> learning school </u><u who="nm0445" trans="overlap"> sure </u><u who="nm0448" trans="overlap"> or is it <pause dur="0.9"/> ethos is it self-directed learning </u><pause dur="0.3"/> <u who="nm0445" trans="pause"> okay <pause dur="3.7"/> i think i'll kind of lead on to that if that's all right <pause dur="0.5"/> by <pause dur="1.7"/> sort of just outlining <pause dur="1.6"/> what seems to happen <pause dur="0.5"/> when we put students through this kind of system <pause dur="3.5"/> i've already said that it's very <pause dur="0.2"/> reliant <pause dur="0.5"/> on <pause dur="0.2"/> or it's it's very much based on self-directed learning <pause dur="0.5"/> and therefore <pause dur="0.8"/> for them to get the most out of these long eight week attachments they actually have to have at least some insight <pause dur="0.6"/> as to what they've already done <pause dur="1.4"/> what they've never done at all <pause dur="0.4"/> what they're good at and what they're bad at <pause dur="1.7"/> and they also <pause dur="0.2"/> have to have the ability to have a sensible discussion <pause dur="1.0"/> with <pause dur="0.4"/> their <trunc>c</trunc> <pause dur="0.5"/> clinical teacher <pause dur="0.3"/> about those areas <pause dur="2.3"/> broadly <pause dur="2.5"/> the top tranche of students <pause dur="0.3"/> 
thrive on this <pause dur="1.1"/> but then good students thrive no matter what you do to them basically <pause dur="0.4"/> they'll always pick out the best learning opportunity and get on with it <pause dur="1.0"/> i think the next <pause dur="0.7"/> kind of quartile probably <pause dur="0.2"/> to <pause dur="0.2"/> probably the <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> second and third <pause dur="0.2"/> quartile <pause dur="1.4"/> take a while to get their head round all of this <pause dur="0.5"/> but when they do <pause dur="0.6"/> i think they do quite well and i think they probably do better <pause dur="0.6"/> than <pause dur="0.2"/> if we were very structured with them <pause dur="1.2"/> i think the lower quartile <pause dur="0.6"/> flounder <pause dur="1.1"/> and <pause dur="1.2"/> they do so much much more <pause dur="0.7"/> than in much <trunc>struc</trunc> more structured courses or at least they are seen <pause dur="0.2"/> to flounder much much more <pause dur="0.3"/> it's more obvious <pause dur="0.4"/> and i can't actually tell you whether actually <pause dur="1.1"/> putting them through structure that actually just hides the fact they're floundering <pause dur="0.8"/> or whether it actually gives them enough structure to help them get on with things <pause dur="0.5"/> but i think one of the challenges we have to look at is <pause dur="0.2"/> how we deal <pause dur="0.4"/> with <pause dur="0.2"/> students who are <pause dur="0.3"/> struggling <pause dur="0.3"/> with the insight and <pause dur="0.5"/> the self <pause dur="0.2"/> you know who haven't 
cottoned on to the self-directed nature <pause dur="1.4"/> i think one of the things <pause dur="1.1"/> which <pause dur="0.6"/> is quite important in <pause dur="0.5"/> in understanding how things operate <pause dur="0.4"/> is <pause dur="1.3"/> the way the course was cut down to four years <pause dur="0.4"/> was to a large degree <pause dur="0.9"/> based on the presumption <pause dur="0.3"/> that these guys are graduates which is true <pause dur="0.2"/> it's not a presumption it's a it's a truth <pause dur="0.2"/> but the presumption <pause dur="0.2"/> that graduates come to us as accomplished adult learners <pause dur="2.0"/> and <pause dur="1.4"/> i don't know <pause dur="0.6"/> if that's entirely true or it certainly doesn't seem to be the whole story <pause dur="0.8"/> we undoubtedly <pause dur="0.2"/> have <pause dur="0.3"/> a lot of people coming to us <pause dur="0.2"/> who are <pause dur="0.2"/> mature <pause dur="0.8"/> efficient effective adult learners <pause dur="0.7"/> who have learned that in their first degree or in the work they've done since or whatever <pause dur="0.4"/> and we undoubtedly have some very very effective learners on our course <pause dur="0.2"/> far more so than you'd expect with a school leavers' group <pause dur="1.6"/> but i think our spectrum is much wider <pause dur="0.5"/> and my personal opinion i don't have any data to back this up at all <pause dur="0.4"/> but it seems to ring true whenever i talk to other 
teachers <pause dur="0.2"/> is we have <pause dur="0.2"/> also <pause dur="0.4"/> a group of people who've gone straight from school <pause dur="0.2"/> straight to first degree <pause dur="0.3"/> have had a very spoon fed first degree as many science degrees appear to be nowadays <pause dur="0.3"/> who actually <pause dur="0.3"/> are more dependent <pause dur="1.2"/> learners <pause dur="0.2"/> than the majority of school leavers <pause dur="1.2"/> so <pause dur="0.4"/> the presumption <pause dur="0.2"/> that we can <pause dur="0.4"/> let our wonderful adult learners loose on the learning material and let them get on with it <pause dur="0.2"/> is perhaps a bit naive for some groups <pause dur="0.4"/> and i think <pause dur="0.4"/> we do have this <trunc>h</trunc> <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> i think <pause dur="0.2"/> <trunc>s</trunc> school leaver populations are more homogenous i think we've got an enormous breadth <pause dur="0.2"/> of <pause dur="0.2"/> maturity and learning ability <pause dur="0.3"/> far far wider <pause dur="0.3"/> than the school leavers' group <pause dur="0.3"/> but i think that also actually goes much lower <pause dur="0.2"/> in terms of <pause dur="0.3"/> ability to learn <pause dur="0.3"/> than <pause dur="0.6"/> the school leaver group <pause dur="1.0"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> and i think that's quite a challenge <pause dur="1.6"/> is that something that <pause dur="0.5"/> rings true in the students that you've been seeing </u><pause dur="3.4"/> <u who="nf0449" trans="pause"> can i ask you do they have # a sort of individual mentor a personal <pause dur="0.7"/> sort of # <pause dur="0.3"/>

heart works and we're going to need to know a little bit about blood and we're going to need to know a bit about this and a bit about that <pause dur="0.6"/> and they go away <pause dur="1.5"/> and they set an agenda <pause dur="0.5"/> and members of the group bring back that knowledge <pause dur="0.3"/> and use that knowledge <pause dur="0.2"/> to structure <pause dur="0.2"/> how they're going to answer that problem <pause dur="1.2"/> so they are not <pause dur="0.2"/> given a module of cardiovascular <pause dur="0.2"/> in which clinical problems are used to illustrate things <pause dur="0.6"/> they're given <pause dur="0.6"/> a series of clinical problems which are supposedly <trunc>de</trunc> designed to cover the whole curriculum <pause dur="0.7"/> but it's entirely up to the group <pause dur="0.5"/> to manage the process of finding <pause dur="0.2"/> all the information <pause dur="0.9"/> for everything <pause dur="0.5"/> the whole course in effect <pause dur="0.3"/> to bring it back to their group <pause dur="0.3"/> to assimilate it <pause dur="0.2"/> to make sense of it <pause dur="0.8"/> and <pause dur="1.2"/> to learn the material <pause dur="0.6"/> and the <pause dur="0.2"/> role of facilitator is not to provide <pause dur="0.2"/> any of that information <pause dur="0.8"/> it's to facilitate the process by which they decide and they set their agendas and they send people off and gather their knowledge <pause dur="0.3"/> and are 
supposed to stop them going off on a complete red herring <pause dur="2.8"/> and i think the difference is important 'cause that is radically different from what we do <pause dur="1.6"/> and it's actually quite a well researched teaching technique and there are some good things about it and some bad things about it <pause dur="0.5"/> but one of the things that tends to happen <pause dur="0.4"/> is <pause dur="0.2"/> that people <pause dur="0.2"/> find the research in problem based learning <pause dur="0.4"/> and say it supports another style of learning <pause dur="0.7"/> where actually it's something completely different <pause dur="3.3"/> does that make sense and is that enough on that is that what you were <pause dur="0.5"/> intending </u><pause dur="0.3"/> <u who="nm0448" trans="pause"> that's very helpful thank you very much are there any questions at all for <pause dur="0.4"/> <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> at all on problem based # learning </u><pause dur="1.5"/> <u who="nf0450" trans="pause"> well i guess <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> question now is there not formal <trunc>t</trunc> anatomy teaching in phase one </u><pause dur="1.0"/> <u who="nm0445" trans="pause"> now in our phase one <pause dur="1.1"/> yes </u><pause dur="0.5"/> <u who="nf0450" trans="pause">

a hundred-and-thirty seniors and a hundred-and-ninety juniors and then you know you end up juggling up all the time <pause dur="0.4"/> so there's a administrative logic to separating them <pause dur="0.9"/> but <pause dur="0.2"/> i think there's also <pause dur="0.2"/> an educational logic to separate them and make some partnerships used in the junior phase and some in the senior phase <pause dur="0.7"/> because <pause dur="0.5"/> there are certain <pause dur="0.3"/> teachers <pause dur="0.5"/> and certain combinations <pause dur="0.3"/> which might be quite difficult and challenging <pause dur="0.3"/> but if they've already done  a year of clinical medicine could be very valuable <pause dur="0.6"/> so you wouldn't dare put a student who's straight you know who's only done phase one <pause dur="0.2"/> straight into this partnership <pause dur="0.3"/> but you might want to use it because there's so much to learn there <pause dur="0.3"/> and that you can make that partnership with the only medicine senior <pause dur="1.9"/> on the <pause dur="0.2"/> converse <pause dur="0.2"/> you could for instance decide that actually <pause dur="1.5"/> they ought to <trunc>tr</trunc> they all ought to meet a general surgeon in the junior <pause dur="0.8"/> therefore we will have junior partnerships that all <pause dur="0.2"/> you know <pause dur="0.2"/> one stream that all includes general surgeons or something like that <pause dur="0.6"/> but that's a development on what currently 
happens because at the moment there is no differentiation at all </u><pause dur="0.2"/> <u who="nm0453" trans="pause"> thank you </u><pause dur="3.0"/> <u who="nm0448" trans="pause"> right <pause dur="0.3"/> maybe at that point give <pause dur="0.5"/> <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> <pause dur="0.4"/> a rest and say thank you very much for <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="1.0"/> really making phase two of the course <pause dur="0.2"/> a lot clearer <pause dur="0.7"/> because i think sometimes we can <pause dur="0.7"/> be a bit tunnel vision and just see the Clinical Methods course and <pause dur="0.2"/> forget about what else happens <pause dur="0.2"/> in phase two and that's <pause dur="0.2"/> really helpful <pause dur="0.8"/> insight thank you very much <pause dur="2.0"/> # we're going to break for <pause dur="0.2"/> coffee <pause dur="0.5"/> and can i suggest we reassemble at about twenty-five to four if that's okay it's in about fifteen minutes' time
