<u who="nm0283"><kinesic desc="projector is on showing slide" iterated="n"/> okay as promised the lecture <pause dur="0.5"/> # now is looking at hepatitis B <pause dur="0.3"/> virus there are no handouts for the this lecture but the first paper <pause dur="0.4"/> in the list of references that i gave you <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.9"/> has actually got everything in that this lecture's going to talk about and more <pause dur="0.4"/> so that can act as the notes for this lecture if you want something else to read <pause dur="2.5"/> okay so what i'm going to do is to talk about hepatitis B virus <pause dur="0.3"/> and i'm going to talk about <pause dur="0.3"/> its epidemiology in the same way that i've talked about measles <pause dur="0.4"/> and hopefully explain why it's different <pause dur="2.6"/> <kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> this work was done jointly with # <gap reason="name" extent="2 words"/> <pause dur="0.4"/> who <pause dur="0.7"/> i made the mistake one day as post-doc in the group <pause dur="0.6"/> # made the mistake one day of showing him my payslip so he went off to work in <pause dur="0.2"/> <trunc>c</trunc> computer industry <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> <gap reason="name" extent="2 words"/> who now heads the <pause dur="0.2"/> mathematical or the <trunc>immuni</trunc> # <trunc>e</trunc> epidemiology group <pause dur="0.7"/> at # <pause dur="0.3"/> # <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> <pause dur="0.6"/> # and and <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> who's still around part of the department <pause dur="2.3"/> <kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> 
so i'm going to give an introduction i'm going to talk about the biology epidemiology and current methods of control of hepatitis B <pause dur="1.4"/> talk about its global prevalence <pause dur="1.4"/> and then explain two particular epidemiological processes <pause dur="0.6"/> that are <trunc>u</trunc> # in some ways unique <pause dur="0.4"/> to <pause dur="0.7"/> or one of them is unique to hepatitis B <pause dur="0.5"/> and then show how that reduces equilibrium results # that are different from measles <pause dur="0.4"/> and the effects that that can have in terms of trying to control <pause dur="4.8"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> hepatitis B virus <pause dur="1.5"/> causes acute disease in a minority of infections so about twenty per cent of people who are infected <pause dur="0.5"/> actually develop <pause dur="0.4"/> acute hepatitis <pause dur="0.4"/> and a small very small proportion will actually die of it most people <pause dur="0.4"/> go through an asymptomatic infectious stage which can last about six months but they don't know they've got hepatitis B <pause dur="1.9"/> a proportion of individuals however will fail to clear that infection and will become carriers <pause dur="0.9"/> and that's where the serious consequences of infection occur <pause dur="0.5"/> because they 
induce a high turnover of liver cells so the the hepatitis is killing the liver cells <pause dur="0.7"/> produces a high turnover <pause dur="0.3"/> and so cirrhosis and primary hepatic cancer <pause dur="0.5"/> or P-H-C <pause dur="0.3"/> are actually consequences of long term carriage of hepatitis B <pause dur="1.0"/> but people remain infectious as carriers for many decades many years <pause dur="0.8"/> yeah so <pause dur="0.5"/> there is a contrast between the acute phase that's months <pause dur="0.9"/> and the carriage phase which is years <pause dur="0.8"/> mm and remember duration of infectiousness <pause dur="0.4"/> has an important role to play in epidemiology <pause dur="2.5"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> hepatitis B virus is transmitted <pause dur="1.0"/> by lots of different routes it's a classic small community virus <pause dur="1.1"/> this virus has obviously been around in people for a long time and has evolved to live in small communities <pause dur="1.5"/> so it's transmitted horizontally <pause dur="0.6"/> by close contact although <pause dur="0.4"/> many of the exact mechanisms are unknown it's it's <pause dur="0.3"/> sort of close contact <pause dur="0.6"/> body fluid transmission <pause dur="0.8"/> from one person to another so sexual contact has an important role in <pause dur="0.7"/> in developed countries <pause dur="1.6"/> and also <pause dur="0.4"/> 
intravenous and particularly used to be very bunch of blood borne diseases associated with tranfusions until all tranfusions started to be screened for <pause dur="0.7"/> # viral infection <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> but still in a medical setting <pause dur="0.9"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> infection is quite common so <pause dur="0.7"/> one of the # <pause dur="0.2"/> target groups for vaccination in the U-K are <pause dur="0.2"/> health care workers so doctors and nurses are routinely vaccinated with hepatitis B <pause dur="0.4"/> because they're likely to come in <trunc>con</trunc> contact with people who are infected more than <pause dur="0.3"/> the rest of the population <pause dur="0.9"/> and then finally there's a vertical transmission component <pause dur="0.8"/> from mother to child <pause dur="4.0"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> the public health significance of hepatitis B <pause dur="0.4"/> is that it's a very common virus <pause dur="0.5"/> so there are at least three-hundred-million people who are carriers <pause dur="0.9"/> and because of the age at which people get infected especially <pause dur="0.3"/> # boys getting infected <pause dur="0.3"/> who then develop <pause dur="0.4"/> cancer and cirrhosis <pause dur="0.4"/> in their sort of between twenty and forty years old <pause dur="0.4"/> it has a <trunc>s</trunc> very significant economic impact because that's just when <pause dur="0.7"/> 
people have got children and aged parents to support <pause dur="1.4"/> so its economic impact is actually slightly bigger than its <pause dur="0.6"/> health impact if you like <pause dur="0.5"/> so it does kill people but it kills a group <pause dur="0.5"/> <trunc>w</trunc> who are economically productive <pause dur="1.6"/> and the contrast <pause dur="0.3"/> or or # or the flip side of that is the fact that we do have a very safe <pause dur="0.4"/> cheap effective vaccines that you will have heard about already <pause dur="0.5"/> # available for hepatitis B <pause dur="0.5"/> so it is a potential <pause dur="1.0"/> target in terms of control <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> economically important <pause dur="0.2"/> health important <pause dur="0.4"/> with a a good way of controlling it <pause dur="4.0"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> now <pause dur="0.6"/> it turns out that the interesting thing about hepatitis B <pause dur="0.4"/> is that it varies greatly in terms of its prevalence <pause dur="1.4"/> so i'm going to contrast the Gambia <pause dur="0.5"/> which is a small <pause dur="1.1"/> elongated country in west Africa <pause dur="0.7"/> # with the Republic of Ireland so talking about the results of this # <pause dur="0.2"/> the study that i'd i mentioned # earlier this morning <pause dur="1.5"/> so in the Gambia about eighty per cent of people <pause dur="0.3"/> having been infected by the age ten it's a childhood viral 
infection <pause dur="0.9"/> yeah much like rubella <pause dur="0.5"/> or mumps <pause dur="0.6"/> that children commonly get infected <pause dur="0.4"/> and the vast majority will be infected before the age of ten <pause dur="1.2"/> in the Republic of Ireland by contrast and and that goes for the U-K as well <pause dur="0.6"/> only one-half of a per cent of the total population has ever been infected <pause dur="1.7"/> so it's an enormous discrepancy <pause dur="3.3"/> yeah so you end up with a <trunc>c</trunc> in essentially two <pause dur="0.5"/> splits two paradigms if you like high endemicity <pause dur="0.7"/> common childhood infection <pause dur="0.5"/> low endemicity it's a rare <pause dur="0.4"/> principally adult infection <pause dur="0.7"/> and predominantly known via risk factors so the people in the in the developed world <pause dur="0.3"/> who get hepatitis B predominantly <pause dur="0.3"/> have the risk factors of high numbers of sexual partners or intravenous drug users <pause dur="0.8"/> yeah <pause dur="1.2"/> in developing countries <pause dur="0.3"/> high endemicity areas actually assigning the route of transmission <pause dur="0.3"/> is much more difficult because it's it's <pause dur="0.4"/> everyone's got it <pause dur="0.4"/> and it's ubiquitous <pause dur="2.3"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> so this figure illustrates this <pause dur="0.3"/> high endemicity low endemicity split <pause dur="0.8"/> that principally 
the developing world <pause dur="0.6"/> so that is <pause dur="0.3"/> by and large sub-Saharan Africa <pause dur="0.5"/> south-east Asia <pause dur="0.8"/> # native <trunc>s</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> native <pause dur="0.4"/> Americans i guess in the Amazonian Basin <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> and Inuits <pause dur="0.2"/> Eskimos <pause dur="0.2"/> in northern <pause dur="0.5"/> America <pause dur="0.8"/> they these communities have very high endemicity <pause dur="1.2"/> yeah the rest of the world <pause dur="0.6"/> really doesn't <pause dur="2.6"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> and the interesting thing is that there is no obvious explanation for this <pause dur="0.8"/> you would like to think oh it's genetics <pause dur="0.5"/> yeah it must be something to do with the hosts <pause dur="0.4"/> however if you transfer people through immigration from a high endemicity area <pause dur="0.3"/> to a low endemicity area <pause dur="0.5"/> then after a generation <pause dur="0.5"/> they've actually got low endemicity <pause dur="0.2"/> infection so it's not not something to do with host genetics that makes people more susceptible <pause dur="1.5"/> it's not something to do with the virus that makes it more transmissible <pause dur="1.1"/> yeah <pause dur="0.8"/> viruses from sub-Saharan Africa are continually being <trunc>tr</trunc> introduced into the U-K but we don't have <pause dur="0.5"/> high endemicity <pause dur="0.2"/> situation in the U-K <pause dur="1.2"/> yeah <pause dur="0.5"/> there are no specific behaviours which 
seem to be related <pause dur="1.2"/> yeah <pause dur="0.9"/> so the best current explanation <pause dur="0.4"/> is the transmission is somehow higher in endemic areas <pause dur="1.2"/> yeah <pause dur="4.5"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> but it's a very hand-wavy sort of way <pause dur="1.2"/> at least this explanation really relies on this basic reproduction number R-zero <pause dur="1.3"/> yeah <pause dur="2.2"/> that somehow there's a very small difference between the basic reproduction number in the U-K <pause dur="0.4"/> it's very low <pause dur="0.4"/> and the basic reproduction number in the Gambia it's a bit higher <pause dur="0.9"/> for some unspecified reason <pause dur="1.1"/> mm <pause dur="1.8"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> so this is a picture that you've seen before <pause dur="0.4"/> that somehow the U-K's basic reproduction number is way down here <kinesic desc="indicates point on slide" iterated="n"/> <pause dur="0.8"/> yeah <pause dur="0.8"/> just enough <pause dur="0.6"/> to have one-half of one per cent of people infected <pause dur="1.1"/> yeah <pause dur="0.4"/> and that the Gambia <pause dur="0.4"/> is up here somewhere <kinesic desc="indicates point on slide" iterated="n"/> <pause dur="1.5"/> but there's no explanation <pause dur="0.5"/> well no other explanation as to why <pause dur="0.3"/> there should be that difference <pause dur="1.6"/> yeah <pause dur="2.6"/> are there any questions <pause dur="7.4"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> okay so it varies greatly between countries between different communities <pause dur="0.9"/> mm <pause dur="0.3"/> however <pause dur="0.5"/> if you actually go to the country <pause dur="0.6"/> it varies greatly within the country as well <pause dur="2.0"/> so if you 
go to two for example villages in Alaska <pause dur="0.9"/> same people <pause dur="0.8"/> genetically speaking <pause dur="0.6"/> same behaviour same culture <pause dur="0.6"/> then the the prevalence of carriage can vary between zero and twenty per cent <pause dur="1.6"/> so any explanation that you have <pause dur="0.4"/> about <pause dur="0.4"/> this variability <pause dur="0.3"/> has to include <pause dur="0.2"/> a local component <pause dur="0.3"/> in fact the local component is almost bigger than the <pause dur="0.5"/> national one international one <pause dur="1.6"/> yeah <pause dur="0.7"/> so in fact you would expect very little difference in basic reproduction numbers and basic transmission <pause dur="0.4"/> between neighbouring villages <pause dur="0.7"/> so the explanation about oh it's R-zero it's contact it's behaviour <pause dur="0.2"/> it's genetics <pause dur="0.4"/> completely falls down <pause dur="0.7"/> mm <pause dur="5.9"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> okay well why is that interesting well it's scientifically interesting <pause dur="0.7"/> but it's also interesting in terms of control <pause dur="0.9"/> what are we going to do about it <pause dur="1.2"/> at the moment barring some <pause dur="0.3"/> drugs which are still under trial but at the moment immunization is the only public health measure that we have <pause dur="0.7"/> yeah <pause dur="1.7"/> now there's very little point in discussing it when it 
comes to countries like the Gambia quite clearly it's a childhood infection everyone's going to get hepatitis B <pause dur="0.5"/> let's vaccinate everybody <pause dur="1.1"/> yeah <pause dur="0.9"/> and the indication is that you don't need a very high coverage <pause dur="0.5"/> to actually control or eradicate the infection <pause dur="0.5"/> yeah <trunc>i</trunc> vaccination is quite clearly <pause dur="0.5"/> the best option for control <pause dur="1.6"/> but there is considerable discussion and i put discussion in inverted commas because it's actually downright argument <pause dur="0.6"/> considerable discussion over whether or not it's appropriate for something like the U-K <pause dur="0.9"/> low endemicity countries <pause dur="0.7"/> to vaccinate <pause dur="1.3"/> because only one person in two-hundred is actually going to get hepatitis B <pause dur="0.4"/> so you're going to be vaccinating a hundred-and-ninety-nine children <pause dur="0.6"/> for no reason whatsoever <pause dur="1.5"/> course what you'd like to do is to walk into a classroom at the age of <pause dur="0.2"/> children at the age of five and say right <pause dur="0.3"/> all those of you who are going to <pause dur="0.2"/> use intravenous drugs when you're older <pause dur="0.4"/><vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" n="ss" dur="1"/> and have more than 
five sexual partners a year could you please put your hand up and we'll vaccinate you but <pause dur="0.7"/> that doesn't happen <pause dur="0.8"/> so you'd have to vaccinate all children <pause dur="0.9"/> so there is a cost issue <pause dur="1.5"/> in terms of you're actually wasting a hundred-and-ninety-nine <pause dur="0.4"/> vaccine cases wasting <pause dur="0.9"/> in inverted commas in effect wasting them <pause dur="0.6"/> and there's also a safety issue in the sense that you don't really want to vaccinate people for something that they're not going to <pause dur="0.6"/> ever get a risk for having <pause dur="0.7"/> mm <pause dur="1.5"/> so <pause dur="1.0"/> if we could actually find a reason for this endemicity change this this low-high endemicity split <pause dur="0.5"/> it might help <pause dur="0.4"/> designing control programmes so at the moment in the U-K we have a targeted programme <pause dur="0.7"/> that is that we <trunc>vac</trunc> offer vaccination to people who have specific risk factors <pause dur="0.5"/> of multiple sexual partners intravenous drug use <pause dur="0.8"/> # but of course then you have to wait for them to have those risk factors before you can vaccinate them <pause dur="3.0"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> so <pause dur="0.8"/> hepatitis B immunization policy this is <pause dur="1.3"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> a good reason 
for buying into Microsoft <pause dur="0.2"/> computer products <pause dur="0.6"/> the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation <pause dur="0.4"/> gives a vast amount of money more money <pause dur="0.2"/> than you can possibly imagine <pause dur="0.5"/> to <trunc>h</trunc> to help control <pause dur="0.5"/> vaccine preventable diseases like hepatitis B <pause dur="0.7"/> so this <pause dur="0.2"/> picture is well out of date now it's <pause dur="0.3"/> this is # from three years ago <pause dur="0.4"/> most of the world is coloured blue most of the world has now got routine immunization <pause dur="0.3"/> and a lot of it is being paid for <pause dur="0.7"/> by Bill and Melinda Gates <pause dur="0.6"/> the few countries that are refusing to adopt <pause dur="0.2"/> vaccination include the U-K <pause dur="0.4"/> Scandinavia <pause dur="0.4"/> and the Netherlands <pause dur="0.7"/> principally because of this reason of <pause dur="0.9"/> of <pause dur="0.2"/> not wanting to vaccinate children when they don't need to be <pause dur="0.8"/> but most of the rest of the world has got this universal vaccination of children <pause dur="2.3"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> so <pause dur="1.2"/> that's a kind of introduction <pause dur="1.3"/> so i'm now going to provide you with a better explanation for this variation in prevalence between communities <pause dur="1.4"/> yeah <pause dur="4.6"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> assesses the interplay between two separate epidemiological processes <pause dur="0.9"/> <trunc>wo</trunc> first is that the proportion 
of people who develop carriage is highly age-dependent <pause dur="1.0"/> yeah <pause dur="2.6"/> if you are young <pause dur="0.5"/> and by that i mean <pause dur="0.4"/> the younger you are the say months old <pause dur="0.5"/> then your chances of becoming a carrier and infected than if you're an adult <pause dur="2.5"/> the second is that the average age of infection decreases <pause dur="0.5"/> the more infection there is and i <trunc>ta</trunc> touched on this earlier today that the more common the virus is in the population <pause dur="0.5"/> the earlier people will be when they first get infected <pause dur="1.4"/> yeah <pause dur="0.8"/> and because of the differing time scales <pause dur="0.7"/> in terms of acute infection versus carriage <pause dur="0.2"/> months versus decades <pause dur="0.5"/> carriers <pause dur="0.6"/> are more important in terms of transmission <pause dur="0.8"/> that a carrier will infect approximately five times more people <pause dur="0.4"/> than an acute case <pause dur="0.4"/> because of that length of time over which they're infectious <pause dur="2.0"/> so the average age of infection will go down <pause dur="0.6"/> the more carriers there are <pause dur="1.1"/> yeah <pause dur="2.4"/> does that make sense <pause dur="5.3"/> <kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> okay just to give you some data to illustrate these 
points <pause dur="0.6"/> this shows <pause dur="0.3"/> picture shows the probability of carriage <pause dur="1.6"/> on the vertical axis against age of infection in years on the horizontal axis <pause dur="0.8"/> each of the red crosses represents a <pause dur="0.2"/> single study <pause dur="0.7"/> where people looked at infection in an age in a group of of people <pause dur="0.5"/> and saw what percentage of them became carriers <pause dur="1.2"/> # and the circle around <pause dur="0.9"/> # each of these studies represents the size of the study so this study here <kinesic desc="indicates point on slide" iterated="n"/> <pause dur="0.4"/> had about two-hundred people in it <pause dur="0.3"/> and this one here <kinesic desc="indicates point on slide" iterated="n"/> will have had <trunc>v</trunc> # <pause dur="0.3"/> you know far fewer people in it <pause dur="2.2"/> but you can see there is a clear relationship here whereabouts up here <pause dur="0.5"/> if somebody is infected at birth <pause dur="0.3"/> by their mother <pause dur="1.1"/> then they have about a ninety per cent chance of becoming a carrier <pause dur="2.9"/> and that percentage that risk or probability drops quite dramatically <pause dur="0.5"/> so that by the time you get to the age of ten <pause dur="0.5"/> you're talking about five per cent <pause dur="0.7"/> oh sorry <pause dur="0.7"/> fifteen per cent <pause dur="0.9"/> yeah <pause dur="0.6"/> and it's about five per cent for adults overall <pause dur="0.8"/> so there's a very strong age relationship <pause dur="1.3"/> yeah <pause dur="4.2"/> 
<kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> this is the relationship between the rate of infection <pause dur="0.9"/> the amount of virus that's there in principally carriers <pause dur="0.3"/> and the age at infection <pause dur="1.3"/> so the more <pause dur="0.2"/> infection there is <pause dur="0.2"/> yeah the <pause dur="0.4"/> if you <trunc>th</trunc> can think of the <trunc>s</trunc> numbers of carriers going up this axis <pause dur="0.6"/> the lower the average age at infection will be <pause dur="1.8"/> yeah <pause dur="1.9"/> so these two things <pause dur="0.3"/> interact <pause dur="0.3"/> ignore the equation <pause dur="2.5"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> so the more carriers you have <pause dur="0.8"/> the lower the average age at infection <pause dur="1.1"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> so the more carriers you will create <pause dur="1.3"/> which will give you more carriers <pause dur="1.1"/> which will mean that the average age at infection is lower so there's a positive feedback loop <pause dur="0.9"/> the lower the average age at infection <pause dur="0.2"/> the higher the numbers of carriers you create <pause dur="0.5"/> and so the higher the rate of infection and so the lower the average age at infection <pause dur="0.2"/> yeah <pause dur="4.8"/> can everyone see that there's this positive feedback <pause dur="1.1"/> created in hepatitis B <pause dur="0.4"/> by the fact that the probability of becoming a carrier <pause dur="1.5"/> is higher the younger you are 
when you're infected <pause dur="3.9"/> yeah <pause dur="0.4"/> any <pause dur="3.0"/> confusion <pause dur="0.6"/> no <pause dur="3.4"/> <kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> skip that one <pause dur="0.5"/> <vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/> <kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> skip that one <pause dur="2.1"/> okay so this positive feedback <pause dur="0.2"/> creates <pause dur="1.1"/> a difference a change in this <pause dur="2.1"/> equilibrium diagram that i showed you earlier remember in the <pause dur="0.4"/> equilibrium diagram i showed you before <pause dur="0.7"/> has the basic reproduction number determining <pause dur="0.5"/> a threshold for when infection <trunc>occu</trunc> can occur <pause dur="0.4"/> or when it can be sustained in a population <pause dur="1.2"/> and here you see this threshold <kinesic desc="indicates point on slide" iterated="n"/> down here <pause dur="0.8"/> yeah <pause dur="0.6"/> so for relatively low values of the basic reproduction number and low values <pause dur="0.6"/> or <trunc>n</trunc> small numbers of infected individuals <pause dur="0.7"/> you essentially have a U-K situation so this black line represents <pause dur="0.4"/> a developed country a U-K situation <pause dur="0.8"/> where the rate of infection is very low <pause dur="0.2"/> not many people have # hepatitis B <pause dur="1.1"/> that means the average age at infection is quite high <pause dur="0.5"/> because you have to live quite a long time 
before you meet somebody who's got hepatitis B <pause dur="0.8"/> which means the chances of becoming a carrier are quite small <pause dur="1.2"/> yeah <pause dur="0.3"/> so it's essentially an adult infection <pause dur="3.5"/> this equilibrium up here <kinesic desc="indicates point on slide" iterated="n"/> <pause dur="1.4"/> is the high endemicity paradigm <pause dur="1.6"/> everybody has hepatitis B which means that all children get hepatitis B <pause dur="0.3"/> which means that they become carriers <pause dur="0.4"/> and it's this positive feedback loop <pause dur="1.2"/> yeah <pause dur="2.3"/> so you have two endemic states a low one and a high one <pause dur="1.4"/> and what's interesting <pause dur="0.9"/> in some ways is that is that for regions of the basic reproduction number <pause dur="1.2"/> these two endemic states can coexist <pause dur="1.0"/> yeah <pause dur="1.4"/> so <pause dur="1.4"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> what you have is these arrows representing <pause dur="0.2"/> how the <sic corr="population">popsulation</sic> will change <pause dur="0.3"/> in terms of <pause dur="0.4"/> endemicity <pause dur="0.6"/> yeah when it's away from its equilibrium <pause dur="1.9"/> so you have two endemic states separated by this <kinesic desc="indicates point on slide" iterated="n"/> <pause dur="0.3"/> red line which is an unstable boundary <pause dur="0.8"/> so if you're down <kinesic desc="indicates point on slide" iterated="n"/> here in the U-K <pause dur="1.0"/> and for some reason you increase the amount of hepatitis B <pause dur="0.4"/> to go above this unstable 
boundary <pause dur="1.9"/> then you cross over into a high endemicity regime <pause dur="0.9"/> you've got enough infection <pause dur="0.4"/> to enable children to become infected to become carriers <pause dur="0.3"/> to start off this positive feedback loop <pause dur="0.4"/> so the amount of infection will then increase up to high endemicity <pause dur="1.5"/> yeah <pause dur="4.4"/> so these two endemic states come about because of this high positive feedback loop <pause dur="2.3"/> and they can coexist <pause dur="0.7"/> so there need be no reason why the Gambia is different from the U-K <pause dur="1.1"/> other than the fact that the Gambia has a high prevalence <pause dur="0.9"/> and the U-K has a low prevalence <pause dur="3.4"/> yeah <pause dur="1.8"/> somehow the Gambia started high and stay there <pause dur="0.5"/> and somehow we've ended up down here <pause dur="0.6"/> but there's there need be no other explanation <pause dur="1.4"/> yeah <pause dur="2.8"/> and i'm going to talk more about that <pause dur="0.5"/> or i'm going to try and explain that more in a minute <pause dur="0.9"/> the other feature from this picture <pause dur="0.9"/> is the fact that <pause dur="0.6"/> you can have viral <trunc>per</trunc> <pause dur="0.3"/> persistence in a population <pause dur="0.8"/> in a <trunc>p</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> in a population where it couldn't invade <pause dur="0.9"/> so where the basic reproduction 
number is less than one <pause dur="1.9"/> yeah down here <pause dur="1.7"/><kinesic desc="indicates point on slide" iterated="n"/> if you introduce some infection <pause dur="1.3"/> basic reproduction number is less than one <pause dur="0.7"/> the change of transmission won't occur <pause dur="1.6"/> but if you introduce enough infection <pause dur="1.7"/> you actually cross into this high endemicity state <pause dur="1.6"/> so in ecological terms if you like <pause dur="0.3"/> what hepatitis B is doing is is <pause dur="0.4"/> changing the host population <pause dur="0.6"/> yeah it's it's making everyone <trunc>t</trunc> be a carrier so that the <trunc>be</trunc> can sustain itself <pause dur="0.3"/> in a population which it couldn't invade <pause dur="1.9"/> mm <pause dur="5.1"/> are there any questions <pause dur="7.8"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> okay so this is different <pause dur="0.5"/> because of this positive feedback means infection can exist in a population <pause dur="0.3"/> that it couldn't invade into <pause dur="0.9"/> yeah and there's more complicated relationship between R-zero and seroprevalence in other words <pause dur="0.6"/> the methods that i talked about earlier for looking at age serological profiles just wouldn't work <pause dur="1.7"/> yeah because if you're looking at a population of eighty per cent infected by age ten you'd say oh R-zero has to be quite big <pause dur="0.4"/> but in fact R-zero could be less than 
one <pause dur="1.1"/> in the Gambia <pause dur="0.9"/> mm <pause dur="1.5"/> and it produces these two stable possibilities high and low endemicity <pause dur="0.4"/> which are both self-sustaining <pause dur="0.3"/> both stable <pause dur="0.9"/> and which one you're at depends on where you start from <pause dur="4.3"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> now i have to mention these but i'm not going to go into any detail <pause dur="0.5"/> this is all controlled by two important parameters <pause dur="0.8"/> one of which is the relative infectiousness of carriers <pause dur="0.8"/> so although carriers are infectious for a longer period of time than acute cases <pause dur="0.4"/> they are less infectious <pause dur="1.3"/> yeah <pause dur="3.0"/> the other <pause dur="0.3"/> parameter <pause dur="0.7"/> is something i've called F <pause dur="0.5"/> which is the proportion of infected adults that become carriers <pause dur="0.7"/> yeah <pause dur="0.6"/> now the reason i highlight these two parameters is because there isn't actually much data on these two <pause dur="1.7"/> yeah <pause dur="1.0"/> what data there is and i've showed it to you suggests the proportion of infected adults <pause dur="0.5"/> who become carriers is about five per cent but <pause dur="0.4"/> you know it could be <pause dur="0.8"/> as high as eight or it could be as low as three <pause dur="2.3"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> now whether or not these <pause dur="1.0"/> occur <pause dur="1.2"/> yeah and this is 
this is looking at the F and alpha in this figure here <pause dur="0.6"/> whether or not this pattern occurs of this <pause dur="0.7"/> multiple equilibria <pause dur="1.3"/> depends very much on these two parameters <pause dur="1.2"/> so in this picture here <pause dur="0.5"/> i am <pause dur="0.6"/> varying this alpha and this F so the relative infectiousness of carriers <pause dur="0.4"/> and the proportion of adults who become carriers <pause dur="0.7"/> so the solid black line <pause dur="0.8"/> is the one that i showed you earlier that's just the the basic relationship between R-zero and seroprevalence <pause dur="0.6"/> this is the one i showed before <pause dur="0.5"/> yeah and these other <pause dur="0.3"/> lines are varying these parameters for which we have little information <pause dur="1.9"/> okay <pause dur="4.4"/> so another <trunc>r</trunc> result from this is that <pause dur="0.4"/> it's not just the fact that you can get these multiple endemicities but the fact is that they are very sensitive <pause dur="0.7"/> to the parameters that you choose <pause dur="1.3"/> so it might be that the Gambia <pause dur="0.4"/> is different from the U-K <pause dur="0.5"/> perhaps in terms of diet <pause dur="0.8"/> which somehow means that adults <pause dur="0.3"/> are just <pause dur="0.3"/> a little more likely to become carriers than <pause dur="0.8"/> than people who don't have that 
diet in the U-K <pause dur="1.0"/> and the difference is so small <pause dur="0.3"/> that you can't measure it <pause dur="1.2"/> without doing large studies <pause dur="1.0"/> but in fact <pause dur="0.5"/> it has a big impact on the epidemiology <pause dur="1.5"/> yeah <pause dur="1.7"/> so it's a it's a phenomenon called criticality the the the <trunc>s</trunc> dynamic situation is critically dependent <pause dur="0.5"/> on some values of the parameters <pause dur="2.6"/> and actually measuring those parameters in the field is <kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> very difficult <pause dur="3.5"/> okay what i'm going to do now is to kind of illustrate <pause dur="1.7"/> potentially how we could explain this endemicity <pause dur="2.1"/> so this <pause dur="0.4"/> figure here shows what happens <pause dur="0.5"/> if you take this system <pause dur="0.8"/> over a period of this case five-thousand years <pause dur="0.6"/> because hepatitis B carriage is is quite persistent <pause dur="0.3"/> it means that <pause dur="0.5"/> the time scales over which hepatitis B changes are quite long <pause dur="1.1"/> yeah <pause dur="0.7"/> but let's take <pause dur="0.2"/> so this just running over five-thousand years <pause dur="0.8"/> and i start off at some level of infection <pause dur="1.0"/> and there where each of the arrows occurs vertical arrows what i'm doing is i'm <pause dur="0.2"/> reducing the basic reproduction number <pause dur="1.6"/> okay <pause dur="4.9"/> let me go <pause dur="0.7"/> back <pause dur="3.3"/> 
<kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> i'm actually starting on here <pause dur="0.3"/> yeah <pause dur="0.2"/> so i'm starting at a value <kinesic desc="indicates point on slide" iterated="n"/> here <pause dur="0.8"/> yeah <pause dur="0.4"/> and then i'm reducing the basic reproduction number to allow the the <pause dur="0.4"/> the system to go to the next equilbrium <pause dur="1.6"/> <kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> yeah <pause dur="0.2"/> so i'm going <kinesic desc="indicates point on slide" iterated="n"/> here down to the next equilibrium then i'm reducing the basic reproduction number again <pause dur="0.4"/> going down to the next equilibrium <pause dur="0.4"/> and reducing the basic reproduction number going to the next one <pause dur="0.3"/> and eventually it goes extinct <pause dur="1.1"/> yeah <pause dur="0.4"/> so i'm essentially moving down that lower curve <pause dur="1.5"/> yeah <pause dur="0.2"/> does that make sense <pause dur="7.4"/> <kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> if i start just above <pause dur="0.2"/> that unstable equilibrium that red dotted curve in the equilibrium diagram <pause dur="0.7"/> i go up to the high equilibrium <pause dur="1.5"/> yeah <pause dur="0.6"/> so the difference in the starting point <pause dur="0.3"/> between those two <pause dur="0.5"/> is as small as you like <pause dur="0.6"/> yeah <pause dur="2.4"/> above it we go up below it you go down <pause dur="1.1"/> and here i reduce the basic reproduction number again <pause dur="0.7"/> and this 
point here <kinesic desc="indicates point on slide" iterated="n"/> <pause dur="0.2"/> between these two <pause dur="0.3"/> reductions of the basic reproduction number <pause dur="0.7"/> is something <pause dur="0.3"/> called a catastrophe <pause dur="0.5"/> yeah the technical term for it <pause dur="0.8"/> where a small change in a parameter produces a <pause dur="0.3"/> a very big result <pause dur="0.4"/> and essentially what's happening is i'm falling off <pause dur="0.4"/> the end of the high endemicity and dropping down to the low endemicity <pause dur="1.3"/> yeah <pause dur="1.3"/> so in these <pause dur="1.2"/> curves here <pause dur="0.3"/> if i change the basic reproduction number <pause dur="0.3"/> so that i just drop off the end <pause dur="0.8"/> then i get a very dramatic change <pause dur="0.4"/> in the <pause dur="1.3"/> proportion positive <pause dur="1.1"/> for a very small change in the parameter <pause dur="1.6"/> <kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> yeah <pause dur="3.0"/> so does that make sense <pause dur="2.4"/><event desc="noise from computer" iterated="n"/> remember not to go backwards again <pause dur="1.9"/> i've never done it with loudspeakers on so <pause dur="2.0"/> any questions </u><pause dur="1.7"/> <u who="sf0284" trans="pause">  are those </u><u who="nm0283" trans="overlap"> yeah </u><u who="sf0284" trans="overlap"> two parameters defined in the journal <pause dur="0.2"/> or are they just </u><u who="nm0283" trans="overlap"> yes </u><u who="sf0284" trans="overlap"> <unclear>just</unclear> like <pause dur="0.4"/> they are </u><pause dur="0.2"/> <u who="nm0283" trans="pause"> they are 
defined yeah <pause dur="6.3"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> so a very small change in the parameters <pause dur="0.4"/> or the starting point <pause dur="0.3"/> can lead to a large <pause dur="0.3"/> changes in outcomes <pause dur="0.7"/> yeah <pause dur="1.9"/> and these changes these these <pause dur="0.4"/> differences <pause dur="1.1"/> can be so small that in fact they're undetectable <pause dur="0.5"/> in most field studies <pause dur="1.7"/> so additional heterogeneity <pause dur="0.5"/> is potentially going to come from the fact <pause dur="0.5"/> that if you have populations that are in transition <pause dur="0.5"/> between one state and another <pause dur="1.0"/> yeah they're moving slowly <pause dur="0.7"/> they are in transition <pause dur="0.6"/> then <pause dur="0.2"/> you'll get additional heterogeneity <pause dur="0.4"/> so one thing i didn't point out <trunc>f</trunc> was that <pause dur="0.5"/> although we have high and low endemicity states <pause dur="0.4"/> sub-Saharan Africa and the U-K <pause dur="0.6"/> much of southern Europe and north Africa <pause dur="0.3"/> are <trunc>in</trunc> have intermediate <pause dur="0.3"/> epidemiology <pause dur="1.6"/> so this would suggest that in between <pause dur="0.7"/> yeah intermediate <pause dur="0.3"/> endemicity <pause dur="0.4"/> there are actually countries on their way <pause dur="0.2"/> from high to low potentially <pause dur="2.2"/> yeah <pause dur="1.3"/> if you look at a country like Tunisia <pause dur="0.3"/> you can actually see a <trunc>cl</trunc> almost a cline 
of hepatitis B <pause dur="0.3"/> from south to north <pause dur="0.8"/> yeah that that you're actually seeing hepatitis B <pause dur="1.3"/> going down as you go north through the country <pause dur="1.5"/> mm <pause dur="0.5"/> so there's a sort of geographical variation which is perhaps due to <pause dur="1.4"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> this this <pause dur="0.6"/> transition from high to low <pause dur="6.6"/> okay so is everybody happy about that explanation for different epidemiologies <pause dur="3.4"/> okay what i want to do now <pause dur="0.7"/> is to talk about <pause dur="0.4"/> the consequences of this <pause dur="0.5"/> in terms of public health <pause dur="2.3"/> and the first is the fact that you're going to potentially have <pause dur="2.2"/> different epidemiological <pause dur="1.2"/> scenarios high or low endemicity <pause dur="0.5"/> in the same country <pause dur="0.6"/> yeah if if this is right there is no reason why we shouldn't have high endemicity in the U-K <pause dur="1.3"/> yeah <pause dur="0.3"/> the only reason we don't have high endemicity is because we don't have high endemicity <pause dur="1.4"/> but if we infected lots of children tomorrow <pause dur="0.9"/> and they became carriers <pause dur="0.6"/> that would create the situation where the other children would become infected and they would become carriers <pause dur="0.4"/> and so on <pause dur="0.5"/> yeah we'd move to high endemicity <pause dur="1.6"/> 
so we can illustrate that by looking at <pause dur="1.1"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> the effect of <pause dur="1.3"/> introducing carriers into a population <pause dur="1.1"/> yeah <pause dur="1.1"/> so we start off at low endemicity <pause dur="1.6"/> introduce some carriers <pause dur="2.2"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> if we introduce <pause dur="2.0"/> enough <pause dur="0.6"/> to make it high but not to cross over the boundary we get a little epidemic <pause dur="0.2"/> of infection <pause dur="0.4"/> but it settles back down to the low equilibrium <pause dur="1.0"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> mm <pause dur="1.6"/> but if we cross the boundary <pause dur="0.7"/> and introduce enough carriers <pause dur="0.5"/> then we create this positive feedback <pause dur="0.3"/> which results in a <trunc>g</trunc> moving up to high endemicity <pause dur="1.7"/> mm <pause dur="1.3"/> so we're just crossing over that red dotted line on the equilibrium boundary <pause dur="1.5"/> so this potentially has important consequences <pause dur="0.5"/> when thinking about for example immigration <pause dur="1.4"/> and in fact bringing hepatitis B carriers <pause dur="0.4"/> into a low endemicity country <pause dur="0.3"/> might well create the possibility <pause dur="0.3"/> of moving to a high endemicity <pause dur="1.6"/> yeah <pause dur="0.6"/> or for example failure of blood tranfusion services to actually detect hepatitis B <pause dur="0.7"/> if we created lots of carriers <pause dur="0.6"/> then we might move into a situation of high endemicity <pause dur="2.9"/> so there is this 
potential <pause dur="2.1"/> of moving to high endemicity <pause dur="1.5"/> now <pause dur="0.4"/> whenever you talk about immigration or mention that word it <pause dur="0.2"/> it <trunc>prod</trunc> usually produces a kind of <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> bistable response in itself <pause dur="1.3"/> there's a very # good paper i'm not sure if it's on the list but # there's the reference given there <pause dur="0.9"/> which actually turns this on its head and says well <pause dur="0.4"/> in fact the majority of carriers in the U-K <pause dur="0.4"/> do actually come from overseas they were infected <pause dur="1.2"/> overseas so they're they've emigrated to the U-K <pause dur="0.3"/> they've brought their hepatitis B carriage with them <pause dur="4.0"/> so in fact the most cost-effective policy <pause dur="0.5"/> for the Department of Health <pause dur="0.4"/> when it trying to deal with hepatitis B carriage in the U-K <pause dur="1.2"/> is to vaccinate people <pause dur="0.6"/> in the countries <pause dur="0.8"/> where immigration starts from <pause dur="2.1"/> yeah <pause dur="3.4"/> in terms of vaccination we shouldn't be vaccinating people in the U-K we should be vaccinating people outside <pause dur="0.4"/> because that's where our hepatitis B comes from <pause dur="1.4"/> so it turns round a <pause dur="0.5"/> a sort of an anti-immigration <pause dur="1.3"/> 
argument <pause dur="0.4"/> into one that's much more positive in terms of <pause dur="0.6"/> sharing health care globally <pause dur="0.9"/> mm <pause dur="8.1"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> everyone chuckles when they read this paper and says oh yes that's a funny thing isn't it but i actually think that this is # a <pause dur="0.3"/> a very <pause dur="0.3"/> important idea <pause dur="0.6"/> # that sooner or later everyone's going to catch on to <pause dur="0.8"/> # that <pause dur="0.6"/> vaccination <pause dur="0.4"/> overseas in terms of of increasing global travel <trunc>incleepa</trunc> increasing globalization <pause dur="0.3"/> is going to be the most cost-effective way <pause dur="0.3"/> in which we control infection in this country <pause dur="5.0"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> okay the <trunc>f</trunc> <pause dur="0.6"/> the other <pause dur="0.8"/> consequence of this <pause dur="1.3"/> dual <trunc>end</trunc> # high-low endemicity <pause dur="0.3"/> dichotomy <pause dur="0.4"/> is the fact that if you have a drug that could cure carriage <pause dur="1.4"/> yeah you could use it as a public health tool <pause dur="1.1"/> now at the moment such a drug doesn't exist there are drugs which you can use to suppress <pause dur="0.4"/> viral replication <pause dur="0.4"/> if for example you're going to do some sort of # <pause dur="0.3"/> # blood # liver transplant <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> but resistance arises quite quickly to them <pause dur="0.3"/> so there isn't anything yet which we <pause dur="0.2"/> we have <pause dur="0.5"/> use 
<trunc>al</trunc> you can use although there are <pause dur="0.2"/> <trunc>s</trunc> many things <pause dur="0.3"/> in the pipeline <pause dur="0.5"/> but let's suppose that we had something <pause dur="0.9"/> so we can actually start at high endemicity <pause dur="0.5"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> and we could reduce the numbers of carriers we could go out into the community and we could say right <pause dur="0.8"/> we're going to cure carriage <pause dur="0.9"/> everyone we can find <pause dur="1.2"/> if we remove that level of carriage from the population <pause dur="0.6"/> yeah to some degree <pause dur="0.7"/> it means that children would no longer potentially become infected as <trunc>ch</trunc> # become infected <pause dur="0.5"/> which means that they wouldn't create carriers <pause dur="0.3"/> so you would break this positive feedback <pause dur="1.2"/> <kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> yeah <pause dur="0.4"/> <kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> so again you get this bistability <pause dur="0.4"/> <kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> effect that if you cross this threshold <pause dur="0.7"/> you reduce the level of carriage enough <pause dur="0.5"/> you can actually switch from high to low endemicity <pause dur="3.7"/> yeah <pause dur="5.7"/> now this is <pause dur="0.9"/> again quite novel because people think in terms of curing 
carriage in terms of curing individuals <pause dur="1.0"/> preventing people getting cirrhosis and hepatic <pause dur="0.6"/> and primary hepatic cancer <pause dur="0.5"/> not <pause dur="0.5"/> in terms of a public health tool <pause dur="1.7"/> yeah <pause dur="0.8"/> but carriers have two roles one is that they are themselves <pause dur="0.4"/> in danger of of serious health consequences <pause dur="0.5"/> the second is that they are actually transmitting to other people <pause dur="1.4"/> mm <pause dur="5.3"/> are there any questions about that <pause dur="1.8"/> mm <pause dur="3.3"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> okay so we can potentially use <pause dur="0.5"/> cure of carriage as a public health tool <pause dur="1.2"/> yep <pause dur="0.8"/> theoretically you could do the same thing with behaviour change if you could just say to carriers right don't transmit <pause dur="0.7"/> yeah <pause dur="0.2"/> or reduce viral load <pause dur="0.2"/> in those carriers <pause dur="0.2"/> to a to an extent you don't actually have to cure them <pause dur="0.6"/> if you could reduce viral loads to an extent that they were no longer infectious it would have the same effect <pause dur="1.6"/> but one of the key things <pause dur="0.6"/> for this is in terms of thinking about eradication <pause dur="1.9"/> eradication through vaccination <pause dur="0.9"/> is <pause dur="0.5"/> the time scale for it is very much related to duration of infectiousness <pause dur="1.9"/> 
and it took about two-hundred <pause dur="0.6"/> infection generations to eradicate smallpox <pause dur="1.0"/> yeah <pause dur="0.5"/> which is actually quite a small number when you think about it <pause dur="0.4"/> you start vaccinating against smallpox in a concerted effort to eradicate <pause dur="1.4"/> and from that <pause dur="0.3"/> that point there are only two-hundred further generations of transmission <pause dur="1.4"/> yeah <pause dur="1.1"/> but it's possible with smallpox because the duration of infectiousness <pause dur="0.4"/> is only measured in days or weeks <pause dur="2.7"/> carriers for hepatitis B can survive many decades <pause dur="0.8"/> so even if we said tomorrow right let's eradicate hepatitis B <pause dur="0.6"/> we're going to have to wait <pause dur="0.2"/> fifty or sixty years <pause dur="0.5"/> before those children who are <pause dur="0.3"/> carriers now <pause dur="1.0"/> yeah <pause dur="0.2"/> if they survive <pause dur="0.7"/> actually <pause dur="1.0"/> stopping carriers <pause dur="1.2"/> mm <pause dur="0.4"/> so two-hundred it may well be two-hundred generations <pause dur="0.4"/> in terms of eradication but if we use <pause dur="0.6"/> clearance of carriage as a public health tool <pause dur="1.8"/> then we can reduce that time scale a lot <pause dur="0.3"/> and it actually makes eradication of hepatitis B <pause dur="0.3"/> a feasible proposition <pause dur="6.7"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> okay <pause dur="0.2"/> what i'm going to do now is i'm going to 
look at vaccination <pause dur="0.7"/> how does vaccination influence <pause dur="0.6"/> this picture <pause dur="0.8"/> yeah <pause dur="0.6"/> this is the same picture as i showed you before <pause dur="0.4"/> # except that rather than <pause dur="0.8"/> prevalence of infection up the vertical axis i've got proportion of carriers <pause dur="0.5"/> but you can see there's low endemicity high endemicity and this unstable boundary between them <pause dur="1.5"/> okay <pause dur="2.6"/> and then suppose we had two communities which i've labelled P and Q <pause dur="2.5"/> and these two communities are high endemicity <pause dur="1.1"/> and it would look very much as though <pause dur="0.5"/> in terms of field investigation anyway that they have the same endemicity <pause dur="1.3"/> yeah in actual fact they might have very different basic reproduction numbers for some reason <pause dur="0.6"/> but <pause dur="0.5"/> you know you wouldn't be actually be able to tell because everyone's infected because of this positive feedback <pause dur="1.5"/> so let's come along and let's vaccinate <pause dur="0.5"/> mm <pause dur="2.5"/> <kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> at fifty per cent so what i'm doing now is all i'm vaccinating fifty per cent of all children that are born <pause dur="1.1"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> and what that does <pause dur="1.3"/> 
is to <trunc>ch</trunc> shift the <trunc>epidemi</trunc> shift the equilibrium <pause dur="1.3"/> and it shifts them all to the right <pause dur="0.9"/> yeah <pause dur="1.5"/> which you shouldn't be surprised about <pause dur="0.7"/> because that means that <pause dur="0.4"/> now you need a <pause dur="0.4"/> for any particular <pause dur="0.5"/> # value you need a higher R-zero for the for the virus to survive <pause dur="1.6"/> but interestingly <pause dur="0.4"/> it shifts the low equilibrium <pause dur="0.2"/> faster <pause dur="1.6"/> in other words you can't use vaccination <pause dur="0.5"/> to move a population from high endemicity to low endemicity <pause dur="3.5"/> because this low equilibrium moves out of the way faster <pause dur="1.2"/> so you can't drop down <pause dur="0.4"/> from here <kinesic desc="indicates point on slide" iterated="n"/> <pause dur="0.5"/> to there <kinesic desc="indicates point on slide" iterated="n"/> <pause dur="0.9"/> yeah <pause dur="2.4"/> what you can do though is to eradicate infection <pause dur="1.0"/> so in this case vaccinating at fifty per cent <pause dur="0.4"/> this population up <kinesic desc="indicates point on slide" iterated="n"/> here with a basic reproduction number of two <pause dur="0.5"/> yeah <trunc>i</trunc> <pause dur="0.4"/> numbers of carriers will go down <pause dur="1.0"/><kinesic desc="indicates point on slide" iterated="n"/> this population here <pause dur="0.2"/> the numbers of carriers <pause dur="0.3"/> will go down but they will only just cling on <pause dur="0.9"/> <kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> if i vaccinate at seventy per cent <pause dur="1.4"/> 
yeah <pause dur="0.3"/> then this population <kinesic desc="indicates point on slide" iterated="n"/> here with a basic reproduction number of one <pause dur="0.4"/> yeah <pause dur="1.7"/> we're now working on <kinesic desc="indicates point on slide" iterated="n"/> these lines <pause dur="0.7"/> would just <pause dur="0.5"/> drop down <pause dur="0.7"/> you will eradicate infection from that <kinesic desc="indicates point on slide" iterated="n"/> population <pause dur="0.4"/> but you won't eradicate it from <kinesic desc="indicates point on slide" iterated="n"/> this population because it's still got this <pause dur="0.4"/> high endemicity equilibrium supporting it <pause dur="2.2"/> mm <pause dur="4.1"/> does that make sense <pause dur="5.4"/> you're all too nervous about asking questions aren't you <pause dur="5.3"/> <vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" n="ss" dur="1"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> okay so the effect of the immunization is that lower equilibra move faster than upper equilibria <pause dur="0.2"/> they're all shifting to the right <pause dur="0.6"/> so we can't use immunization <pause dur="0.6"/> to change the endemicity <pause dur="1.2"/> yeah <pause dur="1.7"/> but it enhances the bistability <pause dur="0.4"/> so it increases the usefulness <pause dur="0.5"/> of chemotherapy against carriers <pause dur="5.1"/> i haven't <pause dur="1.6"/> necessarily shown that result <pause dur="0.3"/> but the effect of of looking at these two together <pause dur="0.7"/> yeah there is a synergy <pause dur="0.2"/> in both curing carriage and vaccination <pause dur="0.8"/> yeah which enhances both <pause dur="4.9"/> <kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> and i shall <kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> 
skip <pause dur="1.4"/> that picture <pause dur="1.2"/> mm <pause dur="11.2"/> okay so <pause dur="1.4"/> bringing things together to a conclusion <pause dur="3.0"/> because of this <pause dur="0.6"/> positive feedback effect and the age-related probability of becoming a carrier <pause dur="0.8"/> hepatitis B <pause dur="0.2"/> transmission dynamics contain <pause dur="0.7"/> potentially complicated <pause dur="0.3"/> and very non-linear features and by non-linear <pause dur="0.4"/> i mean that if you double R-zero you don't just double the amount of infection <pause dur="0.8"/> yeah <pause dur="0.6"/> if i were to halve <pause dur="0.5"/> the amount of contact i won't just halve the size of the public health problem <pause dur="1.3"/> and the small changes in environmental behaviour <pause dur="0.4"/> can have large consequences <pause dur="0.5"/> because of this feedback loop magnifying the effect of any differences <pause dur="1.9"/> and that immigration and and <pause dur="0.2"/> carriage cure or carriage infectiousness removal or <pause dur="0.5"/> whichever term you like <pause dur="1.2"/> are really public health problems or interventions <pause dur="0.7"/> they are <pause dur="0.7"/> # features of hepatitis B that we can actually use <pause dur="0.7"/> to help reduce the size of the problem <pause dur="0.7"/> and <pause dur="0.3"/> potentially bring in the possibility of eradication <pause dur="8.0"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> it 
also raises the question of how <pause dur="0.6"/> general is this type of mechanism <pause dur="1.3"/> mm <pause dur="1.0"/> for example tuberculosis shows a very similar <pause dur="0.4"/> geographical trends <pause dur="1.2"/> yeah from north to south <pause dur="1.5"/> is there something in <pause dur="0.5"/> tuberculosis transmission <pause dur="0.6"/> which <pause dur="0.5"/> creates the same effect <pause dur="1.2"/> yeah <pause dur="3.1"/> in fact it turns out that you can get very similar results <pause dur="0.6"/> if you <trunc>lo</trunc> include the effect of dose response <pause dur="0.3"/> in particular the higher the dose of infection you get <pause dur="0.6"/> the more likely you're to be infected <pause dur="0.7"/> and the higher the <pause dur="0.3"/> dose of infection that you give <pause dur="2.3"/> yeah so you can have you have that kind of dose response you can end up with the same positive feedback <pause dur="0.8"/> that in one community you can have <pause dur="0.2"/> high doses giving rise to lots of people spreading viruses that give high doses <pause dur="0.3"/> to lots of virus <pause dur="0.8"/> and in another community you don't have that positive feedback you just have some low level infection low doses <pause dur="0.5"/> means that people are only infectious with low doses <pause dur="0.7"/> yeah <pause dur="1.1"/> so a kind of dose effect <pause dur="0.4"/> can produce the same split <pause dur="1.5"/> 
yeah <pause dur="2.8"/> and one of my one of the third years is currently doing their project on <pause dur="0.7"/> looking at that effect <pause dur="0.6"/> # in particular for tuberculosis to whether there is a high-low dose split <pause dur="2.3"/> the other question general question is whether there's a role for demographic change <pause dur="1.6"/> now there is something called a demographic transition which i'll talk more about <pause dur="0.3"/> in <pause dur="0.4"/> B-P-H-D next year <pause dur="0.6"/> # for those who are interested <pause dur="1.1"/> and demographic transition <pause dur="0.2"/> is essentially the move from developing <pause dur="0.6"/> country demography <pause dur="0.5"/> to developed country demography <pause dur="0.7"/> and developing countries are typified by having <pause dur="0.6"/> lots of children <pause dur="0.4"/> yeah # <pause dur="0.5"/> perhaps fifty per cent of people in sub-Saharan Africa are under the age of fifteen <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> fairly large households <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> population growing <pause dur="0.9"/> to the <trunc>sti</trunc> state where we have in the developed world where we have far fewer children the population is by and large much older <pause dur="0.4"/> and households tend to be somewhat smaller <pause dur="1.9"/> well if there's a positive role <pause dur="0.2"/> or a strong role for hepatitis B 
transmission within households <pause dur="1.1"/> yeah and particularly the fact that children play this critical role in terms of becoming carriers for hepatitis B <pause dur="0.9"/> then changing the demography <pause dur="0.3"/> changing household size <pause dur="0.4"/> and reducing the numbers of children in the population <pause dur="0.4"/> <trunc>m</trunc> reducing birth rates <pause dur="0.3"/> may well have an effect on the epidemiology <pause dur="1.7"/> so perhaps the the transition from high to low endemicity <pause dur="0.4"/> goes along with the demographic change <pause dur="0.7"/> that occurs from developing to developed countries <pause dur="1.1"/> mm <pause dur="1.7"/> so i would love to be able to go back two-hundred years in the U-K <pause dur="0.3"/> and take some sera <pause dur="0.4"/> and to look for hepatitis B because <pause dur="0.8"/> i think there is a strong possibility that <pause dur="0.4"/> two-hundred a hundred years ago <pause dur="0.5"/> we were a high endemicity country of hepatitis B <pause dur="1.8"/> but <pause dur="0.3"/> and we've lost that over the past <pause dur="0.3"/> hundred years through the <trunc>dem</trunc> through the demographic transition <pause dur="0.7"/> # but i'll i won't be able to do that so that is idle speculation
