<u who="nm1346"><kinesic desc="overhead projector is on showing transparency" iterated="n"/>  what i just want to do <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> first of all is just sort of <pause dur="0.3"/> # recap <pause dur="0.9"/> # this is not actually a comprehensive list but the types of <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="1.9"/> things that we talked about so far in this course in terms of <pause dur="0.4"/> # quality systems <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> procedures that take place <pause dur="0.5"/> we talked about specifications <pause dur="0.3"/> the idea that when you produce product <pause dur="0.6"/> it's # to a specification that's # <pause dur="0.4"/> reasonably precise definition of what it is <pause dur="0.6"/> what the customers expecting to see 
 <pause dur="2.0"/> we talked about # H-A-C-C-P-S <pause dur="0.5"/> # hazards and # critical control point <pause dur="1.0"/> # <trunc> con </trunc> <trunc> con </trunc> <pause dur="0.3"/> hazards and critical <trunc> co </trunc> control points <pause dur="0.4"/> analysis <pause dur="0.4"/> and system analysis generally <pause dur="0.6"/> reviewing <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> features in terms of <pause dur="0.3"/> # efficiency features in terms of <pause dur="0.5"/> health and safety system <pause dur="5.8"/> you've heard <pause dur="0.3"/> particularly from people like # professor <gap reason="name" extent="2 word"/> about protocols <pause dur="0.8"/> # you sure of <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> protocols # <pause dur="1.3"/> think systems to # <pause dur="0.8"/> assist you with # <pause dur="0.5"/> meeting required standard <pause dur="3.0"/> something i 
 <trunc> per </trunc> perhaps haven't said a lot about is work instructions # and the idea here <pause dur="0.4"/> is we're talking about <pause dur="0.7"/> # written pieces of information how the job should be performed <pause dur="0.6"/> so really a written specification on how to do a job <pause dur="6.3"/> and then there's general general records of work <pause dur="0.5"/> # general records of where a product is at any particular time of what it's being treated with <pause dur="0.5"/> of whose worked on it <pause dur="3.0"/> and <pause dur="0.4"/> the types of records that we would associate with # quality control too <pause dur="3.6"/> now <pause dur="0.6"/> # the theme of today <pause dur="0.5"/> is auditing <pause dur="0.6"/> and <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> what i want to suggest you is that auditing really utilizes this type of accumulated 
information <pause dur="0.8"/> so the types of audits that we're talking about in <trunc> term </trunc> in terms <trunc> o </trunc> of quality management <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> # not sort of complete reviews of a system <pause dur="0.4"/> but rather reviews of the quality management systems that # <pause dur="0.4"/> support <pause dur="0.4"/> the way we produce our product <pause dur="4.3"/> and i'm also going to say a little bit in the session just to complete <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="1.8"/> the package in terms of quality management about benchmark <pause dur="1.0"/> that'll be just as a bit at the end before we have a break <pause dur="2.7"/> <kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> okay so what's what's what're the principles of auditing <trunc> wha </trunc> what is it <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> about <pause dur="2.1"/> 
well we're talking about the process <pause dur="0.4"/> of checking to see that we comply with a protocol or a system <pause dur="0.8"/> and so when # <pause dur="0.4"/> Professor <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> was here he described <pause dur="0.4"/> # Assured Produce Scheme in fact that's audited every year or so when <pause dur="0.8"/> when when # <gap reason="name" extent="2 word"/> was here he explained <pause dur="0.4"/> how <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> and <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> have a whole series of all this <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> <pause dur="0.4"/> he'd sort of review <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> wasn't it for <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> <pause dur="1.2"/> so what we're focusing on is is how we actually pick up a process how it's actually done <pause dur="1.6"/> and whenever it 
actually happens <pause dur="0.6"/> it should be based on agreed principles person doing the auditing <pause dur="0.6"/> shouldn't be criticizing the grower or producer <pause dur="0.7"/> something that they weren't aware they should be doing <pause dur="0.6"/> okay so auditing is always based on agreed principles <pause dur="1.4"/> it's not system analysis it's not looking for new things and new suggestions you can make about how things could be done <pause dur="0.4"/> it's it's checking something against <pause dur="0.5"/> an agreed system <pause dur="0.9"/> agreed principles <pause dur="2.6"/> and the type of auditing we are talking about today <pause dur="1.0"/> # in terms of quality management systems <pause dur="0.7"/> exams the management system <pause dur="0.2"/> rather than the process <pause dur="0.8"/> okay <pause dur="0.5"/> so i can say it's about 
growing tomatoes <pause dur="0.2"/> they're not looking in detail <pause dur="0.3"/> at the production system on the nursery they're looking at the <pause dur="0.2"/> management systems to support that the type of records that are being kept # <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> the type of information that's collated <pause dur="4.4"/> and <pause dur="0.8"/> generally # the whole purpose of audit <pause dur="0.6"/> # in really any context <pause dur="0.4"/> is to apply # to give some assurance of compliance to third parties <pause dur="0.5"/> and this'll be true for financial type audit as well we're not talking about financial auditing today we're talking about quality management of auditing <pause dur="0.7"/> but the idea is always that a third party's going to be satisfied with your system complies the standard that that they they're expecting to
 <pause dur="5.5"/> now i have suggested that a principle of auditing <pause dur="0.3"/> # is whatever outcome there is <pause dur="0.4"/> # should be published and agreed <pause dur="0.6"/> # by all those involved <pause dur="0.5"/> # by that i need to say it's not necessarily published to the general <pause dur="0.6"/> # # <pause dur="0.4"/> media or whatever <pause dur="0.6"/> but <pause dur="0.5"/> <trunc> y </trunc> you don't really have # it's not really <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> accepted protocol to complete audit or not giving any direct feedbacks to the organizations that's being audited and <pause dur="0.8"/> they should be noted <pause dur="5.3"/> and <pause dur="0.7"/> # audits only work <pause dur="0.8"/> if there is # some type of procedure to deal with issues of non-compliance <pause dur="0.6"/> if if your business is audited <pause dur="0.5"/> and # 
basically you're not doing very well <pause dur="0.4"/> there must be be some type of procedure there to address that <pause dur="0.8"/> # an audit which just simply tells you <pause dur="1.1"/> # gives you a simple grade <pause dur="0.5"/> # which might suggest you're not doing very well and lets you carry on doing what you're doing in any case is not going to be <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> particularly effective <pause dur="3.9"/> so the difference between # auditing and types of analysis we talked about previously in the course <pause dur="1.4"/> are that audits are there generally to maintain # rather than to develop standards <pause dur="1.0"/> okay you don't expect to really see a significant system improvement through audit it's there about maintenance <pause dur="1.3"/> # <pause dur="1.0"/> and recording what standards are being achieved 
rather than developing them <pause dur="0.5"/> directly in the first instance <kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> <pause dur="5.1"/> now within # schemes like Assured Produce Scheme like <pause dur="1.2"/> BOPP it's recognized that there are several <pause dur="0.3"/> levels of auditing <pause dur="3.0"/> and # <pause dur="0.7"/> most basic level of auditing is self auditing where you actually checking for yourself what you're doing <pause dur="0.9"/> now <pause dur="0.5"/> this <pause dur="0.2"/> # is something which <pause dur="0.3"/> # i have been quite interested in # for some <pause dur="0.4"/> time # by by self here i mean extremely <pause dur="0.3"/> # <trunc> p </trunc> personalized auditing <pause dur="0.9"/> in your # handout <pause dur="0.4"/> i've actually # <pause dur="0.2"/> given you a sheet <pause dur="1.5"/> which actually didn't 
actually come up very well in the # powerpoint so it is actually separate <pause dur="0.6"/> and <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> what it is is actually # a self audit <kinesic desc="holds up sheet" iterated="n"/> <pause dur="0.6"/> # that # we use on <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> it's used on <gap reason="name" extent="2 word"/> <pause dur="1.6"/> # which is <pause dur="0.3"/> # <kinesic desc="holds up sheet" iterated="y" dur="2"/> what i ask <pause dur="0.6"/> # people to complete periodically not after every job they do but periodically to review <pause dur="0.5"/> how well a possible job's been done <pause dur="0.8"/> so # really this just gives you an idea the type of immediate first hand audit that <pause dur="0.4"/> any employee this has might might do it's basically a checklist <pause dur="0.5"/> and it actually describes <pause 
dur="0.8"/> # the idea behind it <pause dur="0.6"/> and the question in here is you should be able to give definitive yes or no answers <pause dur="0.5"/> so when it's # point five for example it's # <pause dur="0.4"/> <reading> correct and clean pots and containers used </reading> <pause dur="0.5"/> it might sound obvious but it has been a problem <pause dur="0.4"/> # on this nursery before <pause dur="0.3"/> and someone's got to simply say yes i've checked it's right <pause dur="0.4"/> well they'll soon realize it's not <pause dur="0.5"/> and obviously that's quite an important issue <pause dur="1.0"/> so the idea is <pause dur="0.3"/> that # you can actually definitively say <pause dur="0.4"/> yes or no that's a good principle of auditing to be to <trunc> ac </trunc> to be able to make some type of definitive statement <pause dur="2.3"/> and then in fact 
there're three columns which i won't describe in detail <kinesic desc="indicates point on sheet" iterated="n"/> but the purpose of these columns is <pause dur="0.4"/> # to basically describe the significance of non-compliance <pause dur="0.7"/> okay so one is something that would be totally non-acceptable and has to be dealt with immediately two is something you wouldn't want to have happen again and three is well it's happened but it's not a big issue <pause dur="0.4"/> okay that's a basic outline of what happens there <pause dur="1.3"/> and so the way the system's used at <gap reason="name" extent="2 word"/> <pause dur="1.7"/> is that # periodically <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> and not necessarily because jobs are going particularly well or particularly badly <pause dur="0.4"/> but just simply so that people continually review what they're doing 
 <pause dur="0.9"/> # <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> might complete this new job that they've just done <pause dur="0.9"/> and then it's reviewed <pause dur="0.6"/> # with their supervisor they do it for themselves interview with a supervisor <pause dur="0.6"/> so the exercise actually has a training function too <pause dur="0.3"/> it actually allows us to identify if somebody understands why they're doing <pause dur="0.4"/> what they're doing <pause dur="4.5"/> the next sort of level up <pause dur="0.3"/> # is what you might regard or might describe as an internal audit <pause dur="0.3"/> an internal audit is where an organization's looking at itself quite critically <pause dur="0.7"/> hopefully quite objectively <pause dur="0.5"/> and # is making up its own mind about whether it's complies with systems that it's meant to be <pause dur="0.4"/> # complying 
with <pause dur="2.1"/> and when you do this within a company <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> what you may well do is have the manager of one section <pause dur="0.5"/> # visit another section <pause dur="0.6"/> so that # there's a degree of objectivity <pause dur="0.6"/> because there's an old saying familiarity breeds contempt <pause dur="0.4"/> maybe checking the work you're doing <pause dur="0.4"/> yourself for yourself <pause dur="0.4"/> # there's a very good chance that you don't actually <pause dur="0.4"/> # notice what's obviously wrong <pause dur="0.9"/> so critical internal auditing is <pause dur="0.6"/> it is a business checking itself but ideally <pause dur="0.3"/> you have somebody not directly involved with the operation <pause dur="0.4"/> # auditing it and checking it's <pause dur="0.4"/> it's complying with <pause dur="0.5"/> # the requirements and 
schemes of the system <pause dur="8.1"/> the next level i would suggest is the sort of thing we've been talking a lot about on this course and that's # independent scheme schemes like the Assured Produce Scheme <pause dur="0.4"/> and it's # sort of equivalent in the ornamental sector <pause dur="0.4"/> which is BOPP <pause dur="0.8"/> <trunc> b </trunc> British Ornamental Plant Producers Scheme <pause dur="0.3"/> i haven't talked a lot about BOPP so far on this course because <pause dur="0.3"/> the main emphasis has been # with # <pause dur="0.4"/> the Assured Produce Scheme as a model <pause dur="4.4"/> and then finally and <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> # <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> made this clear # <pause dur="0.3"/> back in week # <pause dur="0.3"/> three <pause dur="1.3"/> on top of all the these types of processes which businesses might 
indulge themselves in <pause dur="0.9"/> from their own prospective for their own sake <pause dur="0.9"/> you might also expect a customer audit <pause dur="1.4"/> # <pause dur="1.0"/> which and which is <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> i'm here not just simply talking about # large multiple retailers looking at <pause dur="0.4"/> their <pause dur="0.3"/> growers suppliers for example <pause dur="0.5"/> i'm talking about growers themselves <pause dur="0.8"/> perhaps going to look at their suppliers <pause dur="0.6"/> because <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> if <pause dur="0.2"/> schemes like the Assured Produce Scheme <pause dur="1.0"/> # work well <pause dur="2.0"/> producers can assure # <pause dur="0.4"/> that their # <pause dur="1.0"/> customers <pause dur="1.4"/> that anything's in order because they will themselves audited their supply 
chain <pause dur="0.4"/> just think for a minute about this Sudan One issue that's in the media at the moment <pause dur="0.4"/> what's gone wrong there is that in the food processing industry <pause dur="0.6"/> # there wasn't enough supply chain <pause dur="0.5"/> auditing people won't checking <pause dur="0.3"/> their suppliers <pause dur="0.3"/> were they using # legal ingredients or not <pause dur="0.8"/> so customer auditing isn't just about multiple retailers looking <pause dur="0.3"/> at growers it's about growers looking at their suppliers as well <pause dur="0.3"/> and being confident that they're complying <pause dur="0.4"/> with the standards that are required <pause dur="0.7"/> </u> <u who="sf1347" trans ="pause"> would customers usually <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> an advance notice of <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> or

to know whether they got it right or wrong <pause dur="0.4"/> and it's really surprising actually when we introduced that system <pause dur="0.7"/> # it was because <pause dur="0.4"/> a lot of people making a lot of mistakes we weren't expecting them to <pause dur="0.6"/> and # it was because somehow <pause dur="0.5"/> you know it's surprising even some of the most experienced staff still haven't understood why they're doing something <pause dur="0.3"/> and haven't realized the problem with not doing it the way that <pause dur="0.3"/> we would like to be done <pause dur="1.7"/> <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> </u> <u who="sf1349"> # # yeah <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> imagine you're doing internal self audit </u> <u who="nm1346"> yeah </u> <u who="sf1349"> do you actually incorporate in terms of feedback systems that you would expect to <pause dur="0.4"/>

 <pause dur="0.2"/> # # <pause dur="0.6"/> coming back to to your point here <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> one of the issues about auditing is this idea of being sort of <unclear> play </unclear> cold in a way and objective <pause dur="0.5"/> <trunc> a </trunc> and # <pause dur="0.3"/> in deed <pause dur="0.4"/> # certainly the way that # # # <pause dur="1.1"/> the professional is seen to be trained it it isn't in a particular communicative <pause dur="0.4"/> # # technique that they use in the first instance <pause dur="0.6"/> the key thing is to be impartial and objective <pause dur="0.4"/> and to form <trunc> judge </trunc> form a really a judgement more or less on the spot where you got a lot of the evidence to hand <pause dur="0.7"/> there is specialist training in doing a title of auditing that's required by the likes 
of # Assured Produce Scheme <pause dur="0.7"/> and you may or may not be aware that # here at <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> we've got something # known as <pause dur="0.3"/> <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> Scientific Services Limited which is <pause dur="0.3"/> # a <trunc> c </trunc> a commercial <pause dur="0.3"/> # body <pause dur="0.4"/> and they specialize in providing # training for auditors <pause dur="0.9"/> and the and the training is extremely # precise in terms of conduct and attitude <pause dur="0.4"/> as well <pause dur="5.4"/> now <pause dur="0.5"/> with something like the Assured Produce Scheme which is trying to audit <pause dur="1.2"/> a very large process as in producing <pause dur="0.3"/> # fruit or vegetable <pause dur="0.5"/> you can't look at every detail in business <pause dur="0.4"/> so when your audits are <pause dur="0.3"/> drawn up <pause dur="0.5"/> 
and when they're executed what the auditor is doing is focusing on what are regarded as key performance indicators <pause dur="1.1"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> for example <pause dur="0.3"/> # something simple like tidiness <pause dur="1.3"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> tidiness in itself is aesthetically quite good <pause dur="0.7"/> but generally people accept that there's # there's some sort of correlation between tidiness and organization <pause dur="1.2"/> okay how organized <pause dur="0.4"/> you are and what you're doing <pause dur="0.6"/> so <pause dur="0.6"/> # some of the issues that looked at <pause dur="0.3"/> can be a little bit cryptic <pause dur="0.6"/> but # they're regarded nonetheless as being a good indicator of how that business operates <pause dur="5.3"/> now <pause dur="0.5"/> you can't look at every operation that's actually happened in the 
enterprise in detail <pause dur="0.5"/> so <pause dur="0.2"/> what an auditor will do <pause dur="0.2"/> will <pause dur="0.6"/> # he'll he'll look at sample issues he'll look at for example <pause dur="0.3"/> # a particular batch of tomatoes in a packhouse <pause dur="0.3"/> look at how they've been labelled <pause dur="0.2"/> and see if you can actually <pause dur="0.2"/> trace them all the way back to the person that actually picked them and perhaps the person who has the responsibility for growing the plant <pause dur="1.0"/> so <pause dur="0.2"/> the technique is based on sampling <pause dur="0.6"/> relatively random sampling <pause dur="1.2"/> # <pause dur="1.8"/> and <pause dur="1.3"/> very core to to all of these schemes is this concept of <pause dur="0.4"/> traceablity <pause dur="0.7"/> this idea that <pause dur="0.6"/> # when a consumer a 
final consumer buys a product <pause dur="0.6"/> and let's say <pause dur="0.3"/> by some misfortune it is contaminated <pause dur="0.7"/> that retailer can go back to that supplier <pause dur="0.4"/> and find out <pause dur="0.6"/> at which <pause dur="0.5"/> point <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> or rather <pause dur="0.4"/> during the whole production process who would've handled it <pause dur="0.7"/> okay and then you can start to identify <pause dur="0.4"/> # how the contamination happened <pause dur="0.9"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> # prevent it from happening again <pause dur="2.2"/> and indeed it is true to say <pause dur="0.3"/> # i know many of you not all of you <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> at least those in part two have been to <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> Nursery <pause dur="0.5"/> 
they have a system there <pause dur="0.5"/> where <pause dur="0.5"/> you can if you buy # a pack of peppers in in a <pause dur="0.4"/> supermarket <pause dur="0.9"/> they can actually tell you who picked that pepper <pause dur="1.4"/> off off the plant <pause dur="0.5"/> a very precise <pause dur="0.7"/> # data management system <pause dur="0.5"/> # that's that's how that's the level of accuracy it can work to <pause dur="0.2"/> i'm not saying it always does but it's designed to work at that level of accuracy <pause dur="7.2"/> because an audit only happens in one instance in anything from about six months to two years in schemes that we talked about <pause dur="1.0"/> one of the things that the auditor's trying to do <pause dur="0.4"/> is to believe that the arrangements he sees are long term <pause dur="0.9"/> he doesn't want to see that 
they've been applied <pause dur="0.5"/> just before he's turned up <pause dur="0.5"/> and he wants to believe that they've got continuity for the future <pause dur="2.0"/> and hence <pause dur="0.5"/> that's why # <pause dur="0.9"/> #when <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> was here you know he talked about i don't know # # # an audit for a multiple retailer # which might involve looking to see if there's dust behind posters and things to see if it's just been put up <pause dur="0.3"/> that is the type of thing auditors do do <pause dur="0.2"/> because they're looking for the permanency and sustained auditing system <pause dur="0.5"/> they mustn't believe it's just been done because they've arrived <pause dur="10.7"/> if you are actually conducting an audit <pause dur="0.2"/> <trunc> qu </trunc> quite often the issues that you will need <pause dur="0.3"/> 
# immediate reference sources on <pause dur="0.4"/> and a good example is pesticides pesticides as we know very critical to <pause dur="0.4"/> # # <pause dur="0.8"/> the the whole concept of Assured Produce Scheme <pause dur="0.3"/> that's largely one of the reasons why it was created <pause dur="0.8"/> and so for example one of the areas an auditor would look at in more detail is pesticide store <pause dur="0.4"/> and he needs to be very authoritative as to whether materials you can see in there <pause dur="0.7"/> are legal or not <pause dur="0.6"/> and so he'll probably carry with him <pause dur="0.5"/> sufficient reference sources for him to make on the spot judgement about that <kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> <pause dur="7.2"/> right <pause dur="0.2"/> # what i thought i would do because it could become extremely dry just talking 
about auditing i thought i'd actually show you <pause dur="0.4"/> # # <pause dur="0.3"/> something about what a BOPP audit would look like if if if <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.9"/> nurseries like you saw last week were being audited now by BOPP <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.9"/> what what with the inspector what would the auditor rather actually # look at <pause dur="0.4"/> and <pause dur="0.4"/> # i'm going to show you some pictures in due course but first of all <pause dur="0.4"/> # just a basic summary <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> get you to do <pause dur="0.2"/> # in an office phase of the # audit <pause dur="6.7"/> # it's going to basically # verify that the management records he expects to see in place are there <pause dur="0.5"/> and <pause dur="0.6"/> quite close to the top of his list would be risk assessments <pause dur="0.6"/> 
okay <pause dur="0.6"/> # we talked about health and safety we talked about the concept of needing to identify <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.8"/> any any risks that can be associated with a job and any steps that might need to be taken to minimize <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> that risk <pause dur="0.4"/> and there should be if your business has more than six employees <pause dur="0.3"/> there should be a a record of that indeed if you are in one of the schemes we're talking about there needs to be a <trunc> wri </trunc> written record of that to prove it actually happened <pause dur="2.4"/> they'll be looking at policy documents and things like health and safety kind of environmental policy <pause dur="0.5"/> # equal opportunities <pause dur="0.5"/> they need to see that the business has actually worked out how it approaches these these 
issues and what it's doing about them <pause dur="6.4"/> they'll be looking for # and again i'm being specific here to to # to BOPP they'll be looking for <pause dur="0.4"/> # a quality manual <pause dur="0.4"/> or at least a comprehensive range of written work procedures <pause dur="0.4"/> the definitive <pause dur="0.6"/> guide to how operations occur on that enterprise <pause dur="4.8"/> and they'll also be looking for evidence of supplier audits <pause dur="0.5"/> now <pause dur="0.6"/> the BOPP scheme <trunc> pr </trunc> # <pause dur="0.2"/> has <pause dur="0.3"/> a very thorough audit <pause dur="0.9"/> and in fact if you subcontract production <pause dur="0.3"/> to other growers they'll expect the same standards to be applied <pause dur="0.3"/> # to the subcontractors <pause dur="0.6"/> they'd also like to see how you're auditing your 
suppliers in things like <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> substrates pots <pause dur="0.9"/> labels <pause dur="0.8"/> because <pause dur="0.4"/> a scheme like BOPP isn't so much about # safety it's about assurance that the supplier's capable of delivering the product <pause dur="1.6"/> and if you don't understand <pause dur="0.4"/> the process by which your pots labels substrates come to you <pause dur="0.5"/> there's every chance <pause dur="0.3"/> you might <trunc> s </trunc> suggest <pause dur="0.4"/> that you could have a situation that where stuff doesn't turn up one day <pause dur="0.7"/> and you've got no idea why that could happen <pause dur="0.9"/> okay <pause dur="0.8"/> so it's about assurance of ability to deliver sometimes as much as anything else <pause dur="6.0"/> and then the other thing that # the auditor'll probably look for in the office are 
the crop and stock records the the things that # <pause dur="0.2"/> offer the <pause dur="0.3"/> ability to <pause dur="0.2"/> # trace <pause dur="0.5"/> the # progress of the product through the system <pause dur="0.4"/> and allow traceability <pause dur="0.4"/> after the product's been sold as well <pause dur="3.9"/> </u> <u who="sf1347" trans ="pause"> do they expect to have a <trunc> p </trunc> paper record whenever i've worked in other industries they've always wanted a paper </u> <u who="nm1346"> yeah and </u> <u who="sf1347" trans="overlap"> trail rather than in an electronic so that you can prove <u who="nm1346" trans="overlap"> it should be </u> <u who="sf1347" trans="overlap"> <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> yesterday </u> <u who="nm1346"> yes yes they do </u> <u who="sf1347"> which is a problem <gap reason="overlap" extent="1 sec"/> </u> <u who="nm1346" trans="overlap">

 <u who="nm1346" trans="overlap"> yeah yeah and so in this stage you'll get guidance to how you actually achieve compliance <pause dur="0.8"/> but you've got to you have to say a lot of it is there <pause dur="0.4"/> to enable an audit to take place <pause dur="0.8"/> and a question which's just coming out of this is hold on a minute isn't this all a bit onerous <pause dur="0.4"/> and the answer is yes <pause dur="0.2"/> why do you think there're so many technical managers in commerce now it's actually to manage this type of activity to a large extent <pause dur="5.9"/> okay i'm going to drop the lights a little bit here 'cause i'm going to show you a few slides of what actually <pause dur="9.0"/> <event desc="turns off lights" iterated="n"/> # what i actually want to looked at # on a on an audit around this nursery which again is <gap reason="name" extent="2 word"/> 
 <pause dur="0.8"/> one of the obvious places they went to was they look at the chemical store <event desc="puts on transparency" iterated="n"/> # <pause dur="0.8"/> # because this issue of pesticide state of course is <trunc> q </trunc> is quite critical <pause dur="0.6"/> # the types of things they expect to see <pause dur="0.2"/> # will be if the area where chemicals are stored is clearly <pause dur="0.5"/> labelled # <pause dur="1.1"/> if you have # a lot of # a lot of certain different nationality on in your on your site <pause dur="0.2"/> # they expect to see that <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> labelling in all relevant languages so <pause dur="0.3"/> # that's a a step that a lot of the nurseries are addressing at the moment 'cause # they're getting extremely multicultural environments <kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="n"/> 
 <pause dur="2.5"/> looking a bit further in store <pause dur="0.4"/> pesticides you know in our industry are a very critical issue <pause dur="0.5"/> <kinesic desc="indicates screen" iterated="y" dur="unknown"/> and so they'd be going right through the # pesticide cabinet probably and just checking everything there is legal <pause dur="0.7"/> that is the type of thing which a lot of these audits are covering in quite acute detail <pause dur="4.0"/> <kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="n"/> now # there are quite a few records that are associated with with # <pause dur="0.5"/> pesticide application <pause dur="0.4"/> but they would need to see up to date <pause dur="0.5"/> # and comprehensive records of # sprays that've been applied to crops and they'd <pause dur="0.3"/> need to believe that there're sufficient detail <pause dur="0.4"/> for <pause dur="0.5"/> 
# <pause dur="0.8"/> the <pause dur="1.7"/> # the grower to be able to retrospectively # confirm perhaps what crop had been treated with <kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="n"/> <pause dur="3.3"/> of course there is a large degree of legal compliance <pause dur="0.5"/> # in that issue as well <pause dur="1.8"/> most assurance schemes <trunc> adv </trunc> advocate and promote <pause dur="0.4"/> # I-P-M <pause dur="1.8"/> # Integrated Pest Management <pause dur="0.3"/> <kinesic desc="indicates screen" iterated="y" dur="5"/> and so # most protocols now <pause dur="0.4"/> will <pause dur="0.2"/> # # <pause dur="0.3"/> involve <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> standards in terms of pest monitoring <pause dur="0.7"/> and <kinesic desc="indicates screen" iterated="y" dur="2"/> so in BOPP <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> 
what <kinesic desc="indicates screen" iterated="y" dur="3"/> what they need to see is that you actually have # <pause dur="0.2"/> a system <pause dur="0.2"/> for for regular analysis of of pest levels <pause dur="0.5"/> we all know about sticky traps <kinesic desc="indicates screen" iterated="y" dur="10"/> i'm sure <pause dur="0.4"/> # this is the system which i presume most of you are familiar with <pause dur="0.4"/> whereby <pause dur="0.4"/> the sticky trap <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.8"/> has four sheets of paper over it and you peel off a sheet <pause dur="0.6"/> every week so you use it for four weeks <pause dur="0.4"/> and monitor # <pause dur="0.4"/> pest outbreaks across a four week period <pause dur="3.0"/> <kinesic desc="indicates screen" iterated="y" dur="9"/> this is this this is like a key indicator <pause dur="0.6"/> 
to to an auditor can they see this type of system in place <pause dur="0.4"/> everywhere that they go to <pause dur="0.3"/> if they can they can believe <pause dur="0.3"/> that probably <pause dur="0.5"/> # a good I-P-M regime's <pause dur="0.2"/> is in place <pause dur="0.7"/> and when they look at a trap like this <pause dur="0.3"/> <kinesic desc="indicates screen" iterated="y" dur="7"/> if they've all just been put up that day it looks like they've been put up for the audit <pause dur="0.4"/> but if if they all have a history of pest <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> upon them then clearly it's a system that's been running for some time <pause dur="1.6"/> <kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> when it comes to # mechanized equipment <pause dur="0.5"/> they're going to be looking for # evidence that # there's adequate safety notice <pause dur="1.9"/> 
# <pause dur="0.2"/> in this case actually we have got # a bilingual system in actual fact <pause dur="0.5"/> <unclear> no this isn't the quite same because in </unclear> two languages <pause dur="2.0"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> <kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> i put this one in because i i # <pause dur="0.4"/> was a bit frustrated about this particular issue <pause dur="1.3"/> we're looking here at a # <pause dur="0.6"/> fridge <pause dur="0.4"/> <kinesic desc="indicates screen" iterated="y" dur="8"/> and i store all my <trunc> s </trunc> semen actually in fridges <pause dur="0.6"/> which which is quite good 'cause i don't hold on to it for very long <pause dur="0.7"/> but actually # <pause dur="10.0"/> i i failed on audit here because i didn't have records of temperatures inside the fridge <pause dur="1.2"/> okay <pause dur="0.3"/> so 
that's the type of standards that schemes are actually <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> they are working too <kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> <pause dur="5.3"/> and there'll be <pause dur="0.4"/> they'll be overviewing <kinesic desc="indicates screen" iterated="y" dur="unknown"/> the entire <unclear> section </unclear> of the operation just looking for general standards of hygiene cleanliness <pause dur="0.4"/> and and basic organization <pause dur="1.3"/> # <pause dur="2.0"/> before an audit <pause dur="0.8"/> you do basically want to make sure your areas are as clean as possible <pause dur="0.7"/> and <pause dur="0.3"/> anything that is not used you want to make sure it's stored properly as well <pause dur="1.4"/> so <kinesic desc="indicates screen" iterated="y" dur="3"/> <pause dur="0.2"/> # it's now routine <pause dur="0.3"/> on 
this nursery to actually # make sure <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> <kinesic desc="indicates screen" iterated="y" dur="4"/> the # <pause dur="1.9"/> compost filling machines <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> machine <pause dur="0.2"/> # are always covered over <pause dur="0.5"/> # when they're not in use because there'll always be some waste <trunc> com </trunc> compost in there <pause dur="0.2"/> which is probably getting dry and could spoil future use <pause dur="7.7"/> <kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> climate control is an <trunc> in </trunc> is a critical part of the protective crop production <pause dur="0.4"/> so another good sort of performance indicator that <pause dur="0.2"/> that that a company is managing its climate very carefully <pause dur="0.3"/> will be how their aspirating screens are <kinesic desc="indicates screen" iterated="n"/> 
positioned <pause dur="0.9"/> # if you are actually doing a job properly <pause dur="0.2"/> you might expect it to have some reasonable proximity to <pause dur="0.2"/> the plants that you're <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="2.2"/> you're actually growing <pause dur="5.6"/> <kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> most assurance schemes as well # <pause dur="0.4"/> will be concerned <pause dur="0.3"/> at # what business are doing to minimize the <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> potential <pause dur="0.4"/> # occurrence of of of pollution environmental pollution <pause dur="0.8"/> and so <pause dur="0.3"/> # in most schemes you will find <pause dur="0.4"/> that <pause dur="0.2"/> # there's a requirement for any oil storage <pause dur="0.2"/> <kinesic desc="indicates screen" iterated="y" dur="9"/> to be in bunded 
storage tanks <pause dur="0.4"/> by bunded i mean that what we got here <pause dur="0.2"/> is a system where oil is stored in a tank that is inside a tank <pause dur="0.9"/> so if the inner tank was to rupture <pause dur="0.5"/> the contents wouldn't just spill out into the <pause dur="1.0"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> into into the # <pause dur="0.8"/> <kinesic desc="indicates screen" iterated="n"/> water system <pause dur="1.5"/> that it can actually <pause dur="0.2"/> <kinesic desc="indicates screen" iterated="n"/> hold <pause dur="0.4"/> # a leak <pause dur="0.4"/> it's what we call bunded tank <pause dur="0.7"/> an interesting thing here <pause dur="0.5"/> here is that # in terms of legal compliance <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> farms are excluded from needn't # necessarily have a bunded tank seems a bit bizarre in a way 'cause they seem to be 
 <pause dur="0.4"/> the type of place where you might well get an oil leak <pause dur="0.7"/> # but the assurance schemes that we've looked at <pause dur="0.4"/> # most of them <pause dur="0.4"/> would require <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.8"/> the operation to keep its oil stored in bunded tanks <pause dur="0.8"/> <kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> the alternative <pause dur="0.5"/> and this is # something that # <pause dur="2.4"/> is being addressed in the nursery <pause dur="1.0"/> concerned is to having a unbunded tank so this is just a normal <pause dur="0.3"/> # storage tank <pause dur="0.4"/> <kinesic desc="indicates screen" iterated="y" dur="unknown"/> and if that was to # get ruptured <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> drive into them <pause dur="0.3"/> there would be # an oil spillage incident <pause dur="0.3"/> and the 
environment agency would now have to get involved because chances are it would soon end up in a water course <kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> <pause dur="3.7"/> okay so that basically # # <pause dur="0.9"/> is what i want to say about auditing i've tried to give you an idea of physically what it might involve in the process <pause dur="0.2"/> it's involved <pause dur="1.2"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> just one thing i want to cover off really # before i finish <trunc> th </trunc> the sort of key quality management systems <pause dur="0.7"/> # i just want to say a little bit more about benchmarking <pause dur="2.2"/> # because it is a slightly different issue to anything we've talked about before <pause dur="0.5"/> before and it is very much # <trunc> th </trunc> <trunc> th </trunc> the sort of # <pause dur="0.2"/> widely accepted concept <pause dur="1.2"/> so while we're 
talking about benchmarking what we're talking about is # comparisons and performance between businesses businesses sharing <gap reason="inaudible" extent="2 sec"/> # looking at how well they are performing in terms of efficiency perhaps <pause dur="0.8"/> or perhaps in terms of outlets as well <pause dur="2.8"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> an example from the U-K ornamentals industry is something called Nursery Business Improvement Scheme # <pause dur="0.6"/> which is ruled by a horticultural trades association <pause dur="0.5"/> and in that particular scheme <pause dur="0.5"/> businesses actually <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> submit quite detailed financial data <pause dur="0.5"/> to a third party <pause dur="0.5"/> that then <pause dur="0.2"/> # interprets that data in a way that it can be shared with other members of the scheme <pause dur="0.9"/> and in 
fact <pause dur="0.3"/> there's a <pause dur="0.4"/> great deal of honesty # involved in a scheme like that <pause dur="0.5"/> and there're many producers that wouldn't want to get involved <pause dur="0.7"/> because they wouldn't want to share some of their <pause dur="0.2"/> costs with the other other businesses <pause dur="0.6"/> you tend to find that the larger a business is <pause dur="1.0"/> the more reserved it is about that type of information 'cause large businesses often benefit from extremely low costs from suppliers <pause dur="0.6"/> and they would jeopardize this investment <gap reason="inaudible due to noise from audience" extent="1 sec"/> if they were to publish exactly how much they were paying <pause dur="1.5"/> but benchmarking can also look at <pause dur="0.6"/> # the physical performance of a business <pause dur="0.2"/> efficiency

from a business perspective <pause dur="1.2"/> # <pause dur="0.9"/> there's there's really two two <pause dur="0.3"/> types of <pause dur="0.3"/> # training issue <pause dur="0.6"/> firstly there's immediate on the job training <pause dur="0.5"/> basically enabling somebody to do what you're asking them to do <pause dur="0.6"/> # showing them how to do the job <pause dur="2.0"/> and then there's the more strategic <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> what we call in this country vocational training <pause dur="1.0"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> which actually # is formalized <pause dur="1.0"/> you you wouldn't typically wait for someone to be # formally trained before they could do a job <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="1.9"/> apart from in certain circumstances like forklift driving and pesticide application <pause dur="0.3"/> i'm thinking here though of more general <pause dur="0.2"/> 
# formal qualifications <pause dur="5.4"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> just a just a general sort of # <pause dur="1.3"/> thought really <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="1.0"/> nowadays # in commerce we talk about <pause dur="0.3"/> human resource management # H-R management <pause dur="0.4"/> which # is good <pause dur="0.4"/> but <pause dur="0.2"/> # sometimes <pause dur="0.6"/> it seems to me that <pause dur="0.3"/> in a way it's # this whole idea of H-R management <pause dur="0.6"/> is actually potentially dehumanizing <pause dur="0.8"/> # the workplace <pause dur="0.6"/> # because it's almost taking making <pause dur="0.5"/> # what people are doing and sort of clinically categorizing it does that sort of make sense <pause dur="0.4"/> and i think that is a bit of risk <pause dur="0.2"/> when we when we # <pause dur="0.6"/> you know 
sometimes we talk about these issues that # we just you know it can be a bit clinical just talking about people as a component of the production system <pause dur="0.7"/> now that's not the intention generally <pause dur="0.4"/> but i've been to a lot of seminar's about training in the workplace and that's how sometimes it's ended up sounding <pause dur="0.4"/> so i'm just pointing out that's a bit of risk <pause dur="0.3"/> # 'cause we are talking about people here <pause dur="3.7"/> now # <pause dur="0.3"/> this # you don't need to worry about looking at this 'cause i've given it to you on your handout # <pause dur="1.0"/> if you look at # <pause dur="0.3"/> i think it's probably the last sheet i gave you <pause dur="3.5"/> # it's the same same detail <pause dur="0.5"/> but there's quite a lot of confusion now in the U-K at least about # how qualifications <pause dur="0.3"/> 
relate to each other <pause dur="0.5"/> and i do want to just briefly <pause dur="0.3"/> # actually give you some detail <pause dur="0.5"/> about # <pause dur="0.3"/> where they all fit in <pause dur="0.8"/> firstly i want to suggest to you in the U-K and across Europe there are similar sort of # principles <pause dur="0.4"/> we have <pause dur="0.3"/> # what we call the vocational qualifications which are typically workplace based <pause dur="0.2"/> and done by people actually working in an enterprise <pause dur="1.7"/> academic qualifications like <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> we have here and then there are certain qualifications which seem to me at least to come <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> broadly speaking into the middle <pause dur="1.7"/> and then starting on the vocational side the government has identified <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="1.0"/> 
achievement levels <pause dur="0.2"/> # one to five <pause dur="0.7"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> these are <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> first of all <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> what we call in the U-K <pause dur="0.2"/> national vocational qualifications N-V-Qs <pause dur="1.4"/> but these achievement levels should have parallels <pause dur="0.3"/> across the other <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.9"/> qualification systems too <pause dur="1.3"/> and so <pause dur="0.3"/> # the basic idea really of # vocational qualifications <pause dur="0.6"/> is that N-V-Q one and N-V-Q level two <pause dur="0.7"/> are workplace based <pause dur="0.9"/> # qualifications <pause dur="0.6"/> where people in a workplace <pause dur="0.5"/> ideally or they may go # to college or they <trunc> m </trunc> be be based at college <pause dur="1.8"/> # the idea 
is you can achieve this in a workplace <pause dur="0.7"/> and N-V-Q level one and level two <pause dur="0.3"/> there're aimed very much at the general employee <pause dur="0.3"/> okay so it's they are qualifications which anybody in the prospective business that their that their qualification's covering it might be commercial horticulture for example <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> <trunc> w </trunc> potential benefit <pause dur="0.4"/> from receiving that level of of of # training and achieving that type of qualification being a business <pause dur="0.4"/> and an individual's strategic interest <pause dur="1.7"/> N-V-Q level three across all industries is aimed at <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> supervisors really <pause dur="0.5"/> at team leaders and supervisors <pause dur="0.7"/> and then N-V-Q level four and N-V-Q level five <pause dur="0.6"/> 
# are moving on to <pause dur="0.4"/> junior and senior management level <pause dur="0.4"/> # qualifications <pause dur="1.8"/> so in the U-K we have N-V-Qs there are <pause dur="0.3"/> similar equivalents around Europe <pause dur="0.4"/> and we have them arranged into <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> five levels <pause dur="0.7"/> and there are # <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="2.2"/> # # <pause dur="0.2"/> other professional qualifications which perhaps <pause dur="0.3"/> go beyond the level five <pause dur="0.5"/> and are generally recognized as being perhaps a step further and things like # diploma from the institute of management <pause dur="0.4"/> and # <pause dur="0.7"/> similar qualifications <pause dur="2.0"/> and then we have the academic qualifications <pause dur="2.4"/> # # and <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> at level two equivalent <pause dur="0.5"/> 
# we've got things like G-C-S-Es and you can do a G-C-S-E in horticulture or rural skills <pause dur="1.4"/> # along with other G-C-S-Es at the same time and there're equated to the sort of level two on workplace qualification <pause dur="0.7"/> at level three which is a supervisory level qualification the sort of equivalent is <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> A levels <pause dur="0.9"/> # you can do A level horticulture although very few colleges <pause dur="0.5"/> # offer it <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> many of you will have done A level botany <pause dur="1.0"/> and then B-S-C within the <pause dur="0.2"/> # general scheme of things <pause dur="0.7"/> is identified at being <pause dur="0.2"/> at <pause dur="1.3"/> level four or arguably # into # level <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> five <pause dur="1.0"/> and the N-S-C <trunc> w </trunc> 
might be quoted to <pause dur="0.4"/> to to level five <pause dur="0.7"/> the idea is then that <pause dur="1.2"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> with the this sort of scheme of thinking <pause dur="0.8"/> in a workplace <pause dur="0.3"/> you might # achieve a similar level of achievement <pause dur="1.5"/> to what you might do through a purely academic route <pause dur="0.5"/> okay there are different types of achievement <pause dur="0.6"/> but the achievement might nonetheless be recognized as being <pause dur="0.7"/> at a similar level <pause dur="0.8"/> does that make sense <pause dur="1.0"/> # got a few intermediate qualifications in the U-K <pause dur="0.6"/> and a lot of these are organized by a body called Edexcel <pause dur="0.7"/> # and <pause dur="0.2"/> they're known as # <pause dur="0.4"/> things like # first diplomas and national diplomas <pause dur="1.5"/> and i have 
fitted them into the picture too <pause dur="1.6"/> and the other sort of # <pause dur="0.3"/> <trunc> co </trunc> # complicating # factor of things like first degrees <pause dur="0.9"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> you could have argued a first degree <pause dur="0.4"/> is probably # a level three type of qualification <pause dur="0.6"/> which then <pause dur="0.6"/> # might be converted <pause dur="0.4"/> ultimately into a <pause dur="0.5"/> full degree by going to the final year of a full degree course <pause dur="1.4"/> so it's quite a quagmire of <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> qualifications in the U-K <pause dur="0.5"/> but the idea of this chart is to give you some idea of equivalents and where they how they <pause dur="0.3"/> actually <pause dur="0.7"/> # relate to each other <pause dur="1.0"/> has anyone got any questions about that <pause dur="1.0"/> </u> <u who="sf1348" trans ="pause"> 
is a first degree equivalent to an # a foundation degree </u> <u who="nm1346"> sorry i meant a foundation degree <pause dur="0.3"/> sorry <pause dur="0.3"/> you corrected me there <pause dur="0.6"/> when i said that and as a first degree i meant foundation degree thank you <pause dur="3.6"/> okay <pause dur="2.8"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> but from a <pause dur="0.2"/> from a business prospective <pause dur="0.9"/> this is the route you'd probably send your employees down <pause dur="0.3"/> and the type of qualification you would finance them <pause dur="0.6"/> # to do while they were working with you <pause dur="4.0"/> <kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> now <pause dur="2.8"/> when it comes to # training programs <pause dur="3.5"/> from a business perspective <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> what basically # # <pause dur="0.3"/> do you expect do do you need to have
 <pause dur="1.0"/> well <pause dur="0.5"/> the first thing <pause dur="0.4"/> if you're a businessman paying for an employee to be trained <pause dur="1.7"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> <trunc> o </trunc> or looking at the <pause dur="0.2"/> management <trunc> ov </trunc> overall management checking the employees <pause dur="0.3"/> what are at every stage your clear objectives <pause dur="1.3"/> in academic qualifications <pause dur="0.3"/> we're about developing the individual <pause dur="0.4"/> about giving them as broad a perspective <trunc> o </trunc> on issues as possible <pause dur="0.6"/> but from a business prospective <pause dur="0.6"/> you want clear objectives that meet <pause dur="0.5"/> # clear <pause dur="0.4"/> criteria that suit the business <pause dur="4.0"/> another major issue is that <pause dur="0.2"/> the training comes in manageable components 
 <pause dur="1.0"/> so in business <pause dur="0.4"/> yes we like to <trunc> ap </trunc> to apply training within some sort of formal structure that's got to fit in with <pause dur="0.3"/> requirements of someone getting on and doing their job as well <pause dur="0.4"/> so that training can't happen at a time of a year when people are <pause dur="0.2"/> particularly busy <pause dur="3.9"/> and like all good training programs this is not just due to businesses we want assessable outcomes <pause dur="0.8"/> and it's actually <trunc> a </trunc> amazes me actually how much training is still out there without any assessable outcome <pause dur="0.4"/> there any clear <pause dur="0.3"/> indication as to what's been achieved <pause dur="8.0"/> there's quite an issue # <pause dur="0.4"/> especially with N-V-Qs <pause dur="0.6"/> about the verification of standards because the 
idea is the N-V-Q is a workplace based qualification that you can achieve in your workplace <pause dur="1.0"/> but you get big nurseries and small nurseries good nurseries and bad nurseries <pause dur="0.4"/> and how do these standards all relate to each other <pause dur="0.7"/> and so if somebody moves from one business to another <pause dur="0.4"/> and again with an N-V-Q <pause dur="0.5"/> in one business is that still relevant in the next business they might move to <pause dur="0.3"/> it's quite a complex area <pause dur="0.5"/> and so we have <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> quite an industry <pause dur="0.3"/> actually <pause dur="0.4"/> about <pause dur="0.2"/> making sure <pause dur="0.3"/> that # standards are verified that they interrelate to each other <pause dur="0.5"/> # # and business to business as well <pause dur="5.9"/> the other thing # <pause dur="0.2"/> 
that you would expect to see within a # a training programme is # is a qualification process obviously <pause dur="0.5"/> and that's what may well be verified <pause dur="3.3"/> and whatever does come out of it you want to be as widely recognized as possible <pause dur="0.9"/> not just by <pause dur="0.5"/> # within the business <trunc> b </trunc> <trunc> b </trunc> by the employees but also perhaps by your customers <pause dur="0.9"/> # as well as the world at large <pause dur="3.0"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> # i i mentioned # <pause dur="0.4"/> N-V-Qs but there are other <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="1.4"/> # training programmes that the industry have devised to meet its own # <pause dur="0.2"/> purposes <pause dur="0.5"/> one example is # from the <trunc> h </trunc> Horticultural Trades Association the Plant Care Awards <pause dur="0.5"/> this is a # a series of 
awards that's used by # garden centres actually <pause dur="0.4"/> to actually <pause dur="0.4"/> # # <pause dur="0.6"/> raise the level of plant care <pause dur="0.6"/> on garden centres <pause dur="0.5"/> and i have to say some really need it <pause dur="0.6"/> so <pause dur="0.2"/> the <pause dur="0.6"/> # it's an industry based award <pause dur="0.6"/> but but it actually # <pause dur="3.8"/> # it meets a lot of the criteria just discussed <kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> <pause dur="5.0"/> do you have a few thoughts about how <pause dur="1.0"/> training is to be managed <pause dur="2.2"/> and <pause dur="1.2"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> really the pivotal pivotal process in in <pause dur="0.8"/> managing the training of employees <pause dur="0.6"/> and the type of thing which also come into <pause dur="0.2"/> # some of the audits that we talked about <pause dur="0.5"/> 
# # <pause dur="0.2"/> is a job appraisal <pause dur="0.8"/> okay the process of discussing with the employee <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="1.4"/> their progress <pause dur="0.9"/> and to a certain extent <pause dur="0.6"/> their performance <pause dur="0.5"/> of what can be done to <pause dur="0.2"/> improve it <pause dur="0.5"/> and develop it <pause dur="2.4"/> because <pause dur="0.4"/> from that process <pause dur="2.3"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> what you should be able to do is to develop some sort of training plan some sort of strategy to take <pause dur="0.2"/> that individual <pause dur="0.6"/> and through that individual the business forward <pause dur="3.4"/> there is a bit of # an issue which businesses have to address though <pause dur="0.2"/> because if you're a business paying for training <pause dur="0.8"/> what you're trying to do is #
 <pause dur="0.3"/> develop a business primarily <pause dur="1.4"/> as well as to develop the individual <pause dur="0.7"/> and you have to work out some sort of balance here because actually <pause dur="0.2"/> a lot of training <pause dur="0.3"/> # doesn't necessarily directly contribute to business performance <pause dur="0.6"/> directly but it might well contribute to that person's motivation <pause dur="1.4"/> so <pause dur="0.3"/> it's bit of a fine balance it's bit of it's bit of a delicate art <pause dur="0.8"/> and it's interesting actually <pause dur="0.5"/> # in practice i've found <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> working on nurseries <pause dur="0.5"/> that it can be very contentious <pause dur="0.5"/> if one if if a certain individual's been seen to be offered more opportunity particularly that which can't be related to their job and 
another <pause dur="0.3"/> it can be can become a source of grievance <pause dur="5.4"/> now it is # <pause dur="0.2"/> a difficult business getting the balance right <pause dur="0.6"/> and in the U-K <pause dur="0.7"/> # we had a scheme called Investors in People <pause dur="0.9"/> have <pause dur="0.53"/> have many of you heard of this <pause dur="1.5"/> </u> <u who="su1357" trans ="pause"> yeah <pause dur="0.5"/> </u> <u who="nm1346" trans ="pause"> okay <vocal desc="laugh" iterated="n"/> some of you will have worked in businesses where that's been achieved <pause dur="0.6"/> # but basically # <trunc> th </trunc> the object of Investors in People is that <pause dur="0.6"/> <trunc> i </trunc> <trunc> i </trunc> it basically it's it's a <pause dur="1.2"/> scheme which again is audited <pause dur="1.0"/> # <pause dur="0.8"/> and it examines <pause dur="1.3"/> # the

did you get it <pause dur="3.2"/> how many of you are still in the game <pause dur="1.5"/> now it's about half of you <pause dur="1.0"/> okay <pause dur="0.9"/> so <pause dur="0.2"/> # i'll give you another one in a moment but the point is that # we have seven digits seven <pause dur="0.5"/> okay <pause dur="0.5"/> string of seven <pause dur="0.7"/> # details <pause dur="0.7"/> and it's interesting isn't it <pause dur="0.3"/> we're we're very bright people and we're starting to get things <pause dur="0.6"/> wrong <pause dur="0.3"/> okay just <trunc> trans </trunc> just translate that into the workplace situation somebody's first day at work <pause dur="0.5"/> okay <pause dur="0.3"/> how many things are you going to be told <pause dur="0.6"/> probably often in a one string <pause dur="1.0"/> and how much of that is going to get remembered <gap reason="inaudible multiple speakers"/> 
there's context there's reinforcement it's true there is some slight difference i would i would agree okay there's ways of breaking to up but we can talk more about that in terms of # <pause dur="0.8"/> how often do supervisors say for example <pause dur="0.3"/> i want you to take this from here to there to do that to it and then take it to here and then there and <pause dur="1.6"/> then somebody's trying to do it and they started to try to remember what they've just been told is the point i'm making <pause dur="0.5"/> it happens very very easily <pause dur="1.0"/> </u> <u who="sf1347" trans ="pause"> also <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> once you've been told it you don't then you use it for a few days that's when it usually <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> </u> <u who="nm1346"> that doesn't help either yeah for those of you that want to i'll give you a 
bigger number <vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" n="ss" dur="1"/> well i've had # <vocal desc="laugh" iterated="n"/> i better not <pause dur="1.2"/> <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> </u> <u who="su1357"> no don't say that <vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" n="ss" dur="1"/> </u> <u who="nm1346"> no i will then in that case </u> <vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" n="ss" dur="1"/> <u who="su1357"> good </u> <u who="nm1346"> okay for those of you still in the game i will just give you a quick number and you can see if you can get it <pause dur="1.6"/> okay <pause dur="1.2"/> two <pause dur="0.3"/> eight <pause dur="0.4"/> six <pause dur="0.5"/> four <pause dur="0.5"/> three <pause dur="0.4"/> nine <pause dur="0.3"/> five <pause dur="0.3"/> one <pause dur="12.1"/> <kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> did anyone get that <pause dur="4.0"/> well you're 
very clever <vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" n="ss" dur="5"/> anyway the point i'm making is is often a <trunc> ca </trunc> is is often lot of frustration in workplace about about # # inducting new people yeah you're not going to get that i'm not even going to give it to you <pause dur="3.0"/> okay the point i'm just making then in terms of workplace training comes back to a lot of the issues we talked about in terms of familiarizing staff with new procedures et cetera <pause dur="1.5"/> <kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> but an information string of more distinct <trunc> o </trunc> <pause dur="0.5"/> of more than six distinct components is liable to misinterpretation <pause dur="0.8"/> okay given it all at once it <pause dur="0.4"/> depends on the type of information depends how it's reinforced as well <pause dur="0.6"/> 
but it is liable to to misinterpretation <pause dur="0.5"/> and that actually also comes back as to why for example we use <pause dur="0.6"/> # for <trunc> examp </trunc> # i showed you machinery we showed you you <pause dur="0.4"/> know operating procedures on the machine itself for example <pause dur="0.7"/> because people can actually <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> easily become confused <pause dur="3.4"/> and <pause dur="0.6"/> # so from what i've just said <reading> even the most basic new tasks can be better assimilated if accompanied by a written instruction </reading> <pause dur="1.5"/> and again we talked about you know is it a good idea to have written work instructions isn't that a bit onerous <pause dur="0.4"/> but the point <pause dur="0.2"/> # i'm making here is that actually they could also be useful <pause dur="0.7"/> okay it could solve some of 
the problems that we've just been talking about <pause dur="0.3"/> already on this course <pause dur="6.0"/> and when we're talking about training what we've got to do is be careful to break down information into <pause dur="0.2"/> manageable parts <pause dur="3.0"/> that's what # <pause dur="0.3"/> <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> in learning <pause dur="3.2"/> there's a few other points to just bear in mind <pause dur="1.1"/> whenever you're telling <trunc> any </trunc> anybody anything <pause dur="0.2"/> or trying to instruct <pause dur="1.1"/> the most important <trunc> poi </trunc> <pause dur="0.4"/> points in your presentation are going to be the beginning and the end <pause dur="0.5"/> those are the bits that actually get remembered <pause dur="0.5"/> the most distinctly <pause dur="5.4"/> and # most people have an optimum attention span of about 
twenty minutes <pause dur="0.5"/> and actually this is a real issue i have with a lot of of managers on the nursery <pause dur="0.54"/> 'cause they sometimes run <pause dur="0.4"/> training sessions actually last about two hours <pause dur="0.7"/> okay 'cause that's the sort of regular working time <pause dur="0.9"/> and you're just going to waste a lot of that time because their attention won't be held <pause dur="0.8"/> that's why i like to put a break in the middle of our <pause dur="1.2"/> sessions which last two hour well one hour fifty minutes <pause dur="0.7"/> maximum <pause dur="0.8"/> because actually <pause dur="0.5"/> # the efficacy of that session's going to be improved <pause dur="0.5"/> if we put a break in the middle of it <pause dur="4.2"/> and <pause dur="0.6"/> # it's true though actually you can use some devices to make interesting or <pause dur="0.3"/> 
# interesting <pause dur="0.5"/> # if there's any notional stimulus then people are more likely to be fully involved <pause dur="1.1"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> not something you can apply very much in a workplace context <pause dur="0.4"/> but unless <pause dur="0.5"/> # # <pause dur="0.3"/> worth bearing in mind <pause dur="1.0"/> okay i've given a very quick overview of training issues 'cause it seem pertinent to cover it in a context of this course <pause dur="0.4"/> as i say we've now finished the key quality management component <pause dur="1.0"/> next week # i will be looking at financial management <pause dur="0.3"/> and in week <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="1.7"/> ten <pause dur="0.5"/> # which is <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> the last # # <pause dur="0.2"/> Thursday of term of course <pause dur="0.4"/> # what i'm actually going to look at is is more 
communication issues and <pause dur="0.5"/> # networking <pause dur="0.3"/> personal networking issues just to give you an idea of <trunc> wh </trunc> what's to follow <pause dur="0.8"/> i'm going to finish here <pause dur="0.5"/> # but one thing i am going to do <pause dur="0.4"/> # which won't be part of the lecture <pause dur="0.5"/> # it's i am just going to take any questions about the assignment particularly from the M-S-Cs <pause dur="0.6"/> # 'cause i'm getting a lot of questions still coming through about how to cover that assignment <pause dur="0.6"/> and in case there needs to be an opportunity for everyone to hear everything <pause dur="0.4"/> i'm going to do that <pause dur="0.2"/> but otherwise <pause dur="0.6"/> # i've finished with <pause dur="0.4"/> with group as a whole for now <pause dur="0.6"/> okay <pause dur="0.5"/> so <pause dur="0.3"/> thanks for that and i'll see you # again on Thursday </u> </body> </text> </TEI.2>
