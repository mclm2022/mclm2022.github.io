why do eighty-two year olds take overdoses his wife said there were financial problems the business had gone bankrupt <pause dur="0.4"/> and you know i'm sure if he goes to I-T-U <pause dur="0.5"/> and <pause dur="0.7"/> stays there for a couple of weeks and survives he won't be very happy with us <pause dur="0.2"/> because # i'm pretty sure he wanted to die he <pause dur="0.3"/> he took # an overdose three years ago <pause dur="0.5"/> and i don't know why i'm telling you this <pause dur="0.3"/> but biscuits yeah <pause dur="0.2"/> so if you make people better <pause dur="0.6"/> they buy you biscuits <pause dur="0.4"/> and that's why i brought some along this morning just to # remind you what medicine was all about in my opinion it's about <pause dur="0.4"/> biscuits <pause dur="0.4"/> # biscuits because <pause dur="0.2"/> people are generally happy when they make you better <pause dur="0.9"/> # very important when you're looking after a patient to specify what type of biscuits you want <pause dur="0.5"/> otherwise you just get bog standard old rubbish from <pause dur="0.4"/> <trunc>s</trunc> <pause dur="0.4"/> ASDA or somewhere like that <vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" n="ss" dur="1"/> so you must specify at the start <unclear>when you go and see</unclear> exactly what biscuits you want <pause dur="0.5"/> Marks and Spencer's <pause dur="0.2"/> every time <pause dur="0.5"/> <vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" n="ss" dur="1"/> okay <pause dur="0.2"/> so # <pause dur="0.9"/> it's not just about biscuits though # <pause dur="0.3"/> it's actually quite good <pause dur="0.4"/> making people 
better and # <pause dur="0.3"/> you're wondering what on earth this has got to do with acute renal failure well i'm <pause dur="0.2"/> getting round to it in my long and convoluted way <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> making people better is good <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> i've been doing it for nearly twenty years and it still gives me a buzz when you <pause dur="0.4"/> leave the hospital at <unclear>like</unclear> <pause dur="0.3"/> eight ten o'clock <pause dur="0.3"/> whenever you leave the hospital <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> you do know it's not a nine to five job don't you <pause dur="0.4"/> you do know that you are aware of that <pause dur="0.5"/> <vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" n="ss" dur="2"/> and # <pause dur="0.5"/> just to get that imprinted in your brains at an early stage <pause dur="0.3"/> and # your careers will not progress <pause dur="0.7"/> if you consider it a nine to five job <pause dur="0.7"/> #<pause dur="0.9"/> don't think that has changed either <pause dur="0.4"/> but when you leave the hospital at eight ten o'clock at night and <pause dur="0.6"/> a patient or <pause dur="0.4"/> more often the relative of a patient grabs your hand <pause dur="0.3"/> and says thank you doctor you saved <pause dur="0.3"/> my life or my husband's life or my wife's life <pause dur="0.4"/> that still gives you a kick even twenty years later <pause dur="0.5"/> and # <pause dur="0.7"/> one of the ways in which kidney doctors get a 
kick <pause dur="0.6"/> is <pause dur="0.5"/> the handshake when you've <pause dur="0.3"/> got somebody through acute renal failure <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.8"/> i think it's possibly because <pause dur="0.6"/> from the patient's perspective acute renal failure's a bit like a dream <pause dur="0.4"/> and # they know they're ill they don't know how ill they are <pause dur="0.2"/> they usually nearly meet their maker <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> and if they get better <pause dur="0.2"/> they don't quite know what's happened but they know something very bad has happened and in fact most <pause dur="0.2"/> body systems failure <pause dur="0.5"/> patients don't remember they're that ill whether it's respiratory failure cardiac failure or renal failure <pause dur="0.4"/> obviously my specialty's kidneys <pause dur="0.5"/> acute renal failure <pause dur="0.4"/> # like most failures is very bad for you <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> it's probably got a near hundred per cent mortality if you do nothing <pause dur="0.9"/> and you'll notice on on the handout have you all got a handout <pause dur="2.0"/> there is a handout <pause dur="0.3"/> anybody <pause dur="0.3"/> put your hands up if you haven't got a handout okay <pause dur="0.6"/> you'll see <pause dur="0.2"/> # fact number one at the top of your handout is kidney failure's very bad for you <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> even in two-thousand-and-three 
fifty per cent of people died <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> and that hasn't really improved since the nineteen-sixties <pause dur="1.5"/> so <pause dur="0.7"/> hundred per cent or nearly hundred per cent die if you do nothing fifty per cent die if you do something so there's not a great strike rate <pause dur="0.4"/> # there aren't too many handshakes and there aren't that many biscuits but you must specify on your biscuits <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="1.4"/> just let's talk a little bit <pause dur="0.3"/> # about <pause dur="0.3"/> a few words and and the word failure <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> traditionally in in talks such as this you don't start with outcomes you start with definitions and <pause dur="0.3"/> standard things like that but i thought <pause dur="0.9"/> the outcome of acute renal failure is so bad i thought you'd better know it is so bad <pause dur="0.5"/> because a lot of people <pause dur="0.2"/> think oh it's all right have a bit of dialysis they all get better <pause dur="0.2"/> and that that really isn't true even with dialysis the <pause dur="0.5"/> mortality's fifty per cent <pause dur="0.4"/> so the word failure let's have the lady in <kinesic desc="indicates member of audience" iterated="n"/> pink at the back there <pause dur="0.6"/> tell me 
about the the word failure and what do you think the patients <pause dur="0.2"/> what's your <pause dur="0.6"/> <trunc>me</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> what's your understanding of the word and and what do you think the patient's perception is </u><pause dur="0.4"/> <u who="sf0510" trans="pause"> that it's not working any more </u><pause dur="0.3"/> <u who="nm0504" trans="pause"> yeah <pause dur="0.2"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> how much is it not working </u><pause dur="0.6"/> <u who="sf0510" trans="pause"> quite a bit </u><pause dur="0.4"/> <u who="nm0504" trans="pause"> quite a bit <pause dur="0.3"/> and patients normally perceive the word failure to mean complete failure <pause dur="0.3"/> you know <pause dur="0.2"/> if you say your car has failed that means it doesn't drive <pause dur="0.7"/> or <pause dur="0.2"/> the <pause dur="0.2"/> washing machine has failed it means it doesn't work and you can't put your clothes in the washer any more <pause dur="0.3"/> and if you use the word failure <pause dur="0.5"/> and if you think about it i think you've probably already started to use the word failure has anybody <pause dur="0.5"/> seen a patient yet and those that the F word come out has anybody said <pause dur="0.3"/> heart failure <pause dur="0.5"/> congestive cardiac failure <pause dur="0.3"/> and <trunc>ha</trunc> has anybody said that in front of a patient <pause dur="0.7"/> lady in pink <kinesic desc="indicates member of audience" iterated="n"/><kinesic desc="nods head" iterated="n" n="sf0571"/> nodding there anybody else <pause dur="0.3"/> said the word failure <pause dur="0.5"/> with a patient around them <pause dur="2.0"/> read in the notes said oh i

outside your body <pause dur="1.1"/> and <pause dur="1.2"/> <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="2"/> that's why i've written on your handout there is a concept of true volume depletion <pause dur="1.7"/> now a more important concept <pause dur="0.7"/> <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="5"/> is relative <pause dur="0.7"/> volume depletion <pause dur="1.8"/> relative volume depletion is a bit harder to understand but is a <trunc>nic</trunc> <pause dur="0.3"/> an example of it is heart failure as the gentleman said at the back <pause dur="0.8"/> and by relative volume depletion what i mean <pause dur="0.3"/> is fluid in the wrong compartment <pause dur="0.4"/> and heart failure is a classic example <pause dur="0.2"/> you've got fluid around your ankles <pause dur="0.2"/> you've got low blood pressure your heart doesn't work <pause dur="0.2"/> you can't pump <pause dur="0.5"/> blood or plasma or anything round your body <pause dur="0.5"/> and you are <pause dur="0.2"/> intravascularly dry you are volume deplete <pause dur="0.4"/> but the treatment is not to give them more fluid because they they've got an excess of fluid anyway <pause dur="0.8"/> so you have this rather odd situation where you can be <pause dur="0.4"/> if you like generally overloaded with extra <pause dur="0.2"/> water in the body but it's 
in the wrong place <pause dur="0.5"/> so it's not in the <pause dur="0.2"/> intravascular compartment where it should be <pause dur="0.9"/> so this <pause dur="0.4"/> it's quite difficult to get your head around an idea where you can be both wet and dry at the same time and you say well <pause dur="0.2"/> you can't you know you can't be black and white at the same time <pause dur="0.4"/> you can't be fast and slow at the same time and <pause dur="0.8"/> but in terms of fluid shifts <pause dur="0.3"/> you can be both actually <pause dur="0.2"/> it's taken me a long time to realize this i used to think you <trunc>ha</trunc> you you've got to be <pause dur="0.2"/> wet or dry but you can be both <pause dur="0.8"/> it depends how you get your head around it <pause dur="0.4"/> # you could say the purist would say <pause dur="0.4"/> of course that somebody who is fluid overloaded due to heart failure or liver failure or any other failures <pause dur="1.1"/> is not dry <pause dur="0.3"/> they can't be dry because they've got ankle swelling and they've got fluid in the lungs but the you can be intravascularly dry <pause dur="0.5"/> and peripherally wet <pause dur="0.9"/> and the body's reaction is the same which is often acute renal failure <pause dur="1.6"/> why is this why am i rabbiting on about this so much

and put them in the trolley <pause dur="0.5"/> that was the only bit i liked about it <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="1.3"/> <vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" n="ss" dur="1"/> okay <pause dur="0.4"/> treatment # <pause dur="0.6"/> i <pause dur="1.8"/> i know the <shift feature="voice" new="laugh"/>second half <shift feature="voice" new="normal"/>of this talk is meant to be about treatment and # <pause dur="0.5"/> partly because we've only got five minutes to go <pause dur="0.3"/> and and partly <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> i don't think it's nearly as important <pause dur="0.5"/> as what i've talked about so far <pause dur="0.4"/> i'm not going to go into it in any massive detail <pause dur="0.4"/> other than to say <pause dur="0.2"/> the key decision <pause dur="0.3"/> is the <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="3"/> D decision <pause dur="0.7"/> in other words <pause dur="0.5"/> do they need dialysis or don't they <pause dur="0.7"/> and that's a decision that i make on a daily basis <pause dur="0.6"/> and it's not that complicated <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> the books will list hundreds of indications for dialysis there are only two remember i said <trunc>ear</trunc> earlier on in the lecture <pause dur="0.4"/> there are only two important clinical features <pause dur="0.2"/> hyperkalaemia <pause dur="0.2"/> and <unclear>fluid</unclear> overload <unclear><trunc>i</trunc></unclear> <pause dur="0.7"/> and the <pause dur="0.2"/> only indications or absolute indications for dialysis are hyperkalaemia unresponsive to medical management <pause dur="0.5"/> and <pause dur="0.4"/> fluid 
overload unresponsive to medical management yeah i've listed a few others there <pause dur="0.3"/> two-A i've written down as acidosis <pause dur="1.3"/> so having said that sometimes we do dialyse people for rather obscure reasons particularly on an I-T-U <pause dur="0.3"/> if on an I-T-U <pause dur="0.2"/> situation somebody's got a creatinine of two-hundred <pause dur="0.2"/> a urine output of <pause dur="0.2"/> forty mls a minute <pause dur="0.9"/> they're going into renal failure <pause dur="0.2"/> but they don't really need dialysis but we know tomorrow we may want to give them a lot of fluid for some reason <pause dur="0.3"/> or we may want to give them an angiogram <pause dur="0.3"/> which is nephrotoxic <pause dur="0.3"/> or tomorrow we may want to give them T-P-N or N-G-P <pause dur="0.3"/> we may dialyse people for rather odd reasons but but <pause dur="0.4"/> most of the time they are the only two absolute reasons for dialysis <pause dur="0.8"/> i don't think it's necessary that <pause dur="0.2"/> you <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> go into how we dialyse in any great detail <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> just <pause dur="0.4"/> it's much more important you understand the physiology and the pathophysiology <pause dur="0.3"/> and the indications for dialysis <pause dur="0.5"/> the technicalities you'll learn later you put a 
tube in the neck you attach them to a whirly <pause dur="0.2"/> it isn't much more complicated than that <pause dur="1.3"/> # <pause dur="1.6"/> finally finally <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> who should be managing people with renal failure i've said that <pause dur="0.6"/> twenty thirty per cent of people coming into hospital have a raised creatinine <pause dur="0.7"/> and there must be <pause dur="0.8"/> between fifty and a hundred people coming to the <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> every day <pause dur="0.3"/> so a lot of them will have a raised creatinine can they all be referred to the renal team <pause dur="0.6"/> please no <pause dur="0.5"/> i hope not <pause dur="0.5"/> that's one of the points of this lecture that you're going to be managing people <pause dur="0.2"/> where when the cause of renal failure is obvious and when you can reverse it <pause dur="0.5"/> easily <pause dur="0.9"/> it's when it starts to get tricky you need to call the cavalry <pause dur="1.5"/> and <pause dur="0.3"/> fortunately # in <pause dur="0.4"/> <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> and <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> we have a reasonable cavalry i'm one of six nephrologists and there's one that's on every day of the year including Christmas Day including New Year's Day <pause dur="0.7"/> and <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.8"/> if you're having problems call there's no point in <trunc>tr</trunc> being a hero you get 
no medals for being a hero in medicine <pause dur="0.4"/> just because you can manage <pause dur="0.2"/> a case of Wegener's granulomatosis on your own as a house officer <pause dur="0.2"/> out in <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> <pause dur="0.8"/> it doesn't mean you should <pause dur="0.5"/> and i think if you have anybody with any major body system failure and you can't reverse it quickly <pause dur="0.2"/> you can't identify the cause quickly you should be seeking help <pause dur="0.2"/> and if you're in a hospital without a renal unit such as <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> <pause dur="0.3"/> Nuneaton et cetera <pause dur="0.2"/> you need to be <pause dur="0.2"/> ringing the <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> <pause dur="0.2"/> and asking for advice from a renal registrar or renal consultant <pause dur="0.6"/> and that's true of of <trunc>a</trunc> any <pause dur="0.3"/> major body system failure <pause dur="1.4"/> okay <pause dur="0.7"/> that's it <pause dur="0.5"/> questions <pause dur="1.8"/> <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> <pause dur="3.5"/> not too many <trunc>anec</trunc> anecdotes <pause dur="0.4"/> and only one bollocks <pause dur="0.2"/> sorry </u><pause dur="1.8"/> <u who="nf0569" trans="pause"> can i just say anybody here who hasn't signed the register can you do so <pause dur="2.9"/> i don't know whether they are either they must be somewhere </u><pause dur="2.3"/> <u who="nm0504" trans="pause">
