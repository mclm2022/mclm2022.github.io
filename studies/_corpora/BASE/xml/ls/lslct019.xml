<u who="nm0285"><kinesic desc="projector is on showing slide" iterated="n"/> as as some of you will know i'm very much concerned <pause dur="0.2"/> actually <pause dur="0.2"/> that <pause dur="0.3"/> medical research should involve people <pause dur="0.5"/> # as as subjects of the research and obviously particularly patients <pause dur="0.4"/> as subjects of research and <pause dur="0.6"/> # i sometimes say slightly derogatory things about <pause dur="0.4"/> tissue culture and animal models of <trunc>s</trunc> and so forth <pause dur="0.3"/> of course these have their place <pause dur="0.3"/> but ultimately if we're going to understand human disease <pause dur="0.4"/> then we have to work with human patients <pause dur="0.6"/> <vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/> and that means that we have to get ethical approval <pause dur="0.5"/> # for such research <pause dur="0.3"/> now ethical approval for work with patients <pause dur="0.3"/> actually is fairly simple compared with ethical approval for working with animals <pause dur="0.4"/> as some some people have found out <pause dur="0.4"/> and getting ethical approval from a research ethics committee <pause dur="0.5"/> is actually rather easier <pause dur="0.3"/> in some <trunc>s</trunc> some ways <pause dur="0.3"/> than coping with your local R and D committees again <pause dur="0.4"/> some people who work in the hospital will well know <pause dur="1.4"/> so what i'm going to do today is talk a 
little bit about the background <pause dur="0.4"/> # of research medical research ethics <pause dur="0.5"/> # i shall talk about the sort of <pause dur="0.3"/> way in which <pause dur="0.6"/> # medical <pause dur="0.3"/> research is <pause dur="0.2"/> controlled in this country <pause dur="0.3"/> and i shall go on and talk in a bit more detail about the actual way in which you organize <pause dur="0.4"/> # a proposal so that it gets approved by the medical research ethics committee <pause dur="0.6"/> # and i shall <pause dur="0.3"/> point out some of the pitfalls <pause dur="0.5"/> okay so my qualifications for doing this <pause dur="0.3"/> are as you see i'm actually the vice-chairman of the <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> of the local <pause dur="0.3"/> research ethics committee <pause dur="0.6"/> # also as you <pause dur="0.5"/> i'm sure you know <pause dur="0.3"/> # i've been much involved in medical research over some years now <pause dur="0.5"/> and my research has exclusively dealt with <pause dur="0.3"/> with people <pause dur="0.3"/> # research into disease using # <pause dur="0.2"/> human subjects <pause dur="1.4"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> so <pause dur="0.8"/> why do we need to regulate <pause dur="0.3"/> medical research now to most of us <pause dur="0.3"/> that would seem seem absolutely self-evident <pause dur="0.5"/> but <pause dur="0.3"/> take ourselves back fifty years <pause dur="0.3"/> and it wasn't nearly so self-evident <pause dur="0.4"/> # but you've come a long way since the time <pause dur="0.3"/> of 
<vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/> # the last <pause dur="0.3"/> <trunc>f</trunc> # the Second World War <pause dur="0.3"/> if anybody has any <pause dur="0.6"/> doubt <pause dur="0.3"/> about why we <pause dur="0.6"/> need to regulate medical research i'll just mention these two names <pause dur="0.5"/> Mengele and Tuskegee Mengele <pause dur="0.7"/> was a German who carried out some rather frightful <pause dur="0.5"/> # experiments with people in concentration camps and so on <pause dur="0.9"/> # i'm not quite sure what happened to him i'm i'm fairly sure that he went through the Nuremberg Trials and didn't survive <pause dur="0.6"/> Tuskegee <pause dur="0.6"/> you may not have heard about Tuskegee <pause dur="0.4"/> is actually not a man <pause dur="0.3"/> it's a place it's a place in the United States of America <pause dur="0.4"/> # where over a period of some decades <pause dur="0.4"/> a group of # American Africans <pause dur="0.4"/> with syphilis were left untreated <pause dur="0.5"/> # although there were perfectly acceptable perfectly good treatments available at the time <pause dur="0.3"/> so that the natural history <pause dur="0.2"/> development of the disease could be studied <pause dur="0.4"/> now obviously <pause dur="0.2"/> those are rather extreme examples <pause dur="0.4"/> but # those that have been looking into the press and listening to <pause dur="0.3"/> issues 
in the N-H-S over the last few years <pause dur="0.2"/> know perfectly well <pause dur="0.2"/> that there is an ongoing <pause dur="0.3"/> # problem not so much problem ongoing concern <pause dur="0.3"/> with medical research ethics you will remember <pause dur="0.3"/> # <vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/> the <pause dur="0.2"/> fuss about the <pause dur="0.6"/> organs of children that were retained at # Liverpool <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> a fairly recent example and there are still major repercussions <pause dur="0.3"/> of these sorts of events <pause dur="0.5"/> particularly i mean the <trunc>availa</trunc> the availability of <pause dur="0.3"/> # <trunc>ch</trunc> # paediatric tissue for research <pause dur="0.3"/> so <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> you're nodding your head just then there <pause dur="0.3"/> was that a <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> </u><u who="sm0286" trans="overlap"> <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/></u><pause dur="0.6"/> <u who="nm0285" trans="pause"> # and others <pause dur="0.2"/> again will know <pause dur="0.4"/> that because of these sorts <pause dur="0.2"/> of scandal it's not too strong a word <pause dur="0.5"/> it has been very difficult to do some kinds of research <pause dur="0.8"/> so <pause dur="1.5"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> regulation of medical # research is essential <pause dur="0.5"/> now what happens <pause dur="0.4"/> say <pause dur="0.2"/> you decide oh bugger it i'm doing some research rather than <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> medical research <pause dur="0.2"/> what happens if you are discovered to be doing <pause dur="0.3"/> research which should have ethical approval and you haven't got it <pause dur="0.4"/> now first of all # <pause dur="0.3"/> this really applies to doctors <pause dur="0.3"/> the medical defence union cover or what is 
the <trunc>equiv</trunc> equivalent would be void <pause dur="0.6"/> so that if anything goes wrong you are <trunc>s</trunc> subject to the criminal law <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> the <pause dur="0.4"/> chief <pause dur="0.2"/> executive <trunc>os</trunc> officer of the hospital <pause dur="0.4"/> would almost certainly want to talk to you <pause dur="0.7"/> # and i'll mention in a little while that i recently had a letter <pause dur="0.3"/> from the chief executive officer of the <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> Hospital <pause dur="0.3"/> so i know that from a personal <pause dur="0.2"/> point of view <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> if you're medically qualified <pause dur="0.4"/> # the G-M-C <pause dur="0.4"/> General Medical Council <pause dur="0.4"/> could well want to talk to you <pause dur="0.4"/> # and perhaps also the police under extreme circumstances so this is something we obviously <pause dur="0.5"/> have to take <pause dur="0.5"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> # very seriously <pause dur="1.6"/> now as i just hinted from time to time <pause dur="0.2"/> # well not so much <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> this <pause dur="0.5"/> <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> from time to time <pause dur="0.3"/> the local hospital <pause dur="0.2"/> trust <pause dur="0.2"/> does audits <pause dur="0.3"/> on medical research and i have just discovered that they do that <pause dur="0.3"/> 'cause i had a letter from the chief executive officer pointing out <pause dur="0.3"/> that some of the work done under my <trunc>pr</trunc> my supervision <pause dur="0.4"/> # the consent forms are not in proper <pause dur="0.2"/> order <pause dur="0.9"/> it was rather a fierce 
letter that i think you'll enjoy reading <pause dur="1.8"/> okay <pause dur="2.8"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> i will ask the question how am i supposed to <trunc>s</trunc> supervise directly <pause dur="0.5"/> # that's the second issue <pause dur="0.5"/> # so a little bit of history now i've already referred to that guy Mengele <pause dur="0.4"/> # the consequence of the sorts of things he was doing not just him but others <pause dur="0.5"/> # the Nuremberg Code was developed in <trunc>nineteen-fif</trunc> nineteen-forty-seven <pause dur="0.4"/> to regulate and start start to control medical research <pause dur="0.4"/> things like the Universal Declaration of Human Rights <pause dur="0.4"/> and then only in nineteen-sixty-four <pause dur="0.3"/> there was the Declaration of <pause dur="0.3"/> Helsinki <pause dur="0.2"/> which is a very large document which goes into immense detail about all sorts of <trunc>a</trunc> aspects of medical ethics <pause dur="0.5"/> # many many pages i've never read it perhaps i should have done but i haven't <pause dur="0.4"/> and then there # have been other things since then <pause dur="0.4"/> # <trunc>mon</trunc> you've seen modification of the Declaration of Human <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> Helsinki organizations such as the World Health Organization <pause dur="0.7"/> the Council for International Organizations of Medical Science obviously the <trunc>me</trunc> the M-R-C the various Royal 
Colleges in this country and so on <pause dur="0.3"/> all of them <pause dur="0.3"/> sort of dig in # have a little bit they have a say <pause dur="0.4"/> # about medical research ethics so there's <pause dur="0.3"/> # a lot of things going on as it were <pause dur="1.4"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> now <pause dur="0.5"/> that's a bit of history <pause dur="0.5"/> for the future <pause dur="0.3"/> # as always the European Union <pause dur="0.3"/> is lumbering in here <pause dur="0.5"/> # and there is a regulation is drawn up by the European Union <pause dur="0.7"/> called this <pause dur="1.3"/> which is supposed to be coming into force this year but hadn't <pause dur="0.2"/> won't <pause dur="0.4"/> yeah it's here now <pause dur="0.3"/> and i've had a quick look <pause dur="0.5"/> at the <trunc>med</trunc> at the web site <pause dur="0.2"/> and there's <pause dur="0.3"/> downloaded a document of seventy-one pages <pause dur="0.3"/> basically of definitions and regulations okay <pause dur="0.3"/> dreadfully enormous document <pause dur="1.0"/> for the moment <pause dur="0.2"/> <vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/> this document deals only with the conduct of clinical trials <pause dur="0.4"/> involving <pause dur="0.2"/> basically drugs but medical products it says in general so that could be wooden legs <pause dur="0.3"/> but mostly it's drugs <pause dur="0.4"/> but you can bet your bottom dollar that sooner or later <pause dur="0.2"/> this sort of # <pause dur="0.2"/> European Union regulations will come in <pause dur="0.2"/> to cover all aspects of medical 
research so <pause dur="0.5"/> <unclear>it's something we're</unclear> going to have to keep our eyes on <pause dur="2.3"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> okay <pause dur="0.3"/> # in addition because of the recent fusses about <pause dur="0.3"/> retention of tissues <pause dur="0.2"/> there has been extensive # <pause dur="0.6"/> # consultation by the government on these issues of retained tissues <pause dur="0.3"/> and there will be regulation <pause dur="0.5"/> and if you want to see more about that i will obviously i have all these <pause dur="0.4"/> web sites if you want to look at them <pause dur="0.4"/> and there's a summary of responses to the consultation report P-D-F <pause dur="0.6"/> <unclear>again a</unclear> another very substantial document <pause dur="0.2"/> hours of reading <pause dur="1.7"/> okay <pause dur="0.2"/> so let's leave that <pause dur="0.5"/> and go on and talk about the basis for ethical medical research <pause dur="1.3"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> # i'm not an <trunc>ethici</trunc> i'm not a professional ethicist as you know i'm a professional biologist <pause dur="0.3"/> so i haven't made # ever made any sort of significant study of the nature of medical ethics from a from a philosophical moral <pause dur="0.3"/> point of view <pause dur="0.2"/> but i have grasped that there are two major points <pause dur="0.4"/> that we have to consider when organizing medical <pause dur="0.3"/> research <pause dur="0.3"/> one is this thing to do the so-called autonomy 
of the individual <pause dur="0.4"/> and the other is the issue of do no harm <pause dur="0.3"/> non-maleficence <pause dur="0.5"/> if you want to know the technical term for that <pause dur="1.0"/> and the basic point is that present harm no no sort of present harm can justify any sort of future good <pause dur="2.3"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> so what do we mean <pause dur="0.2"/> by autonomy of the individual again <pause dur="0.3"/> this is # sort of a lay person's view of this <pause dur="0.5"/> but as i understand it <pause dur="0.2"/> the whole issue <pause dur="0.5"/> is that i am in control of my destiny i am the person who controls my life <pause dur="0.3"/> i am the person in theory <pause dur="0.3"/> # that controls everything that happens to me unless i trangress the law of course in which case i go to prison <pause dur="0.6"/> # so only i <pause dur="0.3"/> can choose what happens to me <pause dur="0.6"/> now <pause dur="0.3"/> there's an important issue here <pause dur="0.8"/> i can only choose sensibly and properly if i'm fully informed <pause dur="0.4"/> about the consequences of my choice <pause dur="0.4"/> i'll give you # a non-research example <pause dur="0.4"/> the # thing about <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> M-M-R vaccination a little while ago people were saying <pause dur="0.5"/> M-M-R vaccination may cause <trunc>aut</trunc> # autism or related illnesses <pause dur="0.3"/> therefore we have 
single vaccinations <pause dur="0.2"/> people must be given the choice of what they want to do for their babies M-M-R <pause dur="0.2"/> or single vaccinations <pause dur="0.3"/> now there's no way that can be an informed choice 'cause nobody knows <pause dur="0.6"/> what are the real consequences of M-M-R <pause dur="0.3"/> and the real consequences of single vaccinations so there is no <pause dur="0.3"/> question of <trunc>info</trunc> or informed choice here <pause dur="0.6"/> so in fact there is no choice in that issue <pause dur="0.4"/> that's that's just an illustration obviously it's not to do with research but the issue is the same <pause dur="0.3"/> in order to make a choice <pause dur="0.3"/> about whether or not <pause dur="0.2"/> to take part in medical research is what i'm talking about <pause dur="0.4"/> we have to know properly <pause dur="0.3"/> what are the consequences of that choice <pause dur="1.6"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> okay now <pause dur="0.3"/> non-maleficence <pause dur="1.6"/> do no harm <pause dur="1.4"/> basic principle throughout medicine goes back to Hippocrates <pause dur="0.3"/> by the way <pause dur="0.2"/> # doctors no longer take the <trunc>hipprocra</trunc> Hippocratic oath is that true <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> </u><u who="nm0287" trans="latching"> <unclear>i think</unclear> that's correct yeah </u><pause dur="0.2"/> <u who="nm0285" trans="pause"> yeah because we go get all get all these references to the Hippocratic oath <pause dur="0.4"/> and we see 
these things in newspapers about this being contrary to the Hippocratic oath which doctors take and that's not true <pause dur="0.4"/> but doctors nevertheless <pause dur="0.2"/> do you sign a declaration don't you # <pause dur="0.3"/> # which <pause dur="0.2"/> basically covers the same sort of ideas <pause dur="0.5"/> # as the Hippocratic oath and of course <pause dur="0.3"/> a major principle of that <trunc>h</trunc> has to be do no harm <pause dur="0.5"/> well now <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="1.0"/> in medical research <pause dur="0.8"/> if we adhere strictly <pause dur="0.4"/> to the to the concept of do no harm <pause dur="0.5"/> you would do no medical research <pause dur="0.4"/> because any medical intervention <pause dur="0.4"/> potentially <pause dur="0.5"/> has the <trunc>ha</trunc> <trunc>ha</trunc> can do harm <pause dur="0.4"/> even well not <pause dur="0.2"/> i suppose not a pinprick to take a few micrometres of blood <pause dur="0.3"/> but almost any any other sort of intervention any other sort of procedure <pause dur="0.4"/> involving # <pause dur="0.6"/> anything to do with <pause dur="0.2"/> treatment or or or whatever <pause dur="0.5"/> potentially has harm <pause dur="0.9"/> so we have to modify <pause dur="0.3"/> this point about non-maleficence <pause dur="0.3"/> otherwise there will be no medical research <pause dur="0.4"/> so that is modified in in practice <pause dur="3.6"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> okay so <pause dur="0.3"/> to pull those two points together <pause dur="0.6"/> # in order the basis for medical 
research ethical medical research <pause dur="0.4"/> is it the <pause dur="0.4"/> the research subject <pause dur="0.3"/> clearly must understand the risks <pause dur="0.3"/> and benefits of the research <pause dur="0.4"/> # and so that he can give proper informed consent <pause dur="0.5"/> likewise <pause dur="0.5"/> the risks from the research <pause dur="0.3"/> should be proportionate to the benefits that come out of it <pause dur="2.7"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> okay <pause dur="0.7"/> so with that as the basis <pause dur="0.4"/> when do we <pause dur="0.3"/> need to apply for ethical approval <pause dur="0.6"/> and quite simply <pause dur="0.4"/> # we have to apply for <trunc>medic</trunc> ethical approval <pause dur="0.2"/> for any research involving <pause dur="0.4"/> either patients <pause dur="0.3"/> or their carers at home say <pause dur="0.4"/> or <pause dur="0.2"/> medical personnel <pause dur="0.5"/> and that comes as a bit of a surprise to some people <pause dur="0.4"/> why medical personnel <pause dur="0.4"/> # and the argument is <pause dur="0.4"/> # that # <pause dur="0.5"/> nurses midwives porters <trunc>whoe</trunc> whoever <pause dur="0.3"/> if their employer i mean when i say medical personnel what i really mean is N-H-S employees which includes doctors and it includes everybody else as well <pause dur="0.7"/> the issue has come up before now <pause dur="0.4"/> # that medical personnel being involved in research have felt pressured <pause dur="0.3"/> to take part in that research because they have felt <pause dur="0.4"/> that if they 
didn't <pause dur="0.3"/> then their careers may be prejudiced and <unclear>however</unclear> you'd say that that's nonsense <pause dur="0.2"/> but anyway the point is <pause dur="0.3"/> # this is the position they're in so carers and medical personnel <pause dur="0.3"/> are also <pause dur="0.4"/> got to be considered <pause dur="1.0"/> in the in the issue of <pause dur="0.4"/> ethical research now i'll give you an example where <pause dur="0.3"/> actually <pause dur="0.3"/> # this could have been <pause dur="0.4"/> # a significant issue <pause dur="0.3"/> there was a proposal that came before a an our research ethics committee <pause dur="0.4"/> in which personnel N-H-S employees <pause dur="0.4"/> were required to # speak to people in pubs <pause dur="0.3"/> about # their sexual habits now you can just imagine <pause dur="0.3"/> under certain circumstances that could have <pause dur="0.2"/> ended up in a punch-up <pause dur="0.9"/> and so the ethics committee involved said no they can't do that <pause dur="0.3"/> i'm afraid you'll have to find other ways of approaching the people <pause dur="0.3"/> that you want to discover the facts about their sexual practices and so on <pause dur="0.3"/> not in the pub <pause dur="0.3"/> somewhere else <pause dur="0.5"/> of course the whole point was that <pause dur="0.4"/> # they wanted to have a <pause dur="0.4"/> # a broader group of people than those that came along to the <pause dur="0.4"/> # # <unclear>say they went</unclear> to the <pause dur="0.2"/>

from our undergraduates over the last few weeks <pause dur="0.4"/> you can understand <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.9"/> what is meant by qualitative in that context <pause dur="0.6"/> some of our undergraduates tried to get some quantitative <pause dur="0.4"/> data from their research i'm talking about <pause dur="0.5"/> # the sorts of things that my students do they # one of my students for example <pause dur="0.5"/> # compared <pause dur="0.2"/> a group in Kenilworth <pause dur="0.3"/> and a group in Bristol according to their knowledge <pause dur="0.5"/> of # current carcinoma screening programmes <pause dur="0.3"/> because there's a pilot programme locally there's not one in Bristol <pause dur="0.5"/> the guys locally <pause dur="0.3"/> knew about it the guys in Bristol didn't <pause dur="0.2"/> and she was able to clearly get good statistical <pause dur="0.3"/> # significance between those two groups that's the kind of quantitative research <pause dur="0.4"/> because it didn't involve patients except indirectly it's a bit of a <pause dur="0.2"/> sleight of hand <pause dur="0.3"/> because it didn't involve patients it didn't require ethical approval <pause dur="0.7"/> okay but you see the point that i'm trying to make <pause dur="0.4"/> that's what a study if it involved patients certainly would <pause dur="1.3"/> now clinical research # that 
includes things like drug trials epidemiology we know what that means i've mentioned drug trials there <pause dur="0.3"/> lab based the sort of thing <pause dur="0.2"/> that i do a lot <pause dur="0.6"/> # we want bits of colorectal tissue in or carcinoma tissue <pause dur="0.4"/> particularly in order to study <pause dur="0.3"/> the processes involved in carcinomas <pause dur="0.3"/> now with the tissues there's an issue i'll come later come up later bring up later <pause dur="0.4"/> the tissue is removed at # the operation <pause dur="0.4"/> # and my use of the tissue has very little consequences for the patient's well-being <pause dur="0.5"/> i could say there's no consequences for the patient's well-being but that isn't quite true in fact <pause dur="0.5"/> because the pathologist always wants a bit of that tissue <pause dur="0.3"/> obviously to do the pathological study <pause dur="0.5"/> and so if the researcher says well i want the biggest bit <pause dur="0.4"/> the pathologist may be # some weak-kneed feeble sort of person doesn't happen of course not in my experience <pause dur="0.3"/> and so he gives up <pause dur="0.2"/> most of the tissue <pause dur="0.2"/> so that would be very unethical obviously so in this situation <pause dur="0.3"/> where basically we're using unwanted tissue 
you still have to have ethical approval of course we do <pause dur="0.9"/> so that's really what i mean by lab based <pause dur="0.5"/> retrospective prospective whatever <pause dur="0.4"/> okay <pause dur="0.2"/> so <pause dur="0.3"/> there we are very broad definition of medical research <pause dur="1.0"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> now it's not <pause dur="0.4"/> absolutely broad because <pause dur="0.2"/> there's always this issue of audit now # medical practitioners get very concerned about what is the difference between reseach and audit <pause dur="0.4"/> and <pause dur="0.4"/> to be honest it's very difficult to say <pause dur="0.6"/> but <pause dur="0.8"/> the way i look at it <pause dur="1.0"/> research <pause dur="0.3"/> is aimed at generating <pause dur="0.2"/> new knowledge <pause dur="0.2"/> that if you didn't do the research <pause dur="0.3"/> that knowledge would not be available you could not get it so you have to do the research to generate new knowledge <pause dur="0.8"/> audit <pause dur="1.0"/> is more a retrospective looking at <pause dur="0.2"/> current practice current knowledge <pause dur="0.4"/> # with the aim <pause dur="0.2"/> of # validating or confirming the value whatever <pause dur="0.3"/> of the current medical practice <pause dur="0.4"/> so if you have a series of patients <pause dur="0.2"/> # some of <pause dur="0.3"/> women <pause dur="0.2"/> # who give birth at home or women who give birth in a swimming pool <pause dur="0.2"/> or women who give birth in an obstetrics ward <pause dur="0.2"/> and you've been doing this for several years you've got <pause dur="0.2"/>

transplants <pause dur="0.2"/> are very sophisticated indeed in an understanding of their disease and the treatment for it <pause dur="0.4"/> so you can go into perhaps a greater level <pause dur="0.3"/> <trunc>o</trunc> of sophistication in your description of the project with such patients <pause dur="1.0"/> but for most people it's got to be fairly straightforward <pause dur="2.8"/> <kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> do i have to take part no of course the patient doesn't have to take part <pause dur="0.6"/> what will happen to me now this matters also <pause dur="0.4"/> # there was a a a <pause dur="0.2"/> a <pause dur="0.3"/> project that was submitted <pause dur="0.4"/> a little while ago <pause dur="0.3"/> # to do with immune responses to cancers patients were being recruited in <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> <pause dur="0.2"/> but all the testing <pause dur="0.4"/> was going on in <gap reason="name" extent="2 words"/>'s Hospital in <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> i shouldn't be mentioning names in <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> <pause dur="0.6"/> # and this the these tests <pause dur="0.2"/> involved multiple visits up to <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> <pause dur="0.3"/> and you know where they'd have to spend several hours in the clinic <pause dur="0.3"/> this wasn't properly explained in the <pause dur="0.3"/> in the patient information sheet <pause dur="0.7"/> one has the this suspicion that it wasn't 
explained properly in the patient information sheet because the proposers <pause dur="0.3"/> knew jolly well <pause dur="0.2"/> if a patient's understood what was expected of them they wouldn't ever be recruited <pause dur="0.6"/> having been recruited they would probably feel involved and <trunc>w</trunc> <trunc>a</trunc> <trunc>a</trunc> <trunc>a</trunc> and committed and do it <pause dur="0.7"/> so we insisted that <pause dur="0.3"/> the there was <pause dur="0.2"/> proper explanation of what was expected of the patient in the <trunc>in</trunc> <pause dur="0.3"/> information sheet <pause dur="0.4"/> i don't know if they recruited any patients for that study <pause dur="1.9"/> <kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> okay risk benefit analysis has got to be honest obviously <pause dur="0.4"/> and of course mostly there's no benefit to the patient <pause dur="1.5"/> what happens if <trunc>dru</trunc> if something goes wrong <pause dur="0.3"/> now <pause dur="1.1"/> there's <pause dur="0.2"/> this <pause dur="0.3"/> it brings up this whole issue of no fault compensation <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> again <pause dur="0.4"/> now the Association of British British Pharmaceutical Industries <pause dur="0.3"/> require all pharmaceutical companies to have in place <pause dur="0.4"/> suitable no fault compensation arrangements so they have <pause dur="0.2"/> # # # # # an insurance

behind you to do that <pause dur="0.5"/> you must be a member of the university <pause dur="0.4"/> you've got to inform the insurance office about it <pause dur="0.3"/> and you've got to say in the <pause dur="0.4"/> in the patient's information sheet that you do have done this <pause dur="1.0"/> okay <pause dur="0.4"/> you can get get anybody that wants detail obviously i can e-mail this presentation to them <pause dur="0.2"/> <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> <pause dur="1.9"/> <kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> okay so that brings me to the last stage our local business <pause dur="0.4"/> we have monthly meetings which is a great <trunc>ba</trunc> advance on the two monthly meetings that we used to have till quite recently <pause dur="0.4"/> i've forgotten the exact deadlines obviously there's a deadline for receipt of a <trunc>pro</trunc> proposal i think it may be fourteen days rather than twenty-one <pause dur="0.5"/> the proposal goes to every member of the committee but there is a lead speaker <pause dur="0.4"/> who provides a written report <pause dur="0.6"/> right <pause dur="0.7"/> you <trunc>sh</trunc> do not need to attend the meeting if you unless you're asked

or no tick it <pause dur="0.4"/> okay <pause dur="0.3"/> so that looks <trunc>g</trunc> like we've gone back to the earlier and happier situation where you've just sort of got blanket generic approval <pause dur="0.8"/> no <pause dur="0.3"/> the research ethics committee won't allow that you've got to have specific approval for the project <pause dur="0.3"/> in hand <pause dur="0.4"/> so that # that paragraph in the surgical consent form is redundant <pause dur="0.4"/> and should be removed <pause dur="0.4"/> # hospital authorities being what they are <pause dur="0.3"/> God knows when if <pause dur="0.7"/> that will happen <pause dur="1.2"/> and they know it should <pause dur="1.7"/> a second issue <pause dur="0.3"/> which is also <pause dur="0.2"/> iffy <pause dur="0.3"/> is banking of human material <pause dur="0.8"/> and subsequent use for research <pause dur="0.4"/> which wasn't included in the original <unclear>research</unclear> proposal <pause dur="0.5"/> now <pause dur="0.4"/> i would say <pause dur="0.5"/> that if you've got a bank of tissue D-N-A whatever <pause dur="0.6"/> if you reuse that for a different project <pause dur="0.4"/> that is the ethical approach 'cause it means you don't have to bother the patient again <pause dur="1.0"/> you've got the stuff in your freezer use it <pause dur="0.5"/> no <pause dur="0.2"/> the research ethics committee says you can only use that tissue <pause dur="0.3"/> for the purpose for which <pause dur="0.4"/> # you have <pause dur="0.5"/> intended it in 
your original proposal <pause dur="0.4"/> and if you want to use that tissue for some other purpose <pause dur="0.3"/> you have to go and get consent from the patient in order to do that <pause dur="0.4"/> now there are some wonderful banks of tissue in the country <pause dur="0.3"/> for example in Saint Mark's Hospital in London <pause dur="0.4"/> there are lumps of colorectal carcinoma going back to the nineteen-twenties now and <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> there's no question of <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> <pause dur="0.5"/> <trunc>g</trunc> getting consent <pause dur="0.4"/> for the reuse of that <pause dur="0.2"/> so it's wholly impractical in fact <pause dur="0.2"/> in practice <pause dur="0.3"/> in reality <pause dur="0.5"/> so the committee has backtracked a little bit <pause dur="0.3"/> so if you include if you have the sense <pause dur="0.3"/> to include on your <pause dur="0.2"/> consent form <pause dur="0.3"/> i give consent <pause dur="0.3"/> for the reuse <pause dur="0.3"/> of this material at a later date for other projects yes or no <pause dur="0.5"/> okay the patient ticks the yes box no problem if he ticks the no box <pause dur="0.5"/> well then you bin it <pause dur="0.4"/> after your project <pause dur="0.3"/> after your research is done <pause dur="1.5"/> and you can put specific inclusions in there you can say for example <pause dur="0.3"/> i guarantee that this material will not be used to
