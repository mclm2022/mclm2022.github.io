<u who="nf0269"><kinesic desc="projector is on showing slide" iterated="n"/> so part two <pause dur="0.9"/> tackling inequalities in health <pause dur="1.1"/> and we're going to look at the national and local policy context <pause dur="0.9"/> are there any questions from the earlier two sessions before we start <pause dur="3.1"/> okay well if you do think of any then ask them to your small group tutors <pause dur="0.6"/> okay <pause dur="4.0"/> so the key question then is <pause dur="2.2"/> which policies and strategies are being employed to tackle health inequalities <pause dur="0.5"/> and how effective are they likely to be <pause dur="1.6"/> and i will say although this is <trunc>s</trunc> some of looking at some of this policy stuff is quite dry <pause dur="0.4"/> and requires quite a lot of concentration <pause dur="1.2"/> it is something that you can be examined on and that we have <trunc>ex</trunc> # # asked exam questions on in the past <pause dur="0.3"/> in the overarching <unclear>IMPSA</unclear> and qualifying papers so it's worth paying attention to <pause dur="1.9"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> okay so what i'm going to begin with is just # a very <pause dur="1.0"/> brief thumbnail sketch of the health policy framework from nineteen-forty-five this isn't something you will be examined on but it will just provide you <pause dur="0.5"/> with # a thumbnail sketch of <pause dur="0.3"/> health 
policy # until up to the current date <pause dur="1.7"/> okay so from nineteen-forty-five <pause dur="0.5"/> to about nineteen-seventy-eight # we had # a health policy framework which really didn't concern itself <pause dur="0.4"/> with health inequalities really until the nineteen-seventy <pause dur="0.4"/> it wasn't an issue of political concern <pause dur="0.4"/> partly because in the # immediate post-war period <pause dur="0.4"/> health inequalities were # were at their lowest <pause dur="0.2"/> and there was much more equality in health after the <trunc>p</trunc> <pause dur="0.5"/> the war years <pause dur="0.3"/> # but inequalities in health # started to increase <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> with the gap health gap between those who were better off and those who were poorer <pause dur="0.5"/> # starting to increase # until it was really <pause dur="0.5"/> becoming quite wide in the nineteen-seventies <pause dur="2.2"/> and of course it was in the nineteen-seventies that the Black Report was commissioned because of this concern about this # <pause dur="0.3"/> these <trunc>ineq</trunc> these inequalities in health experience between social groups <pause dur="1.4"/> from <pause dur="0.5"/> nineteen-seventy-<pause dur="0.3"/>nine onwards # <pause dur="0.4"/> we had quite a a long <pause dur="0.2"/> almost twenty years <pause dur="0.6"/> # a long 
period <pause dur="0.3"/> when <pause dur="0.2"/> there was <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> a really failure to acknowledge <pause dur="0.6"/> # or in in government policy to acknowledge that health inequalities existed <pause dur="0.3"/> and in fact the term health inequalities wasn't used in any policy documents or any policy speak during this <pause dur="0.5"/> period <pause dur="0.5"/> # and health <trunc>ineq</trunc> <sic corr="inequalities">equalities</sic> were referred to as health variations <pause dur="3.1"/> we had # in the early nineties the first ever national health strategy for England <pause dur="0.4"/> and there was also a health <trunc>s</trunc> # strategy put in place at that time for Scotland and Wales as well <pause dur="0.9"/> and # some of you may recall that this first health strategy was called The Health of the Nation <pause dur="1.1"/> and its overarching theme and concern was with # individual health <pause dur="0.8"/> and <pause dur="0.3"/> strategies <pause dur="0.7"/> aimed to <pause dur="0.8"/> encourage individuals to <trunc>s</trunc> to take responsibility for their own health <pause dur="0.6"/> so there was no action <pause dur="0.3"/> to tackle inequalities <pause dur="3.6"/> since nineteen-seventy-nine we've had a shift in emphasis in # the health policy framework <pause dur="1.0"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> # we've talked about the Acheson Report <pause dur="0.5"/> # the Acheson 
Report was used to inform # the new health strategy <pause dur="0.5"/> which we currently have in place <pause dur="0.5"/> and this strategy is called Saving Lives Our Healthier Nation <pause dur="5.0"/> Saving Lives Our Healthier Nation represents the government's health strategy <pause dur="0.9"/> and this strategy aims to <pause dur="0.2"/> improve the health of everyone <pause dur="1.1"/> but particularly to improve the health of the worst off <pause dur="0.5"/> so it does acknowledge that # <pause dur="0.3"/> there are groups <pause dur="0.2"/> # who are experience health inequality <pause dur="0.3"/> and this is <trunc>near</trunc> this is where efforts need to be put <pause dur="0.3"/> to improve the health <pause dur="0.4"/> # of those who are in the <pause dur="0.2"/> the <pause dur="0.2"/> the in the poorest health <pause dur="1.7"/> and this # health strategy seeks to tackle the four main killers and you'll if you refer back to <gap reason="name" extent="2 words"/>'s lecture on lifespan <pause dur="0.5"/> he looked at # <pause dur="0.7"/> the incidence # <pause dur="0.5"/> and the patterns for <pause dur="0.4"/> # <trunc>th</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> these four main killers <pause dur="2.7"/> so we currently have a health policy framework which # aims to reduce coronary heart disease accidents <pause dur="0.4"/> mental health and cancer et cetera <pause dur="1.9"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> so <pause dur="0.4"/> it's important to recognize # <pause dur="1.6"/> what Saving 
Lives Our Healthier Nation aims to do because it does provide direction <pause dur="0.4"/> for health work <pause dur="0.4"/> so it does acknowledge the existence of health inequalities again this as i said this is a substantial change <pause dur="0.9"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> it accepts the evidence that health is determined by social and economic factors <pause dur="1.3"/> and it states that health inequalities need to be tackled <pause dur="1.0"/> and it sees the way forward as people communities and government working together in partnership <pause dur="2.3"/> if it can be criticized <pause dur="0.3"/> # or certainly when it was published the criticisms were that no funding no specific funding was attached to reducing health inequalities <pause dur="2.6"/> it actually itself <pause dur="0.8"/> as a policy document doesn't address poor living standards or inadequacy of <pause dur="0.4"/> of benefits <pause dur="0.8"/> but having said that these are addressed in # in in other government documents and we'll be looking and these and other government policies we'll be looking at some of the social <pause dur="0.5"/> policies that aim to address issues such as poor living standards <pause dur="1.4"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> and it didn't when it 
was published <pause dur="0.4"/> identify any national targets <pause dur="0.2"/> # to reduce inequalities <pause dur="0.3"/> but <trunc>s</trunc> these targets # since have been identified <pause dur="0.5"/> and since February <pause dur="0.3"/> two-thousand-and-one we've had <pause dur="0.5"/> two <pause dur="0.2"/> health inequalities targets to work towards <pause dur="1.8"/> and these are <pause dur="0.2"/> targets relating to infant mortality and life expectancy <pause dur="0.6"/> the first target is to reduce by at least ten per cent by the year two-thousand-and-ten <pause dur="0.6"/> the gap in infant deaths between manual groups and the population as a whole <pause dur="1.3"/> and for life expectancy to reduce by again by at least ten per cent <pause dur="0.6"/> # by two-thousand-and-ten the gap in life expectancy between the fifth of health authorities with the lowest life expectancy at birth <pause dur="0.3"/> and the population as a whole <pause dur="1.4"/> so we now have got some targets to work towards <pause dur="2.5"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> the government <pause dur="1.8"/> works to <pause dur="0.2"/> # <trunc>s</trunc> <pause dur="0.3"/> reduce <pause dur="0.2"/> health inequalities or sees itself as reduc<pause dur="0.4"/>ing health inequalities by a number of overarching strategies <pause dur="1.0"/> and these three strategies which are White Papers <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> i'm not sure if the N-H-S 
plan was a White Paper but <pause dur="0.4"/> these three documents <pause dur="0.3"/> all refer to in some shape or form <pause dur="0.4"/> # the existence of health inequalities and the way in which health inequalities <pause dur="0.2"/> # should be tackled <pause dur="0.7"/> we've talked about # <pause dur="0.2"/> the N-H-S plan <pause dur="0.3"/> # in the first week that we were here <pause dur="3.1"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> but then <pause dur="0.3"/> it delivers these plans if you like <pause dur="0.2"/> through a number of mechanisms <pause dur="0.8"/> through Primary Care Trusts and N-H-S Trusts <pause dur="0.3"/> where you'll all be working <pause dur="1.0"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> through health improvement and modernization programmes <pause dur="0.2"/> which i'll be talking a little bit about <pause dur="0.6"/> and through national programmes and initiatives and again i'm going to talk about those in a minute <pause dur="1.9"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> but Primary Care Trusts # <pause dur="0.3"/> has anyone not heard of a Primary Care Trust you may do if you <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="1.6"/> if you <trunc>do</trunc> if you haven't lived here very long or if you've studied in another country and just come here to do medicine has anybody </u><u who="sf0270" trans="overlap"> <gap reason="inaudible" extent="2 secs"/> </u><pause dur="1.4"/> <u who="nf0269" trans="pause"> Primary <sic corr="Care">hair</sic> <trunc>ca</trunc> Trusts # <pause dur="0.2"/> G-Ps are all part of a Primary <sic corr="Care Trusts">hair crust</sic> in Ireland what are they do you have health boards </u><pause dur="0.9"/> <u who="sf0270" trans="pause"> 
yeah the health board </u><u who="nf0269" trans="overlap"> yeah </u><u who="sf0270" trans="overlap">  <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> </u><pause dur="0.4"/> <u who="nf0269" trans="pause"> yeah Primary Care Trusts okay <pause dur="0.4"/> they were they have replaced Primary Care Groups so they are relatively new so if you haven't heard them <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> i'm <trunc>n</trunc> i'm not too surprised <pause dur="0.5"/> they're part of the new framework for delivering the new N-H-S so they're key they're key to government's way of delivering health <pause dur="1.0"/> they've evolved from Primary Care Groups so you may still and some Primary Care Groups still exist so you may <trunc>peop</trunc> hear people talking about Primary Care Groups <pause dur="0.9"/> # but it's hoped that by two-thousand-and-four all groups will have transformed themselves into Primary <trunc>c</trunc> Care Trusts <pause dur="0.3"/> which are much much <pause dur="0.2"/> bigger on the whole <pause dur="1.9"/> and they're seen as pivotal <pause dur="0.6"/> in terms of improving health and tackling health inequalities <pause dur="1.2"/> and that by two-thousand-and-four <trunc>pi</trunc> Primary Care Trusts will be <trunc>res</trunc> responsible for at least seventy-five per cent of the N-H-S budget <pause dur="0.5"/> so <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> you 
know they'll huge <pause dur="0.4"/> <trunc>hu</trunc> they'll hold huge budgets so for example for Coventry <pause dur="0.4"/> there's just one Primary Care Trust now there were three Primary Care Groups <pause dur="0.4"/> and there's and they've reorganized into one Primary Care Trust i think in Warwickshire <pause dur="0.5"/> there are three <pause dur="0.3"/> trusts is that right <pause dur="0.7"/><kinesic desc="nod heads" iterated="n" n="ss"/> how many <trunc>tu</trunc> tutors are nodding yeah there are three trusts which are <pause dur="0.5"/> north south and Rugby <pause dur="0.9"/> is that right yeah <pause dur="0.4"/> okay <pause dur="0.8"/> # and some of you may have had speakers from the trusts has anybody had speakers from the trusts yet </u><pause dur="0.7"/> <u who="su0272" trans="pause"> <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/></u><pause dur="0.5"/> <u who="nf0269" trans="pause"> yeah <pause dur="0.4"/> yeah <pause dur="0.3"/> good <pause dur="0.4"/> good <pause dur="1.3"/> so Primary Care Trusts are free-<pause dur="1.4"/>standing N-H-S bodies accountable to their strategic health authority <pause dur="1.7"/> and Primary Care Trusts <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> are responsible for commissioning care for their local population <pause dur="0.8"/> so they're able to commission care from hospital trusts <pause dur="0.4"/> so they will be commissioning # <pause dur="0.6"/> care from secondary care <pause dur="0.8"/> and from other organizations as well so they can can commission flexibly <pause dur="0.7"/> # and innovatively so they can commission aspects of care from <pause dur="0.3"/> # local 
authorities from voluntary <pause dur="0.3"/> and other statutory agencies <pause dur="2.5"/> and they also provide <pause dur="0.2"/> primary and they can also <pause dur="0.4"/> commission other primary care but they also provide primary care themselves <pause dur="0.9"/> and the primary care boards are made up of all the local stakeholders <pause dur="0.2"/> in that locality <pause dur="0.5"/> so there # there are elected family doctors <pause dur="0.7"/> there are elected nurses community nurses <pause dur="0.2"/> # midwives professions allied to medicine <pause dur="0.3"/> social services for example you might have a <trunc>so</trunc> some social workers on there <pause dur="0.4"/> and also # <pause dur="0.6"/> representatives of the wider community <pause dur="0.6"/> and it's the <trunc>b</trunc> the boards <pause dur="0.2"/> that decide the priorities for the trust <pause dur="0.4"/> and ensure that # <pause dur="0.3"/> services are commissioned to meet the needs of the local population <pause dur="1.6"/> the trusts unlike Primary Care <pause dur="0.2"/> Groups they have a much stronger <pause dur="0.3"/> public health role <pause dur="0.5"/> and the public health duties that were once until recently were held by <pause dur="0.5"/> # the health authorities have now been passed on to the Primary Care Trusts <pause dur="0.4"/> so <pause dur="1.3"/> public health <pause dur="0.7"/> is now the <trunc>r</trunc> the role of the Primary Care 
Trusts <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> so they're responsible for example for publishing # the annual public health reports <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> and for monitoring public health in localities <pause dur="1.0"/> # and they're <pause dur="0.2"/> also responsible trusts are responsible for <pause dur="0.5"/> to <pause dur="0.5"/> # facilitate better access to services <pause dur="0.4"/> and to provide <pause dur="0.2"/> better integrated services <pause dur="0.5"/> so these are the roles that have been allocated by government to Primary Care Trusts <pause dur="2.5"/> so the trusts will be <trunc>af</trunc> # # <trunc>affe</trunc> <pause dur="0.4"/> the trusts will determine who comes to you in hospital <pause dur="0.3"/> and a <trunc>ki</trunc> and the kinds of services that you're required to <trunc>pr</trunc> # <pause dur="0.5"/> to # provide <pause dur="0.4"/> # and if you're a doctor in a community trust a community based doctor you will you may be # part of the board or you may become part of the board <pause dur="0.6"/> that's if there isn't <trunc>s</trunc> any substantial # reorganization of the health service by the time you qualify <pause dur="1.7"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> so <pause dur="0.3"/> Primary Care Trusts then have the potential to respond to local health needs <pause dur="0.5"/> because they're # <pause dur="0.2"/> they're responsible for a local 
geographical area <pause dur="0.8"/> # so the potential is they could be quite responsive <pause dur="1.2"/> they're required to work in partnership one of their strengths are that they're required to work in partnership <pause dur="0.2"/> with other organizations like social services <pause dur="4.4"/> they can commission very flexibly <pause dur="1.5"/> and they can target <pause dur="0.6"/> # prevention <pause dur="0.3"/> and care and work towards equity in access to care <pause dur="1.3"/> but what they can't do <pause dur="0.2"/> is reduce poverty or income inequalities because it requires <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="1.5"/> wider social policy <pause dur="0.2"/> to do that <pause dur="2.9"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> the second mechanism i identified were HIMPs which is the Health Improvement and Modernization Programme <pause dur="0.3"/> has anyone when they've been out in the community localities had a <trunc>sp</trunc> a HIMP <pause dur="0.7"/> <trunc>lec</trunc> speaker yet <pause dur="1.7"/> no it may well be you have have you yeah <pause dur="0.7"/> may well be that some of you will have <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> someone from the trust <pause dur="0.2"/> coming to talk about <pause dur="0.5"/> the HIMP plan <pause dur="0.2"/> the Health Improvement and <trunc>moder</trunc> Modernization Programme <pause dur="0.3"/> for your particular locality <pause dur="1.3"/> so as i said earlier they've become the responsibility of the 
trust <pause dur="0.8"/> and they set out the local strategic plan <pause dur="0.3"/> for improving health <pause dur="0.3"/> and importantly for tackling health inequalities <pause dur="5.4"/> okay so the HIMP will set out # the plan and it will look at <pause dur="0.4"/> # with <trunc>oth</trunc> other organizations how it can # <pause dur="1.3"/> work to tackle the broader determinants of illness with other local <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> with other local groups and minimize the impact of hill ill health through providing <pause dur="0.3"/> integrated services <pause dur="2.1"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> so let's turn to look at national programmes rolling out policy <pause dur="1.1"/> well it's clear if we're going to reduce health inequalities that we need to have <pause dur="0.4"/> the kinds of policy in place <pause dur="0.3"/> at national level <pause dur="0.4"/> that # will <pause dur="0.6"/> both improve <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> cash in kind <pause dur="0.3"/> and improve cash in income <pause dur="0.2"/> because we've seen that those <pause dur="0.3"/> those are the main ways that we're going to reduce health inequalities <pause dur="7.2"/><event desc="drinks" iterated="n"/> the government has put in place since nineteen-ninety-seven <pause dur="0.6"/> a number <pause dur="0.9"/> of programmes that aim to improve cash in kind <pause dur="0.5"/> and these are initiatives like <pause dur="0.3"/> which i'm sure you've all heard of even if you don't know what they 
are <pause dur="0.3"/> things like Health Action Zones Education Action Zones <pause dur="0.3"/> Sure Start and regeneration programmes <pause dur="0.9"/> as well as having # some cash in income programmes again <pause dur="1.1"/> # regeneration programmes Welfare to Work programmes <pause dur="0.4"/> and changes to benefits and pensions <pause dur="0.3"/> # are likely <pause dur="0.2"/> or are aimed to increase cash in income <pause dur="0.5"/> and i'm just going to look at some of these not all of them now so that you have at least <pause dur="0.3"/> some understanding of of what they're about <pause dur="2.1"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> so the first one i'm going to look at is # a cash in kind programme which is Health Action Zones <pause dur="3.2"/> Health Action Zones were launched # <pause dur="1.5"/> and first of all drawn attention to when the N-H-S plan was # <pause dur="0.7"/> launched <pause dur="1.1"/> they're seen by the government as blazing the trail for modernizing the N-H-S <pause dur="2.0"/> and Health Action Zones are an area based approach for improving health and reducing health <trunc>equali</trunc> health inequalities <pause dur="0.8"/> so it's a local area based approach <pause dur="3.5"/> the key objectives of Health Action Zones are <trunc>t</trunc> <pause dur="0.3"/> that the zone will <pause dur="0.3"/> identify and address 
local needs <pause dur="2.6"/> increase the effectiveness and responsiveness of local services <pause dur="0.5"/> and develop partnerships with other agencies <pause dur="1.9"/> and <pause dur="0.4"/> these <pause dur="0.3"/> # these programmes or initiatives are coordinated usually by the National Health Service <pause dur="0.7"/> now the government has made substantial amounts of money available for Health Action Zones <pause dur="0.8"/> # and the latest figures suggest that about two-hundred-and-seventy-four-million pounds <pause dur="0.4"/> have been made available for Health Action Zones <pause dur="1.1"/> and this two-hundred-and-seventy-four-million pounds <pause dur="0.4"/> is going to twenty-six Health Action Zones that have been established <pause dur="1.0"/> and they cover about thirteen-million people and will run for about seven years <pause dur="3.0"/> we haven't got any Health Action Zones in Coventry or Warwickshire <pause dur="0.3"/> # i don't know if any bids were made but people <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> groups <pause dur="0.2"/> local groups had to put together bids so it would have been local health authorities <pause dur="0.5"/> # bidding with with partners in education social services et cetera <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> to put a 
proposal forward for funding <pause dur="0.9"/> twenty-six <pause dur="0.4"/> proposals have been <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> successful and there's some and and i don't think there's any <pause dur="0.3"/> any more <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> Health Action Zones going to be funded <pause dur="0.8"/> but Leicester has one is that right <pause dur="1.2"/> but you can see that substantial <pause dur="0.4"/> amounts of money have been put into them <pause dur="1.1"/> # they're currently being evaluated but it's early days <pause dur="0.5"/> the evidence so far suggests that innovative projects have been put into place <pause dur="0.6"/> # but there has been <pause dur="0.3"/> # a flexible and <trunc>i</trunc> <trunc>innova</trunc> innovative # commissioning of services <pause dur="0.2"/> and developments of services <pause dur="0.7"/> but there's no evidence yet # on whether they have brought about any health improvements within those local areas <pause dur="3.2"/> although they were seen as blazing the trail for modernizing the N-H-S <pause dur="0.3"/> they seem to have when you <pause dur="0.4"/> # hear government ministers talking about health policy they seem to be <pause dur="0.4"/> less on the agenda than they were <pause dur="0.7"/> # sort of two years ago <pause dur="1.1"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> but if we look at <pause dur="0.2"/> the strengths of Health Action Zones <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> and the strengths and weaknesses really of 
any area based approach to tackling health inequalities <pause dur="0.5"/> and because they're they're the same <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> then the strengths are that <pause dur="0.5"/> they could potentially seek to address locality based needs <pause dur="1.8"/> they can build <pause dur="0.5"/> or could have the potential to build local solutions and there's some evidence that that's being done <pause dur="1.9"/> and that they can strengthen and provide <pause dur="0.2"/> money for <pause dur="0.2"/> existing and new partnerships <pause dur="2.5"/> working together <pause dur="0.6"/> to improve health in local areas and you can see the substantial among <pause dur="0.3"/> amounts of money <pause dur="0.4"/> gone into these projects <pause dur="1.2"/> but the weaknesses if you like are that they can only ever reach <pause dur="0.2"/> a small number <pause dur="0.2"/> of of <pause dur="0.2"/> people whom whose whose health is poor <pause dur="0.6"/> you can see they were only actually covering although it was two-hundred-and-fifty-four-million <pause dur="0.3"/> they were only actually covering thirteen-million people <pause dur="1.9"/> # <pause dur="0.9"/> and they're not necessarily in areas with the greatest needs so we know that there are for example <pause dur="0.3"/> there are areas of Birmingham for example and other areas of the

<trunc>inte</trunc> it's <pause dur="0.3"/> different agencies working together <pause dur="0.5"/> again like # <trunc>h</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> the Health Action Zones <pause dur="0.5"/> # they're locally driven programmes and they're programmes that # are designed to address local needs specifically <pause dur="2.0"/> Sure Start programmes are required to acknowledge # <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> the the the fact that # <pause dur="0.8"/> different groups have different needs <pause dur="0.3"/> and they're required to deliver <pause dur="0.3"/> culturally appropriate services <pause dur="2.6"/> and that they <pause dur="1.0"/> will increase support to families with young children living in those particular areas <pause dur="1.3"/> the weaknesses of Sure Start are the same as i've i've referred to in relation to # Health Action Zones <pause dur="0.5"/> # because it's an area based approach it's got the same inherent problems <pause dur="4.0"/> although <pause dur="0.2"/> there's a there's now there's going to be about five-hundred programmes they're still only likely to reach a small proportion of of children who are poor <pause dur="0.5"/> there's two-thirds of poor children who are not being # <pause dur="0.5"/> # covered by Sure Start programmes who would benefit

regeneration programmes <pause dur="10.3"/> the government is seeking to through <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> regeneration programmes to regenerate local areas to put more life and money <pause dur="0.5"/> and economic activity <pause dur="0.3"/> into local areas to boost the # you know the <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="1.3"/> economic climate within areas <pause dur="0.3"/> in the hope <pause dur="0.2"/> that by regenerating very poor areas there will be <pause dur="0.3"/> economic spin-offs for those who are are the poorest <pause dur="1.6"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> we've got things like New Deal for communities <pause dur="0.2"/> # this is a a government programme <pause dur="0.4"/> that targets money to most deprived areas and i think Wood End's got # and Henley in the north of Coventry have got a New Deal programme <pause dur="1.1"/> # <pause dur="0.8"/> so it it targets money on the most deprived areas <pause dur="0.4"/> and has it aims to <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> to build initiatives within local areas which <pause dur="0.4"/> reduce social exclusion and improve health so it has a very <pause dur="0.6"/> clear health focus <pause dur="0.4"/> and in fact next week when we're in we've got a <trunc>s</trunc> got a speaker i think haven't we from New Deal <pause dur="0.8"/> # who will be talking about <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="1.1"/> the New Deal programme in Coventry </u><pause dur="0.5"/> <u who="nf0271" trans="pause"> yeah </u><u who="nf0269" trans="latching">

funded <pause dur="0.6"/> # # <pause dur="0.3"/> et cetera <pause dur="2.2"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> now you also need to just bear in mind that there are things like Welfare to Work programmes that the government has in place <pause dur="0.3"/> confusingly one of them is also called New <pause dur="0.2"/> New Deal <pause dur="0.8"/> but it's different to New Deal for communities <pause dur="2.0"/> New Deal # <pause dur="0.2"/> is a Welfare to Work programme <pause dur="0.6"/> which is designed to get specific <pause dur="0.2"/> groups of the population <pause dur="0.6"/> # back into employment <pause dur="1.0"/> so it combines <pause dur="0.5"/> training and employer <trunc>incenti</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> incentives <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> together with making it very difficult for some groups <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> together in one programme so it aims <pause dur="0.2"/> # New Deal is particularly aiming at getting lone parents back into employment <pause dur="0.5"/> it's aimed at getting people off welfare <pause dur="0.3"/> back into the work programme so off welfare benefits <pause dur="1.0"/> it's aimed at lone parents young adults # eighteen to twenty-four <pause dur="0.6"/> adults who are twenty-five-plus who are long term unemployed <pause dur="0.5"/> and also looking at trying to get people with disabilities back into work <pause dur="1.7"/> for some groups <pause dur="0.4"/> there where i've said coercion what i mean is <pause dur="0.2"/> 
there are some groups # if they <trunc>h</trunc> who if they do not <pause dur="0.5"/> # move into a New Deal programme or move into <pause dur="0.4"/> sort # a training programme then there are <pause dur="0.3"/> # it will affect their benefit <pause dur="3.8"/> so there's little opportunities for some groups to # not to <trunc>g</trunc> to take part in this scheme <pause dur="1.1"/> one of the problems with these kinds of programmes is they're only going to be effective if there are <pause dur="0.4"/> well paid <pause dur="0.5"/> jobs for people to move into <pause dur="0.4"/> so for example <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> if if <pause dur="0.2"/> these particular groups lone parents et cetera <pause dur="0.4"/> # are to move into <trunc>e</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> employment then <pause dur="0.3"/> # they need to <trunc>wo</trunc> to move into employment <pause dur="0.3"/> which has # <pause dur="0.6"/> a healthy wage in terms of a wage that provides them <pause dur="0.4"/> with access to a healthy living style <pause dur="0.3"/> we're not going to reduce <trunc>in</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> # inequalities if <pause dur="0.3"/> health inequalities if the people are just moving from benefits to work <pause dur="0.4"/> # without having an income <pause dur="0.2"/> that provides them access to a healthy lifestyle <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="1.5"/> and <pause dur="0.4"/> the evidence we have at the moment is <pause dur="0.2"/> that # <pause dur="0.4"/> the New Deal programme isn't <trunc>move</trunc> necessarily moving 
people into well paid jobs that people <pause dur="0.4"/> are moving into jobs <pause dur="0.3"/> that have poverty level incomes or minimum wages <pause dur="2.4"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> finally <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> we need to look at benefits and pensions and the <pause dur="0.3"/> benefits and pensions programme that the government has in place <pause dur="0.6"/> it's important because the majority of the poorest fifth of the population are dependent on welfare benefits <pause dur="1.6"/> so for example ten-million people claim income support <pause dur="0.2"/> in England <pause dur="2.2"/> the evidence that we have is <pause dur="0.2"/> that # <pause dur="1.2"/> welfare benefits particularly income support fall short of the level <pause dur="0.4"/> independent experts # say is needed <pause dur="0.2"/> to be a modern <pause dur="0.5"/> minimum <pause dur="3.1"/> so that would be the modern minimum if you like for # <trunc>t</trunc> to <pause dur="0.2"/> # support <pause dur="0.5"/> good health <pause dur="0.2"/> in these groups <pause dur="3.1"/> there is evidence that the current government has increased benefits # <pause dur="0.7"/> # for younger children <pause dur="0.2"/> # # and for families and there've been # above inflation increases in things like <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="1.0"/> # child benefit <pause dur="0.4"/> and other initiatives # have been put in place like <pause dur="0.2"/> the childcare tax credit and the working family tax
