charity based in <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> called Skillshare International <pause dur="1.3"/> and the # <pause dur="0.6"/> the # principal aim of the charity <pause dur="0.5"/> # is to work <pause dur="0.3"/> in partnership with people <pause dur="0.2"/> # and communities in Africa and India <pause dur="0.5"/> # to promote development <pause dur="0.4"/> and # <pause dur="0.4"/> the means by which they do this is <pause dur="0.2"/> partly by recruiting development workers to go <pause dur="0.2"/> and work and share their skills hence the name <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> with people in those communities <pause dur="0.6"/> but more recently they've developed # <pause dur="1.1"/> an arm of the charity which looks at development education within the U-K <pause dur="0.7"/> and jointly with David Weatherall who was at the time the development # education officer at # Skillshare <pause dur="0.7"/> # we devised and developed a <pause dur="0.2"/> # course for <pause dur="0.5"/> # students in the special study module section of the phase one curriculum <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> now <pause dur="0.9"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> what the aim of the course was was to develop their understanding of issues around <pause dur="0.2"/> health and international development <pause dur="0.5"/> and # David and i were quite open # with the students that we obviously brought to this course a set of attitudes beliefs and 
orientation towards development issues <pause dur="0.5"/> and we made those explicit we we made it quite clear that we didn't <pause dur="0.3"/> necessarily expect them to agree with us and we were very happy to discuss <pause dur="0.4"/> any conflicting or different opinions or attitudes towards development issues <pause dur="1.8"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> in order to help you under sort of stand what we did the special study module is a twelve week course it occupies twelve consecutive weeks in semester five which in traditional terms is September through to December <pause dur="0.6"/> of the third year <pause dur="0.6"/> and we have a day a week and generally the pattern of teaching that we adopted was <pause dur="0.3"/> we were giving taught sessions in the mornings <pause dur="0.4"/> # and they would have time in the afternoons for self-study <pause dur="0.4"/> and to develop their assessment plans <pause dur="1.4"/> <kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> and we set out # at the outset we had four themes that we wanted to study which sort of <pause dur="0.3"/> kind of drew on the skills and # <pause dur="0.4"/> of <pause dur="0.3"/> the people within Skillshare who were able to teach on 
this course and <pause dur="0.5"/> partly address some issues perhaps <pause dur="0.2"/> # to do with <pause dur="0.4"/> # things i could bring to it which was issues perhaps more <pause dur="0.2"/> tightly related to <pause dur="0.3"/> becoming a doctor which is about disease control <pause dur="0.5"/> treatment and elimination <pause dur="1.8"/> and also <pause dur="0.2"/> # we <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> we found that this was extremely popular module because as you're probably all aware issues of globalization are <pause dur="0.4"/> have a high priority in the undergraduate <pause dur="0.2"/> student body at the moment # MEDSIN is a <pause dur="0.3"/> very active organization <pause dur="0.5"/> # and is promoting very heavily <pause dur="0.4"/> the teaching of these sorts of issues within the undergraduate curriculum <pause dur="1.5"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> and again what Skillshare can bring is to get people to think about their skills and so <pause dur="0.3"/> # help them to orientate themselves towards <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> where they're going <pause dur="0.2"/> # in their course <pause dur="1.1"/> # <pause dur="1.2"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> and each theme <pause dur="0.4"/> was taught <pause dur="0.3"/> # around sessions <pause dur="0.4"/> # that looked at different aspects of those themes <pause dur="1.0"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> and again the particular aspects we chose depended more on the <trunc>availa</trunc> the interest and availability <pause dur="0.4"/> of the teachers who were going 
to do the sessions <pause dur="0.3"/> and we expected things like <pause dur="0.2"/> looking at the disease control of smallpox and malaria <pause dur="0.2"/> to act as paradigm <pause dur="0.3"/> conditions for <pause dur="0.3"/> diseases that are prevalent in developing countries <pause dur="2.6"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> right so that's a quick look at what we did <pause dur="0.2"/> and <pause dur="0.6"/> # we offered it # to twelve students <pause dur="0.4"/> # of whom six were female and five were male the sixth <trunc>stu</trunc> the <trunc>s</trunc> the the twelfth student <pause dur="0.3"/> came to our first session <pause dur="0.4"/> # and withdrew because she felt <pause dur="0.4"/> that she didn't have enough expertise in the area <pause dur="0.4"/> # unfortunately she did so by approaching faculty rather than me so i wasn't able to reassure her <pause dur="0.4"/> that we didn't expect her to have expertise <pause dur="0.7"/> what i think went wrong <pause dur="0.3"/> is that in our round of introductions at the very start of the course <pause dur="0.4"/> # six of the participants had actually lived or # in a developing <pause dur="0.2"/> country during all or part of their childhood <pause dur="1.4"/> and seven them seven of them had a <trunc>pa</trunc> parent one or more parent born outside of 
the U-K <pause dur="0.3"/> and in two cases # these were students one from Africa <pause dur="0.2"/> # one from Nigeria and one from # Egypt <pause dur="0.3"/> whose parents # were were medically qualified <pause dur="0.5"/> so i'm afraid we frightened off the one student who thought <pause dur="0.3"/> that she was <unclear># <trunc>th</trunc></unclear> group within a group of experts # <pause dur="1.0"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> as we found out from the assessment process <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> she was sincerely wrong about that although the students did reasonably good assessments they certainly didn't display any great expertise even after twelve weeks of our <pause dur="0.5"/><vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" n="ss" dur="1"/> effective teaching <pause dur="1.2"/> and the process we used was we asked them to write an individual essay of two-thousand words <pause dur="0.4"/> on a topic of their own choosing <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> but <pause dur="0.4"/> # we had offered them a menu of different essay titles <pause dur="0.4"/> and in fact three of them <pause dur="1.0"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> wrote essays about breastfeeding and H-I-V transmission <pause dur="0.6"/> two about access to <unclear>self</unclear> water two about prescribing branded drugs <pause dur="0.4"/> # two about education as the key to health and <pause dur="0.2"/> one student wrote an essay about human rights and its effect on health <pause dur="0.3"/> and 
another about participation <pause dur="2.3"/> at the second phase of the assessment we divided them into two groups and we asked them <pause dur="0.3"/> # to prepare three different presentations on the same topic one would be a formal fifteen minute presentation very similar to what i'm <pause dur="0.5"/> doing here <pause dur="0.7"/> the second would be a poster again similar to the thing you might prepare for a for a conference presentation on the theme <pause dur="0.6"/> and the third and most interesting <pause dur="0.2"/> and certainly the one they i think they enjoyed the best <pause dur="0.7"/> was <pause dur="0.4"/> what we called a resource poor presentation in other words <pause dur="0.5"/> # we invited them to present on the topic # to a lay audience using no no resources whatsoever <pause dur="1.0"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> well <pause dur="0.9"/> the topics they chose and this may reflect the fact we did quite a lot of teaching about H-I-V at the start of the course <pause dur="0.3"/> was on the politics of H-I-V control in Kenya and Uganda <pause dur="0.5"/> # and this was the group # doing their little role play both groups interestingly chose exactly the 
same <trunc>tea</trunc> <pause dur="0.3"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> technique because the group that had wanted to talk about access to H-I-V treatment in South Africa <pause dur="0.7"/> again had prepared a mini drama <pause dur="0.9"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> and # <pause dur="0.3"/> <trunc>th</trunc> as i say they certainly enjoyed it <trunc>w</trunc> i don't know about being resource poor because # <pause dur="0.4"/> one group # brought a # an inflatable swimming pool <pause dur="0.3"/> a plastic gun <pause dur="0.3"/> and a large amount of props to the presentation <pause dur="0.2"/> <vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" n="ss" dur="1"/> <shift feature="voice" new="laugh"/># <shift feature="voice" new="normal"/> <pause dur="0.7"/> i've given presentations to audience in Africa and # <pause dur="0.4"/> you're doing pretty well if you've got a <pause dur="0.3"/> # a chalkboard to write on <pause dur="2.5"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> right moving on <pause dur="0.5"/> to <pause dur="1.3"/> towards what i'm hoping to get to <pause dur="0.3"/> to give you <pause dur="0.2"/> a <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> <trunc>w</trunc> wanting really to develop a discussion # hopefully in this half hour slot <pause dur="1.6"/> # but we've we asked them about their view of some of the elements within the course <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> and <pause dur="0.5"/> this slide is is really about <pause dur="0.4"/> oh sorry <pause dur="0.2"/> <unclear>want to</unclear> go back again <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="1.7"/> had we got the balance right about teaching between # <pause dur="0.3"/> development topics that related to health and global development <pause dur="1.7"/> and <pause dur="0.5"/> you know did we did they feel 
that # learning in this special study module which is outside the normal range of the curriculum <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> we were they were learning enough <pause dur="1.9"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> and <pause dur="0.5"/> we also wanted them to reflect on the assessment process and as to whether that had helped <pause dur="0.6"/> # to develop their understanding <pause dur="3.0"/> and the last question was really the the counter <trunc>mo</trunc> the counter-question to the one about teaching on development topics <pause dur="1.2"/> now <trunc>m</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.9"/> we only got ten responses out of the eleven students because # <pause dur="0.2"/> one responded by e-mail so this is a caution if you send out e-mail questionnaires <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> <trunc>i</trunc> if students use a different program to <pause dur="0.2"/> complete them and send them back to you to the one you sent them out in you get a garbled response so <pause dur="0.4"/> # his <pause dur="0.4"/> # <trunc>s</trunc> his responses to the free text questions were perfectly # <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> translatable but # the <pause dur="0.3"/> the # <pause dur="1.2"/> the crosses had appeared in the wrong boxes so we didn't know what he was actually saying <pause dur="1.6"/> i mean my interpretation of these was that <pause dur="0.4"/> we probably had for the students' view got the 
balance about right between teaching on specific health-related issues and development issues <pause dur="0.7"/> # and that the course was generally <pause dur="0.2"/> well received <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> and that students # enjoyed it and the informal feedback we got was that they'd had a lot of fun <pause dur="0.6"/> doing the course and they felt they'd learned a lot <pause dur="0.2"/> so as it's not my job to entertain them <pause dur="0.4"/> but it is my job to educate them i <pause dur="0.2"/> regarded that as <pause dur="0.4"/> a success <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="1.0"/> and they felt that the presentations that they had prepared had helped them develop their understanding of the issues they'd chosen to study <pause dur="1.2"/> but of course <pause dur="0.3"/> these students had volunteered # they'd specifically opted to take this course and because this is a popular topic at the moment <pause dur="0.4"/> in medical education it was significantly oversubscribed and some special study modules <pause dur="0.4"/> may only have two or three applicants <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> so to have more students wanting to do it than actually did it <pause dur="0.4"/> # is perhaps not <pause dur="0.2"/> # always typical <pause dur="2.0"/> # <pause dur="1.4"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> and then we wanted to ask them about their attitudes to 
the course and in in doing this i think we were hoping <pause dur="0.5"/> that we would get some kind of handle <pause dur="0.4"/> more generally on their attitudes <pause dur="0.4"/> # to the issues that we wanted to talk about <pause dur="1.7"/> so <pause dur="0.9"/> again we felt that # <pause dur="0.4"/> with a couple of exceptions # <pause dur="0.2"/> they'd enjoyed the course <pause dur="0.2"/> they felt <pause dur="0.4"/> # challenged to think about <trunc>deep</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> deeply about the issues <pause dur="1.1"/> and that they were more motivated <pause dur="0.2"/> # to learn about these issues # in the future <pause dur="1.4"/> now it's not <pause dur="0.3"/> it's it's in no way a an objective of ours to recruit people who wish to go and work in a developing country either <pause dur="0.3"/> to undertake an elective within a developing country <pause dur="0.6"/> # although <pause dur="0.3"/> # we did say that students who <trunc>w</trunc> <pause dur="0.3"/> weren't thinking of doing an <trunc>e</trunc> elective in a developing country would benefit greatly from <pause dur="0.2"/> undertaking our course <pause dur="0.9"/> # <pause dur="1.0"/> but <pause dur="0.2"/> because we knew we were dealing with volunteers and it's certainly one of Skillshare's objectives to get people to <pause dur="0.5"/> offer their skills <pause dur="0.2"/> and work abroad <pause dur="0.4"/> it's <pause dur="0.2"/> gratifying that the majority of them didn't feel 
put off from the <trunc>no</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> from the idea of doing that <pause dur="1.9"/> so that was their attitude to the course and moving on to whether <pause dur="0.4"/> their general attitudes had changed as a result of the course we asked them <pause dur="1.4"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> had they changed and ten of them said yes and one said no <pause dur="1.8"/> # <pause dur="1.4"/> and then when i analysed the free text <pause dur="0.5"/> <trunc>quest</trunc> the responses to the free text question <pause dur="0.7"/> seven of them talked about they felt more aware or more knowledgeable about the issues <pause dur="0.9"/> three of them felt they had a better understanding <pause dur="1.7"/> and four of them said they had an increased interest in the topic for the future <pause dur="1.5"/> but actually very few of them had <pause dur="0.5"/> <trunc>ac</trunc> responded to the question i'd set which is had their attitudes changed <pause dur="2.2"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> these are the kind of these are just a sample of the responses that they made <pause dur="0.5"/> # and i've chosen one <pause dur="0.6"/> from each category <pause dur="0.2"/> that i ended up with <pause dur="2.1"/> so <pause dur="0.8"/> possibly <pause dur="0.4"/> understanding that this is a much more complex issue than they started is # <pause dur="0.2"/> does represent some sort of attitudinal shift <pause dur="1.5"/> and <pause dur="0.5"/> perhaps becoming 
more sympathetic to the plight of refugees and asylum seekers again <pause dur="0.5"/> perhaps an attitudinal shift <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> and <pause dur="0.9"/> if you increase somebody's motivation to go and do something <pause dur="0.4"/> then <pause dur="0.2"/> you perhaps can infer <pause dur="0.2"/> that there may have been a change in their attitude <pause dur="0.2"/> a positive change in their attitude towards <pause dur="0.5"/> whatever you're asking about <pause dur="2.9"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> <gap reason="inaudible" extent="1 sec"/> the student whose attitudes hadn't changed <pause dur="0.2"/> now <pause dur="0.8"/> of course that may not be a bad thing <pause dur="0.2"/> 'cause he may have <pause dur="0.2"/> entered the course with exactly the kind of attitudes that David and i <pause dur="0.3"/> hoped students would develop during the course <pause dur="0.3"/> and all we did was confirm in him in his previous attitudes that <pause dur="0.4"/> were what we were interested in <pause dur="2.2"/> so having sort of done this analysis of the course and realized that actually i'd absolutely failed in my objective was to measure attitude change amongst my students i went away well first of all what does the word attitude mean <pause dur="0.9"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> so <pause dur="0.5"/> course i <unclear>headed across</unclear> to the dictionary like we all do <pause dur="0.9"/> and the first meaning in the dictionary is all to do 
with # <pause dur="0.2"/> body posture <pause dur="0.3"/> so i think i felt that definition wasn't particularly helpful to me <pause dur="1.0"/> the second <trunc>def</trunc> definition is that a state of mind or a feeling <pause dur="0.2"/> a disposition <pause dur="0.6"/> and the example the <trunc>dish</trunc> the dictionary quotes is had a positive attitude about work <pause dur="1.7"/> and the second <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> definition which is probably one better understood by teenagers and young people <pause dur="0.7"/> is an arrogant or hostile state of mind or disposition <pause dur="1.6"/> now <pause dur="0.6"/> that i find very interesting because it <pause dur="0.2"/> made me remember something that Lesley Southgate said when she came to <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> to give a presentation about poorly performing doctors <pause dur="1.7"/> and what she found is that <pause dur="0.2"/> that the <trunc>s</trunc> the doctors whom <pause dur="0.5"/> that <pause dur="0.4"/> process has identified as poorly performing <pause dur="0.3"/> and whom they were having most difficulty <pause dur="0.4"/> in reforming <pause dur="0.3"/> into <pause dur="0.7"/> doctors who would perform well in future <pause dur="0.6"/> it was to do with attitude it was not about their knowledge <pause dur="0.3"/> on the whole these doctors had good knowledge <pause dur="0.4"/> nor was it 
about their skills they were often quite skillful <pause dur="0.2"/> # surgeons for example where obviously <pause dur="0.2"/> skill is <pause dur="0.2"/> very important <pause dur="1.1"/> and <pause dur="0.6"/> they'd identified <pause dur="0.3"/> this was the particularly different category of doctor to deal with <pause dur="0.6"/> it also made me remember an incident with one of our students <pause dur="0.4"/> who and one of our practice teachers rang up and said we're very concerned about this student <pause dur="0.5"/> because # during the midpoint assessment <pause dur="0.3"/> # which is <pause dur="0.2"/> the clinical assessment with live patients in the doctor's surgery <pause dur="0.4"/> the student <pause dur="0.3"/> possibly a mistaken attempt to <pause dur="0.2"/> create a light-hearted environment had told a patient <pause dur="0.3"/> female patient getting undressed for <pause dur="0.4"/> not a vaginal examination but an abdominal examination <pause dur="0.3"/> go behind the <trunc>sceen</trunc> screens and get your kit off <pause dur="1.0"/> now <pause dur="1.3"/> this was a student who i by chance i actually had <pause dur="0.2"/> in my small group <pause dur="0.6"/> and he was a student who'd displayed very great <trunc>weak</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> found it very difficult to get him to accept that one of the videotape consultations he'd looked 
at <pause dur="0.4"/> there were problems in the behaviour and relationship of <pause dur="0.2"/> the doctor <pause dur="0.4"/> on the tape and the patient <pause dur="0.4"/> and he was insisting that okay the doctor wasn't clinically very competent <pause dur="0.4"/> but he was polite and therefore he thought this doctor was behaving very well with this patient <pause dur="0.9"/> and the entire group eventually ended up siding against him <pause dur="0.6"/> and he wouldn't shift his <pause dur="0.2"/> attitude <pause dur="0.3"/> towards this performance <pause dur="1.7"/> now one of the advantages of our style of teaching and i suspect it's true for all the medical schools represented here is that our general practice teachers <pause dur="0.3"/> are pretty good at picking up on these kind of issues <pause dur="0.6"/> and generally <pause dur="0.2"/> # they'll <pause dur="0.2"/> they'll <pause dur="0.3"/> refer them to us and we will try and get the faculty to take some notice of them <pause dur="0.8"/> often some difficulty to John Cookson's credit when i wrote to him about the student and this incident he did call the student in and speak to him <pause dur="1.1"/> now <pause dur="0.5"/> the problem is <pause dur="0.5"/> is i've really got no idea whether this student i'm sure the student's 
graduated <pause dur="0.5"/> and although he probably said all the right things to John Cookson <pause dur="0.3"/> i don't really know whether his attitudes have changed very much <pause dur="3.4"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> so i then <unclear>wondered</unclear> what have other people done <pause dur="0.3"/> about attitudes <pause dur="0.3"/> so i just did a quick <pause dur="0.2"/> # flip through Medical Education <pause dur="0.3"/> using the keyword attitude in the search <pause dur="0.4"/> and came up with seventy-four articles where that's the <pause dur="0.7"/> where that is a keyword that the author's used to describe the purpose of their work <pause dur="0.4"/> since January nineteen-ninety-eight <pause dur="0.4"/> forty-six of which relate to undergraduate medical education <pause dur="1.2"/> well twenty-two of these papers essentially are about the students' teaching and learning experience so it's nothing to do with their attitudes <pause dur="0.9"/> nine of them are about their attitudes towards patients or patient groups almost <trunc>pr</trunc> almost entirely <trunc>res</trunc> these papers were written by psychiatrists who claim people were <pause dur="0.4"/> vulnerable there's one paper by an epidemiologist but again that's no surprise that <pause dur="0.5"/> these two groups of specialties in 
medical schools <pause dur="0.3"/> get a bit sensitive about how students perceive their speciality <pause dur="1.1"/> eleven of the <trunc>paysh</trunc> # the papers were about particular issues or topics # for example <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.9"/> about the doctor-patient relationship or their attitudes towards terminal illnesses # <pause dur="0.5"/> as a topic on which they were being taught <pause dur="0.5"/> and four related to something about their personal experiences <pause dur="1.4"/> a majority the overwhelming majority of these # <pause dur="0.2"/> papers had assessed student attitude by use of questionnaires <pause dur="0.3"/> i guess most of them derived <pause dur="0.2"/> <trunc>pr</trunc> precisely the way i derive questionnaires <pause dur="0.4"/> rather than the way that # Dr <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> does <pause dur="1.0"/> and many of them depended on scale questions and most of them didn't actually attempt to measure change although one of although one or two did <pause dur="2.8"/> so <pause dur="0.6"/> the issues that arose then for me is well <pause dur="0.3"/> i'd wanted to measure attitude and i hadn't done it well okay we hadn't done a before and after questionnaire <pause dur="0.5"/> but <pause dur="0.5"/> if i'm going to measure attitude shift amongst my 
students <pause dur="0.2"/> who take the module next September <pause dur="1.4"/> these are all volunteers who want to study this topic so it <pause dur="0.2"/> it may be that they already have all the right attitudes and nothing we can do can shift them <pause dur="0.5"/> so <pause dur="0.3"/> do we need control groups and <pause dur="0.2"/> and although i didn't look in detail at all the seventy-four papers <pause dur="0.4"/> i didn't detect that any of the ones i do look at the abstracts of had actually used control groups when they were talking about attitude <pause dur="2.0"/> and <pause dur="2.4"/> this then relates back to something that i think is really much more <pause dur="0.6"/> problematic and why i <pause dur="0.2"/> related the anecdote i did about the student who said get your kit off <pause dur="1.3"/> is <pause dur="1.2"/> we talk about measuring knowledge and skills <pause dur="0.3"/> within a medical education and there's <pause dur="0.3"/> huge vast literature <pause dur="0.2"/> about how you do that effectively and reliably <pause dur="1.4"/> and that's actually quite relatively easy <pause dur="1.0"/> but how do we measure attitude <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="1.4"/> i come from <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> so <pause dur="0.4"/> the example of Peter Green the doctor who sexually assaulted patients in his surgery is obviously a 
very live one for us <pause dur="0.3"/> particularly as as he was a partner in one of our teaching practices <pause dur="1.0"/> and this is a doctor who's regarded as very outgoing very cultured <pause dur="0.5"/> regarded as a very competent general practitioner by all his colleagues <pause dur="1.4"/> and <pause dur="0.4"/> but <pause dur="0.2"/> his attitudes towards his patients <pause dur="0.3"/> were <pause dur="0.2"/> about as arrogant as you can get which is that i inject them with anaesthetics and i can sexually assault them <pause dur="2.0"/> and of course <pause dur="0.5"/> there were concerns about the attitudes of Harold Shipman <pause dur="0.8"/> and because of behaviours in previous practices <pause dur="0.4"/> but yet his colleagues regarded him as a competent doctor and he wasn't being flagged up by any other mechanisms that we generally <pause dur="0.7"/> use to know and we <pause dur="0.2"/> might not use in teaching practice or particular practice for teaching because we're concerned about the professional competence of the doctors there <pause dur="1.4"/> and yet these were two of the most <pause dur="0.4"/> attitudinally dangerous and <pause dur="0.3"/> difficult doctors that we've that have come to light and heaven knows how many more 
there are out there that haven't come to light <pause dur="2.0"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> so should we measure whether our students have appropriate attitudes when they start <pause dur="1.6"/> and can we assess their attitudes during medical education <pause dur="2.1"/> and how do we <trunc>fine</trunc> define what we mean by good and bad attitudes <pause dur="1.0"/> and if it is desirable to assess them <pause dur="0.5"/> how do we prevent students from playing the game <pause dur="0.5"/> 'cause you can measure their knowledge and that's quite straightforward you can measure their skills and if they haven't got skills then they haven't got the skills <pause dur="0.8"/> but it isn't very difficult if you're as bright as our students to spot what the socially desirable answer <pause dur="0.3"/> to the question might be <pause dur="1.4"/> sorry i'm i'm sorry i've overrun a few minutes so i've eaten into your discussion time but i will now shut up and <pause dur="0.7"/> # hopefully that's sown some seeds of thought in your minds </u><pause dur="5.1"/> <u who="nm0311" trans="pause"> can i ask # if you if you if you were to do this again <pause dur="0.6"/> would you actually have some sort of measure of attitudes before and after <unclear>it</unclear> </u><pause dur="0.5"/> <u who="nm0310" trans="pause">
