<u who="nf0621"><kinesic desc="projector is on showing slide" iterated="n"/> welcome <pause dur="4.7"/> today <pause dur="1.1"/> we're talking about <pause dur="0.9"/> communication skills <pause dur="2.3"/> it's the core part <pause dur="0.7"/> of what you learn <pause dur="0.6"/> if you want to become <pause dur="0.2"/> a doctor <pause dur="2.5"/> ninety-five per cent <pause dur="0.2"/> of doctors <pause dur="0.5"/> spend most of their days <pause dur="0.7"/> talking to people <pause dur="1.0"/> one way or another <pause dur="1.8"/> ninety-eight per cent of doctors <pause dur="1.0"/> have to be able to consult <pause dur="1.6"/> even if you're a pathologist you have to talk to the relatives of the people you cut up <pause dur="2.1"/> and you have to be able to talk to other doctors as well <pause dur="1.7"/> so this is absolutely <pause dur="0.3"/> crucial <pause dur="1.0"/> now one of the first things about communication skills that we teach you all <pause dur="0.2"/> is that first of all <pause dur="1.2"/> you should introduce yourselves <pause dur="0.4"/> and so <pause dur="1.6"/> we're going to introduce ourselves <pause dur="0.7"/> because in the next few years you're going to become <pause dur="0.2"/> fairly familiar <pause dur="0.5"/> with all these names <pause dur="0.6"/> that are <pause dur="0.4"/> in front of you here <pause dur="1.5"/> and we thought we'd give you this opportunity to find out <pause dur="0.4"/> who we are <pause dur="0.9"/> and we're all going to introduce ourselves <pause dur="0.3"/> to you so that <pause dur="0.7"/> all of you will be taught by us <pause dur="0.8"/> probably most of us <pause dur="0.4"/> before you qualify <pause dur="0.9"/> even if not directly in 
the next few months <pause dur="0.9"/> so we thought you'd like to know who we are <pause dur="1.5"/> so <pause dur="0.9"/> this is our <pause dur="0.5"/> Department of Undergraduate G-P Education at the moment <pause dur="0.2"/> we have two senior lecturers <pause dur="0.2"/> <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> and <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> <pause dur="1.3"/> and <pause dur="1.1"/> as of <pause dur="0.9"/> two weeks' time we have ten <pause dur="0.5"/> part-time G-P lecturers <pause dur="0.9"/> all of us are <pause dur="1.7"/> more than half-time more than two-third time G-Ps <pause dur="0.9"/> in the week <pause dur="0.6"/> and <pause dur="0.6"/> all of us <pause dur="1.0"/> spend most of our time <pause dur="0.3"/> actually at the coalface <pause dur="1.7"/> so if my <pause dur="0.3"/> people could come up <pause dur="0.2"/> please <pause dur="1.0"/> and <pause dur="0.5"/> we'll let <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> <pause dur="2.1"/> now <pause dur="0.8"/> the most important members of our team as far as you're concerned <pause dur="0.4"/> are <pause dur="1.2"/> <gap reason="name" extent="2 words"/> who's our undergraduate administrator <pause dur="1.5"/> and <gap reason="name" extent="2 words"/> <pause dur="0.3"/> her assistant who's i think officially called the secretary <pause dur="1.6"/> these two ladies <pause dur="0.7"/> are <pause dur="0.6"/> the heart of our department <pause dur="0.6"/> and they run everything and you will be going to see them and phoning them <pause dur="0.9"/> lots and lots <pause dur="1.6"/> <vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" n="ss" dur="1"/> but now <pause dur="0.3"/> <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> <pause dur="0.6"/> all yours </u><pause dur="3.1"/> <u who="nm0622" trans="pause"><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> i'm the director of G-P Undergraduate Medical Education at <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> Medical 
School <pause dur="0.3"/> and we're all <pause dur="0.3"/> members of the Department of <pause dur="0.5"/> Undergraduate General Practice Education <pause dur="0.9"/> <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> asked us to give <pause dur="0.2"/> # an amusing theme about ourselves and <pause dur="0.2"/> a message therefore about communication <pause dur="0.8"/> my wife says that my interest in cricket has become an obsession <pause dur="0.5"/> and this is myself actually <pause dur="0.4"/> on a very rare occasion <pause dur="0.4"/> going out <pause dur="0.2"/> to bat <pause dur="0.9"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> and i wanted my communication <pause dur="0.4"/> theme to # surround <pause dur="0.7"/> cricket because <pause dur="0.3"/> to be successful in cricket <pause dur="0.5"/> requires <pause dur="0.2"/> teamwork <pause dur="0.5"/> it can't be <pause dur="0.6"/> a solo <pause dur="0.3"/> effort <pause dur="0.7"/> and if you think of the team it's more than just <pause dur="0.4"/> the players <pause dur="1.1"/> if you make the analogy with <pause dur="0.2"/> you as doctors in the future you're going to be the major players <pause dur="0.4"/> in the N-H-S but there are a lot of other players as well <pause dur="0.7"/> there's the ground staff <pause dur="0.6"/> the umpires <pause dur="0.2"/> the scorers the fixture secretary publicity <pause dur="0.6"/> those who make the teas <pause dur="0.4"/> and many others so there are many others in the N-H-S team <pause dur="0.4"/> as well as doctors <pause dur="0.9"/> and we'll all have different skills which <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/>'s just alluded to some of us may be pathologists some of us may be <pause dur="0.5"/> G-Ps so 
similar to the cricket team there are those that are good at batting <pause dur="0.4"/> some at bowling some at fielding <pause dur="0.9"/> but <pause dur="0.3"/> success is not through individuals <pause dur="0.2"/> for us to be successful we've got to communicate <pause dur="0.9"/> <kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> and <pause dur="0.6"/> thinking particularly of the university we have teamwork in teaching that's why <pause dur="0.3"/> we're introducing ourselves as a team <pause dur="0.3"/> in order to make it a success we've got to communicate <pause dur="0.7"/> for you as students during your four years to be successful <pause dur="0.3"/> you've got to be able to communicate <pause dur="0.5"/> both as pairs and within groups during seminar work <pause dur="0.4"/> particularly in relation to problem based learning <pause dur="0.8"/> that requires teamwork <pause dur="0.7"/> and similarly when you go into practice <pause dur="0.3"/> people don't work on their own nowadays they work in teams both in the community <pause dur="0.6"/> and in hospital <pause dur="0.7"/> so <reading>effective teamwork depends on good communication to enable mutual understanding of needs <pause dur="0.5"/> whether on <pause dur="0.2"/> or off the field</reading> <pause dur="0.7"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> so the amusing bit for me is <pause dur="0.4"/> i have the long walk out from the pavilion on to the <vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" n="ss" dur="1"/> 
cricket square <pause dur="0.4"/> a relatively short time <pause dur="0.3"/> at the crease depending whether i'm facing to begin with or whether i have a few balls while my partner at the other end is facing <pause dur="0.7"/> and then unfortunately <pause dur="0.4"/> the long walk <pause dur="0.3"/> back to the pavilion <vocal desc="laughter" iterated="y" n="ss" dur="1"/><pause dur="1.6"/> pass on to <pause dur="0.2"/> <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> </u><gap reason="break in recording" extent="uncertain"/> <u who="nf0623" trans="pause"><kinesic desc="projector is on showing slide" iterated="n"/> thank you <pause dur="0.6"/> # i'm <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/>'s sort of other half in the academic department in that # i'm codirector <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> i haven't made you a beautiful slide because as my group from this morning will know i'm i'm rather keen on art and i have a new digital camera and i haven't quite got my act together <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.9"/> i've been here since January <pause dur="0.2"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> and i was at U-C-L prior to that # <pause dur="0.4"/> my major interest is obviously in communication and consultation skills <pause dur="0.5"/> # which is also a research interest for for many years i was head of the international unit which is <pause dur="0.4"/> involved in primary care development projects abroad <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> and that i think has made me more aware of of of communication it's it's brought a lot of lessons back <pause dur="0.2"/> for me to the U-K which i use in my daily

you have to give patients space <pause dur="0.4"/> and time <pause dur="0.4"/> to express themselves <pause dur="6.4"/> it's actually quite <pause dur="0.3"/> difficult <pause dur="0.6"/> to hear <pause dur="0.4"/> what patients are actually saying <pause dur="2.6"/> we take it for granted but very often <pause dur="0.7"/> you know there's family arguments where <pause dur="0.3"/> <shift feature="voice" new="mimicking an other's voice"/> i told you about so and so <shift feature="voice" new="mimicking an other's voice"/>no no you didn't <pause dur="0.2"/> you didn't say that you said something <trunc>el</trunc> <shift feature="voice" new="normal"/><pause dur="0.7"/> it's very difficult <pause dur="0.3"/> to hear what people say <pause dur="0.3"/> because very often <pause dur="0.4"/> you're expecting <pause dur="0.7"/> an answer <pause dur="1.3"/> and you get <pause dur="0.8"/> dragged <trunc>b</trunc> off by your expectation <pause dur="1.1"/> and practising listening to the story that patients <pause dur="0.2"/> really tell you <pause dur="1.4"/> is very important <pause dur="3.1"/> you have to overcome <pause dur="0.6"/> the barriers to disclosure <pause dur="2.0"/> they're always there <pause dur="0.8"/> they'll be worse for you <pause dur="0.2"/> when you're feeling insecure <pause dur="0.9"/> when you're only a first year medical student <pause dur="1.0"/> and you feel <pause dur="0.4"/> like this <pause dur="0.5"/> but even the most experienced doctor has to overcome <pause dur="0.3"/> barriers <pause dur="0.7"/> in order to be able to help <pause dur="0.6"/> as well as they can <pause dur="5.1"/> if i've got one message that i'm going to give you above all others <pause dur="0.5"/> it's <pause dur="0.8"/> to value the patient's contribution <pause dur="0.5"/> as equal <pause dur="0.6"/> to your 
own <pause dur="1.4"/> in fact <pause dur="0.5"/> it's not just equal to your own it's probably <pause dur="1.7"/> everything <pause dur="4.6"/> and by the time <pause dur="0.3"/> you qualify <pause dur="0.6"/> we hope you will have the knowledge and the skills <pause dur="0.7"/> to process what the patient says <pause dur="1.6"/> to be able to make <pause dur="0.6"/> this magic thing called <pause dur="0.2"/> a diagnosis <pause dur="0.4"/> but more than that not just a label <pause dur="0.8"/> a real insight <pause dur="0.5"/> into that patient's world <pause dur="1.0"/> something that will make sense to them <pause dur="0.4"/> as well as you <pause dur="7.5"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> so you're going to be doing this <pause dur="0.4"/> by listening <pause dur="0.3"/> but also by questioning <pause dur="1.5"/> anybody know anything about questions <pause dur="1.5"/> anyone <pause dur="0.9"/> <kinesic desc="indicates member of audience" iterated="n"/> yeah </u><pause dur="1.1"/> <u who="sm0634" trans="pause"> # <pause dur="0.5"/> basically not to ask leading questions to keep them open </u><pause dur="1.1"/> <u who="nf0621" trans="pause"> brilliant <pause dur="0.6"/> yeah <pause dur="2.1"/> sounds very easy <pause dur="0.2"/> doesn't it not to ask leading questions <pause dur="0.5"/> but there are basically two sorts of questions <pause dur="0.2"/> there are closed questions <pause dur="1.1"/> these are ones that can be answered by yes and no <pause dur="1.4"/> things like <pause dur="0.2"/> do you have you are you <pause dur="3.6"/> and there are open questions <pause dur="0.7"/> which actually allow <pause dur="0.3"/> a

patients <pause dur="0.2"/> understand <pause dur="0.5"/> and in the way that that patient understands it <pause dur="3.3"/> so you then can get a shared understanding <pause dur="3.3"/> and <pause dur="0.5"/> we teach you <pause dur="0.3"/> in order to get that shared <trunc>un</trunc> understanding <pause dur="0.2"/> you're going to use <pause dur="0.3"/> the patient's ideas <pause dur="2.1"/> the patient's concerns what's bugging them <pause dur="2.6"/> and their expectations <pause dur="4.2"/> and you'll be practising this <pause dur="0.4"/> by the time <pause dur="0.4"/> you get to the Clinical Methods course <pause dur="0.8"/> you'll actually know <pause dur="0.2"/> ideas concerns and expectations as ICE <pause dur="0.6"/> it will be something i hope <pause dur="0.5"/> that you'll be so familiar <pause dur="0.4"/> with thinking <pause dur="0.3"/> do i know their ideas do <trunc>n</trunc> i know what <pause dur="0.5"/> what they are worried about <pause dur="0.3"/> do i know what they want from us <pause dur="6.4"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> and responding <pause dur="0.6"/> what do you do when somebody bursts into tears <pause dur="0.7"/> what do you do when <pause dur="0.9"/> are there some useful things that you'll get used to <trunc>d</trunc> using <pause dur="0.3"/> things like <pause dur="0.2"/> tell me about <pause dur="2.5"/> tell me about encourages <pause dur="0.5"/> the narrative <pause dur="0.8"/> of a consultation <pause dur="0.2"/> it gets people talking <pause dur="0.4"/> it's a wonderful tool that experienced doctors use <pause dur="0.9"/> you don't usually tell your friends <trunc>t</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> tell me about this do you <pause dur="0.7"/> but it's 
something that as a professional <pause dur="0.2"/> you'll learn <pause dur="2.5"/> reflection <pause dur="1.1"/> to be able to just <pause dur="1.0"/> repeat back <pause dur="0.2"/> something that a patient has said <pause dur="0.5"/> and not to feel ridiculous about it <pause dur="2.1"/> summarizing <pause dur="0.4"/> to take a long complicated story <pause dur="0.3"/> that a patient has told you <pause dur="0.5"/> and to create it into a nice neat whole <pause dur="0.4"/> so that they can check that you've got <pause dur="0.6"/> all the important data <pause dur="2.1"/> and empathizing <pause dur="1.6"/> how to say <pause dur="1.8"/> naturally <pause dur="0.2"/> easily <pause dur="1.0"/> i'm so sorry <pause dur="0.2"/> if somebody tells them <pause dur="1.1"/> you that <trunc>y</trunc> their father's died or <pause dur="0.3"/> something like that <pause dur="0.6"/> and to be able <pause dur="0.5"/> to feel comfortable about giving that empathy <pause dur="5.9"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> so these are all very practical things and me talking to you about them isn't going to help them happen is it <pause dur="2.4"/> so how does our DISC course here <pause dur="0.8"/> help you <pause dur="0.6"/> to develop these skills <pause dur="9.6"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> we start out <pause dur="0.6"/> with three seminars <pause dur="4.6"/> each of the seminars <pause dur="0.4"/> takes place here <pause dur="2.2"/> it's about an hour and a half long <pause dur="1.2"/> you'll be in small groups <pause dur="3.5"/> there'll be about ten of you <pause dur="2.0"/> and you'll have <pause dur="0.3"/> a G-P tutor <pause dur="0.3"/> with you in that group <pause dur="1.8"/> you'll also have <pause dur="0.5"/> a thing called a simulated patient <pause dur="4.1"/> we use 
simulated patients quite a bit <pause dur="0.4"/> both in exams <pause dur="0.5"/> and in <pause dur="0.4"/> training <pause dur="2.2"/> and i know that there's a <pause dur="0.2"/> tendency for students to think oh it's only an actor <pause dur="1.0"/> well <pause dur="0.7"/> if you call a simulated patient an actor a lot of them get very offended <pause dur="1.0"/> but these are people <pause dur="0.4"/> who <pause dur="0.8"/> have an alter ego <pause dur="0.8"/> as a person who comes to see a doctor <pause dur="2.0"/> and they know how to be that person <pause dur="0.9"/> and they give you a chance to practise <pause dur="1.7"/> to dry run <pause dur="0.5"/> like going on a dry ski slope <pause dur="0.8"/> you know it's <pause dur="0.6"/> it's easier <pause dur="1.7"/> although it isn't easier <pause dur="0.2"/> when you actually try it you find it feels just like talking <pause dur="0.2"/> to any other patient and of course these are real patients <pause dur="1.0"/> often they have real illnesses <pause dur="1.5"/> but the advantage is <pause dur="0.7"/> that if you say the wrong thing if you laugh when they say my father died <pause dur="1.3"/> you won't have really hurt somebody <pause dur="1.1"/> in a way that can't be undone <pause dur="1.7"/> and if you find <pause dur="0.2"/> that the patient doesn't understand what you're going on about you can say <pause dur="0.2"/> ah i'm sorry shall we try that again <pause dur="0.8"/> and reel back like a videotape <pause dur="0.7"/> and have a <trunc>g</trunc> go using different words <pause dur="1.4"/> for us 
experienced doctors we love having a chance to use simulated patients <pause dur="1.0"/> and <pause dur="0.6"/> we <trunc>f</trunc> we find that the work that we can do with them is immensely valuable to us <pause dur="4.3"/> but these seminars that you have are a chance to actually practise <pause dur="0.8"/> your first attempts at talking to patients <pause dur="0.5"/> in a safe <pause dur="0.2"/> environment <pause dur="2.0"/> it's also an environment where <pause dur="0.5"/> you can experiment <pause dur="2.2"/> it's often quite difficult to find out why the patient has come <pause dur="1.4"/> if you're in a group <pause dur="0.2"/> the group can give you ideas <pause dur="0.7"/> how you can ask <pause dur="0.3"/> the right questions <pause dur="0.6"/> to actually find out why <pause dur="0.3"/> these particular patients <pause dur="0.3"/> have come <pause dur="2.3"/> and they also enable you to be able to find out the background <pause dur="0.2"/> to the problems that the patients have <pause dur="0.7"/> at this stage we don't expect you to make medical diagnoses <pause dur="1.3"/> but it's never too <trunc>se</trunc> soon <pause dur="0.4"/> to start practising <pause dur="0.3"/> the actual nuts and bolts of talking to patients <pause dur="0.5"/> finding out <pause dur="0.2"/> what their story is <pause dur="0.5"/> why have they come to the doctor's today <pause dur="0.6"/> what is it they want <pause dur="0.3"/> what is the real problem <pause dur="2.1"/> those skills you need <pause dur="0.5"/> right from day one <pause dur="2.6"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> we then follow it 
up with real patients because <pause dur="0.8"/> that's what life is <trunc>a</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> going to be about for all of you <pause dur="2.7"/> and you then have three sessions <pause dur="0.3"/> in the G-P practice of your group tutor <pause dur="0.4"/> so you will be with <pause dur="0.2"/> the tutor who's been with you in the seminars <pause dur="1.8"/> and you go out in pairs <pause dur="1.4"/> and you'll spend an afternoon or a morning <pause dur="0.5"/> in their surgery <pause dur="2.1"/> and you'll see real patients with real problems <pause dur="0.6"/> and even your tutor won't know anything about them because they'll come in and they'll have something new he <pause dur="0.3"/> and he won't know what it is <pause dur="3.1"/> and you'll be able to talk to them before any other doctor <pause dur="0.6"/> or nurse or anyone has actually spoken to them about this problem <pause dur="0.6"/> and have a go <pause dur="0.3"/> at finding out <pause dur="0.3"/> why the patient has come <pause dur="0.8"/> finding out the background to the problem <pause dur="2.0"/> and then <pause dur="1.0"/> as a pair <pause dur="0.3"/> you can think about the difficulties you find <pause dur="2.2"/> and you can learn to recognize <pause dur="0.6"/> what you do naturally easily <pause dur="0.5"/> and what you're going to have to work at <pause dur="1.3"/> and the most important thing here is that <pause dur="0.2"/> your G-P tutor <pause dur="0.7"/> is going to be giving you <pause dur="0.2"/> 
feedback <pause dur="1.5"/> every time you talk to a patient <pause dur="0.9"/> your G-P tutor <pause dur="0.4"/> will be watching and listening <pause dur="0.2"/> to what you do <pause dur="0.7"/> and they will give you feedback <pause dur="0.6"/> on <pause dur="0.3"/> how you did it well <pause dur="1.2"/> what worked <pause dur="0.4"/> why it worked <pause dur="1.9"/> and they'll give you suggestions for things to try <pause dur="0.7"/> so it's not <pause dur="0.5"/> knock you feedback it's <pause dur="0.2"/> useful feedback <pause dur="0.9"/> and even more importantly at the end <pause dur="0.5"/> of the course <pause dur="0.2"/> they should give you some structured written feedback as well <pause dur="0.6"/> so that you can take that and put it in your portfolio <pause dur="0.9"/> and you've got a record of that work you've done <pause dur="5.5"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> so <pause dur="1.0"/> that structured written feedback how do we do it <pause dur="2.0"/> i'm going to rush through this bit <pause dur="0.6"/> because it's <pause dur="1.3"/> it's important but <pause dur="0.5"/> it's also something that probably not <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="1.1"/> you'll want to know all the details very at some stage but not here <pause dur="1.6"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> here we use a thing called <pause dur="0.5"/> we call it the LAP <pause dur="0.5"/> it's called the <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> Assessment Package <pause dur="2.4"/> this is the <pause dur="0.3"/> the assessment tool that's used in all the exams in the <gap reason="name" extent="2 words"/> Medical School <pause dur="0.9"/> and <pause dur="0.8"/> it's a way of measuring <pause dur="0.5"/> how you perform when you're talking to

assessment package <pause dur="2.5"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> now <pause dur="0.4"/> we only <pause dur="0.3"/> look at what you do <pause dur="0.5"/> in two parts of talking to patients <pause dur="0.6"/> we're not going to be judging you on how you make a diagnosis <pause dur="0.5"/> at this stage <pause dur="0.5"/> but we do look at your behaviour and relationship <pause dur="0.6"/> with patients <pause dur="3.8"/> and your tutor will tell you whether you are <pause dur="0.3"/> maintaining a friendly but professional relationship with patients <pause dur="0.9"/> whether you are conveying sensitivity to the needs of patients <pause dur="2.7"/> and whether you are communicating <pause dur="0.5"/> an awareness that their attitude <pause dur="0.5"/> actually matters <pause dur="0.3"/> towards creating <pause dur="0.2"/> a shared <pause dur="0.5"/> approach <pause dur="2.4"/> you'll also <pause dur="1.1"/> be being judged <pause dur="0.3"/> or being given feedback on your interviewing and history taking <pause dur="0.6"/> skills <pause dur="0.6"/> and there are a lot of criteria here so i'll it's on to the next slide and it's a rather crowded slide and i apologize for that <pause dur="4.7"/><kinesic desc="changes slide" iterated="n"/> you're expected to become fluent at introducing yourself <pause dur="1.0"/> putting patients at ease <pause dur="1.7"/> allowing a patient to tell their story <pause dur="3.0"/> checking out words that the patient uses that you're not sure quite what that patient means <pause dur="0.7"/> so that
