<u who="nm0237"> so can we start now please <pause dur="0.2"/> just past nine o'clock <pause dur="0.4"/> can i remind you today before we start the official lecture that you've got video discussion sessions <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> the third <trunc>grou</trunc> the third # period here <pause dur="0.7"/> okay same rooms but different members of staff <pause dur="0.5"/> we will be discussing the tests and so on i think you might have found this test perhaps more difficult than the previous one but # <pause dur="0.3"/> after all you are beginning to learn more of the subject so # <pause dur="0.4"/> please # make sure that you go through it <pause dur="1.8"/> okay so let's start with # <pause dur="0.3"/> the subject then <pause dur="2.9"/> can i have hush please at the back <pause dur="1.5"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> we're dealing with if you remember <pause dur="1.2"/> the lymph nodes okay <pause dur="0.4"/> and especially we were talking about stimulation <pause dur="0.5"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="3"/> of <pause dur="0.9"/> B-cells <pause dur="3.9"/> which occur in the lymph node <pause dur="0.9"/><kinesic desc="puts on transparency" iterated="n"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> if you take a typical lymph node <pause dur="0.6"/> whereabouts in the <pause dur="0.2"/> lymph node do you normally find B-cell activity <pause dur="4.2"/> cortex paracortex medulla </u><pause dur="0.4"/> <u who="ss" trans="pause"> <gap reason="inaudible, multiple speakers" extent="1 sec"/> </u><u who="nm0237" trans="latching"> sorry </u><pause dur="0.6"/> <u who="ss" trans="pause"> <gap reason="inaudible, multiple speakers" extent="1 sec"/></u> <u who="nm0237" trans="overlap"> cortex okay <pause dur="1.3"/> mainly <pause dur="0.7"/> occurring in these follicles the secondary follicles here <pause dur="0.6"/> which we've 
discussed before but also there's some B-cell activity <pause dur="0.4"/> outside of the follicles <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> still in the cortex in the sort of <pause dur="0.2"/> non-follicular area if you like as well so there's <pause dur="0.3"/> activity <pause dur="0.3"/> in both zones but <pause dur="0.3"/> predominantly <pause dur="0.2"/> it's in the follicles <pause dur="0.9"/> so this picture don't <pause dur="0.3"/> bother to <pause dur="3.1"/> don't bother to try to copy it down but this tries to show an enlarged picture <pause dur="0.3"/> of the cortex area here and the paracortex area <pause dur="0.5"/> showing a follicle here <pause dur="0.6"/> with a germinal centre which is where you find the B-cells proliferating <pause dur="1.0"/> and also the sort of <pause dur="0.5"/> cortex outside of the follicle round here <pause dur="0.3"/> and you'll notice in both that it pictures <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> macrophages which are in effect antigen presenting cells <pause dur="0.3"/> and also <pause dur="0.3"/> these follicular dendritic cells which again <pause dur="0.3"/> are antigen presenting cells remember <pause dur="0.4"/> A-P-Cs <pause dur="2.9"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="3"/> antigen presenting cells <pause dur="1.8"/> and # <pause dur="1.4"/> there does appear to be B-cell stimulation in both areas but the B-cells <pause dur="0.3"/> in the follicles are different to those <pause dur="0.3"/> outside of the follicles <pause dur="0.5"/> in fact <pause dur="0.2"/> in the 
follicles <pause dur="3.3"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="7"/> you have cells which are called <pause dur="0.6"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="3"/> B-two cells <pause dur="3.2"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> outside <pause dur="2.0"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="4"/> you have <pause dur="0.5"/> B-one cells and they do <pause dur="0.2"/> appear to respond to different types of antigen okay so there's <pause dur="0.3"/> two sorts of B-cells in the follicles B-two cells <pause dur="0.4"/> outside of the follicles B-one cells still in the cortex <pause dur="0.4"/> but they do appear to respond to <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> different <pause dur="0.2"/> sorts of <pause dur="0.2"/> antigen <pause dur="3.5"/> and <pause dur="0.6"/> if you look <pause dur="0.3"/> in these <pause dur="0.6"/> especially in the follicles then <pause dur="0.5"/> you will find B-cells proliferating you get mytosis and maturation and so on <pause dur="0.7"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> the memory cells will stay there <pause dur="0.4"/> but remember the plasma cells once they're produced the plasma cells secreting the antibodies <pause dur="0.4"/> will go to the medulla area <pause dur="0.2"/> and secrete the <pause dur="0.2"/> antibody from there <pause dur="0.5"/> okay there we can to go the medulla area <pause dur="0.6"/> and also they may go off to other lymph nodes and so on <pause dur="2.5"/> okay so <pause dur="0.4"/> what we want to know now <pause dur="0.4"/> is to <pause dur="0.4"/> to <pause dur="0.5"/> try to <pause dur="0.2"/> answer the question <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> how does antigen stimulate a B-cell <pause dur="0.3"/> how do the B-cells <pause dur="0.2"/> become stimulated to produce antibodies so really today's 
lecture <pause dur="0.3"/> is about this topic about how B-cells become stimulated <pause dur="0.4"/> by antigen <pause dur="0.6"/> ultimately to produce <pause dur="0.4"/> # antibodies <pause dur="0.7"/> and # <pause dur="0.3"/> i would say right from the start that i don't think anyone knows the complete story <pause dur="0.5"/> # but # one can make pointers <pause dur="0.3"/> in that direction <pause dur="2.2"/> so <pause dur="0.2"/> okay <pause dur="1.1"/> you get lots of different forms of antigen there's no doubt Professor <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/>'s told you <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> and <pause dur="1.0"/> some of them <pause dur="0.3"/> are <pause dur="0.5"/> able to stimulate some of these antigens are able to stimulate <pause dur="0.2"/> B-cells directly <pause dur="1.7"/> this picture <pause dur="0.8"/> outlines how this <pause dur="0.3"/> might be <pause dur="0.6"/> here's <kinesic desc="indicates point on board" iterated="n"/> a B-cell <pause dur="0.3"/> remember it's got <pause dur="0.2"/> I-G on its surface <pause dur="0.7"/> immuno-globulin molecules on its surface <pause dur="0.5"/> and one way <pause dur="0.5"/> is for antigen <pause dur="0.4"/> to <pause dur="0.2"/> cross-link <pause dur="0.3"/> these <pause dur="0.5"/> I-G molecules directly cross-linking <pause dur="0.4"/> so you've in fact <pause dur="0.7"/> got a polymeric <pause dur="0.3"/> form of antigen an antigen which contains lots of repeater units so that <pause dur="0.9"/> all these groups on the outside remember <pause dur="0.3"/> will have to be the same to attach to the I-G on any one B-cell because all these receptors are the same okay <pause dur="0.4"/> so it's a polymeric molecule repeating molecule <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> 
which can stimulate B-cells directly <pause dur="0.7"/> and <pause dur="0.3"/> in fact <pause dur="0.2"/><vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/> what happens is in all these cases <pause dur="0.6"/> that <pause dur="0.2"/> if you've got a B-cell <pause dur="1.1"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="9"/> with its <pause dur="0.7"/> Y-chains on the surface like that i'm not going to draw them all but all round <pause dur="1.0"/> what happens is <pause dur="0.3"/> the antigen <pause dur="0.9"/> has to cross-link <pause dur="1.8"/> individual I-G molecules it has to link <pause dur="0.6"/> at least two together and obviously you see in that first case <pause dur="0.4"/> you've got <pause dur="0.2"/> cross-linking between a lot <pause dur="0.3"/> of <pause dur="0.2"/> these molecules <pause dur="1.2"/> and <pause dur="0.8"/> all the once this happens <pause dur="0.2"/> all the I-G is taken to one end of the cell <pause dur="1.4"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="5"/> a process called capping <pause dur="2.4"/> the I-G with the antigen on it goes to one end of the cell <pause dur="0.4"/> and then <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="6"/> it's taken into the cell <pause dur="0.6"/> by endocytosis <pause dur="1.7"/> so you get capping and endocytosis and that's what <pause dur="0.3"/> appears to stimulate <pause dur="0.5"/> the B-cell <pause dur="0.5"/> okay <pause dur="0.6"/> material <pause dur="0.3"/> has to cross-link the I-G <pause dur="0.4"/> taken into the cell after it goes to one end <pause dur="1.0"/> like that <pause dur="2.6"/> so <pause dur="0.5"/> one method is to use polymeric <pause dur="0.3"/> molecules <pause dur="0.9"/> the second method <pause dur="0.4"/> is apparently you can get <pause dur="0.4"/> equivalent stimulation by <pause dur="0.4"/> antigen 
binding to a <pause dur="0.5"/> a a an I-G chain <pause dur="0.5"/> but also <pause dur="0.7"/> a mitogenic effect that also appears to be able to stimulate a B-cell you get some cross-linking of Y-chains <pause dur="0.3"/> but also <pause dur="0.3"/> linkage to a mitogenic receptor <pause dur="0.2"/> on the B-cell <pause dur="1.6"/> and the third sort of <pause dur="0.3"/> response is where again you get cross-linking but you get some complement binding as well remember B-cells have a complement receptor on you don't know what complement is yet except it's a polypeptide <pause dur="0.7"/> but that can attach to the antigen so you get <pause dur="0.4"/> multiple linking <pause dur="0.4"/> I-G linking there <pause dur="0.2"/> immuno-globulin linking there <pause dur="0.3"/> and complement linking there <pause dur="0.6"/> and that <pause dur="0.2"/> also <pause dur="0.3"/> will encourage this procedure <pause dur="0.5"/> to start to occur so there's at least three sorts of bonding <pause dur="0.4"/> polymeric <pause dur="0.6"/> mitogenic <pause dur="0.5"/> complement <pause dur="0.2"/> bonding <pause dur="7.9"/><kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="9"/> so <pause dur="1.0"/> i'll give you <pause dur="0.2"/> some examples of this <pause dur="0.5"/> on a <pause dur="0.5"/> an overhead <pause dur="0.3"/> and you can <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="1.6"/> copy them down <pause dur="1.9"/> so <pause dur="0.7"/> antigen <pause dur="0.6"/> can directly stimulate B-cells <pause dur="0.5"/> you can have <pause dur="0.5"/> polymeric <pause dur="0.3"/> molecules long linear molecules <pause dur="0.3"/> usually <pause dur="0.3"/> relatively firm ones and examples of those <pause dur="0.4"/> are pneumococcal <pause dur="0.2"/> 
polysaccharides of <pause dur="0.6"/> # bacteria <pause dur="0.8"/> # diamino acid polymers <pause dur="0.2"/> and also artificial <pause dur="0.4"/> # compounds like polyvinyl pyrrolidone <pause dur="1.1"/> pyrrolidine sorry <pause dur="1.2"/> okay <pause dur="0.2"/> and they cross-link <pause dur="0.2"/> the antigen receptors to the B on the B-cell <pause dur="0.2"/> just as the first example i gave you <pause dur="0.8"/> an example of a mitogenic one of bacterial lipopolysaccharides <pause dur="2.8"/> they bind to the antigen receptor on the B-cell possibly more than one Y-chain but they also seem to <pause dur="0.3"/> offer a mitogenic stimulus <pause dur="1.0"/> and then thirdly <pause dur="0.5"/> you can activate <pause dur="0.2"/> via complement binding <pause dur="0.7"/> no specific example <pause dur="50.7"/> now these <pause dur="0.3"/> antigens they're probably <pause dur="0.4"/> the exception rather than the rule they're <pause dur="0.4"/> perhaps somewhat strange <pause dur="0.2"/> antigens in the sense that they can stimulate B-cells directly <pause dur="0.6"/> and <pause dur="0.4"/> it appears that predominantly the sort of B-cell that is stimulated <pause dur="0.5"/> are these ones <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="7"/> that are <pause dur="0.4"/> outside of the follicles <pause dur="1.5"/> they seem to be the sort <pause dur="0.2"/> that <pause dur="0.4"/> can be stimulated directly <pause dur="0.4"/> without any other assistance <pause dur="0.3"/> probably macrophages present <pause dur="0.2"/> this stuff <pause dur="0.6"/> this antigen <pause dur="0.4"/> to the B-cells <pause dur="0.3"/> 
but they don't seem to need any further assistance to <pause dur="0.3"/> produce <pause dur="0.6"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> a an antibody response <pause dur="2.3"/> but the vast majority <pause dur="0.2"/> of <pause dur="1.2"/> antigens are poor direct <pause dur="0.2"/> B-cell stimulators most of them are poor <pause dur="0.4"/> things <pause dur="0.3"/> like <pause dur="0.6"/> a lot of parasites for example <pause dur="0.4"/> like sheep red blood cells which are <trunc>l</trunc> <pause dur="0.2"/> used in a lot of immune experiments and so on <pause dur="0.4"/> these are relatively poor direct <pause dur="0.4"/> B-cell stimulators they don't <pause dur="0.2"/> do this sort of thing <pause dur="0.5"/> and also <pause dur="0.3"/> a lot of antigens <pause dur="0.3"/> are <pause dur="0.5"/> degradable <pause dur="0.6"/> 
and so <pause dur="0.2"/> are not present <pause dur="0.2"/> and able to activate the B-cell <pause dur="0.3"/> for fairly lengthy periods of time so <pause dur="0.3"/> the predominant <pause dur="0.4"/> B-cell's <pause dur="0.6"/> # stimulation is not by the sort of antigen which i've already mentioned <pause dur="1.3"/> so the majority <pause dur="0.4"/> of <pause dur="0.2"/> antigens <pause dur="0.2"/> the majority of antigens <pause dur="0.3"/> for instance sheep red blood cells as i say which is sort of thing that immunologists have tended to use <pause dur="0.6"/> do not have the above molecular characteristics they're not linear they're not mitogenic <pause dur="0.3"/> they might well not bind complements in any sort of way <pause dur="0.8"/> but you still get immune responses against 
these other antigens okay they're not of this character up here but you still get <pause dur="0.2"/> these responses <pause dur="1.2"/> and <pause dur="0.4"/> what you find is <pause dur="0.6"/> that <pause dur="1.0"/> the first three sorts these # <pause dur="0.6"/> # polymeric mitogenic or complement binding ones <pause dur="0.9"/> tend not to use <pause dur="0.4"/> any cells that are derived from the thymus they don't depend upon T-cells <pause dur="0.5"/> so <pause dur="0.7"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="3"/> no T-cells required <pause dur="0.3"/> okay <pause dur="1.1"/> but <pause dur="0.6"/> for the majority of antigens like sheep blood cells if you're going to get an immune response against them <pause dur="0.5"/> you need some T-helper cells <pause dur="1.4"/> you need <pause dur="1.6"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="4"/> T-helper cells <pause dur="3.8"/> to get a significant immune response <pause dur="0.6"/> and therefore <pause dur="0.4"/> the majority of antigens like sheep red blood cells <pause dur="0.2"/> are called thymus-dependent antigens <pause dur="0.6"/> so the first three groups are thymus-independent antigens don't need T-cells to help the B-cells <pause dur="0.5"/> the last group <pause dur="0.3"/> are thymus-dependent antigens <pause dur="0.5"/> needing <pause dur="0.4"/> T-cells to help the B-cell <pause dur="1.6"/> and these are <pause dur="0.5"/> predominantly the ones that occur in the follicles <pause dur="0.3"/> these B-two B-cell <pause dur="3.8"/> okay <pause dur="0.3"/> so <pause dur="0.6"/> what we'll spend most of today really 
talking about <pause dur="0.2"/> is the main <trunc>re</trunc> sort of response that you get with # <pause dur="0.5"/> as i say in the follicles <pause dur="0.5"/> and <pause dur="0.7"/> they'll be involving <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="5"/> B-cells <pause dur="0.9"/> they'll be involving T-helper cells <pause dur="0.8"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> also <pause dur="0.3"/> antigen presenting cells are important <pause dur="0.4"/> in this story <pause dur="3.0"/> okay so <pause dur="0.9"/> this is all happening then <pause dur="0.6"/> inside <pause dur="1.0"/> the lymph node follicle or the equivalent area in the spleen or wherever in these follicles <pause dur="0.3"/> in there <pause dur="0.3"/> and you've got these <pause dur="0.3"/> follicular dendritic cells <pause dur="0.4"/> which are at least one form of antigen presenting cell <pause dur="0.4"/> in there <pause dur="4.2"/><kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="9"/> so <pause dur="0.2"/> how do we know that T-cells were involved <pause dur="1.3"/> well there's some evidence right from the start remember i showed you <pause dur="0.7"/> this last time <pause dur="1.3"/> # <pause dur="0.4"/> where we had chickens <pause dur="0.8"/> they'd taken <pause dur="0.3"/> out the thymus or the bursa at birth <pause dur="0.2"/> or had left them intact <pause dur="0.7"/> and remember <pause dur="0.7"/> that when you measure the antibody production <pause dur="1.3"/> taking out the bursa taking out the B-cells <pause dur="0.7"/> antibodies taken out completely <pause dur="1.4"/> if you take out the thymus you get a bit of antibody production but it's not as good as if you leave both systems in together so clearly 
the T-cells are playing a role <pause dur="0.5"/> even <pause dur="0.3"/> in that <pause dur="0.2"/> experiment there <pause dur="1.4"/> but you can go further than that <pause dur="0.3"/> you can use <pause dur="0.3"/><kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="2"/> mice and do various nasty things to them <pause dur="0.5"/> and you can show that T-cells and B-cells are important <pause dur="2.7"/> okay <pause dur="0.3"/> so <pause dur="0.4"/> let's consider the situation of a lethally irradiated mouse <pause dur="0.4"/> this is <trunc>wa</trunc> a mouse a mouse of an inbred strain so you can <pause dur="0.5"/> have lots of different mice almost all the same <pause dur="0.5"/> and they've been irradiated <pause dur="0.6"/> and <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> they would die shortly afterwards but okay they'd probably die anyway of something or other <pause dur="0.5"/> but what happens to them is that the irradiation <pause dur="0.2"/> knocks out <pause dur="0.5"/> lots of # <pause dur="0.2"/> different cell types including the lymphocytes <pause dur="0.4"/> okay so irradiation <pause dur="0.3"/> knocks out the lymphocytes <pause dur="0.6"/> and then you can take these mice and you can repopulate them with <pause dur="0.3"/> lymphocytes <pause dur="0.3"/> from the same inbred strain of mice <pause dur="0.6"/> their <pause dur="0.2"/> their # <pause dur="0.3"/> brothers and sisters and so on <pause dur="0.4"/> and remember if it's an inbred strain these mice are all genetically identical <pause dur="0.4"/> so really transferring the cells from one mouse to another <pause dur="0.3"/> will not 
make any difference there shouldn't be any nasty responses as a result <pause dur="0.6"/> okay so you've got some lethally irradiated mice <pause dur="0.6"/> and <pause dur="0.4"/> you <pause dur="0.2"/> populate them <pause dur="0.2"/> with <pause dur="0.3"/> or repopulate them with lymphocytes of different sorts <pause dur="0.6"/> and give them an antigen <pause dur="0.2"/> sheep red blood cells S-R-B-C <pause dur="1.1"/> so you inoculate <pause dur="0.2"/> one mouse <pause dur="0.3"/> or possibly if it's experimental you'd have to have some replicates of course <pause dur="0.5"/> inoculate T-cells <pause dur="0.2"/> and sheep red blood cells <pause dur="0.4"/> you don't get any antigen <pause dur="0.2"/> any antibodies pretty obviously <pause dur="1.9"/> if you inoculate them with B-cells <pause dur="1.7"/> you take your mouse <pause dur="0.3"/> your lethally irradiated mouse <pause dur="0.6"/> put in some B-cells <pause dur="0.5"/> and then give it sheep red blood cells as the antigen <pause dur="0.5"/> you get a bit of I-G-M <pause dur="0.4"/> and no I-G-G <pause dur="1.0"/> little bit of I-G-M not very much <pause dur="0.3"/> and some I-G-G <pause dur="2.5"/> and <pause dur="0.5"/> you do the third experiment <pause dur="0.7"/> this lucky mouse gets both T and B-cells <pause dur="1.3"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> you give it sheep red blood cells <pause dur="0.6"/> and it produces a lot of I-G-M <pause dur="0.2"/> and I-G-G <pause dur="0.7"/> which suggests that although the B-cells <pause dur="0.4"/> do produce <pause dur="0.2"/> antibodies <pause dur="0.5"/> you need some help <pause dur="0.2"/> from T-cells <pause dur="0.4"/> to produce adequate 
quantities of antibodies <pause dur="0.3"/> that is these T-helper cells <pause dur="0.3"/> are required <pause dur="0.2"/> T-helper cells <pause dur="0.3"/> are required <pause dur="5.1"/> and <pause dur="0.3"/> the same sort of thing <pause dur="2.0"/> can happen <pause dur="0.4"/> in <pause dur="1.1"/> mice which are genetically deprived of their thymus <pause dur="1.5"/> in the mouse world there are some mice known as <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="4"/> <pause dur="3.2"/> nude mice jolly chilly but they they certainly <pause dur="0.2"/> haven't got any hair <pause dur="1.6"/> nude mice have no hair but that's not the important thing <pause dur="0.6"/> the important things about nude mice is that they don't have a thymus <pause dur="0.7"/> they're <pause dur="0.3"/> thymus-deficient they're athymic as it's called <pause dur="4.6"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="1"/> oops <pause dur="0.9"/> pen seems to be on the way out <pause dur="1.8"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="4"/> athymic <pause dur="2.3"/> genetically don't have a thymus <pause dur="0.4"/> so they've got B-cells <pause dur="1.3"/> but no T-cells so they're a bit like these mice here although they're not at death's door <pause dur="0.8"/> but they haven't got a thymus <pause dur="0.5"/> but if you get some nude mice <pause dur="0.3"/> and put T-cells into them from <pause dur="0.3"/> another inbred mouse which is normal very similar to them but normal <pause dur="0.8"/> then <pause dur="0.2"/> these <pause dur="0.2"/> athymic mice these nude mice instead of <pause dur="0.3"/> not producing antibodies <pause dur="0.3"/> will suddenly start to produce antibodies so 
you can give nude mice <pause dur="0.2"/> which haven't got their T-cells so you give them T-cells of the right sort <pause dur="0.6"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> they'll start to produce antibodies whereas they didn't produce antibodies before <pause dur="1.6"/> so <pause dur="1.0"/> T-cells and B-cells then <pause dur="0.3"/> have to cooperate to produce an immune response <pause dur="3.6"/> okay <pause dur="1.2"/> so what about macrophages <pause dur="0.5"/> antigen presenting cells <pause dur="0.6"/> and similar sorts of <pause dur="0.4"/><kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="14"/> # cells <pause dur="0.6"/> are possibly important as well <pause dur="0.9"/> and you can show this by <pause dur="0.2"/> various <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> culture experiments <pause dur="1.3"/> as is shown <pause dur="0.2"/> here <pause dur="3.0"/> you can separate out the spleen cells <pause dur="0.5"/> don't worry about the technique but you can separate spleen cells out <pause dur="0.9"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> you can <pause dur="0.5"/> # <pause dur="0.8"/> isolate them and grow them in culture and so on quite happily in a petri dish <pause dur="0.7"/> as i say the <trunc>metho</trunc> <pause dur="0.3"/> the methodology doesn't matter <pause dur="0.5"/> you can divide them into two populations you can divide them <pause dur="0.3"/> into those that stick to glass <pause dur="0.2"/> glass adherent <pause dur="0.3"/> cells <pause dur="0.4"/> and you can <pause dur="0.3"/> also have <pause dur="0.4"/> non-glass adherent cells <pause dur="0.8"/> and the glass adherent cells are the macrophages they have the ability to stick to glass or plastic <pause dur="0.4"/> as long 
as it's clean <pause dur="0.9"/> and <pause dur="0.4"/> non-glass adherent cells will include the lymphocytes <pause dur="2.1"/> okay so you take your mouse <pause dur="0.2"/> you take out the spleen you separate the cells <pause dur="0.6"/> and you do the following experiment <pause dur="0.7"/> again using sheep red blood cells if you like as the antigen <pause dur="0.2"/> perfectly possible <pause dur="0.8"/> so you take your mouse spleen cells <pause dur="1.2"/> you divide them into three lots you have a complete set <pause dur="0.8"/> you have some glass adherent ones <pause dur="0.5"/> and you have glass non-adherent ones <pause dur="1.8"/> and if you have the complete cells you present these cells with sheep red blood cells as the antigen <pause dur="0.7"/> you get antibodies produced in due course <pause dur="2.5"/> you have the glass adherent ones <pause dur="0.5"/> you present antigen <pause dur="0.9"/> no antibody <pause dur="1.0"/> you have <pause dur="0.2"/> glass non-adherent ones <pause dur="0.3"/> you present antigen <pause dur="0.3"/> you get no antibody <pause dur="1.0"/> if you remix the sets the glass adherent ones and glass non-adherent ones <pause dur="0.6"/> you get antibody produced <pause dur="0.8"/> so clearly glass adherent cells <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> are necessary for the production of antibody <pause dur="0.6"/> but no one would say that macrophages actually produce it but they're clearly important for 
its production <pause dur="0.4"/> and so <pause dur="0.6"/> the glass non-adherent ones <pause dur="0.3"/> need the glass adherent ones <pause dur="0.3"/> to make the antibody macrophages are needed to produce antibody <pause dur="2.6"/> 
so these are cells <pause dur="0.2"/> from a <pause dur="0.6"/> line of mice <pause dur="0.8"/> from <pause dur="0.3"/> strain of mice <pause dur="1.5"/> and <pause dur="1.8"/> so they're all from one mouse basically you can take <pause dur="0.5"/> one <pause dur="0.4"/> spleen of one mouse and do this experiment <pause dur="1.3"/> and <pause dur="3.2"/><kinesic desc="adjusts transparency" iterated="y" dur="17"/> not sure this is going to work actually <pause dur="0.2"/> okay <pause dur="0.9"/> # <pause dur="3.0"/> move it up a bit <pause dur="0.2"/> sorry we'll take the top off here <pause dur="7.4"/> so these are all all <pause dur="1.7"/> the same <pause dur="0.9"/> all <pause dur="0.3"/> cells from one mouse <pause dur="0.9"/> and so because they're from one mouse they're all going to have the same <pause dur="0.3"/> M-H-C group <pause dur="0.5"/> let's say for the sake of argument <pause dur="0.5"/> they're all <pause dur="0.2"/> H-two-K <pause dur="0.5"/> they're all of the M-H-C same M-H-C type <pause dur="0.4"/> major histocompatibility complex remember <pause dur="3.3"/> <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="3"/> all cells <pause dur="0.2"/> from one animal <pause dur="0.3"/> will have the <trunc>sem</trunc> same M-H-C type <pause dur="2.1"/> and similarly with an inbred strain of mice if you got a lot of siblings of one inbred strain they'll all be of the same M-H-C type so you could take <pause dur="0.4"/> the glass adherent <pause dur="0.3"/> cells from one mouse <pause dur="0.4"/> and the 
glass non-adherent cells from another mouse all of the same inbred line <pause dur="0.2"/> and you'd still get the same response when you mix them <pause dur="0.3"/> you've got <pause dur="0.4"/> antibodies produced <pause dur="2.4"/> but if we do a devious experiment where we take <pause dur="1.3"/> two lines of mice <pause dur="0.4"/> one of one M-H-C type <pause dur="0.4"/> and one of another M-H-C type <pause dur="0.5"/> say <pause dur="0.3"/> H-two-K <pause dur="0.4"/> and H-two-D <pause dur="0.9"/> and then we try and get the cells to cooperate <pause dur="2.1"/> as in below the line here <pause dur="1.7"/> okay <pause dur="0.7"/> so you've got glass adherent cells which are H-two-K from one mouse which is H-two-K <pause dur="0.6"/> glass non-adherent cells <pause dur="0.3"/> from a mouse which is H-two-D now <pause dur="0.9"/> and you put them together <pause dur="2.5"/> you don't get any antibodies produced <pause dur="0.7"/> you don't get antibodies produced <pause dur="0.5"/> when the macrophages and the lymphocytes <pause dur="0.3"/> come from <pause dur="0.2"/> mice of different <pause dur="0.2"/> M-H-C type <pause dur="2.8"/> and this is what is called <pause dur="0.7"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="8"/> M-H-C-two <pause dur="0.4"/> or <pause dur="0.2"/> sorry M-H-C restriction <pause dur="3.2"/> the response is M-H-C restricted <pause dur="0.8"/> okay <pause dur="2.3"/> because the macrophages <pause dur="0.7"/> and the lymphocytes have to be of the same <pause dur="0.2"/> M-H-C type <pause dur="0.2"/> and in fact <pause dur="0.3"/> it's M-H-C-two restricted <pause dur="1.0"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="3"/> because it's that molecule <pause dur="0.4"/> 
which is the important one <pause dur="0.2"/> it's the M-H-C-two molecules that are important <pause dur="0.5"/> for reasons which i <pause dur="0.7"/> won't explain in detail here but will become obvious a bit later on so it's M-H-C-two <pause dur="0.3"/> restriction that's applying here <pause dur="0.7"/> it <pause dur="0.3"/> the cells <pause dur="0.2"/> have to be of the same <pause dur="0.3"/> M-H-C <trunc>ti</trunc> type <pause dur="0.5"/> before you get <pause dur="0.2"/> the response <pause dur="3.9"/><kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="8"/> okay <pause dur="0.5"/> so <pause dur="2.3"/> what goes on <pause dur="0.9"/> between these cells you've got three sorts of cells you got T-helper cells <pause dur="0.3"/> you got <pause dur="0.3"/> antigen presenting cells or macrophages <pause dur="0.3"/> and you got B-cells <pause dur="0.3"/> and somehow you've got to get them together <pause dur="0.3"/> to make antibodies <pause dur="3.5"/> well <pause dur="1.9"/> early on <pause dur="1.8"/> the theory was <pause dur="0.4"/> that you got a response <pause dur="0.2"/> something like this this is what you would find <pause dur="0.5"/> in many early <pause dur="0.3"/> textbooks <pause dur="3.8"/> you have <pause dur="0.7"/> an antigen here <pause dur="1.3"/> which consists of <pause dur="0.6"/> a complicated molecule <pause dur="1.7"/> it could for instance consist of a carrier protein such as <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.6"/> chicken gamma globulin <pause dur="3.6"/> <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="8"/> can somebody stop talking at the back please <pause dur="3.2"/> chicken gamma globulin C-G-G <pause dur="0.7"/> and <pause dur="0.6"/> it's known that you can make artificial antigens by sticking a <pause dur="0.2"/> the small 
molecular group on <pause dur="0.3"/> called a hapten <pause dur="0.6"/> for instance dinitrophenol <pause dur="0.8"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="6"/> and i expect <pause dur="1.3"/> Professor <gap reason="name" extent="1 word"/> has told you about that <pause dur="2.2"/> dinitrophenol <pause dur="0.6"/> and it's known that the antibody will recognize the dinitrophenol <pause dur="0.3"/> as long as it's attached to a carrier molecule if it's free on its own <pause dur="0.4"/> the B-cell won't recognize it <pause dur="0.3"/> the B-cell won't recognize the dinitrophenol on its own <pause dur="0.4"/> but it'll recognize it and make antibodies <pause dur="0.3"/> if it's <trunc>atch</trunc> attached to chicken gamma globulin <pause dur="2.1"/> and of course the hapten <pause dur="0.4"/> could be replaced in nature <pause dur="0.8"/> by a normal epitope antigenic determinant <pause dur="0.7"/> so the picture was something like this that you had T-helper cells recognizing one end of the molecule <pause dur="1.4"/> the B-cell recognizing the bit that one's interested in against which will make the antibody <pause dur="0.5"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> the T-helper cell <pause dur="0.2"/> helps the B-cell <pause dur="0.4"/> whatever help might mean <pause dur="4.7"/> okay and that's described by the way in Weir and # Stewart <pause dur="0.4"/> thirty-nine and page thirty-nine and forty <pause dur="0.5"/> and Roitt Brostoff and Male <pause dur="0.2"/> on pages one-four-two 
and one-four-three if you're interested in that <pause dur="3.3"/> so that was the early picture <pause dur="1.3"/> you've got the T-helper cell and the B-cell cooperating <pause dur="3.3"/> but you've got a third sort of cell an antigen presenting cell and can anyone see what the problem is <pause dur="5.9"/> remembering <pause dur="0.4"/> that obviously this gap here <pause dur="0.3"/> is vastly magnified i mean this T-helper cell would be much closer to the B-cell than i've shown but can anyone see <pause dur="0.4"/> what the problem is <pause dur="1.2"/> if you got the third cell as well coming into it <pause dur="2.7"/> pretty naive <pause dur="1.1"/> problem really but you may not notice it <pause dur="2.6"/> you can't haven't got enough space for anything to be going on because this T-helper cell will be close to the B-cell <pause dur="0.3"/> how do you get a macrophage putting its paw in so to speak or its # <pause dur="0.2"/> # pseudopodium in <pause dur="0.5"/> to <pause dur="0.6"/> get <pause dur="0.2"/> this <pause dur="0.2"/> to get into contact with the antigen so there's <pause dur="0.4"/> something wrong with this story <pause dur="0.9"/> because there must be more to it than that because you've got a third cell <pause dur="0.3"/> and how does it make contact <pause dur="1.1"/> okay <pause dur="0.2"/> so let's try to explain <pause dur="0.4"/> what 
actually goes on <pause dur="1.8"/> let's start just by saying one or two things about <kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="7"/> antigen presenting cells <pause dur="1.2"/> you've seen this picture before <pause dur="2.2"/> but <pause dur="0.2"/> an antigen presenting cell <pause dur="4.2"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="26"/> can present <pause dur="0.2"/> antigen in a variety of ways it can present it on its surface <pause dur="1.2"/> just as a lump <pause dur="0.2"/> attached by say complement <pause dur="3.1"/> so you get the antigen presenting cell <pause dur="2.1"/> some complement <pause dur="1.4"/> and then the antigen stuck on the surface like that for example <pause dur="0.8"/> you could have <pause dur="0.3"/> # simple lumps of antigen presented in that way <pause dur="0.3"/> with complement <pause dur="0.5"/> but also <pause dur="0.4"/> you can have the antigen taken in <pause dur="0.3"/> and processed <pause dur="0.5"/> and <pause dur="0.3"/> remember <pause dur="0.2"/> during the processing it can be exposed or reprocessed and put on the surface <pause dur="0.8"/> in <pause dur="0.8"/> the cleft <pause dur="0.2"/> in the M-H-C-two molecule <pause dur="0.3"/> the M-H-C-two molecule <pause dur="0.3"/> is assembled inside <pause dur="0.4"/> # # <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> # little vacuoles inside the macrophage <pause dur="0.4"/> bits of antigen are stuck in the cleft <pause dur="0.3"/> it's exocytosed <pause dur="0.3"/> and exposed on the surface so <pause dur="0.5"/> presentation can be <pause dur="0.5"/> <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="6"/> in the form of <pause dur="0.2"/> M-H-C-two <pause dur="1.8"/> there's a bit of antigen <pause dur="0.4"/> in that <pause dur="0.3"/> cleft there <pause dur="0.3"/> a little bit of processed antigen this is much larger this bit here this is a little bit of processed antigen okay <pause dur="1.2"/> 
a few <pause dur="0.2"/> amino acids for example <pause dur="1.0"/> so there are at least two ways in which antigen presenting cells <pause dur="0.4"/> can <pause dur="0.3"/> present <pause dur="0.2"/> antigen <pause dur="0.2"/> on their surface <pause dur="1.8"/> so <pause dur="1.1"/> if you could look at the diagram that i gave the early-comers unfortunately i haven't got enough copies of it to go round i thought it was photocopied more than that i'll get you copies of it <pause dur="0.8"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> in time for the <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.7"/> video at <pause dur="0.2"/> eleven o'clock i'll get you some more copies of it <pause dur="0.6"/> but you've got a picture like this which summarizes what goes on <pause dur="0.8"/> and <pause dur="0.9"/> so just note <pause dur="0.2"/> could you that you've got <pause dur="0.3"/> a T-helper cell and the B-cell cooperating <pause dur="0.6"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> two antigen presenting cells <pause dur="0.3"/> here <pause dur="0.2"/> and here <pause dur="0.3"/> okay and we'll go through this story and if you haven't got the picture <pause dur="0.4"/> you can certainly get <pause dur="0.5"/> most of this copied down <pause dur="0.3"/> from the <pause dur="0.3"/> pictures as i put them up in sequence <pause dur="1.3"/> okay so let's go through the stages first of all talking about this side <pause dur="0.8"/> then this side <pause dur="0.3"/> and then <pause dur="0.2"/> the interaction 
between the two <pause dur="0.3"/> this side <pause dur="0.4"/> that side <pause dur="0.3"/> then the interaction between the two <pause dur="1.0"/> so let's start with the T-helper cell <pause dur="5.0"/> somewhere <pause dur="0.2"/> in the lymph node <pause dur="0.4"/> probably <pause dur="0.2"/> in the paracortex <pause dur="0.4"/> there are T-helper cells <pause dur="0.7"/> which will be <pause dur="1.1"/> specific <pause dur="0.4"/> for the antigen <pause dur="0.2"/> there's specificity of fit between the T-cell receptor <pause dur="0.3"/> and the antigen <pause dur="0.3"/> and the M-H-C-two molecule here <pause dur="0.2"/> okay <pause dur="0.5"/> you get <pause dur="0.3"/> specificity of fit <pause dur="0.9"/> there's a few of these T-helper cells <pause dur="0.3"/> somewhere <pause dur="0.3"/> in the paracortex of a lymph node <pause dur="1.1"/> and an antigen presenting cell <pause dur="0.6"/> presents this antigen then <pause dur="0.3"/> in combination with M-H-C-two <pause dur="0.3"/> on its surface <pause dur="1.3"/> and the T-cell receptor <pause dur="0.3"/> recognizes <pause dur="0.5"/> the <pause dur="0.2"/> antigen <pause dur="0.2"/> and the M-H-C <pause dur="0.8"/> like <pause dur="0.6"/> as is shown there there is a fit <pause dur="0.2"/> between the M-H-C and the antigen <pause dur="0.3"/> and the T-cell receptor <pause dur="0.3"/> there's also a subsidiary molecule <pause dur="0.3"/> C-D-four <pause dur="0.3"/> which helps the connection <pause dur="0.8"/> don't worry too much if you don't understand that at this stage <pause dur="0.4"/> i'll <trunc>ex</trunc> have to explain that to you <pause dur="0.3"/> in a later lecture <pause dur="2.0"/> so the T-helper cell <vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/><pause dur="0.8"/> connects up to the antigen presenting 
cell <pause dur="0.5"/> because of this specificity of fit across here <pause dur="1.2"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> messages are exchanged between the two cells that's what these squiggly arrows mean <pause dur="1.0"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> the T-helper cell <pause dur="0.3"/> becomes stimulated <pause dur="1.4"/> will undergo mitosis <pause dur="0.9"/> will undergo maturation <pause dur="0.3"/> and will produce a clone of daughter cells <pause dur="0.3"/> okay so the T-helper cell <pause dur="0.3"/> receives some of this antigen after it's processed by an antigen presenting cell <pause dur="0.6"/> showing it in in the M-H-C-two context <pause dur="1.0"/> and <pause dur="0.9"/> mitosis and maturation result <pause dur="0.4"/> and you'll notice M-H-C-two is important <pause dur="0.4"/> and that's why it's M-H-C-two restricted because <pause dur="0.3"/> the T-cell receptor <pause dur="0.3"/> will only recognize its own M-H-C-two sort <pause dur="0.5"/> so <pause dur="0.3"/> an H-two-K T-helper cell <pause dur="0.3"/> will recognize an H-two-K <pause dur="0.2"/> antigen presenting cell <pause dur="0.4"/> but an H-two-K T-helper cell <pause dur="0.3"/> will not recognize <pause dur="0.2"/> an H-two-D <pause dur="0.3"/> type <pause dur="0.2"/> antigen presenting cell that's why there's M-H-C-<pause dur="0.3"/>two restriction <pause dur="0.4"/> okay <pause dur="0.5"/> so <pause dur="0.3"/> the T-helper cell <pause dur="0.6"/> produces a clone of daughter cells <pause dur="0.2"/> as a result of that stimulation <pause dur="1.3"/> and some of them <pause dur="0.2"/> will probably migrate to those follicles that we keep talking 
about <pause dur="2.5"/> but remember it takes some time for this to take place it isn't an instantaneous thing <pause dur="0.5"/> for instance mitosis will take some time for a start <pause dur="0.8"/><vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/><pause dur="9.1"/> okay <pause dur="3.1"/> now <pause dur="1.0"/> let's go to the other side of the story <pause dur="1.8"/> this is <pause dur="0.5"/> in the follicle <pause dur="5.2"/> you've got an antigen presenting cell there like the dendritic follicular cell <pause dur="1.3"/> this time it presents antigen in a different way <pause dur="0.5"/> bound to the surface perhaps with the aid of complement or something or other <pause dur="0.4"/> but it presents a blob of antigen <pause dur="1.0"/> not in <pause dur="0.2"/> terms of M-H-C-two now but just <pause dur="0.6"/> on the surface so you've got a distinct blob of antigen <pause dur="0.7"/> presented to the B-cell <pause dur="1.0"/> you get cross-linking as i said early on <pause dur="0.5"/> the I-G cross-links <pause dur="0.4"/> capping <pause dur="0.4"/> endocytosis <pause dur="1.6"/> and the antigen molecule or # it's more than a molecule it's a lump <pause dur="0.4"/> is taken into the B-cell <pause dur="0.9"/> okay the antigen's taken into the B-cell <pause dur="0.6"/> and it's broken up <pause dur="0.3"/> it's broken up into small fragments <pause dur="2.5"/> that's what this is supposed to represent this is broken up into that <pause dur="1.1"/> and these small fragments are small 
enough <pause dur="0.4"/> to be expressed <pause dur="0.4"/> on the M-H-C-two molecule <pause dur="0.3"/> on the B-cell <pause dur="1.3"/> okay so the B-cell <pause dur="0.3"/> has M-H-C-two molecules just like that antigen presenting cell that we had over this side before <pause dur="0.8"/> and <pause dur="0.4"/> it expresses bits of <pause dur="0.5"/> antigen <pause dur="0.2"/> in the M-H-C-two cleft <pause dur="2.2"/> so the B-cell <pause dur="0.2"/> has started to <pause dur="0.4"/> be doing things with the antigen <pause dur="0.8"/> and you'll notice that this response down here <pause dur="0.2"/> is not M-H-C-two restricted because there's no M-H-C-two involved down here <pause dur="0.4"/> there's M-H-C-two up here <pause dur="0.3"/> but not down here <pause dur="1.6"/><vocal desc="clears throat" iterated="n"/><pause dur="12.3"/> so <pause dur="0.2"/> the B-cell <pause dur="0.2"/> has started to process the antigen for which it is specific <pause dur="1.0"/> and it's presented some of this antigen in its M-H-C-two <pause dur="1.9"/> and so <pause dur="1.0"/> when these T-helper cells come along <pause dur="1.9"/> which <pause dur="0.5"/> is a bit of a mind-boggling event because how does a rare cell meet another rare cell i don't know <pause dur="0.5"/> but this is what is said to occur <pause dur="2.1"/> you've got this B-cell now with the antigen in its cleft <pause dur="0.3"/> it recognizes a T-helper cell which has still got the same T-cell receptor specific for it it's the same one as <pause dur="0.3"/> recognized the <pause dur="0.4"/> antigen 
presenting cell way back down here <pause dur="1.3"/> the two come along <pause dur="0.7"/> they interconnect <pause dur="1.0"/> there's the antigen there's the M-H-C-<pause dur="0.5"/>two <pause dur="0.3"/> there's the T-helper cell <pause dur="0.8"/> and <pause dur="0.9"/> you find then <pause dur="0.6"/> that <pause dur="0.5"/> once the T-helper cell <pause dur="0.3"/> makes contact with the B-cell <pause dur="1.5"/> it then gives the T-helper <trunc>s</trunc> the T-helper cell then gives the B-cell <pause dur="0.2"/> some help <pause dur="3.2"/> okay <pause dur="1.0"/> so the antigen is broken down by the B-cell <pause dur="0.4"/> put into the M-H-C-two cleft <pause dur="0.5"/> T-helper cell recognizes it with its T-cell receptor <pause dur="1.5"/> for which it <trunc>speci</trunc> it's specific for this M-H-C <pause dur="0.4"/> antigen pattern there <pause dur="1.3"/> also C-D-four is involved <pause dur="0.6"/> and once that connection is made there are in fact a number of other surface molecules but <pause dur="0.4"/> as long as that connection is made <pause dur="0.4"/> you then get help <pause dur="0.3"/> going <trunc>abro</trunc> across from the T-helper cell <pause dur="0.4"/> to the B-cell <pause dur="0.9"/> and once that occurs the B-cell <pause dur="0.3"/> is then stimulated <pause dur="0.4"/> to produce a clone or <pause dur="0.7"/> memory cells <pause dur="0.9"/> plasma cells <pause dur="0.4"/> and to produce antibodies <pause dur="4.0"/> 
okay <pause dur="14.9"/> so you end up with a picture which is on the sheet that i've <pause dur="0.2"/> given at least some of you <pause dur="2.5"/> slightly <pause dur="1.2"/> drawn slightly differently but basically it's the same antigen presenting cell one <pause dur="0.4"/> T-helper cell <pause dur="0.4"/> B-cell <pause dur="0.2"/> and antigen presenting cell two <pause dur="0.4"/> so you've had that bit of the story <pause dur="0.4"/> then that bit of the story <pause dur="0.3"/> then that bit of the story <pause dur="0.5"/> and as a result the B-cells are stimulated to produce <pause dur="0.3"/> a clone of daughter cells <pause dur="0.3"/> memory cells and plasma cells <pause dur="0.3"/> and the plasma cells <pause dur="0.3"/> will produce <pause dur="0.2"/> antibody <pause dur="14.2"/> and if you find <pause dur="0.2"/> that there are difficulties with that i mean don't hesitate to discuss it <pause dur="0.5"/> in the discussion sessions <pause dur="0.2"/> after the video <pause dur="4.8"/> and you'll find that when i come to deal with T-cells i'll give you a similar picture <pause dur="0.7"/> # <pause dur="0.5"/> and show that the process is approximately the same <pause dur="0.5"/> with cell mediated immunity <pause dur="3.8"/> okay <pause dur="1.1"/> now the final thing i think we need to discuss this morning <pause dur="0.9"/> is what this help is these dotted these 
jagged arrows <pause dur="0.6"/> are <trunc>in</trunc> <pause dur="0.4"/> intended to indicate help <pause dur="0.6"/> help goes <pause dur="0.3"/> from the T-helper cell to the antigen presenting cell across here and back again i've shown it mainly going in that one way <pause dur="0.4"/> and also <pause dur="0.3"/> there's <pause dur="0.3"/> # <pause dur="0.3"/> cross-help <pause dur="0.3"/> from the T-helper cell <pause dur="0.3"/> to the B-cell <pause dur="2.1"/> there are two ways <pause dur="0.7"/> in which help can be received in which one cell can stimulate another cell <pause dur="2.2"/> you've got two cells here <pause dur="1.9"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="4"/> let's call them A and B <pause dur="1.5"/> help <pause dur="0.2"/> is sometimes received <pause dur="0.6"/> by <pause dur="0.2"/> direct molecular interaction you get <pause dur="0.2"/> receptors interacting between the two cells okay <pause dur="0.4"/> so they're in close proximity very close proximity <pause dur="0.5"/> and <pause dur="0.6"/> these receptors interact with each other they <pause dur="0.5"/> fit each other perhaps in some way or another <pause dur="0.3"/> and a message is sent across as a result <pause dur="0.2"/> that's one way that help can be transferred <pause dur="0.3"/> and in fact the help is often not just one way <pause dur="0.3"/> it's two way <pause dur="1.4"/> and the other way <pause dur="0.4"/> the <pause dur="0.3"/> this help occurs <pause dur="0.8"/> is through molecules being secreted <pause dur="4.1"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="4"/> and <pause dur="0.2"/> molecules are secreted by cell A <pause dur="0.5"/> and they act on receptors on cell B <pause dur="2.7"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="2"/> and <pause dur="0.6"/> so 
help can <pause dur="0.4"/> be transferred in that way <pause dur="0.4"/> and remember that in this picture <pause dur="0.7"/> these cells are far closer together than i've shown here because these receptor groups are very small <pause dur="0.3"/> and in fact a secretion <pause dur="0.4"/> to diffuse across need only diffuse <pause dur="0.3"/> a very very short distance <pause dur="1.6"/> and these secreted factors <pause dur="0.6"/> so far as immunology <trunc>s</trunc> is concerned <pause dur="0.2"/> are called cytokines <pause dur="4.2"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="4"/> cytokines okay <pause dur="0.7"/> and most of them not all of them <pause dur="0.5"/> are <pause dur="0.5"/> called by <pause dur="0.9"/> the <pause dur="0.2"/> # abbreviation <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="1"/> I-L so you got I-L-one up to at least I-L-twenty and probably further okay <pause dur="0.4"/> and I-L stands <kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="7"/> for interleukin <pause dur="4.5"/> okay <pause dur="1.0"/> which simply means between leukocytes <pause dur="0.8"/> # though it's mainly between lymphocytes but certainly I-L-one for example <pause dur="0.4"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="4"/> is secreted by <pause dur="0.3"/> macrophages so <pause dur="0.2"/> it's not always just lymphocytes that secrete <pause dur="0.4"/> # <pause dur="0.2"/> cytokines or interleukin <pause dur="0.3"/> it can be other cells interleukin-one as i say <pause dur="0.4"/> being secreted by <pause dur="0.3"/> macrophages <pause dur="2.1"/><kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="12"/> and if you look at the <pause dur="0.3"/> cytokines in bold <pause dur="0.6"/> in this response here <pause dur="0.7"/> they are <pause dur="0.7"/> many <pause dur="0.3"/> and quite complicated <pause dur="2.2"/> but <pause dur="0.6"/> just to <pause dur="0.2"/> try to keep 
it relatively simple <pause dur="0.8"/> they're as follows <pause dur="0.6"/> you've got your antigen presenting cell the one that reacts with the T-helper cell called a T-helper-two cell here <pause dur="0.5"/> okay <pause dur="0.6"/> and <pause dur="1.0"/> the B-cell <pause dur="0.4"/> which was stimulated by another antigen presenting cell <pause dur="0.7"/> you'll notice then that the antigen presenting cell secretes I-L-one <pause dur="0.6"/> as i've already said over there <pause dur="0.6"/> it can act on the B-cell directly <pause dur="0.5"/> can also act on the T-helper cell <pause dur="2.3"/> and that stimulates the <pause dur="0.2"/> both sets of cells <pause dur="1.0"/> but notice the T-helper cells <pause dur="0.2"/> remember they underwent mitosis <pause dur="0.5"/> they can self-stimulate <pause dur="0.8"/> they can stimulate themselves with the <pause dur="0.2"/> <trunc>s</trunc> # <pause dur="0.5"/> interleukin I-L-two <pause dur="2.3"/> so <pause dur="0.4"/> T-helper cells can stimulate themselves they're autostimulated <pause dur="0.5"/> by <pause dur="0.3"/> interleukin-two <pause dur="1.0"/> and then <pause dur="0.7"/> T-helper-two cells <pause dur="0.6"/> can stimulate B-cells <pause dur="0.6"/> by <pause dur="0.5"/> a number of cytokines <pause dur="0.4"/> some I-L-two but perhaps not very importantly but more importantly <pause dur="0.4"/> I-L-four and I-L-five <pause dur="0.5"/> I-L-four and I-L-five stimulate B-cells <pause dur="0.6"/> and I-L-six <pause dur="0.4"/> encourages the actual secretion <pause dur="0.2"/> of antibodies I-L-six <pause dur="0.3"/> encourages the secretion of 
antibodies <pause dur="0.4"/> so I-L-four and I-L-five <pause dur="0.4"/> are the prime helpers <pause dur="0.4"/> I-L-two perhaps a bit <pause dur="0.3"/> and I-L-six actually encourages the secretion of the antibodies <pause dur="4.7"/> and then <pause dur="0.3"/> finally <pause dur="0.6"/> remember <pause dur="0.3"/> that when you get <pause dur="0.2"/> an immune response <pause dur="0.7"/> you get a change of <pause dur="1.3"/> I-G production <pause dur="0.6"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="15"/> you start off with I-G-M <pause dur="1.4"/> and then later on you get <pause dur="0.2"/> I-G-G being produced there is a class switch remember <pause dur="3.5"/> and the class switch from <pause dur="0.6"/> I-G-<pause dur="0.9"/>M <pause dur="0.7"/> to I-G-G <pause dur="0.6"/> is controlled <pause dur="0.3"/> predominantly by <pause dur="0.5"/> an increase of secretion <pause dur="0.3"/> of I-L-four <pause dur="0.3"/> the I-L-four level <pause dur="0.4"/> converts the B-cells from being I-G-M secretors <pause dur="0.3"/> to being I-G-G secretors <pause dur="1.2"/> a predominance of <trunc>I-G</trunc> <pause dur="0.6"/> of I-L-four <pause dur="0.5"/> causes this class switch <pause dur="0.3"/> from secreting I-G-M <pause dur="0.4"/> to I-G-G <pause dur="29.5"/> now i just want to leave you with the thought <pause dur="0.7"/> about <pause dur="0.6"/> these different sorts of B-cells remember that i talked about early on <pause dur="0.9"/> that <pause dur="1.2"/> B-cells in the follicles of the lymph node <pause dur="0.5"/> are the normal ones that we've been discussing here using T-helper cells <pause dur="0.7"/> but outside of the follicles you get B-cells these B-one cells 
that respond to strange <pause dur="0.3"/> antigens things like these polymeric ones and so on <pause dur="0.4"/> but they don't use T-cells at all <pause dur="1.4"/> and <pause dur="0.4"/> what you find is that <pause dur="0.2"/> in the follicles the B-cells will produce <pause dur="0.4"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="16"/> I-G-M <pause dur="0.2"/> and then I-G-G just as we've described here <pause dur="1.1"/> outside of the B-cell <pause dur="0.8"/> outside of the follicle rather <pause dur="0.3"/> these B-one B-cells <pause dur="1.0"/> not using T-cells <pause dur="0.6"/> only produce <pause dur="0.2"/> I-G-M <pause dur="2.0"/> and <pause dur="0.7"/> the reason for this <pause dur="1.2"/> is <pause dur="0.6"/> that <pause dur="1.4"/> since these B-cells are being stimulated on their own they may get some I-L-one help from antigen presenting cells <pause dur="0.6"/> but they don't get any of this help because T-helper cells <pause dur="0.3"/> are not involved <pause dur="1.2"/> so these <pause dur="0.3"/> B-one <pause dur="0.5"/> lymphocytes outside the follicle don't have T-cells <pause dur="0.3"/> and they don't get any of this cytokine <pause dur="0.3"/> help down here they might get some I-L-one coming from an antigen presenting cell <pause dur="0.4"/> but they don't get any of this <pause dur="0.4"/> and therefore you find <pause dur="0.6"/> that <pause dur="0.4"/> this sort of <pause dur="1.4"/> T-cell <pause dur="0.5"/> will only produce I-G-M <pause dur="0.2"/> it will never undergo <pause dur="0.2"/> a class switch <pause dur="3.9"/><kinesic desc="writes on board" iterated="y" dur="4"/> so you get <pause dur="0.3"/> a very deficient sort of response <pause dur="0.4"/> against <pause dur="0.3"/> things like 
polymeric antigens <pause dur="0.4"/> # like the mitogenic ones and the complement ones <pause dur="0.3"/> which are <pause dur="0.2"/> responded to by these B-one <pause dur="0.5"/> B-cells only if if the antigen is not responded to by a B-two B-cell <pause dur="0.4"/> it will only <pause dur="0.3"/> produce an I-G-M response because you've got no T <pause dur="0.4"/> T-helper cell help <pause dur="0.5"/> therefore you haven't got these cytokines <pause dur="0.4"/> so the B-cell stays at that position <pause dur="0.2"/> and can't switch to that position <pause dur="0.4"/> there <pause dur="0.6"/> 
okay <pause dur="2.6"/> so <pause dur="0.4"/> with that <pause dur="0.2"/> thought <pause dur="0.7"/><kinesic desc="changes transparency" iterated="y" dur="6"/> that the end <pause dur="0.8"/> just to put up <pause dur="0.2"/> a <pause dur="2.2"/> piece of paper about <pause dur="0.2"/> what is relevant in the books <pause dur="0.6"/> # Weir and Stewart in fact hasn't altered since last time because there's not a great deal in this area in that early part of chapter four <pause dur="0.5"/> but i've added chapter eleven now to what you should have a look at <pause dur="0.4"/> in Roitt Brostoff and Male some of it you won't understand but some of it is relevant to what i've said today <pause dur="2.3"/> okay thank you very much <pause dur="5.6"/> there is a handout <pause dur="0.2"/> which i'll give you
