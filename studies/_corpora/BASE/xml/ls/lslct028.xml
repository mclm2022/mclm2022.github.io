<availability><p>The British Academic Spoken English (BASE) corpus was developed at the
Universities of Warwick and Reading, under the directorship of Hilary Nesi
(Centre for English Language Teacher Education, Warwick) and Paul Thompson
(Department of Applied Linguistics, Reading), with funding from BALEAP,
EURALEX, the British Academy and the Arts and Humanities Research Board. The
original recordings are held at the Universities of Warwick and Reading, and
