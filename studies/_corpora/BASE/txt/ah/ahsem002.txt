nm5082: right well this is namex and he's going to talk about the feasibility 
and use of Roman aes grave the type of currency that was used immediately 
before the Hannibalic War which broke out in two-hundred-and-eighteen B-C so 
over to him and he has the aes grave in front of him 
nm5083: yes er these are rather large and heavy coins cast from bronze er one 
of the er comments that was almost said about the Romans was that er you'd have 
to carry all your savings around in a wheelbarrow which er feeling these you 
can understand er 
nm5082: what's the approximate weight of this 
nm5083: i think that one is er 
nm5082: it's about ten ounces isn't it yeah 
nm5083: and that was effectively er a fifth of the large er 
nm5082: aes signatum blocks 
nm5083: aes signatum blocks which i think we've got 
nm5082: right 
nm5083: some pictures of there right this was broken down into the various 
units we've got semis there which was half of that and then these er the 
denomination is denoted by various pips er going down from four three two and 
one show the currency er at this time Rome had four different currencies this 
one seemed to be an intermediary between the Italian blocks of bronze and the 
er the coins that circulated in south Italy er i-, this tended to circulate 
within Rome itself and that area whereas Rome had other currencies to exchange 
with the with the other cities it traded with the other areas er but obviously 
after a while this this became very inconvenient and Rome worked down to er 
initially a couple of currencies different types of currency and then down to 
the silver denarii as standard although at the time the they which that 
presents i-, was still nominally the er the unit of 
currency in Rome 
nm5082: yes how were they actually produced do you think 
nm5083: er i think from this you can see that it's er a a cast was produced and 
you've got a little nodule there so it was poured into the cast it's probably 
cast with two sides because you can see there it doesn't quite join in the end 
nm5082: mm 
nm5083: so that was probably an individual cast with some of these er there 
could be a number of coins put in the same cast and be joined 
nm5082: yeah 
nm5083: perhaps top and bottom 
nm5082: yes you'd have to look for the entry and exit points 
nm5083: yes 
nm5082: wouldn't you on the side 
nm5083: you've also got things like air bubbles where it hasn't actually er the 
molten metal hasn't actually flowed into all the spaces available there er then 
again on this one you see that quite a bit and also where where it's worn at 
the edges as well 
nm5082: yes well the important thing to to bear in mind 
with this is if the the value was actually within the the metal itself there's 
no aspect of it being a token coinage er this circulates as a kind of low grade 
bullion currency and you've got one ass worth of bronze within it so you could 
simply hand it over and get one ass back unlike the modern currency where you 
can't get anything back essentially except er more of the same er what what 
kind of er purchasing power have we er any information about the kind of 
purchasing power these things had 
nm5083: yes we have but i can't think of it at the moment 
nm5082: wasn't it something like a hundred a hundred of these would buy you an 
ox and ten would buy you a sheep 
nm5083: yes 
nm5082: that was er basically it so this is why i suppose people took their 
their wealth around on carts if you wanted to buy anything of er particularly 
large value then certainly that was the only way to do it 
nm5083: that's one of the inherent 
problems of the coinage that's whether the coin matches the actual value of the 
metals 
nm5082: yes yes 
nm5083: in terms of the 
nm5082: why were the Romans fixated on on the value actually in-, inherent 
within the metal itself and why bronze why didn't they i mean they did have 
silver currency but as you said it was for er trading with states that had a 
basic silver currency why were the Romans so fixed on bronze for themselves 
nm5083: well bronze was very plentiful it was also er used as a standard 
currency in central and er northern Italy 
nm5082: mm 
nm5083: er and it also seemed to take quite a long time for the Romans to get 
their heads around the idea of the fact that a coin didn't have to represent er 
the value of the metal contained er 
nm5082: but this was true of the whole of the ancient world wasn't it 
nm5083: yes 
nm5082: it's true of of 
those states that are on a a silver basis for their currency they too have got 
er the idea that weight equals value and it's only it's only with the advent 
into the Greek world of bronze that 
nm5083: yes 
nm5082: er we er actually depart from that idea 
nm5083: it's certainly the case i mean but er it's quite i mean the fact that 
this was still being produced in three-hundred er B-C quite late on the Romans 
still continued for many years to produce a coinage that was based purely on 
value 
nm5082: mm 
nm5083: er and it took them a while to remo-, to re-, to actually stop 
producing that coinage where for a period they were producing both that and the 
silver standard 
nm5082: yes yes 
nm5083: er 
nm5082: but for different purposes 
nm5083: yes this is it 
nm5082: which is the strange thing they managed to di-, to divorce the the 
basic er purpose of their currencies th-, they they it's as though we 
were working on the the pound internally but externally we were dealing with 
dollars over euros er but in many ways its no no different from say what's 
happening in er in Russia where you can use the the rouble internally but 
externally of course they have to deal with dollars 
nm5083: mm 
nm5082: but it's a it is almost peculiar system where er the very weight of 
this kind of currency actually militates against its use it's not something 
taht one could even d-, use on a day to day basis you couldn't buy a cabbage 
with any of this kind of material nor i think would you want to 
nm5082: right okay well this is namex again talking about the feasibility and 
use of fifth and fourth century Athenian currency which is based not on bronze 
but essentially on a silver standard er ranging from the f-, the four drachma 
piece down to the one-twenty-fourth drachma piece 
nm5083: yes with the er the silver coinage was effectively based on a er a 
content of silver within the er the coins that represent the value er the 
problem here was when you got down lower in the coinage until the pieces were 
so minute as to be very easily lost in fact looking at these two there's 
virtually no difference between them to the naked eye in fact you could 
probably go as far as saying the three of them that's point-one-sixth of a gram 
and that's point-two-one of a gram and that one's point-three-two of a gram er 
but as far as picking them up carrying them around it would be very difficult 
to tell the difference er this coin here is the obol 
which is renowned as the the coin they put under the tongue to pay the ferryman 
er when you're dead of course er these silver coinage er silver Athenian silver 
coinage so it's got the the famous owl on the reverse and the head of Athena on 
the front 
nm5082: well one of the problems with these as you've already mentioned is the 
difficulty of of differentiating them 
nm5083: mm 
nm5082: there was at times an attempt to differentiate by reverse motifs a lot 
of them still have the owl on er but that one for instance as you can see just 
has a single crescent on er 
nm5083: and even that would be difficult 
nm5082: that would be difficult 
nm5083: unless it's a bright light 
nm5082: yes but as you can see on that one you've got well originally three 
crescents on because basically it's three times the value of that 
nm5083: yes 
nm5082: and one of the later er series for the obol since it was 
four of those had four crescents on but this one actually isn't it's an earlier 
one and still has the the owl and where you've got the standard owl motif 
that's when you've got problems in differentiating one from another 
nm5083: yes it's certainly the case with these the visibility of any design on 
the back 
nm5082: mm 
nm5083: would be a very difficult to see 
nm5082: yes 
nm5083: and also you've got the corresponding difference in quality i mean 
fitting a head on that compared to that it's er 
nm5082: mm 
nm5083: would be very easy i mean with this looking at the quality of the er 
the head er any forgery would tend to be poorer quality and look poorer quality 
but something like this it'd be very difficult to tell what is was it looks 
very little more than a blob 
nm5082: yes it's qu-, very badly centred 
nm5083: mm 
nm5082: so that's one of the problems we get 
that but what is strange is that in er in finds it's this material and 
especially the tetradrachm which is far commoner to find than these smaller 
things now why do you think that is 
nm5083: well finds tend to be er things like hoards of coins 
nm5082: mm-hmm 
nm5083: that people keep these could very easily get lost first of all but 
secondly if you were hoarding coins you'd hoard higher value coins rather than 
nm5082: mm-hmm 
nm5083: effectively low value coins that were more or less worthless 
nm5082: yes i think that's probably it i mean most of these very small things 
would have found their way into the ground by accident 
nm5083: mm 
nm5082: and either be overlooked in excavations since they would simply be 
encrusted in dirt and er and not recognized or in certain circumstances which 
is simply corrode away 
nm5083: yes 
nm5082: and it would not be left with anything but these of course 
do have a certain presence and as you say they are the ones that are 
preferentially er hoarded because they're big value and two obols in the fifth 
century was what was er the equivalent of er social security that would keep a 
man and a wife for a day so a tetradrachm which is what seven times that is 
going to be a big value coin and more than a week's wages for most people but 
what's interesting about this one is that it's actually been chopped 
nm5083: yes 
nm5082: is there any significance to that 
nm5083: yes to er check that it is actually silver quality of the coin make 
sure that it's not er a plated coin a forgery 
nm5082: well if you were plating it what what would the check then reveal 
nm5083: it would show er a lesser value metal such as 
nm5082: could be 
nm5083: er you could put something like bronze in there 
nm5082: mm so you'd make a bronze core and then put a layer of silver on either 
side and 
then use some forged or stolen dies to create it and then by chopping it which 
has obviously been done by a banker with a chisel you're trying to prove 
whether it's forged or not fortunately that one isn't we can see there there is 
a slight they were beginning to get differences in the pose of the owl in this 
fifth century half obol these are side-faced and this one is definitely full-
frontal and then as you work your way down and back to the side as well so 
there is obviously been some attempt to to differentiate at some stage by the 
pose of the owl er but to a large extent there's not much that one can er do 
about er people who insist on filing a little bit off to make a profit that way 
and then passing the er c-, coin off as the real thing of full standard weight 
but how feasible do you think these are in in use i mean you mentioned the 
small size of them how would you carry them around 
nm5083: be very difficult you could 
carry it under your er under your tongue for example it would be safe 
nm5082: yes we do hear stories of people carrying them under their tongues just 
have to hope they don't get slapped on the back and swallow them 
nm5083: well that's it 
nm5082: but otherwise i think you'd have to carry these into you know a very a 
very well constructed pouch 
nm5083: mm 
nm5082: or purse 
nm5083: can imagine a lot of them would get lost very easily 
nm5082: mm yes there is recent research on on these coins has suggested that 
they are they were originally far more plentiful than find current finds er 
actually suggest which i think if it it's if it's correct and it seems to be 
correct would prove that er the loss rate and the total disappearance rate has 
been very much heavier towards this end of the production than against that end 
nm5083: certainly they'd be more used more in day to day er purchases so 
nm5082: 
yes 
nm5083: imagine that that would be the case 
nm5082: though even so when you're getting two of those to keep you and your 
wife for a day even this is going to have a certain er degree of of fairly high 
purchasing power since that is an eighth so is basically a sixteenth of your er 
your er subsidy for the day 
nm5084: the thing in fact the thing about the Greek coins over the the aes 
grave we were looking at earlier is that these are struck 
nm5082: yes 
nm5084: rather than cast er and 
nm5082: what would the dies be made of then 
nm5084: that's a good question actually 
nm5082: well it's certainly not silver but i mean what other metals were 
available 
nm5084: er bronze probably 
nm5082: yeah i think it is 
nm5084: bronze 
nm5082: it must have been bronze er because of course the bronze itself had to 
be had to be worked like er a gem-cutter cutting the gem 
nm5084: to create 
the to create the image 
nm5082: yes to create the negative image that could then be used on the er to 
create the positives 
nm5084: we had the animal that the coin would go on and the die itself er 
probably created that one you think 
nm5082: yeah so the 
nm5084: 
nm5082: animal the die would have the obverse the head side 
nm5084: yeah would have the obverse 
nm5082: mm-hmm 
nm5084: and the die would sit on top 
nm5082: yes 
nm5084: and you get which is why you get this squeezing out the material on 
each edge 
nm5082: yes that's 
nm5084: as the as the coin is compressed 
nm5082: yeah that's the the sign of the original form of the die punch wasn't 
it 
nm5084: yes 
nm5082: it created a square pattern 
nm5084: you can see you can see it just about here 
nm5082: yes 
nm5084: the 
square of the original die 
nm5082: yeah so that the you've got an image actually within the square of the 
die punch 
nm5084: these as you as you stated earlier these are Athenic from Athens er you 
can see the the mark of Athens there as well as er the owl other areas within 
Greece had different designs er turtles tortoises er 
nm5082: you had shields from Thebes as well didn't you 
nm5084: shields from Thebes so 
nm5082: so virtually every city state would have its own 
nm5084: had its own design 
nm5082: have its own design yes 
nm5084: which made them er easily recognisable as coming 
nm5082: mm 
nm5084: from that city state 
nm5082: but these don't seem to change essentially you get the the Athenian 
head er all the way back from the beginning of the fifth century all the way 
through er until Athenian's currency effectively ended 
nm5084: mm-hmm 
nm5082: i mean even when the currency is undergoes its first major revamp 
sometime towards the end of the second century er Athena's head stays there 
nm5084: still in the same place 
nm5082: and this particular type of head stays very much the same for well over 
two-hundred years why do you think the Athenians would want to do that and 
especially since the old the the the actual sh-, form of the head is very much 
an archaic head er when in terms of statuary they were producing stuff that was 
much more f-, er sophisticated why would they want to stick to an old design 
like that 
nm5084: becomes recognizable 
nm5082: why would how would it function as a recognizable feature 
nm5084: er okay well if you're if you're continually changing the design er you 
can keep that side as the owl but if you're continually changing the design er 
then you're m-, moving away from standardized coinage 
nm5082: why would the Athenians want a very standardized coinage for over two-
hundred years 
nm5084: er 
nm5082: was there something about the the area of of circulation with this 
currency 
nm5084: er 
nm5082: if i can interpose the answer for you 
nm5084: yeah go on then 
nm5082: it's basically it is an international currency 
nm5084: yeah 
nm5082: and they go out of their way to make it like a collecting the dollar 
nm5084: yes that was what i wanted to say but 
nm5082: yeah 
nm5084: i couldn't find the words to say it 
nm5082: so it was it's they're they're stamping their city imperialistic 
tendencies upon their coinage so that these are used in preference 
nm5084: yeah these 
nm5082: to anything else 
nm5084: yeah they're trying to dominate the currency market basically 
nm5082: yes yes 
nm5084: which is what Athens tends to do 
nm5082: mm-hmm 
nm5084: er and this was what i was trying to say that that 
nm5082: and this comes acceptable everywhere 
nm5084: yeah it becomes very easily recognizable and it's standardized 
nm5082: yes 
nm5084: and becomes acceptable in fact they are trying to dominate the entire 
area 
nm5082: yes in fact these these take over from the Aegina turtles don't they 
nm5084: yes eventually 
nm5082: as an international currency that's accepted by everybody like the the 
dollar today 
nm5084: mm 
nm5082: and then Alexander the Great comes along and he does exactly the same 
it's really the battle of who's got the greatest amount of bullion 
nm5084: well it's based on the weight standard as well 
nm5082: yeah 
nm5084: er some city states had different weight standards 
nm5082: mm-hmm 
nm5084: er and Athens at at one point attempted to 
standardize on on this weight 
nm5082: and to make everybody else standardize 
nm5084: and to make everybody else standardize on those 
nm5082: yeah 
nm5084: and Alexander eventually did exactly the same and moved towards the 
Athenic weight standard 
nm5082: yes and er knocked it off its pedestal 
nm5084: knocked it off its pedestal 
nm5082: simply by force of of volume so these things thanks to the Laurium 
mines were big business they were thrown out in their millions er they were 
spent on large prestigious state er enterprises like the building of the 
Acropolis and the building up of the Athenian navy and they were they basically 
flooded the market with them and anybody else who wanted to er do any 
international trade of any soon found that these were the acceptable types of 
coins being used right across er the Greek world in preference except on a very 
local basis to anything else
