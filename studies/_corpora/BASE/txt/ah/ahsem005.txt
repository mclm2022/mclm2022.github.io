nm5144: okay mm we were er going to consider to start with mm er Bell Brigit 
and Ruth the figure of Socrates er anything you want to say first
nm5143: well in ca-, in just casting my mind over over this list this morning i 
see well we've got three figures today Socrates Goethe and Dionysus i don't 
know if they namex you've you've been trying this out you've meant to make a 
kind of progression but we do start out with somebody that Nietzsche is very 
opposed to then we get on to somebody that Nietzsche is quite that is Socrates 
er then we get on to Goethe somebody Nietzsche's really quite enthusiastic for 
oh yes he does say that Goethe never actually did understand the Greeks he's 
got a little bit of reservation there and then on to Dionysus which is a figure 
that er Nietzsche to some extent recuperates from from er the Greek period but 
also in a sense in-, invents as a kind of symbol or or something to stand for 
all the er life affirming values that he er is seeking to er impart really er 
so there is there is a kind of there is a kind of progression and today we'll 
sort of follow that progression through er i i wonder if we should we should 
give it over right now to Brigit and and Ruth
sf5145: are you happy with
sf5146: yeah i'm fine
sf5145: er i'm going to do the first two questions that reference to the sheet 
and Brigit is going to do the second two 
nm5143: oh right okay
sf5145: er why is dialectic a sign of Greekness wisdom is traditionally linked 
with the idea of escaping life and death because it's an end to a feeling of 
worthlessness and hostility as a result and a quote from section one of er 
Socrates does wisdom maybe appear on earth as a scavenger bird excited by a 
little sight of rotting meat wisdom is associated with decline Socrates is a 
great historical figure with continuing intellectual influence Nietzsche sees 
Socrates and Plato as symptoms of decay and as anti-Greek Socrates felt that it 
was necessary to take hold of the belief that the value of life had to be 
assessed which Nietzsche strongly criticises in the making of value judgements 
about life Nietzsche claims that they attributed and another quote from section 
two question marks attached to their wisdom or unwisdom 
nm5144: mm
sf5145: philosophers mistakes about their views were that they made value 
judgements about life whilst they were merely symptoms of it such judgements 
were stupidities Nietzsche
nm5143: can you see can you slow down just a little bit
sf5145: yeah er 
nm5143: i'm noticing that people i see are writing down see
sf5145: Nietzsche believes that because man philosophers are living as symptoms 
of life they could not be wise to begin with because they can't reflect back on 
it er dialectic is a sign of weakness because with Socrates enters a shift from 
noble taste to that of the rabble Socrates ushers in dialectical manners which 
were basically that one was to distrust open exposure of reason Nietzsche 
associates the dialectic with mistrust it is authoritarian so that one avoids 
having to give reasons it is a deceiving act and Nietzsche likens Socrates and 
also associates his repulsiveness at the same time to a clown whom the people 
unfortunately took seriously the dialectician is a form of self-defence 
Nietzsche admits this is a weapon which can be easily wiped away it is 
ordinarily weak but he claims that Socrates moved to prevent this by 
strengthening his claims through force he is manipulative and cunning and he 
likens him to Reynard the Fox the metaphor of a clown er this is another quote 
who got people to take him seriously that's from section five is a clever one 
as one of the rabble Socrates opposes the noble through laying on his opponent 
the burden of proving that he is not an idiot that's also another quote thereby 
angering and paralysing through the instrument of resentment Socrates 
disempowers the intellect of his opponent Nietzsche names the dialectic as a as 
sorry i can't read my own writing as a form of revenge founded on what should 
have been an undefendable form of self-defence however the weakness of the 
dialectic was strengthened by one force and that is that it drove straight into 
the heart of the noble Greeks via their main defence which was their intellect
nm5143: mm mm
sf5145: and then er i went on to consider in what ways Socrates repulsive and 
what makes him an object of fascination 
nm5144: mm mm
sf5145: Socrates ugliness was merely a further expression of his monstrous soul 
Nietzsche deduces that the typical criminal is ugly and this is a quote monstro 
in fronte monstro in animo which is monster in the face monster in the soul his 
ugliness is for Socrates evidence of development in decline Nietzsche's analogy 
of him as a criminal reveals that his repulsiveness reflects the vices and 
cravings in his soul namely that Nietzsche attributes to him decadence and 
vulturous scavenging over life as decline and worthlessness Socrates' physical 
repulsiveness is a mirror of his mental repulsiveness revenge is the vice that 
drives the soul which is which is what at the same time makes him so 
fascinating his fascinating element is derived from the fact that he led a new 
form of attack on the noble he stimulated them which engaged and appealed to 
their intellect what he stimulated was the combative drive of the Hellenes he 
used the erotic by introducing a and this is a quote variant into the wrestling 
match between young men and youths what made him fascinating was that he 
managed to adulterate the nobles intellect through the physical driven urge of 
that which even the rabble could understand at least feel and that was the 
erotic Socrates revenge channelled in a two-way interchangeable form the 
physical into the mental and the mental into the physical 
nm5144: mm
sf5145: okay 
nm5143: er 
sf5145: what do you want to do
nm5143: should we well how wh-, wh-, what would be most comfortable for you 
would you like to present your material and then open discussion up maybe that 
would be best
sf5146: right
nm5143: okay
sf5146: so for Nietzsche Socrates is a decadent figure and he describes him as 
a symptom of decay he is decadent because he's overly logical he's too rational 
Nietzsche thinks it's just as decadent to suppress and fight against instincts 
as it is to give in to all instincts er i think he says there's a quote here 
it's just altering the expression of decadence to try and escape it by fighting 
the instincts it's not getting rid of the decadence it's just decadence under 
another form so the strict rationality of Socrates is a sickness it's not the 
way to achieve health and happiness as he sees it his choice as the means to 
fight decadence is just what we need to a calm life over the rational and such 
rationality is absurd it's just a formula for decadence er that's all i've got 
to say about that really er but the Greeks' crisis was that as far as i could 
see they were either going to be destroyed by their commitment or they were 
going to become absurdly rational er and it's Socrates rationalism that they 
think will save them from decadence which is why Socrates is seen as a saviour 
he's er but he's an extreme case of the general crisis which is that people are 
letting their instincts turn against each other so yeah he seems to be saying 
it because his teachings are one that one should not give in to the senses but 
er this is seen to be a rescue from decadence but for Nietzsche this is not 
true it's just another form
nm5144: that's where you finish
sf5146: mm
nm5144: thanks very much let's just pick up that last moment er er in what is 
the crisis i mean er a certain sense is lying behind all this er Socrates seen 
as er a a by Nietzsche as operating at a certain period in history which is in 
some sense crisis you identify Brigit crisis as 
sf5146: no Ruth did that
nm5144: sorry as one where all the in where the instincts are turning against 
each other i don't know what you or indeed anyone how you understand that
sf5146: yeah it says the general crisis the fact that noone was master of 
himself anymore and each were turning against each other
nm5144: and what did that mean and maybe perhaps a way of bringing that out is 
do you think that applies to today and would could the same description apply 
today i i i think that might be a way back to discovering whether we understand 
what that means if it means anything anyone we needn't just pressurise Brigit 
on this
sf5146: i don't think so i hadn't really thought about it i i don't think there 
is there seems to be kind of a culture of er the individual and the needs of 
the individual and the kind of giving in to what you want
nm5144: mm mm
sf5146: i hadn't given this much thought but i don't think there is a lot of 
rationalism particularly in today's society or that
nm5144: no so you're saying if there was a crisis in today's society the 
Socratic solution doesn't look as if it's prepared for er right thank you well 
i'm just wondering what people understand the crisis of Greek society to be er 
i mean the reason why i'm asking whether it's now is we're just trying to get 
clear about what the claim is or from what you know from what we did earlier 
this term when we looked at the Symposium whether you can identify any features 
of what you read there which matter or interest you in terms of what's being 
said either positively or negatively either in support or against it
nm5143: another way of getting at this is just to think er what what Nietzsche 
says in in section ten er just for er they were in danger they had to make this 
choice either to be destroyed or to be absurdly rational so as i understand it 
we're we're seeking to just identify what was this condition that forced them 
into making a choice which as Nietzsche says is between either being destroyed 
or to be you know in the direction of Socrates absurdly rational
sf5147: could you see it as a sort of er exemplified by er er Alchibiades' in 
opposition to Socrates' view of love and so if Alchibiades is sort of the 
immediate expression of his feelings whereas Socrates is sort of more tending 
to rationalize the feelings and to tend to go away from the everyday and to go 
into the more heavenly realm er i don't know whether you'd say that was a sort 
of a suppression of the feelings it's er because there's a sort of analogy 
between the er more erotic side of love and then there's the the relationship 
between the older men and the younger men where there's the more rational bit 
they have the the birth of knowledge in the other in the partner 
nm5144: mm mm
sf5147: its rather than the erotic side of love
nm5144: that sounds plausible er but just take a look at the end to follow this 
up let's just take a look at the end of that section ten that namex drew your 
attention to because the question one needs to ask is why on Nietzsche's 
account and i'm sure you're right in picking out the Alchibiades as an example 
er is claiming the result of a pathological condition right that's second 
paragraph in section ten i-, on page sixteen er they felt that we have to 
imitate Socrates and produce a permanent daylight against the dark desires the 
daylight of reason we have to be cunning sharp clear at all costs every 
acquiescence to the instincts to the unconscious leads downwards now its that 
last sentence clause that i'm interested in the context in which he sees a 
crisis was reason was er being absurdly rational was an antidote though he 
thinks in fact an unsatisfactory antidote is where the perception in the 
culture is that acquiescence to the instincts of the unconscious leads 
downwards one needs something to rule them one needs something to rule oneself 
it says er er when one finds it necessary to make a tyrant out of reason there 
must be no small danger that something else should play the tyrant what is that 
something else it looks as if that something else is instincts which could lead 
downwards now why just go back to thinking about Alchibiades' case and the case 
of the Symposium what in er that context seems to be the problem about the 
instincts
sf5147: that er more in the light of what happens to Alchibiades 
nm5144: sure
sf5147: in the days after be killed in war and er have lots of disasters and er 
nm5144: yes
sf5147: could be seen as a result of his rejection from Socrates who he's in 
love with
nm5144: er er mm
sf5147: and he's sort of letting his feelings run away with him
nm5144: yeah
sf5147: whereas Socrates is sort of seen as the opposite extreme
nm5144: okay
nm5143: but they're aren't they in Nietzsche's terms
sf5147: yeah i don't i guess so
nm5143: i mean Alchibiades is either to be Alchibiades represents the either to 
be destroyed option and Socrates is the absurdly rational
nm5144: right now what okay what's common to those such that they could 
possibly probably both be called decadence on Nietzsche's account the clue i 
think is actually given in that passage that was just read out or part of 
something that was actually read out aloud if i was to mention the word tyrant 
i mean it looks as if what he's saying here is you've got a you've got a 
problematic situation where you need a tyrant now certainly you have the 
tyranny of reason and that is seen by Socrates as decadent but there's a danger 
of another tyranny to which that is opposite what would the tyranny be the 
tyranny of a certain type of instinct why is that perceived as a tyranny and 
that comes right back to what's supposed to be the problem here i think part of 
what the problem here is a lack of a lack of belief in a lack of confidence in 
living the life without a tyrant right where something's gone wrong with the 
form of life which involved er well what's the opposite of tyranny freedom 
involved a form of freedom in life an allowance of the different instincts to 
play their own role in other words a context where to pick up on what namex 
said no sorry what what namex er what er what er er i think er 
nm5143: namex
nm5144: namex said er thanks er where the instincts turn against each other 
it's no longer the case that the instincts are working in positively in harmony 
and so you need something to rule right er 
nm5143: er this er distinction of kinds of instincts or different ways 
instincts function er you know it was brought out clearly in four and also in 
in to some extent in nine in section nine it talks about the instincts were in 
anarchy and that was the problem and that's what leads to this necessity to 
make a choice
nm5144: er mm mm
nm5143: and in four the first line there's again these anarchic instincts
nm5144: er mm
nm5143: as opposed to the very last line of section four yeah
nm5144: er mm
nm5143: the instincts of the older er Hellenes which which were unified and 
therefore er a reliable er source for for living in for ascending life as it 
were
nm5144: okay now let's put another
sf5148: but is
nm5144: go on go on sorry
sf5148: er in ten the bottom of section ten er is saying that you know reliance 
a reliance on the instincts and the unconscious leads downwards is that sort of 
based on what Nietzsche says in the Genealogy of Morality saying that er that 
Socrates is in is in fact er part of he's he's ignoble he's part of the common
nm5144: he's rabble
sf5148: he's he's yeah he's definitely part of the rabble
nm5144: it connects i wouldn't say it was based on it it is certainly connected 
with it but i think what you're pointing to is an interesting question what is 
the evaluative force of saying that he's rabble or that leading downwards is 
something to be resisted
sf5148: yeah
nm5144: right and that picks up something er that er Ruth mentioned at the 
start that i thought we ought to ought to pick up you said Ruth and you were 
citing er er the text that part of the problem was that at least i think you 
said that you couldn't reflect back on your own situation can you enlarge a bit 
on what you meant by that or what you were referring to
sf5145: er i was talking about er Socrates and Plato's wisdom 
nm5144: yeah
sf5145: and that they saw themselves as being able to make judgements
nm5144: yeah
sf5145: and then sort of judge that there was a decline that there was a decay 
but they could not in fact because they were still living their life which 
meant that they were merely symptoms
nm5144: right and what does Nietzsche think about his own situation again er 
just looking at the text that
you've been studying i'm thinking particularly at the moment of paragraph two 
the middle of the second
paragraph 
sf5145: basically that you can't assess the value of life 
nm5144: that then what do you think that does to Nietzsche's own claims about 
the acceptability or otherwise
of shall we say decadence
sf5148: i i think Nietzsche what i think Nietzsche did was the fact that he's 
only offering he's in he's interpreting he's not he's not offering values he 
might be trying to get rid of values but he's not well by get getting rid of 
values he's im-, im-, sort of implicitly going to put other values in place but 
that's not what he's intending to do
sf5145: but you can't say that can you
sf5148: yeah but he will do and we'll see that he does i would say i don't 
think you can say that Nietzsche doesn't doesn't have any values at all that's 
sort of like an indirect result of what he's trying to do
sf5145: but i don't think that he he would want to make it in the same way that 
Socrates or Plato would make
sf5148: no no no no that's not what i'm saying i'm saying he tries to get away 
with all values but implicitly in doing the getting away with all values he in 
places his own values because that's just the way it works but he's not saying 
these are the values that you should live your life by and these are the values 
that you should er sort of evaluate with that that's not the kind of values 
they are but i think he does
nm5144: keeping your thumb or finger or pencil in that particular place turn 
over to page twenty-eight has everybody got this text we're all working no 
you've all got this text right section five right look at the end of the first 
paragraph of section five on page twenty-eight and then the following paragraph 
do you see that Helen as bearing on what you've just been saying
sf5148: er yeah apart from he wouldn't think he was weak he would say he was 
strong 
nm5144: mm mm
sf5148: er yeah i mean the degeneracy of life needs needs a a more a more 
creditable value to work with
nm5144: when we speak of values we speak under the inspiration under the optics 
of life this goes back to the whole business of seeing everything in terms of a 
particular perspective which one can only speak and think from a perspective 
the perspective of life life itself is forcing us to posit values life itself 
is valuing by means of us when we posit values when namex said look not 
establishing values attempting to establish values in the way Socrates did er 
by dialectic you say that's right in a different manner i wondered whether this 
threw some light on the ways in which Socrates er Nietzsche thinks that values 
may be posited
sf5148: er i think sort of values yeah what am i trying to say er if they're 
life-affirming 
nm5144: mm mm
sf5148: i think that's kind of Nietzsche's the values Nietzsche is affirming 
the ones that come out of life of
itself the ones that are just forced from life from us out into the world and 
into an interpretational
perspective like you said
nm5144: mm mm
sf5145: it's like it's like he's a spectator rather than like a legislator like 
here you're looking at phenomenology in a way
nm5144: mm mm
sf5145: he would probably say that Socrates was a legislator and he was a 
spectator
nm5144: mm mm
sf5145: because he only discusses symptoms which doesn't force him like it 
forced Socrates and Plato to take the stance through making judgements that 
life was in decline 
nm5144: mm mm
sf5145: he merely observed the symptoms as opposed to er form like direct 
opinions or develop those opinions
nm5144: mm mm
sf5148: and so these er moralities which have been posited and the value of 
life which has been from Socrates onwards through sort of like down through the 
Greeks to the Christians finally to to Kant the sneaky Christian which i quite 
like is er sort of they're they're anti-life they're anti the the natural force 
the will or strength of life because they're positing something that's it's 
degenerative because they're saying it's it's kind of it's going against the 
natural the natural will the power of the will because it's saying there's 
there's something better it's not all here there's
nm5144: mm mm mm mm it looks as if
nm5143: does Nietzsche
nm5144: go on go on
nm5143: well does does Nietzsche imply where one can find the sort of values he 
does seem to stand for i mean if you read the book if you read this text you 
can it's so difficult to distill as it were the sorts of things Nietzsche 
stands for right does he suggest anywhere here where that where those can be 
found what does he mean by saying that Socrates the way it asks the question is 
what does he mean by saying that Socrates is anti-Greek i thought Socrates was 
Greek i thought he stood for everything that Greece stood for ancient Greece 
stood for what does he mean by saying that Socrates was anti-Greek
sf5145: because they stand opposed to the sort of the negative life-force they 
don't like the Greeks they don't move with and accept and live through what is 
terrifying they're standing opposed to it
nm5143: who's they
sf5148: Dionysus
sf5145: yeah i'm talking about like the birth of tragedy the sort of thing we 
talked about in the birth of tragedy
nm5143: who do you mean who do you mean by they
sf5145: well
nm5143: do you mean Socrates and
sf5145: Socrates yeah
nm5143: okay so you don't mean the Greeks
sf5145: no i mean they as opposed to the Greeks
nm5143: right
sf5145: the traditional views of the Greeks
nm5143: right and Nietzsche's Greeks
sf5148: are Dionysian they're Dionysian
nm5143: yes i mean this is looking ahead to the Dionysus material that we'll 
get to but it's already present here isn't it when he said that Socrates is 
anti-Greek right he's making that distinction
sf5148: is there was just a point when you were doing your presentation and it 
was saying er Nietzsche was arguing that er Socrates is overly logical overly 
rational and du du du du er er but he sort of what Nietzsche wants is something 
which is not rational which is goes on the instincts which is bodily which is 
physical
nm5144: mm mm
sf5148: er you know hence you know the intoxication later on which we'll get 
onto you know it's all-consuming it's like very important that it's physical 
and yet he gives Socrates this physicality and admits that he had this physical 
driven urge dimension and this eroticism and i just wondered how that stood 
with with Nietzsche himself and is has Nietzsche actually moved that far away 
from the dialectic
nm5143: what does
sf5148: its not a dialectic in the sort of set sense of Socrates' dialectic but 
isn't Nietzsche still being provocative isn't he still trying to entice an 
answer out of you know he's always engaged Nietzsche's philosophy doesn't work 
in boom boom boom boom boom properties of one du du du so that you can follow 
it logically his philosophy works in enticing you provoking you to a response
sf5145: i'd say that it offers like an ideal something far more appealing in 
something that you could dream about almost
nm5144: mm mm
sf5148: so but i mean has he moved that far away from the dialectic that's my 
question
nm5143: wha-, what do other people think
sf5148: i'm not i'm not saying that he isn't he is the the same as Socrates but 
just the way that he can be i don't think
sf5147: do you mean you're sort of giving a legislation in condemning things
sf5148: no i'm just wondering about Nietzsche's own style whether he has moved 
that far away from the style of the dialectic in his philosophy that's my 
question and i don't know the answer other than i know i think Nietzsche teases 
you and plays with you and is provocative and tries to get you to give him
nm5143: well he is to that extent er rhetorical if we might take that just 
broadly to say th-, that he is asking things of us of readers and so on er in 
that sense every text is to some extent every argument functions rhetorically
sf5148: he's quite explicit though
nm5143: so how how would it function how do you see it functioning er in terms 
of dialectic more sort of narrowly conceived or defined the sort of dialectic 
that we saw going on in in the er the Symposium Socrates is
sf5148: this is [laugh] 
nm5143: his interlocutor interlocutors
sf5148: i don't i don't think it just wasn't something which sat right when we 
read the sections and i don't know all this stuff about dialectic as such 
that's just a question mark
nm5144: well i think this text gives a bit more er er more hints er remember we 
noticed last time that Twilight of the Idols in in a certain sense has a 
structure to it in which the er the end balances the beginning and you can move 
two stages in and the problem of Socrates is balanced by what i owe to the 
ancients so if you look over to what i said over to the ancients which is pages 
eighty-seven eighty-six rather onwards right and er he draws on page eighty-
seven er having been rude er about the Greeks er on page eighty-six er he draws 
a distinction between Plato and with it Socrates and Thucidides bottom of page 
eighty-seven er my recreation my predilection my cure for all Platonism has 
always been Thucidides and also perhaps Machiavelli now what is it that he is 
pointing to here their unconditional will to fabricate nothing and to see 
reason in reality and not in reasonable morality and then down on page eighty-
eight the end of that section er Thucidid-, er Greek philosophy was the 
decadence of Greek instinct Thucidides is the great summation the final 
appearance of that strong stick strict hard factuality that was a matter of 
instinct for the older Hellenes which of course picks up precisely what Michael 
John picked up from the earlier bit and he's just been talking about the 
culture of the Sophists which it appears to be he for right er courage in the 
face of reality is in the final analysis the point of difference in natures 
such as Thucidides and Plato er Thucidides has control over himself 
consequently he also has control over things now what's going on there control 
over himself that suggest a model whereby you don't need some tyrant to 
dominate your er to dominate your er instincts or your life you are able to do 
it yourself whoever yourself may be right in other words it's a notion of the 
opposite of tyranny as a form of self-control self-creation in context with 
truthfulness courage in relation to reality that looks like the model that is 
implicit in this what i er the problem of Socrates and is brought out in what i 
owe to the ancients who seem to me to lead directly into the positive account 
that's given of Goethe later on do you think namex we might move to that
nm5143: mm mm mm
nm5144: who was going to be dealing with er Helen Helen and Siobhan wasn't it 
you were going to be thinking about the figures of Goethe and Dionysus er and 
how have you carved this between you
sf5148: in no particular way
nm5144: it's not that one of you's identified with Goethe 
sf5149: no no we haven't no we just
nm5144: and the other one is going to put on the garlands of Dionysus
sf5149: no
nm5144: what a shame okay er 
sf5148: yes Siobhan is going going to get into a little frenzy in the corner 
[laughter] 
nm5144: i would hope so absolutely 
nm5143: yes 
nm5144: which of you would like to go get into your frenzy first
sf5148: i don't mind do you want us to go straight to to Goethe or do you want 
us to look at
nm5144: i think Goethe would be the next thing to look at in the light of where 
we've just got to at the moment don't you think
sf5148: no er okay er are we going to come back to the
nm5144: oh yes you bring in anything that you wish from the earlier part either 
now or in discussion we don't need to leave it all behind by any means these 
things all integrate
sf5148: right er it'll be page eighty-three sorry Michael John perception er 
Goethe er for Nietzsche he is the last German that he says he respects but he 
also says that he's not a German event but a European and he's trying to return 
to nature er and that he's trying to overturn everything that the eighteenth-
century sort of stood for and therefore he's he's going against sort of 
everything so he's sort of a figure whi-, which will stand out for for 
Nietzsche which he can identify with but he's in contrast to to something which 
he's within and he says i think he sort of thinks Goethe's got quite a lot of 
integrity because he says he carried his strongest instincts in him 
sentimentality ideology of nature the anti-historical idealistic unrealistic 
and revolutionary instincts
nm5144: mm mm
sf5148: and but he's sort of he admires Goethe because he sort of puts his life 
into his work there's it's it's a returning to nature it's being sort of true 
to yourself it's following the instincts it's not following rational and unlike 
sort of Kant and everyone that's there around at the time who like trying to 
separate and box sort of different emotions and moods and er sort of saying 
that we work on a physical level and a spiritual level Goethe is although he 
would acknowledge i would say all those separate things he's putting them all 
together he's into the wholeness he wanted totality that's what he says at the 
bottom of of page eighty-three
nm5144: what he wanted was totality
sf5148: yeah
nm5144: he fought against the separation of reason sensation emotion and will 
preached with the most horrifying scholasticism by Kant
sf5148: er 
nm5144: he disciplined himself yes go on 
sf5148: yes so so i think there's some important things already coming out of 
the fact that Goethe wants the whole the fact that it's it's disciplined it's 
taking strength
nm5144: mm mm
sf5148: er it's instinctual
nm5144: mm mm
sf5148: it's out of life and it's against the Christian Kantian morals of 
having separate identity
sf5149: it's life affirming rather than than being negative rather than it just 
being a formal sort of constraint it's something that
nm5144: so it arises out of life 
sf5149: yeah 
nm5144: not 
sf5148: yeah
nm5144: is apart from life
sf5149: yeah
sf5148: yeah
sf5149: yeah
nm5144: yeah and what do you make of that word at the bottom of page eighty-
three he created himself
sf5148: in that he's got the strength to keep himself together
sf5149: together
sf5148: in a wholeness and that he's got some kind of balance in in this 
totality that he's created that out of his will is that right ish
nm5144: yes i mean er creation i think is a dynamic notion and the way you were 
putting it first sounded as if it were static just holding himself together
sf5148: oh yeah
nm5144: it's more than that it's actually
sf5148: yeah because it's i mean it's it's a battle isn't it
nm5144: yeah that's right
sf5148: it's always with sort of the will it's no it's not straight-forward it's
nm5144: that's right
sf5148: it's fighting against yourself
nm5143: do you want to finish your presentation a bit i mean just carry carry 
it a bit further before we maybe we should do that before we
sf5148: er so er er list the fact that it's it's positive and life-affirming 
which Siobhan is saying is really apparent if you look over on on page eighty-
four he says yes to everything that was open to him and this: he had no greater 
experience than the most real being and sort of this is this is i think this is 
probably the most important thing is that for that Nietzsche sees Goethe as 
saying yes and for Nietzsche to say yes that's the most affirmative thing you 
can do it shows complete er strength of will to be able to say yes to 
everything and i think that's that it Martin pulling a face i i that's what i 
would say okay er then he then he goes on to say Goethe conceived a human being 
who was strong highly cultivated skilled in everything bodily with self-control 
and self-respect a human being who was al-, allowed to dare to accept the 
entire scope of natural he was strong enough for his freedom he was strong 
enough for his freedom that's out of strength they don't need constraint they 
don't need some moral imposing ordered they don't need a tyrant basically
nm5144: yeah er 
sf5148: and that's not would make an average nature perish you need strength 
for this it's not it wouldn't work for the weak-willed it wouldn't work for the 
rabble er 
nm5144: so you don't say yes to the rabble
sf5148: you have to say yes to the rabble is you're going to say yes to yourself
nm5144: okay 
sf5148: [laugh] sorry so er okay so it's there's this wholeness which affirms 
itself and it says yes to everything and this is the natural this is the strong 
and therefore by saying yes to everything you attain your freedom from these 
constraints i would say and and and this is what he calls he's baptised it in 
the name of Dionysus so Goethe is in some sense the Dionysian figure not 
strictly but in some sense do you want to
sf5149: er i don't know really it's probably better to talk about Dionysus 
because it's kind of that's what kind of brings it together doesn't it
nm5143: yeah
sf5149: i don't know if you want to
nm5144: would you like to talk about Dionysus then
sf5149: i can do i don't know if you want to talk about
nm5143: okay yeah okay
nm5144: what do you think namex
nm5143: well i think this yeah there's probably more things to say about Goethe 
maybe but but maybe you should
nm5144: are there is there anything you want to say about Goethe that hasn't 
been touched on
sf5149: er i wanted to ask you about the the he created himself does he say is 
that is that because he doesn't need an ideal that because he's sort of made 
his own ideal like with er the person whose name i can't pronounce a bit later 
where he says er i know Plato's a coward in the face of reality so he leads 
into an ideal which is which is what people do
nm5144: mm mm
sf5149: that's that's to do with the tyrant thing isn't it
nm5144: well it certainly if an ideal is seen as something other than oneself 
to which one seeks to conform oneself then clearly there is a contrast here 
it's er then the ideal becomes to use the term that Helen was using a tyrant er 
but it's not of course to say that he is er opposed to ideas or ideals in some 
senses of those words er so this is why i wanted to just to stop and think 
about 'created himself' er i-, it's it's the notion of self-creation bear in 
mind we'll talk about it later that's in a certain sense where the whole of 
twilight ends doesn't it with that use of the sculptor's hammer to create but 
it's also partly a form i think possibly at least of self-creation er and 
'created himself' it's self-reflexivity again it's picking up what we've been 
talking about earlier: how can you reflect back upon yourself how can you 
create yourself who's doing the creating clearly a form of self-transformation 
is going on that appears to be part of what he's very positive about right
sf5148: is that because Goethe's
nm5144: sorry
sf5148: is that because Goethe's an artist
nm5144: it's partly because he's an artist it's partly er er i mean partly this 
is an idealised Goethe quite plainly er Goethe in fact in his early work as you 
you'll know because you did European novel last year in the Sorrows of Young 
Werther is er very much in touch with those romantic strains and that of course 
is picked up here er he er er he er he was a a great attempt to overcome the 
eighteenth century by a return to nature that sounds like er like Rousseau and 
he talks about carries his strongest instincts sentimentality which was 
sentiment and so on but it goes beyond it and in his later work you find him 
using the Roussean romantic approach and disciplining it and re-forging it in a 
much richer conception of er of what some people would even call classical if 
you think about his his late works in other words he forms himself and he forms 
his way of thinking and he forms his way of writing in terms of patterns and 
modes of living which are richer than those which have gone before because they 
incorporate that which he chooses to say yes to the reason i pulled a slight 
face you're dead right when you said yes to everything is er in Thus Spake 
Zarathustra which of course is where this text ends he er Zarathustra has with 
him two companions one is the ape and the other is the donkey and each of them 
think they represent Zarathustra and the ape is negative and says no to 
everything and the donkey is positive and life affirming and says yes to 
everything and he is equally er scathing about both the ass he calls stupid 
because of course there are some things to which he is going to say no in er 
whilst it maybe he doesn't always say no to rabble he certainly does say no 
partly to anything else to decadence he in other words wishes to be life 
affirming but to be life affirming is in some sense not to be death affirming
sf5148: yeah but he maybe maybe i'm thinking of the wrong Nietzsche but
nm5144: no go on
sf5148: strength of will 
nm5144: yes
sf5148: is in affirming everything that went before
nm5144: yes yeah yeah
sf5148: is going to go you know past present future 
nm5144: mm
sf5148: all in one
nm5144: mm
sf5148: so everything that is negative you have to you just encompass it within 
affirming instinct encompassed with air
nm5144: mm
sf5148: and so yes you don't sort of of you wouldn't focus 
nm5144: mm
sf5148: on decadence as being the starting point of your affirmation but
nm5144: that's right
sf5148: you can't not not affirm it i would say
sf5145: what does he think of madness
nm5144: would you like to enlarge that question
sf5145: because i it could either be the most perfect example of what Nie-, 
Nietzsche wishes or the worst one 
nm5144: yeah
sf5145: as far as i can make out and i can't understand
nm5144: well this is where we move thus both your responses point is outside 
this text because this text points out itself anyhow let's take Ruth's point 
first er in the Genealogy of Morals and in other works there is a distinction 
that is drawn which in English is usually drawn as a distinction between bad 
and evil and the projection of the distinction between good and evil is a 
projection that he sees arising out of and out of er Platonism and Christianity 
and indeed what he thinks of as decadence and he wishes to overcome it er and 
so he can glorify hi-, himself in his evil instincts but in the genealogy of 
morals that is seen as a negative feature a negative way of thinking in 
reaction against the earlier Hellenes the earlier Greeks who thought in terms 
of good and bad and good is associated with success and beauty and all that is 
positive and bad with what is ugly and disgraceful and cowardly
sf5148: and fallen
nm5144: and
sf5148: and fallen
nm5144: tell me about fallen
sf5148: would you not say that one of the most important things in the 
opposition is that good is literally that er no okay
nm5143: go on go on
sf5148: good good as in good and noble 
nm5144: mm mm
sf5148: is from an elevated position that is literally what it means
nm5144: yep yeah
sf5148: whereas the bad is just that which is not
nm5144: it may it may not have fallen though it may have fallen it may just be 
it's never got to that it may be that you were born rabble and remain rabble er 
but that actually brings out part of that association that you find in the 
problem of Socrates where it says look: ugly in face ugly in mind that 
separation between the mental and the physical that you actually found in the 
Symposium and that's brought out by the Silenus statue with these beautiful 
things inside is resisted on that projection that to some degree the way you 
live your total being and who you are and what you look like and all the rest 
of it and the grace of your life is all part of one which may be positive or 
negative so he's operating there with implicitly in that problem of Socrates 
that older scale of values and so when you said Ruth you know does he want what 
does he think about badness i think it depends a bit
sf5145: i meant madness
nm5144: sorry
sf5145: madness
nm5144: oh madness i misheard you madness is something that we'll come back to 
when we look at Dionysus i think because that precisely is er you know will map 
on to that with respect to the issue that you raised Helen let's go back to er 
le-, let's go back to that business about judgements and value judgements can 
in the final analysis never be true right that's on page thirteen what he is 
doing is aligning himself with a form of creative creativity a form of yea-
saying which is affirmative and so you say Helen look if you're fundamentally 
affirmative sure you have to be affirmative about everything including that 
which is negative 
sf5148: 
nm5144: yeah go on and that certainly is what comes out in other texts in 
particular er where the test of the Overman is precisely can you actually 
respond positively to the thought that everything will return the eternal 
recurrence of everything just as it is and was including the most ignoble 
sf5148: mm mm
nm5144: and in his diaries er Nietzsche or in a letter actually Nietzsche says 
i've tried it myself aach [laughter] you know it's the final test which 
Zarathustra is presented as overcoming so in one sense that's right er the 
affirmative has to affirm everything including negativity including decadence 
that suggests that there are different levels of yea-saying and nay-saying 
remember what we looked at last time all truth is simple is that not doubly a 
lie there are truths about values which are both must be affirmed and must be 
rejected and what we have here is a form of hierarchy whereas the strongest 
confir-, affirm every affirm everything but that necessarily involves also 
affirming certain negations so there is a degree of complexity here and he sees 
Goethe as exemplifying it more or less though not wholly and then he identifies 
himself as a disciple of the god Dionysus but you said is not exactly mapping 
onto Goethe and that's right but Dionysus as a figure has now become more rich 
than in the earlier writings such as the ones you studied last year in the 
Birth of Tragedy i wonder if we should look at Dionysus now
nm5143: mm mm
sf5148: so how affirming would you say Goethe is
nm5144: would i say Goethe is or would Nietzsche say Goethe is
sf5148: both if you like
nm5144: the questions how let's reformulate it the question for how affirmative 
i would say Nietzsche is i would like to absorb in the question how affirmative 
we would say er Goethe is and that i would like us to put on the pending tray 
until next term when we're going to be studying Goethe and some of you will 
have noticed that we have these texts in non-chronological order and we thought 
it would be interesting given the sort of praise Nietzsche is giving Goethe to 
use one OF to use Goethe's greatest text as a means of interrogating Nietzsche 
and we thought that okay Nietzsche has problems with self-interrogation don't 
we all let's use his great figure of affirmation and use that figure of 
affirmation in one of his writings as providing pers-, perspective so let's 
leave that on the pending tray okay i think it's a perfectly proper question 
but for i read we how positive does Nietzsche think Goethe is er i think he 
sees him as very positive though limited in that he didn't didn't understand 
the Greeks though as Nietzsche goes on to say i didn't like the Greeks and they 
made no impression on my mind and then of course goes on to talk about the 
Greeks
sf5147: but does it matter that he doesn't understand the Greeks because er 
because he says at one point the the weak the weak are underestimated because 
they have disintelligence
nm5144: yeah yeah
sf5148: so you don't necessarily need to understand come to an understanding of 
everything to be to be a strong person
nm5144: i think that's right
sf5148: in fact in complete intelligence his intelligence leads to suspicion 
and cunningness and stuff
nm5144: yeah i think that's exactly right and of course there's complications 
what he means by the Greeks we've already seen he's used the word in in 
different ways already er no i think he sees Nie-, Goethe as limited but he 
sees his as the greatest exemplar available to him of what the affirmative 
spirit can be and can make and provides a model a very interesting model of 
what it might be to move towards being a uberman rather than the sort of models 
other models he sometimes used essentially military figures like Julius Caesar 
er Goethe was certainly er not a distinguished military man let's put it that 
way even though he did once meet Napoleon what about Dionysuser Siobhan do you 
have thoughts about Dionysus
sf5149: yes i just won't be a second er er i think it's already been said by 
Goethe that the Dionysian state is er is the most natural state it's going back 
to sort of primordial instincts
nm5144: mm mm
sf5149: and he makes a distinction on page fifty-six between er apollonian and 
Dionysian er i don't know ways of perceiving things er and the Apollonian is 
Apollonian sorry is to do with er is it to do with like form and and shapes 
sort of the rational
nm5144: yes yes
sf5149: it's finding things beautiful and 
nm5144: mm mm
sf5149: out of
nm5144: mm mm
sf5149: out of the world so that we've got something to sort of almost to 
aspire to 
nm5144: yes
sf5149: something that makes everything look a not lot nicer so that everything 
terrible that's going on we can we can sort of dismiss whereas the de dealings 
that's sort that's concerned with visual art i think whereas the Dionysian is 
more with with music and rhythms and in you know the sort of baser instincts 
nm5144: mm mm
sf5149: er mm so i was 
nm5144: well basically the sense is more primitive perhaps
sf5149: yeah
nm5144: yeah
sf5149: yeah primitive that was that was what i was going to say because the 
reality's not 
nm5144: mm mm
sf5149: er and yeah so he says that that's and that's more natural to us
nm5144: mm mm
sf5149: that that is er like what he was saying about Kant that was and er 
nm5144: mm mm
sf5149: the whole 
nm5144: mm mm 
sf5149: formal aspect of how we think about things
nm5144: mm mm mm mm
sf5149: is is a move away from the way we actually you know we actually feel 
and and maybe want to act i don't know er but it's it's through the Dion-, the 
Dionysian that he it's because it's supposed to be like a rebirth isn't it
nm5144: ah yes go on
sf5149: in that it this is this is sort of bringing in a bit from the Birth of 
Tragedy as well
nm5144: yes
sf5149: but to er because Dionysus it was it was to do with hi-, it was it was 
something to do with complete destruction isn't it
nm5144: that's right
sf5149: you have to reach into the lowest point before you can be reborn into 
something else so it's kind of take it's completely the opposite of the formal
nm5144: mm mm
sf5149: sort of way of looking at things into the most natural and by doing 
that that's how you you find a new way of looking at things
nm5144: mm mm
sf5149: does that make sense
nm5143: yeah
nm5144: and you notice just in relation to that on page fifty-seven that 
passage you're there the end of that first paragraph they're talking about the 
Dionysian human beings they penetrate every skin every emotion they constantly 
transform themselves and that transform themselves 
sf5149: mm mm
nm5144: picks up that what you were saying and also about that self creation of 
Goethe
sf5149: yes i don't know there was a bit there was a bit later on i didn't 
understand a reference to him pulling Ariadne's ears that i didn't know what 
that was about
nm5144: er shall we
sf5149: i couldn't really work that out
nm5144: shall we turn to it what page are we on
sf5149: er that's on sixty-two but the section's on sixty-one section one here
nm5144: right
sf5149: i just i just literally didn't know what it meant i didn't know what it 
was trying to get at
nm5144: er you didn't find the er footnote of much help
sf5149: er not really i don't know
nm5144: it is well look look at the context then er er do any at the bottom of 
page eighty-six sixty-one do any of us know what we look like in the eyes of a 
higher judge of taste [sniggering] now clear theres the certainty of comedy the 
higher judge of taste has long donkey's ears right okay er outrageous maybe 
even funny maybe a little arbitrary er why are you pulling my ears i find a 
sort of humour in your ears why aren't they even longer now there are several 
things going on there 
sf5149: er 
nm5144: first it's a question of perspective we think of someone having long 
donkey's ears as comic here you have someone who has actually been for a 
punishment given a donkey's head actually being amused by people not having 
donkey's ears so that partly brings out the 
sf5149: hmm
nm5144: whole business of perspective secondly however it brings out the notion 
of ears being important do you remember how the preface start er er right back 
at the preface those who have ears even behind their ears is using that very 
notion of listening as a way of er being perceptive and er what the and the and 
if his footnote er points out go-, going back to other work of of Nietzsche the 
er the the thought was you need to have extended ears in this particular case 
rather than ears behind the ears to really hear right at the bottom of page 
sixty-two you have small ears you have my ears let a clever word into them er 
in other words the suggestion is be clever Ariadne have longer ears so i'm 
going to pull them it's a bit of a joke
sf5149: mm mm
nm5144: right
sf5148: is Nietzsche look-, giving like an importance to
nm5144: sorry
sf5148: is Nietzsche kind of giving an importance to ears well a privilege to 
hearing in that er and again therefore privileging the Dionysian over the 
Apollonian because
nm5144: mm mm
sf5148: you need you need to hear
nm5144: that's right
sf5148: to get this complete intoxication to get the rhythm to get into the 
primordial urge to breaks to get 
nm5144: i think that's right i think there are two things here first er 
conventionally we think of the ear
as the eye as being the most discriminating what the eye of course picks out 
is form right
sf5148: which is 
nm5144: which is precisely Apollonian er Apollonian right whereas in the 
Dionysian model music as as Siobhan quite rightly said is the primary exemplar 
and that you hear and this is again a shift in perspective normally one might 
think of having particularly good eyes to discern it here he says particularly 
good ears to discern it he is changing the standard metaphor he is changing the 
standard perspective so partly it's shaking up ones normal way of thinking but 
is doing so with an agenda the agenda being that the Dionysian has a certain 
priority over the Apollonian 
sf5148: mm mm
nm5144: though our culture tends to prioritise sight which is has gives 
priority to the Apollonian so i think all that is there too and also there is 
of course the element of comedy
sf5147: i'm just wondering you know you're sort of er privileging er rhythm 
over form in a sense
nm5144: yes sure
sf5147: but isn't isn't it instinctual to to focus on form and also it's also 
quite instinctual to focus on reason as well
nm5143: why why do you say why do you say that
sf5147: what to reason
nm5143: why do you say it's instinctual yeah
sf5147: i just think it is i think it's sort of i think it's quite innate 
really to
nm5144: that human beings have the language instinct
sf5147: yes yeah
nm5144: and reason arises out of language 
sf5147: huh
nm5144: that sort of model
sf5147: er huh
sf5148: oh there's a nice quote there's a nice quote that ah god i don't know 
where it is our reason and language oh what a tricky old woman she is
nm5144: yeah
sf5148: i'm afraid we're not afraid of god because we still believe in grammar
nm5144: yeah
nm5143: how would you use it [laughter] 
sf5148: i just wanted to use it i think it says something quite nice about 
language and our our faith in language 
nm5144: mm mm
sf5148: as long as we have language we're going to
nm5144: mm mm
nm5143: okay but you're saying that that's a kind of er what Nietzsche saying 
there about thing you're pointing to is that language is actually a symptomatic 
of a kind of false consciousness we shouldn't have so much confidence in it 
right
sf5148: no
nm5143: yeah i mean we shouldn't i mean it's one of the idols he's trying to 
sf5148: to
nm5143: to to break but but but namex is saying the opposite right you're 
saying actually to reason is is
sf5147: i'm not saying that
nm5143: instinctual
sf5147: i'm saying reason is instinctual but i'm not saying that language can 
necessarily represent everything that we think and feel
nm5143: right
sf5147: as it because actually so but i do think yeah i think we have i mean 
isn't Nietzsche using his reason when he's talking about these things
nm5144: yes
sf5147: i mean
nm5143: one er er certainly i mean er er we have to discriminate between sort 
of our or maybe work a little bit harder at what we understand by Dionysian 
right because Dionysian doesn't mean just the life of un-, unreflecting er 
passions yeah
sf5147: mm mm
nm5143: certainly it's erotic certainly it has to do with the orgiast-, 
orgiastic and that that sort of element that is but i mean this is why the 
example of Goethe is im is important because Goethe is actually a cultured 
person right he's not just Joe Bloggs who lives for his to to satisfy a sexual 
appetite right he's a cultured person he's and he's self-cultivated even
nm5144: yeah
nm5143: so i i think we have to feed those into our understanding of Dionysian
nm5144: mm mm
nm5143: so that the though it is it i i i involves the this kind of instinctual 
energy without a kind of task-master like reason involved directly
sf5147: mm
nm5143: yeah but that's but there but there is a kind of er self-mastery maybe 
that's involved
sf5147: isn't Dionysian sort of an escape from the rational into the sort of 
primordial forces that's that that's how i understood it
nm5143: well i think that he i think he's saying that that's where it that 
that's where it begins and its its yeah
sf5147: it begins as an escape from the rational do you would you
nm5143: yeah but i mean he he's not saying you know we should old go live like 
animals in the woods or something right he's saying the the early Greek culture 
was great because it was in touch with this basic kind of you know fire of er 
energy or something that was yeah you know they were in touch with and not 
suppressing it
sf5147: mm
nm5144: mm
sf5148: isn't er i mean the way it works in the Birth of Tragedy is that you 
need so maybe we could look how how it's moved on in here perhaps that you need 
to experience the Dionysian that brings you back it draws you back into the 
primordial flux 
nm5144: mm mm
sf5148: and sort of nearly organic state yet you need this element of self-
control and that's where the Apollonian is so essential
nm5144: er 
sf5148: so that you are not completely destroyed 
nm5143: er er that sounds like a kind of dialectic doesn't it like we need a 
little bit of Socrates in ourself or something
sf5148: and and is this is this
nm5143: that's not that's not quite what
nm5144: maybe he said
sf5147: i'm not sure how the Birth of Tragedy relates to this because i know it 
changes doesn't it
nm5143: yes it's much earlier
sf5147: i'm i'm sort of confused about what the difference is er between the 
dionysian and apollonian distinction in in the Twilight of the Idols because i 
understand it in the Birth of Tragedy but i don't understand i don't know how 
it works in this
nm5144: mm mm
nm5143: well Martin you're better placed here to
nm5144: well i mean it er i i think you're quite right to be puzzled er because 
er we've already Siobhan has drawn our attention to that passage which er does 
draw the distinction between the Dionysian and the Apollonian very much in the 
sort of way that you found in the Birth of Tragedy that was er the page er 
fifty-six that you drew our attention to but by the time you get to the end of 
the er the text er towards the end of what i owe to the ancients a great deal 
seems to being built into the figure of er Dionysus er and what we have here er 
look on page ninety er in the er about just over a third of the way down the 
page only in the Dionysian mysteries in the psychology of the Dionysian 
condition does the fundamental fact of the Hellenic instinct express itself 
it's will to life now will to life is not entirely clearly what you will get 
out of the Birth of Tragedy and this picks up of course on what Helen was 
saying about the ultimate notion of the affirmative er what we have here is er 
at the end of this paragraph for the to the eternal joy of creation which is 
associated with the Dionysian for the will to life to affirm itself eternally 
which is Dionysian there must eternally be the torment of the child-bearer that 
is that model of tearing oneself to pieces or allowing oneself to be torn to 
pieces or wounded so that one may grow stronger that whole notion of 
reformulation and that seems to include all the elements in other words the er 
the Apollonian now seems to be a model for a form of control that resists being 
broken open the Dionysian is a form of self-control that allows being broken 
open in order for new springs new possibilities to become available and 
affirmed and so you find absorbed into that figure of the Dionysian some 
elements that one might earlier find in the Apollonian and in Beyond Good and 
Evil which is a a different text er plainly but written a little not very long 
before this Nietzsche speaks of the philosophers of the future as needing to 
have been all sorts of things including scholars and so on including 
exemplifying the Apollonian but the those who are truly affirmative those who 
on this model would be Dionysian incorporate all that and go beyond it by 
allowing themselves in a certain sense to be broken open again and it's er 
what's being presented you say is not Nietzsche using his reason of course in 
one sense he is er but he's he's using his reason in the service of er 
attempting to be to use his own image a Pied Piper to attract us to a vision 
which goes beyond what is available to us or to our culture but we can er it is 
possible to affirm which includes what you called madness sorry Helen you want 
to come in
sf5148: i was going to say er that you can't criticise him for using the 
language because how else can he convey
sf5147: but he's criticising reason and he's using it so it's
nm5143: well he's criticising to he's criticising er reason in the sense of ty-,
a tyran-, tyranny
sf5148: yeah
nm5143: yes
sf5148: an over reliance
nm5143: or language in the sense being an island
sf5147: isn't he really just using a different kind of reason and er 
nm5143: well
sf5147: and er it's the sort of pure logic he's kind of he's using reason to 
sort of say how like er reason can con-, conflict with itself he's not saying 
that reason can fit into these logical structures he's saying that there are 
many logical structures
nm5143: sure
sf5145: is like he's meshing on top of each other different historical points 
it's not a linear development that he's creating is it it's sort of like a a 
mesh a grid of different points
nm5143: er yes a plural a plurality
sf5145: yeah
nm5143: bu-, but that what you're what you're what's sort of coming out of this 
corner is you know a criticism that's that that can be made of all of Nietzsche 
and that is how can you be consistently deconstructive how you can consist-, be 
consistently deconstructive because whenever you say well everything is all 
from different perspectives for example you know the that you know Nietzsche 
develops er well in that there there is there's no there are no sort of hard 
and fast rules well that itself is a hard and fast rule right
sf5148: yeah
nm5143: so that's an existing that's
sf5147: harmonodian kind of because it seems to be the case and it is the case 
for you and er because there's no objective truth anymore
nm5144: mm mm
sf5147: and how how do you prevent that going beyond like into the madness thing
nm5144: yep 
sf5147: er 
nm5144: no i think that's quite right and its indeed what you're going to talk 
about next time isn't iti see that you Bell are going to be talking about the 
reason illusion and the problem of language er but just to pick er to pick up 
on what you've just been saying is he not using reason in a different sense 
here i think the answer is plainly yes and i think that that's actually marked 
in your text by the fact that er you have in the section that immediately 
follows the problem of Socrates page eighteen look at its title reason in 
philosophy and reason has gone into inverted commas and they're Nietzsche's 
inverted commas er 
nm5143: i see on on our list we don't have reason in inverted commas
nm5144: oh no er 
nm5143: so this is this is the clue this is a hint
nm5144: [laugh] 
nm5143: er but if you put reason in inverted commas that does suggest that er 
the term reason is being used to use a phra-, a term er made famous by 
Heidegger and er and then er Derrida under erasure you use the term because you 
don't have a better term for it but you don't want it to carry all the baggage 
so when you put it in inverted commas you're saying that's how it's 
conventionally used without suggesting now that that implies there may be a way 
in which i am prepared to use it or affirm it but it may be very difficult to 
articulate it hence indeed the the passage that Helen quoted to us with such 
delight er er is er what what a deceptive female she is er er quite right so i 
mean it seems to me that this is er in a certain sense pointing directly 
forward to where we need to go er to go next time can i just put this one one 
last thing because it has come up which was er the the way Nietzsche presents 
his arguments and the question that Helen raised was what is he actually er er 
working with a kind of dialectic or not just on page eighty-six the bottom of 
the first the first er section er he's saying is oh pardon me all that is 
relevant and if one wishes to believe me noble heart ex-, excellence i'm not 
interested in you know what he's trying to assert there i'm not i'm interested 
in this if one wishes to believe me er does Socrates ever say if one wishes to 
believe me
sf5147: he said at one point er you may look at it this way and he says i use 
we in the polite sense [laughter] 
nm5143: yes that's right that's right
nm5144: yes
nm5143: okay well there he is his is being he is being you know er assertive i 
mean i think Nietzsche is assertive but there is this i don't know just a i 
wonder i want to think about this not now but maybe but maybe next time: if one 
wishes to believe me is is Nietzsche instead of being a kind of dialectician 
saying trying to draw you in you know inextricably into a into his own position 
where you have to agree with him is he saying here it is take it or leave it
sf5147: mm mm
sf5148: no i don't think he is
nm5143: and if you do take it you have to take it all you have to take 
everything
nm5144: you seek followers seek zeros
nm5143: [laugh] 
sf5148: on page twenty-one says you will be thankful to me if insight make it 
easier to understand and i dare you to contradict it i think that's 
nm5144: yeah
nm5143: right
sf5148: but be er 
nm5144: no
nm5143: okay
nm5144: it comes back doesn't it to that notion of tyranny that you raised i 
think right at the beginning er is er the dialectic is objected to because in a 
certain sense it's it's tyrannical it's authoritarian it forces you it 
necessitates you into certain types of position and what is being presented 
here is a if it's a model of reason at all something that is challenging how 
much truth does a spirit dare rather than in a certain sense compelling you let 
me just tell you one la-, final thing the Greek word for necessitation that 
Aristotle uses for the necessitation of the necessary conclusion following from 
premise is also the word that you can use in Greek when you are being frog-
marched off to the jail you are necessitated to the jail you are necessitated 
to a conclusion and that notion of necessitation is perhaps on Nietzsche's 
account tyranny it's a thought anyway
nm5143: okay so next week er yeah er er er on Monday we'll hear from er namex 
and namex yes on reason illusion and the problem of language and from er Gary 
and Sarah who aren't here on the history of error er laughs
nm5144: depending if you
nm5143: if any of you see them yes remind them that we're expecting them on the 
history of error [laughter] on Monday okay
nm5144: thank you very much every every
om5150: can you sign that for me
nm5144: right
nm5143: yeah
om5150: thank you 
nm5144: okay
om5150: thank you everybody
