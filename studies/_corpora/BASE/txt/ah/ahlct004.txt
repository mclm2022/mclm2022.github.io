nm0048: there's [0.2] a sign-up sheet starting [0.9] from him [0.5] and going 
[0.2] to the front hopefully [0.8] so if you suddenly realize you haven't got 
it give us a shout [0.5] now what i want to do today is [2.0] to look at 
another case study [0.2] 'cause we were looking last time at [0.5] er the 
Imperial Way Via dell [0.3] dell'Impero [0.2] at the centre of Rome connecting 
the Colosseum up to [0.2] the Victor Emmanuel monument yes [0.7] remember that 
bit [0.6] maybe [0.2] bit hazy [0.7] so [0.3] there's a message also from namex 
[0.8] that your seminar this week [0.5] er which if you haven't got the sheets 
from last time 'cause i gave them out [0.3] there are some [0.2] there so 
collect one on the way out [0.3] they will be on Friday he's going to put a 
sheet up [0.5] on the board [0.2] to sign up [0.5] to [0.4] put you into groups 
so as usual seminars this week [0.2] there's no lecture on Thursday [1.0] right 
so [0.3] today we want to look at [0.8] what is known as Foro Italica it's 
where the Olympic Stadium is in Rome [0.6] and [0.2] what was happening [0.2] 
in terms of the setting up of that architectural space [0.4] so [0.3] we want 
to carry on [0.5] with our theme [0.5] of [0.2] looking at 
architecture as a setting [0.3] for [0.2] modern activities [0.4] in this case 
with reference to sport in particular [0.4] in the nineteen-thirties [0.9] 
nineteen-twenties and nineteen-thirties [0.6] and looking at the references 
back to antiquity [0.5] now to do that [0.2] we have to do a certain amount of 
modern history [0.5] which we'll try and keep to the minimum [0.4] i mean in 
terms of dates events et cetera things to know [0.4] so i want to start off 
with [0.2] a quick run-through [0.5] of [0.3] the things which are [0.5] 
happening in terms of modern history [1.5] which are [0.9] needed [0.7] for 
doing [1.5] this bit of the course [0.4] right [1.6] now [0.8] the key thing 
here is [0.6] the [0.6] there's a reference back to antiquity always when it 
comes to the Olympics by the Olympic movement [0.4] er on [0.6] the 
bibliography there's an article by namex History department [0.3] looking at 
the earlier history of the Olympics so if you want to know more about the 
Olympics generally [1.2] now [0.3] key things [0.3] in terms of [0.5] what is 
happening in Rome [0.7] once again [0.5] Mussolini isn't starting something 
completely new [0.4] it's a key 
thing here is it's not completely new [0.5] nineteen-o-eight [0.2] Rome had 
made a bid [0.5] for the Olympic Games [0.7] definite bid [0.4] to get the 
Olympic Games [0.2] into Rome [0.6] there were plans to [0.4] build a new 
stadium [0.4] build a new sporting complex [0.2] so [0.3] in this case we get 
[0.7] an example of something which has been thought of [0.3] been done before 
[0.5] but is going to have a greater relevance in the nineteen-thirties in 
terms of [0.4] actual happening [1.6] the [1.0] Rome is also making a bid for 
the Olympics of nineteen-forty and nineteen-forty-four [0.3] and it was decided 
in the late thirties that Rome would have the Olympics in nineteen-forty-four 
which never happened [0.6] after [0.3] the Second World War [0.7] this building 
[0.8] over here [0.4] became the headquarters of the Olympic movement [0.2] so 
[0.4] although this is [0.2] strongly associated with fascist Italy [0.4] its 
use today is linked in to that tradition [0.3] of the Olympics [1.9] now [1.6] 
in terms of [0.7] what [0.9] we need to know here [1.2] there is something 
called the O-N-B [1.2] right now the O-N-B [1.0] is [1.0] it's on your handout 
most of the factual details 
you'll find are on your handout [0.6] the [0.5] O-N-B [0.4] is [0.8] a national 
organization [0.2] for [0.2] youth [1.1] and [0.5] in terms of what it does [1.
3] it's a very male [1.1] it's called the Opera Nazionale Balilla [0.2] Balilla 
was [0.4] a revolutionary in Italy in the seventeen-forties [0.2] who revolted 
against Austria [0.3] brought Italy away from Austria [0.5] so it's a reference 
back to Italian history [0.6] but if we look at the organization [0.9] this is 
the male organization the female organization [0.3] is [0.4] quite is simple [0.
4] in terms of it's a different structure [0.2] if you're between the ages of 
nought and fourteen [0.3] you are [0.5] er [0.2] the female children of Italy 
[0.4] if you're from fourteen to eighteen [0.3] you are the young women of 
Italy so again [0.3] there is a [0.4] er [0.4] a female aspect to this as well 
as the male aspect the male aspect [0.3] has more references back to antiqui-, 
to antiquity [1.8] the [0.4] structure of the whole organization [0.3] is [0.6] 
imbued with ideas of antiquity [0.6] between the ages of nought and eight [1.7] 
you're in what's called the groups known as the Sons of the Wolf now we're 
straight back to Romulus and Remus here [0.6] we're straight back into [0.4] 
that idea [0.2] of antiquity [1.6] but then between the ages of eight to 
fourteen [0.2] you're what known [0.6] you're in what's known as the Balilla [0.
2] the Balilla is again this revolutionary [0.3] from [0.2] the eighteenth 
century [0.2] so that's a reference to [0.2] Italian history it's creating [0.
2] the two together [1.6] in between fourteen and eighteen [0.3] you become [0.
5] members of the Advanced Guard [1.2] so [0.3] in terms of that structure [0.
2] we have an automatic reference back to antiquity [0.5] reference to [0.5] 
Italian national history [0.6] and then [0.5] a reference to what's going on 
now to seems to er [0.2] see the Advanced Guard of [0.3] Fascism and again the 
cult of youth is very important here [1.8] now [0.4] when you go [1.2] through 
[0.2] the actual [0.2] organization as well [0.9] in terms of how [0.8] the 
boys are organized [0.9] eleven boys [0.2] is what's known as a squad [1.5] 
then you have [0.3] three squads [0.3] equals a maniple a maniple is one of 
those [0.3] names used for [0.3] military organizations in ancient Rome [1.1] 
then you have three mam-, maniples [0.3] makes up a 
century [0.7] typical [0.3] idea of [0.2] Roman organization the century again 
[0.7] and then you have [0.5] three centuries [0.2] equals a cohort [0.3] and 
three cohorts equals a legion [0.3] they don't [0.2] replicate antiquity [0.5] 
but they [0.5] make reference [0.2] to [0.4] antiquity's military organization 
[1.6] now what [0.6] does the O-N-B do [0.2] really [0.3] it's a organization 
[0.4] for [1.0] children to be in principally [0.9] it's also involved [0.5] in 
[0.2] physical education [0.3] physu-, physical education [0.3] and the setting 
up [0.5] of [0.6] athletics [0.2] organizations so [0.3] the link [0.2] comes 
from [0.6] this voluntary organization [0.3] it's a sort of after school 
organization [0.2] you could see parallels with things like the Hitler Youth in 
Germany [2.0] the other thing [0.2] the O-N-B [0.4] which is all you need to 
know don't [0.3] try and learn the long title [3.2] what it's doing in Rome [0.
9] is it's setting up [0.7] plans [0.9] after it set up in nineteen-twenty-six 
we see the first plans [0.2] for the sports [0.8] complexes [0.2] in Rome [0.9] 
now [0.4] the key here [0.4] is [0.2] the g-, link between sport [0.3] 
education [0.3] and politicalization [0.5] the three things go together [1.3] 
and [0.4] what is also set up in that year [0.5] is [0.3] 
the fascist [0.5] Academy [0.2] of Physical Education [0.8] and [0.3] that 
academy [0.7] is was going to be [0.3] in this building here [0.8] right right 
next this is the Olympic Stadium [0.4] people may know from football [0.5] and 
[0.2] on this side [0.3] over here [0.3] was going to be [0.3] the [0.7] er [0.
5] Academy [0.3] for Swimming [0.6] so on this side you have swimming [0.5] 
this side you have athletics [0.4] right in the middle [0.4] you have [0.3] the 
football stadium [1.1] so what we want to look at here [0.3] is [0.9] to think 
through [0.2] how this structure is being set up [0.3] what are the architects 
doing in terms of [0.3] references back to antiquity [0.2] and what are they 
trying to do in the present [0.5] so here what we see [0.6] when [0.3] we go to 
Foro Italico [0.3] sorry over there [0.5] today [0.5] we see [0.2] the setting 
[0.4] for this organization [0.2] the setting up for [0.2] seeing [0.2] the 
idea of sport education and politicalization [0.4] all running together [7.3] 
so [0.2] just have some more [0.6] dates on this side and then we're go and 
look at [0.2] the actual structures themselves which is probably more [0.4] 
interesting [1.1] now originally [1.7] what was going to be set up was a Forum 
of Sport [0.5] 
Forum of Sport had always been on the cards the idea of the ancient concept of 
a forum [0.7] this had been [0.5] an idea floating around from the nineteen-o-
eight Olympics bid [0.4] that there should be a new Forum of Sport [1.2] now [1.
6] that [0.2] concept [0.5] the plan to set up in nineteen-twenty-seven [1.0] 
and gradually as the plans evolve [0.4] we find that Mussolini [0.2] is 
starting to im-, [0.4] be put over the top of those plans [1.0] nineteen-twenty-
seven you have to remember was only five years after the march on Rome [0.2] by 
Mussolini so the state [0.3] the fascist state is only five years old [2.7] now 
in nineteen-thirty [2.1] the Forum [0.9] of Sport [0.5] is renamed [0.6] the 
Forum [0.2] of Mussolini [0.8] today we call it [0.7] Forum of Italy because it 
was re [0.4] named again after the war 'cause it couldn't any longer be called 
[0.5] the Forum of Mussolini it wasn't politically [0.5] er [0.2] we would say 
today correct or politically acceptable then [1.1] in nineteen-thirty it's 
renamed by the architect [0.3] the Forum of Mussolini [1.0] at this point [0.8] 
there is a linking back [0.2] of [0.2] the person [0.7] onto [0.5] if you 
think in the nineteen-thirties [0.4] early nineteen-thirties the excavations [0.
4] of the Forum of Augustus are beginning [0.8] as we saw last time or the 
Forum of Julius Caesar [0.3] or the Forum of Trajan [0.4] so again [0.4] the 
associations of the word forum [0.6] suggests sort of basically a square around 
which buildings are placed [0.3] in terms of antiquity [0.4] but [0.3] by 
linking it to a named person you have a link back to the emperors of Rome [0.3] 
so again [0.2] we have this link with antiquity [2.4] now [0.8] the actual [0.
9] structures [0.3] take [0.5] have been [0.7] being constructed [0.4] up to [0.
3] nineteen-thirty-two [0.7] and this is the te-, for the tenth anniversary [0.
2] of the march on Rome [0.6] they are inaugurated [0.2] so again [0.2] 
nineteen-thirty-two's a very important date to know [0.2] as we saw last time 
[0.3] when we were talking about [0.4] the Imperial Way in the centre of Rome 
[0.2] connecting the Colosseum [0.6] to the Victor Emmanuel monument [1.1] so 
tenth anniversary Mussolini goes to inaugurate the first buildings are 
completed [0.6] and its [0.4] the first buildings [0.5] included [0.4] the 
Obelisk here [0.3] the Athletics [0.5] 
Academy [0.4] and the stadium's behind it [2.0] what we then find [2.1] is [0.
6] in nineteen-thirty-seven [0.6] additional structures are being built [0.6] 
nineteen-thirty-seven [0.4] is the year in which [0.5] empire is declared for 
Italy [0.5] and this is where [0.7] we find [0.6] Piazza dell'Impero [0.3] or 
[0.2] the Piazza [0.4] of [0.5] Empire [0.7] which is [0.7] in here before you 
get to the Olympic Stadium [0.5] that [0.2] is completed [0.2] for nineteen-
thirty-seven [2.0] and [0.7] what we gradually see [1.1] in terms of what this 
structure's doing [0.3] it's outside Rome it's to the north of Rome [0.5] but 
it's going to be [0.2] the entry point into Rome [0.6] 
so it's almost as though [0.4] this is going to be the first point [0.4] on 
what you could say [0.6] is the entrance into Rome [0.3] entrance into modern 
Rome [2.1] right [0.3] so [0.3] in terms of [0.5] a boring date [0.2] that [0.
4] will keep you going [0.2] for your exams [0.3] basically in a year's time [0.
4] that's all [0.2] the dates you would ever need to know [0.7] there are some 
more [0.6] on the handout but that's [0.3] the overall political structure [0.
4] is there [0.8] so [1.0] key thing let's think back [0.2] it's not a new 
project [0.3] but [0.2] there's going to be something different about it [0.2] 
once it becomes more [0.6] er [0.5] organized by fascism [0.9] and [0.2] will 
have a greater reference to antiquity [1.0] right so [0.2] to look at the 
structures themselves [0.9] we're mostly [0.2] going to be concerned [0.4] with 
the athletics area [0.5] the [0.3] i put on your handout [0.6] er illustrations 
of all the buildings we're actually going to be referring to so [0.2] 
afterwards you can look through them [0.3] rather than having to depend on 
memory from [0.3] the slides i show you [2.5] right [0.3] the first action [0.
7] which is taken [0.2] in this process [0.2] is to drain [0.2] this 
area [0.4] just to the north of the Tiber [0.9] in doing so a law is passed 
that all Rome's rubbish [0.3] should be [0.3] deposited here [0.2] for two to 
three years [0.3] and so it gradually builds up [0.4] the embankment of the 
Tiber here [0.3] this is just [0.3] a marshy area [0.3] which is going to be 
reclaimed [0.6] and [0.8] we see [0.5] in that reclamation [0.2] is [0.2] is 
using a useless piece of land [0.5] and [0.2] reclaiming it through modern 
technology [0.2] to create something new to create a new quarter of Rome [0.4] 
and [0.5] you might thinking here of s-, [0.2] parallels with things like the 
draining of the Pontine marshes [0.2] one of the most famous [0.3] activities 
of [0.2] the fascist government [2.8] the plan itself [0.2] is fairly simple [0.
2] in terms [0.2] of a series of stadiums [0.2] series of [0.4] areas [0.2] for 
which people are going to be [0.2] mostly to do with sport [0.7] now [0.4] the 
key thing after nineteen-thirty-seven [0.2] there's going to be a greater 
influence of politics [0.3] politics becomes more important [2.3] and [1.1] the 
idea [0.2] the architect's vision [0.2] of what [0.9] the area should look like 
[0.4] the area is [0.5] down here [0.2] of the sports stadiums [0.2] and 
overlooking it [0.2] should be the monument to fascism [0.6] this [0.4] rather 
strange victory monument [0.2] which [1.0] they made a model of it a mock-up of 
it [0.3] again [0.3] what we're going to see throughout [0.7] the Forum [1.0] 
of Mussolini [0.5] is the idea of the male body [0.3] the male body [0.3] and 
the cult of the body is going to come through time and time again [0.5] so the 
plan to overlook it [0.4] is [0.3] a colossal struc-, statue [0.6] now colossal 
statues in the ancient world [0.8] er you probably know that the Colossus [0.3] 
of Nero next to the Colosseum [0.7] was [0.2] one of the enormous statues from 
antiquity [0.3] here [0.5] you're going to see [0.7] a ca-, a colossus [0.2] 
put next to [0.2] and overlooking [0.2] the modern sports stadium [0.6] and [0.
2] it's significant that the Colosseum in Ancient Rome [0.2] gets its name from 
the colossal statue next to it so [0.4] again [0.2] putting a colossal statue 
in there [0.4] is not [0.3] an original idea [0.2] it has a reference straight 
back to antiquity [3.3] now in terms of structure [1.7] this is [0.3] nineteen-
thirties [0.3] view [0.4] of the stadium [0.5] so remember the modern stadium 
[0.2] modern Olympic Stadium [0.4] got 
extended [0.2] for the last World Cup [0.2] in nineteen-ninety [0.4] here we 
see something different [0.8] so [0.7] if you [0.5] were coming [0.4] to the s-,
[0.3] to the stadium itself we want to move through [0.4] what you would see 
[0.6] the first thing you see [0.4] is this enormous obelisk [0.2] which is the 
first thing we want to look at [0.7] then we want to look at this piazza [0.5] 
the Piazza of Empire [0.5] before looking [0.3] at [0.6] this structure here [0.
2] the [0.7] central area [0.2] for athletics in [0.2] fascist Italy [0.4] and 
looking at the stadium behind it [0.4] before finally [0.4] moving on [0.4] to 
[0.2] what was [0.2] the football stadium itself so [0.2] and we're going to 
pick up [0.3] references to antiquity [0.2] right the way through [0.3] 
sf0049: are all those buildings part of the forum [0.6] 
nm0048: yeah [0.4] the thing with the forum is [0.6] if [0.4] in [0.2] Ancient 
Rome [0.8] in republican Rome the forum is [0.6] a piazza [0.2] which is 
surrounded by buildings put [0.6] placed [0.6] around it so [0.2] when we say a 
forum [0.2] we mean [0.3] the whole area [0.4] the whole area is called Forum 
[0.3] Mussolini or Foro Mussolini [0.9] so [0.3] the individual buildings make 
up [0.2] the forum [5.0] right the first thing [0.2] is [0.7] the [1.0] obelisk 
[2.3] now [1.7] this obelisk [0.7] as you can see [0.7] 
has Mussolini's name on it [0.3] and says D-U [0.2] there's an X there [0.3] 
Dux [0.2] so [0.2] leader [0.3] reference back to Julius Caesar being perpetual 
dictator [0.5] just as [0.4] Mussolini is perpetual dictator [1.0] however [1.
2] significantly [1.4] this is made out of [0.2] virtually [0.3] one block [0.
2] of Carrara marble [0.5] Carrara marble [0.2] you may know [0.5] is [0.3] the 
white marble which Michelangelo uses [0.3] that was f-, used for the first time 
[0.5] in Augustan Rome [1.6] the [1.7] and you can see [0.5] inscribed in it [0.
2] is one of the fasciae which we were talking about last time [0.2] so always 
look for things like fasciae they crop up everywhere after a while [1.3] the [1.
0] cutting [0.2] of the block itself this was the biggest block of Carrara 
marble ever quarried [0.5] again that idea of [0.2] we're going to be better 
than everything which has gone in the past is there [0.5] we're going to use 
the biggest piece of Carrara marble [0.8] so it was d-, [0.2] cut out [0.2] at 
the quarry [1.2] and then [0.2] it was dragged [0.2] by oxen [0.2] through the 
towns of Italy it was something which was reported [0.4] in [0.6] Italian 
magazines and in the Italian press it was an 
event in itself [0.4] to actually bring this thing [0.3] by road through the 
towns [0.2] north of Rome [2.8] and [0.5] the spectacle [0.3] it's almost like 
[0.2] the spectacle [0.2] of the monolith of Mussolini [0.2] this is going to 
be the new idea [0.4] of [0.8] the obelisk [0.2] where as we're going to talk 
about [0.3] think about how that relates to obelisks from antiquity [0.4] in a 
moment [1.5] it was set up [0.5] er [0.4] in a way which was used by the Popes 
to set up obelisks [0.2] in front of Saint Peter's [0.4] and using [0.2] 
hydraulics [0.2] again [0.3] the idea of modern technology [0.6] and its 
utilization to be celebrated [0.4] is also part of the fascist ideology [0.4] 
so [0.3] it uses modern technology [0.3] but will have a reference back [0.3] 
to antiquity [2.9] now in terms of [0.9] what it looks like [0.6] this is [0.3] 
and architects' drawings actually show you a l-, a lot about how [0.5] people 
th-, [0.2] the architect is thinking about things in terms of light and dark [0.
4] you always have a lot of very dark er [0.4] sort of the white and dark is 
very [0.3] strong [0.2] in Italian fascist drawings [0.6] now this is [0.8] 
what the architect sees it looking at it [1.2] now the other thing [0.6] to 
think of parallels with antiquity here [0.7] is with [0.7] the parallel with 
the Augustan sundial [0.5] the Augustan sundial in Rome [0.8] was [0.3] made of 
an obelisk [0.4] captured from Egypt [0.2] brought back to Rome [1.8] the [0.8] 
obelisk itself was the pointer [0.3] for the sundial [0.8] now [0.3] that 
structure [0.3] is almost paralleled [0.4] with this one [0.6] 'cause it had 
the obelisk in the centre [0.7] of this [0.5] piazza [0.8] which is [8.7] which 
is called Piazzale di Impero or little piazza of Empire [0.6] but [0.2] on each 
of these blocks [0.6] is recorded [0.2] a date from the fascist age [0.4] so [0.
4] whereas the Augustan sundial recorded things like hi-, Augustustus' 
horoscope [0.6] in this case [0.2] we're going to find [0.6] put on here [0.2] 
inscribed stones [0.2] with [0.2] significant dates from the modern state [0.2] 
so [0.2] the structure [0.2] parallels [0.2] the ancient sundial [0.6] of Italy 
[0.7] of Augustus [0.6] but [0.4] we have here [0.5] the inscription of exact 
date rather than the pointer trying to point to them [4.5] right so [0.2] when 
you go there today [0.6] and [0.4] it's [0.8] almost the same [0.2] as it was 
then some of it's fallen apart [0.4] and [0.5] the blocks [0.3] recording [0.2] 
the various years of 
the fascist state [0.6] are [0.4] graffitied over [0.2] deliberately [0.6] as a 
sort of anti-fascist [0.5] concept [0.7] now in terms of [0.8] what we have 
here is [0.2] we have a piazza [0.3] the obelisk [0.2] is this way on [1.0] and 
as you walk to [0.2] the football stadium [0.3] you walk over [0.3] these 
modern mosaics [0.4] modern mosaics which make reference [0.6] back to the past 
[0.6] but also [0.3] contain [0.4] very obvious [0.2] fasciaes [0.4] and then 
as you go across them [0.5] you see various images [0.3] as you move [0.3] 
towards the stadium [3.1] for instance [0.2] on one side [1.5] let's go back [1.
7] should point it out that on this side [0.4] we have [0.3] images in the 
mosaics [0.2] of modern Italy [0.5] of nineteen-thirties Italy [0.9] and on [0.
3] the other side over here [0.3] you have Ancient Rome [0.6] so [0.5] we were 
talking about last time how you have this juxtaposition of past and present so 
[0.3] on the left [0.3] you have the past [0.3] on the right [0.2] you have the 
present so [0.2] they're put next to each other [0.4] as this technology of 
power [3.2] 
so we have obvious things like the Tiber [0.3] the Tiber [0.3] is generic [0.2] 
because it's ancient and modern [1.1] we also have [1.3] on the other side [1.
1] the bull [0.5] the symbol of Italy [0.2] the idea of the whole of Italy so 
the Tiber in a way [0.2] represents Rome [0.4] whereas the bull [0.3] will 
represent [0.2] the whole of Italy [4.2] and [0.3] as you go up on the [0.3] 
ancient side [0.3] you find [0.4] buildings such as the Theatre of Marcellus [0.
2] laid out in plan [1.1] or [0.2] some temples laid out in plan [0.2] with 
their name put next to them [0.9] then [0.5] very clear [0.3] mosaic idea then 
on the other side [0.6] surprise surprise you have a plan [0.2] of the Forum of 
Mussolini [0.7] so [0.3] again you have that juxtaposition between [1.1] the 
ancient [0.4] theatre the place of the games [0.5] in terms of scenic ga-, 
games [0.7] and then [0.8] you have the modern one [0.3] which [0.4] you have 
[0.6] various structures like [0.4] the stadium [0.8] the Olympic Stadium there 
[0.3] and [0.2] another sports stadium there so [0.2] you have this constant 
juxtaposition [0.4] even when [0.2] there isn't antiquity actually there [0.3] 
it's not present in any 
form [0.4] in the Forum Mussolini [4.6] as you [0.3] go through [0.7] you also 
see [1.0] the blocks with the inscriptions [0.7] now this one [0.3] is the 
first block that you would [0.2] see in terms of the sequence [0.6] the 
sequence begins [0.5] on the twenty-fourth of May [0.7] nineteen- [0.3] fifteen 
[0.2] Italy enters the First World War [0.3] that is the first action [0.5] 
which is recorded here [0.4] the first action [0.3] is [0.4] militaristic [0.2] 
from recent history [2.0] then [0.4] as you [0.2] go past them [0.8] you see 
other ones this one is [0.3] the ninth of May [1.3] nineteen-thirty-six [0.2] 
the proclamation of empire [0.2] there's one [0.2] for nineteen-twenty-two [0.
3] the fascist march on Rome [0.5] so [0.4] this is a way [0.3] of marking [0.
5] the important dates from the recent past [0.4] but putting them in the 
context [0.4] of something which looks quite antique the architect's [0.3] 
deliberately quoting [0.4] from antiquity [1.3] and the last one [0.4] which is 
[1.1] something which is reappropriated [0.3] is the twenty-fifth of July [0.4] 
nineteen-forty-three [0.2] the end of the [0.7] er fascist regime [0.4] and 
then after that [0.3] there are a series [0.2] of blank [0.5] blocks [0.9] and 
[0.6] it's written under here [0.2] a [0.2] little graffiti [0.5] 
which says instead it's continued so again its political commentary can be made 
on the monuments themselves [0.2] and be reappropriated [3.6] at the end [0.5] 
of [0.4] the piazza [0.7] you [0.2] find [0.9] this fountain structure [0.3] 
this is called [0.6] the spherical fountain or the Fontana dei Sfera [0.6] 
which [0.3] is made out [0.2] of another block [0.3] of [0.3] Carrara marble [0.
6] and [0.2] to represent the Earth [0.2] very much so like you see [0.4] 
winged victories from antiquity [0.2] standing on a globe [0.5] so [0.2] a 
reference to the idea [0.2] of the whole empire [1.6] around it [0.2] we have 
[0.8] fish mosaics [0.4] mosaics [0.3] which are very similar to those you find 
[0.2] in Roman bathhouses [0.4] so [0.2] you could actually go to the monuments 
of Rome to see bathhouses [0.4] and [0.4] be here [0.3] and you'd see [0.4] 
modern ones [0.5] made of slightly [0.2] stylized fashion [0.2] stylized 
differently [4.6] it's [0.7] the other thing [0.6] you find [0.3] in the 
mosaics as you get closer to the athletics stadiums [0.7] are [0.3] emphasis [0.
3] on [0.3] what goes on here [0.8] and [0.2] you find [0.2] here we have two 
boxers [0.3] but [0.5] they're placed [0.8] in a di-, sort of rather antique [0.
2] form [0.4] in terms of creating [0.3] the bit of tree behind them 
as though it's some form of pastoral scene [2.7] and you find other ones which 
[0.3] some of them [0.7] here [0.2] we have somebody with a lionskin [0.3] club 
[0.3] looks very like Hercules so [0.6] whoops [0.3] so you can have [0.5] 
modern ones [0.6] and then you can have [0.8] overtly [0.4] antique references 
as well [4.5] and you have a strutting [0.6] very modernistic eagle [0.2] 
running over the top [0.2] again we saw eag-, the importance of eagles [0.2] 
last time [3.4] now [0.8] the [0.9] spherical fountain [1.5] has a reference 
back [0.2] to [0.6] a small shrine [0.7] of the goddess [4.0] we don't have any 
[0.2] yes we do [10.8] a small fountain near the [0.3] ancient forum [1.2] is 
of [1.9] where is it [0.5] must be the other one [1.3] Juturna J-U-T-U-R- [0.3] 
N-A [0.3] the Lacus Juturnae the fountain of [0.4] Juturna [0.4] is in the 
Forum at Rome [0.2] so [0.3] similarly in the Forum Mussolini [0.2] we found [0.
2] a fountain structure as well [0.5] again [0.2] another reference back [0.4] 
to the idea of a forum in antiquity [0.3] being made in this very modern [0.4] 
sports stadium area [4.8] right the next [0.9] building we need to look at [0.
7] is [0.7] the Academy [0.2] of Physical Education [2.4] Academy of Physical 
Education [0.8] stay 
on [1.2] [6.5] the [0.8] Academy of Physical Education [0.2] is one of those [0.
9] structures [1.3] right [0.4] antiquity [0.2] also has mosaics [0.3] and one 
of the boasts of [0.2] these mosaics in the Forum [0.3] of Mussolini [0.4] is 
they are bigger [0.2] than any mosaic from antiquity [0.4] so it's almost that 
idea of remaking antiquity [0.3] but [0.3] bigger again [2.4] and you have 
words such as [0.4] er [0.4] duce for us again key things [0.2] key political 
messages to make the mosaics more didactic [0.4] in a way [0.3] that antiquity 
never had them [0.2] so [0.3] a way of [0.4] putting Mussolini [0.4] physically 
[0.6] into the mosaics themselves [0.2] don't have to do a picture of him [0.3] 
you just use the word dux repeatedly [0.3] and the word Mussolini [2.4] right 
so [0.9] we've looked [1.0] so far [0.4] at this area [0.4] the entrance area 
[0.3] if you were coming [0.5] to [0.2] see athletics [0.5] or if you were 
going to be there [0.4] at the planned nineteen-forty-four [0.4] Olympics [1.5] 
the [1.5] athletics area [0.6] this is the Academy for Athletics [0.6] and 
behind it [0.5] is what's known [0.6] as [0.7] the Stadium [0.6] of Marble [1.
4] and on [0.3] the other side [0.6] this very low flat [0.4] Olympic Stadium 
[0.5] in its original form [0.4] so we want 
to look at [0.4] this one [0.4] this one [0.6] and the last one [4.1] now [0.7] 
Academy of Physical Education [0.9] is [0.2] built in a very modernistic style 
[0.5] it looks [0.3] different from flat buildings [0.2] if you look at its [1.
2] overall plan [0.4] it's built [1.0] in [0.2] a very peculiar [0.3] 
modernistic fashion [0.2] again we're talking about the futurism [0.3] the 
rejection of everything to do with the past [0.5] this building [0.4] would add 
up to the same thing [2.5] its structure [0.3] not surprisingly [0.3] you can 
spot the fasciaes here [0.3] but it's full [0.2] of statues [0.4] statues [0.4] 
crop up [0.3] time and time again through these buildings [1.6] and [0.3] at 
the back [0.6] in [0.4] the stadium [2.2] Stadio dei Marmi [0.4] Stadium of 
Marbles [0.5] we find [0.7] eighty statues [0.2] have been placed [0.2] around 
the seating area [0.7] so if you're watching [0.6] the athletics [0.7] or [0.2] 
the events which are done here in terms of [0.3] political events as well [1.7] 
the thing which is looking over your shoulder [0.2] are these four metre high 
statues [0.9] they're all of males [0.4] they're all [0.2] in [0.3] vaguely 
heroic forms [0.8] now the statues themselves [1.7] are donated [0.2] by 
individual cities of Italy [0.6] the statues are given [0.5] they're [0.3] 
individual cities [0.2] commission [0.2] the statues there's quite a few [0.3] 
on your handout [1.4] 
the [1.0] donation [0.4] all the specifications are [0.2] that they should be 
four metres high [0.4] they're all slightly different they're not all done by 
the same artist [1.2] and [0.9] give you an idea of one's [0.2] this one is 
outside [0.5] the stadium [0.7] which [1.2] shows huge [0.2] muscular [0.4] 
figures again [0.3] this emphasis on the body [0.7] and [0.5] one of the things 
which Mussolini does regularly [0.2] if he goes to visit people [0.4] in the 
campaign for wheat [0.3] which he [0.3] the fascist stage orchestrates [0.3] 
Mussolini [0.3] takes off his shirt and starts helping to cut the wheat [0.3] 
or he goes to the beach he takes off his shirt and goes in the sea [0.4] so 
there's a cult [0.3] of the body in Italy [0.3] coming out here [0.6] cult 
which can be [0.4] produced through [0.4] sport organizations or [0.4] things 
like the O-N-B in particular [0.8] and they're organizing it for adults but 
they're also organizing it for children to train children [0.3] in [0.5] the 
ways of [0.2] physical exercise [0.4] so i think [0.3] very [0.3] strong 
emphasis on being [0.2] 
physically fit [0.3] whether you are young [0.2] or old [2.2] now the statues 
themselves [0.7] once you're inside [0.4] they all [0.2] repeat [0.2] the 
similar theme of body perfection [0.4] and [0.3] the muscular body [3.3] and 
they [0.2] become vaguely heroic they're not like ancient statues [0.3] key 
thing is [0.3] they look like [0.7] because they're naked [0.3] they look like 
ancient statues [0.4] but if you actually look at their features [0.2] their 
far more modernistic style [0.6] the style is quite different from let's say [0.
3] the Prima Porta Augustus [0.6] Prima Porta Augustus [0.3] looks like [0.4] 
Augustan statues [0.6] look [0.2] very thin [0.2] very effeminate in a way 
compared with this [0.3] so [0.2] the emphasis here [0.2] is on the real man [0.
3] whereas [0.6] st-, statues of things like Apollo [0.2] don't add up to that 
[0.7] concept i-, within Italy of the real man [3.3] the other feature of this 
stadium [0.3] is its [0.3] lowness it's very low in the ground [0.5] now the 
stadiums all the stadiums were quite flat they were dug out of the ground [0.9] 
and [0.7] the Olympic Stadium you just have to block it out but again [0.2] 
that would be a very low stadium [1.2] so one of 
the things [0.2] you're going to find [0.2] is [0.5] there are sculptural 
points [0.2] which stick up [1.1] 'cause you tend t-, the statues stick up 
above [0.9] the [0.2] drop [0.2] into the stadium itself [5.5] now [0.4] the [1.
3] stadium structure in terms of [0.6] the organization [0.2] of the stadium 
how you go into it [0.9] also has parallels from the Colosseum [1.0] because [0.
9] the spec-, [0.2] the spectators [0.2] come in [0.2] this way [0.3] having 
seen things like the spherical fountain mosaics et cetera [0.3] they come in [0.
2] from this angle [0.7] the [0.4] people involved in the actual sport [0.4] 
come in [0.6] down [0.3] this ramp [0.5] into the what you could call the arena 
area there [1.7] and this structure is paralleled in that of the Colosseum [0.
2] it's paralleled in that of the Circus Maximus [0.2] from antiquity as well 
[0.2] so again [0.4] we can play this game of snap where there's something 
modern [0.3] something antique [0.4] very deliberate [0.2] organization [2.5] 
the [0.6] and not surprisingly [0.3] in [0.3] the athletics area [0.3] you have 
[0.3] mosaics of people jumping [0.5] running [0.2] et cetera [0.4] it's all [0.
3] still there today [0.4] and it would have been [0.2] er [0.3] pristine [0.2] 
at the time [1.9] and you 
have things like equestrians [0.6] and whatever [1.0] this person could be 
doing presumably [0.2] some form of wrestling [0.5] but again [0.3] that cult 
of the very big [0.2] bulky body [0.2] very muscular [0.5] body is there [0.6] 
even [0.8] within [0.8] things like the sprinters again there's this emphasis 
[0.2] on [0.3] the very [0.3] sort of muscle toned [0.5] male [1.7] and [0.3] 
one of the things is there are no [0.2] female images [0.3] on this [0.3] at 
all [0.3] whatsoever [0.5] it's as though [0.4] female sport just didn't [0.3] 
exist [0.8] and you see up here [0.3] in the inscription [0.4] is [0.2] the 
inscription of O-N-B [0.2] the organizers of the whole thing [3.3] now [0.4] 
that's [1.3] one aspect of it [1.2] terms of the sport aspect [0.5] if you look 
at the middle photo here [0.6] which has just slipped out of focus [5.4] the [0.
7] here [0.2] you see a military parade [0.5] in [0.2] that Stadium [0.3] of 
Marbles [0.2] with the statues [0.4] around here [1.0] another feature [0.5] of 
[1.9] the Forum of Mussolini [0.4] is [0.3] the idea [0.2] of politicalization 
[0.6] politicalization [0.7] in terms of [0.4] having [0.2] great events occur 
here [0.9] it's one of the things which [0.4] children [0.3] from all over 
Italy [0.3] were sent to Rome [0.3] to stay [0.7] in [0.4] the Forum [0.2] of 
Mussolini [1.7] 
for a number of weeks [0.8] and one of the things [0.2] they can see are the 
mass rallies of things like soldiers [0.5] but another thing is the actual 
doing [0.8] and [0.2] one of the things they do is they grow wheat [0.2] next 
to the Forum [0.2] for children to come and cut [0.3] again there's this thing 
in [0.5] fascist Italy of [0.3] the campaign for wheat [0.4] but [0.6] it's a 
very ideological campaign to grow more wheat [0.9] and [0.4] to bring children 
into the idea of growing more wheat [0.2] they were brought here to practise 
sport but they also [0.3] went out [0.3] to cut the wheat in the summer as well 
[0.3] so [0.3] there's a double purpose here [0.7] in terms of ideology [1.3] 
the [1.0] building in the background [2.1] is [0.7] a building which has now 
become [0.3] the Italian Foreign Ministry [0.7] this is [0.2] the Palace of the 
Fascists [0.2] the Palace of the Lictors [0.8] and [1.0] this structure [0.6] 
is set up [0.5] as the new [0.4] headquarters of fascism in Rome [0.2] of the 
Fascist Party [0.2] not of the government but of the Fascist Party [0.3] 
there's a difference [0.2] to be made there [1.2] and [0.5] outside of it [0.8] 
in this square here [0.5] was [0.2] a huge piazza area [0.4] piazza area [0.3] 
which 
could contain four-hundred-thousand people [0.7] sort of very like Tiananmen 
Square in China [0.5] similar [0.6] type of structure [0.7] and in [1.1] 
architect's drawing [2.3] not surprisingly [0.8] you have [0.2] things like an 
obelisk [0.3] horses here [0.3] ideas about Castor and Pollux [0.2] put two 
horses together [0.6] in [0.3] if you've imbued everybody with the ideology of 
fascism [0.5] people automatically think of Castor and Pollux [1.2] and [0.2] 
Castor and Pollux of course helped the Romans in a battle [0.3] so [0.2] it's 
those twins again [0.2] Roman history [0.3] made large by association [4.1] and 
[0.4] the key [0.4] element here [0.3] is if you are [0.5] watching [0.2] a 
spectacle here or taking part in the spectacle [0.5] you can always see [0.2] 
the fascist headquarters [0.3] this idea of visibility [0.4] is very important 
what other monuments you can see [0.5] so [0.9] there is [0.2] the political 
headquarters [0.2] is put next to [0.2] the sporting headquarters of Italy [0.
4] in terms of [0.3] the Fascist Party [5.0] 
now [2.2] to look [0.3] briefly [0.3] at the Olympic Stadium [0.4] because [1.
1] it's a bit sport [0.9] fanatics [3.1] in terms of [0.4] what it looks like 
[0.7] today it's been [0.9] had another stadium put on to increase the seating 
capacity [0.7] originally [0.6] it was [0.7] a s-, a stadium [0.8] this stadium 
still lies underneath it if you go [0.4] to this er to Italian football match 
today you come out of one of these things [0.2] and then [0.3] there's about 
that much more stadium on top of it [1.2] now the thing [0.3] with this stadium 
is [0.7] it seats fifty-five-thousand people [1.1] is the design it's a design 
it was going to be called the Stadium for Fifty-five-thousand people [2.0] it 
is [4.7] now that number in itself is the same number [0.3] as it's estimated 
[0.2] was [0.2] as the number of people who'd get in the Colosseum [0.5] so [0.
4] if you think about the forums of [0.7] of Ancient Rome [0.2] next to the 
Colosseum [0.5] here [0.4] we have [0.9] the forums [0.4] of modern Rome [0.3] 
next to [0.5] the stadium the Olympic Stadium [1.0] the [0.4] structure of it 
is again seating [0.2] a low surround [0.3] but [0.2] on 
top of it [0.2] are these huge eagles [0.5] now the eagles also contained 
floodlights [0.5] again so there's again there's technology here [0.6] one of 
the things which [0.6] you see is that use of technology modern technology [0.
4] but [0.3] you turn the floodlights into [0.3] eagles [0.2] to make them look 
classical [0.6] so [0.2] there's a double usage here something very modern [0.
2] but it has a reference back to antiquity [4.7] and [2.5] the other feature 
[0.4] of it a series of flagpoles [0.5] this is used for Hitler's [0.2] visit 
to Rome [0.4] in the ninet-, nineteen-thirty-eight [0.7] and [0.2] for the huge 
[0.3] displays [0.3] of government of sort of government popularity [1.1] what 
are called sometimes the oceanic displays like it's a ocean of people [0.2] in 
front of it [2.8] right so [0.3] if we're going to think about [1.8] the effect 
[0.7] of all this [0.7] in terms of Rome [0.6] and the effect [0.5] of what the 
intention is [1.3] one of the things [1.0] we talked about [1.2] very beginning 
today [0.7] was [0.8] the idea [0.5] of a triumphal route [1.0] the idea of [0.
7] the Forum of Mussolini [0.2] as being the entry point into the city [0.8] 
Forum of Mussolini [0.3] being [0.2] where people came into 
the city [1.9] and [0.6] the concept is to create a triumphal route from the 
Foro Mussolini [0.4] you go across the river [0.5] you go into [0.2] through 
the city walls of Rome [0.2] the original third century A-D walls of Rome [0.4] 
you go down [0.5] the road to the [0.4] piazza [0.5] with [0.2] Augustus' 
mausoleum in which we were talking about last time [1.2] you then [0.2] move on 
[0.2] to the Victor Emmanuel monument [0.5] in the centre of Rome [0.3] and you 
end at the Colosseum [0.8] now [0.3] that route [0.7] is [0.2] so strongly [0.
2] created in terms of traffic route [0.4] that [0.2] today after [0.4] a great 
victory by Roma or Italy or Lazio [0.3] in the [0.6] er the football stadium [0.
5] people go [0.2] straight down that route [0.2] it's exactly the same route 
into Rome [0.5] er to celebrate at the Colosseum [0.4] and in front of the 
Victor Emmanuel monument [0.5] so [0.3] what's being created [0.4] is not just 
the Forum of Mussolini [0.5] the Forum of Mussolini is being created to connect 
into [0.4] the rest of the architecture of Rome [0.6] it's going to become [0.
2] an important point [0.4] within the architecture of Rome [3.5] now [2.5] so 
[0.9] one [0.9] key thing [0.7] is [0.2] to link [1.2] the celebration [0.8] of 
things like [0.5] the sport [1.7] which [0.2] takes place [0.6] in these low 
buildings [0.3] with [0.4] the vision of the statues [0.3] around in the 
Stadium of Marble [1.4] and [0.8] at the same time [1.6] within the stucture [1.
8] you have the technology of floodlights [0.4] this is [0.2] opening of the 
Olympic Games stuff [0.4] the style [0.4] of the nineteen-thirties i think we 
all know [0.5] about the sor-, opening of Olympic Games seem to be completely 
over the top [0.3] events of choreography [0.4] but [0.8] this also happened in 
the nineteen-thirties [0.3] and would be lit up at night again that use of 
technology to use the stadium at night's there [0.6] the other thing [0.3] as 
you can see from this [0.4] picture which is the football stadium [0.5] you can 
always see [0.3] the Palace of the Fascists nearby [0.5] it creates that link 
[0.4] with [0.6] the Fascist Party [0.9] but the other thing [1.4] which is [0.
8] nearly always visible [0.5] from anywhere in the original stadium [0.5] is 
the Obelisk of Mussolini [0.2] so [0.2] Mussolini [0.5] is there if [0.3] not 
present at the opening of these events [0.5] is present [0.6] by simply seeing 
[0.2] the enormous obelisk which has been 
reported in the press [0.3] so successfully [1.3] and [0.7] typically [0.2] 
people stand [0.2] in these arenas so you can get lots of people in there's 
none of this [0.2] seating [0.6] problem which is the current [0.3] football 
stadium [0.3] reduces the number of people in there [3.8] the other key thing 
[1.3] to think about [0.3] although [1.0] a lot of the artistic style [1.0] is 
has a reference back to antiquity [0.6] the way it's drawn [0.6] and the way 
it's represented [0.5] is linking in to [0.9] er [0.5] Italy's modern artistic 
movement [0.5] which [0.2] has a particular emphasis on the body [0.6] emphasis 
on the body and those chunky sculptures people are making [0.4] a lot of 
sculptures out of [0.6] of [0.3] things like peasantry [0.2] in the nineteen-
thirties [0.3] there's a [0.4] you go to [0.4] Rome's modern art gallery [0.2] 
you'll see [0.4] a lot of [0.5] very very chunky [0.2] these chunky sculptures 
can also be found in art galleries [0.2] as well as [0.5] in the stadium itself 
[2.1] so in terms of themes from antiquity [0.4] what are we seeing [1.9] the 
key theme [0.3] of [0.2] the Forum of [0.4] Mussolini [2.4] sure you can go 
backwards [1.6] is the idea [0.7] that [0.6] it links in [0.4] with [0.2] the 
Forums of 
Augustus [0.2] Trajan [0.2] Nerva [0.2] Julius Caesar [1.7] and [0.2] it seemed 
to be [0.2] bigger than them [0.3] like the mosaics are larger than those of 
antiquity [0.3] the piece of Carrara marble cut for that obelisk is bigger than 
any ever [0.5] so [0.3] bigger [0.2] than any ever is important [1.6] so 
there's comparison [0.2] but there's [0.2] surpassing antiquity [0.2] to create 
the new state of Italy [0.2] ver-, sorry [0.2] to create that new idea of 
civilization [0.3] we always find with [0.7] people who start using classical 
antiquity [0.3] they're always creating something new [0.6] and [0.3] classical 
antiquity is almost [0.2] the reference point [0.3] which it's going to be 
better than [0.2] that brave [0.3] new world idea [0.2] sort of modern utopia 
[1.8] the other thing [1.3] to think about is there's reference back to 
antiquity [0.2] via the seating capacity [0.3] with things like this stadium [0.
6] it's er automatic [0.3] why is it called the Stadium of Fifty-five-thousand 
[0.2] it's because the Colosseum [0.2] held the same number [0.3] there's that 
reference back to antiquity [0.6] you can also see [0.4] that [0.2] this 
structure [0.3] is the beginning [0.3] of the triumphal 
route into Rome [0.2] whereas the Colosseum is the end [0.2] so you begin with 
the modern world [0.3] and you end with antiquity [3.1] so [0.2] a new [0.2] 
triumphal route [0.2] into Rome is being created [0.2] by this new structure [2.
0] the other link [0.3] is to empire [0.4] and to always think of the dates the 
inauguration dates [0.2] you keep that nineteen-thirty-two [0.3] is when [0.7] 
the obelisk [0.4] the Stadium of Marbles [0.3] and [0.3] the football stadium 
[0.2] were all completed inaugurated by Mussolini [0.9] nineteen-thirty-seven 
[0.6] the inauguration of [0.4] the Imperial Square [0.3] with that round 
fountain in it [0.3] is the next stage so [0.2] those two dates [0.2] 
incredibly important [0.8] the other thing [0.2] to link in terms of empire [0.
4] is the cult of the body [0.3] the idea of youth [0.6] and [0.6] in 
particular [0.3] the fact that 
you can always see [0.4] images of empire wherever you go in this building [0.
5] you see images [0.4] of things like the eagles holding the floodlights [0.3] 
you see [0.8] Mussolini [0.3] placed onto the architecture [0.5] so in terms of 
architectural setting [0.7] the architectural setting creates the ambience [0.
6] of [0.3] a certain type of thinking about [0.4] the Italian state certain 
type of thinking which goes back [0.3] to the ancient world [0.2] but also 
looks forward [0.5] to a modern future [0.3] which will surpass [0.2] that of 
the ancient world [0.6] right [0.2] it's ten to so it's lunchtime [0.3] if you 
have any questions do [0.2] come and ask [0.5] er and your seminar's on [0.2] 
Friday
