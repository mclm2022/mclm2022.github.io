nm5019: okay has everyone got a sheet okay if you haven't where are those 
sheets 
sf5020: on the table 
nm5019: they're back on there are they and everyone's got a revision 
sm5023: can't find it 
sf5021: no i haven't 
sf5024: no 
sf5022: no i haven't 
sf5025: 
nm5019: okay so Thin Red Line er in relation to beauty now think as far as the 
exam goes er well you can use The Thin Red Line in the exam for a number of 
quest-, i'm telling you right right put it on film i'm telling you that you can 
use it for a number of of of questions er but and i've put some of the the 
issues down on er on the er on the handout but also er i i sort of gave you The 
Thin Red Line really in relation to the whole to the whole aesthetics course 
'cause i think you can you can work it er into all of the sorts of issues that 
we covered and even the ones last term about er er darkness and 
postmodernism er in relation to film and T-V i think er i-, i-, it can work 
there or it can work in relation to the sorts of things we'll look at this term 
er the first thing that i've i've put down the thing i want to talk about now 
is beauty er beauty in relation to The Thin Red Line would somebody like to 
start off by by commenting really on what you think the relationship between 
ideas of beauty i suppose those aesthetic ideas and The Thin Red Line what that 
relationship might be namex 
sf5026: er well it's quite strongly er linked to nature sort of the the beauty 
in The Thin Red Line seems to be all surrounding the ideas of nature and the 
natural and like the the whole of like the first half an hour when they're er 
is it an island they're on an island 
nm5019: mm 
sf5026: or they're separate from the army then it's like you see shots of the 
sea and the trees er just growing without er interference from man and sort of 
sunlight and that it's the and you also hear er 
Witt talking about kind of how perfect the island is like that so i think the 
beauty in the thin in The Thin Red Line is sort of mainly linked to ideas of 
nature 
nm5019: mm-hmm ideas and images of the natural 
sf5026: yeah 
nm5019: any other thoughts 
sf5027: i think it's it's kind of linked to er transcendence in a way er 
because the darkness and light in it is er it is that kind of dialectical 
enlightenment so they're both kind of interspersed so and the the shots of kind 
of a lot where the camera is just looking up through the trees and you have 
that light er the moments where Jim Caviezel's character Witt every person that 
he touches in the film er experience-, er he kind of changes their life in some 
way er i think he's kind of very kind of linked to transcendence and that's 
shot 'cause nature is quite er frightening in a way you know the the vines 
round the trees it's all very kind of dark so it it's 
not like you can kind of extract a single meaning from the text 'cause they are 
so kind of tightly interwoven 
nm5019: mm 
sf5027: er with with the voiceovers as well but i think beauty is er is figura-,
figured more in transcendence because in the violent scenes as well er they're 
not really shown to be beautiful you know it's always kind of juxtaposed with 
something more natural more er what's the word kind of communicative like you 
have the the village at the beginning er it's kind of set up a sort of utopian 
ideal that sets up those ideas of of community of family of communication of 
something that is beyond the self something that you have er which is er 
illustrated in the character of Witt that having that vision to see something 
beyond the self er which i think is why it starts off in the village you know 
there's no kind of sense of time you know she i think she says something 
about the child going to sleep 
nm5019: mm 
sf5027: it depends something on the trees it's like that er the old kind of 
tribal communities that were that were very kind of extracted from modernity 
and it shows that to be something that's wonderful something that is is 
beautiful 
nm5019: mm 
sf5026: and it's quite interesting as well because at at the beginning the 
army's kind of shown fairly negatively because you you hear the woman say er 
he's he asks her if she's scared of him 
nm5019: yeah yeah 
sf5026: and er she says yes i am because you're with the army and er 
nm5019: yeah 
sf5026: then you see the boat coming round and they er and they run and you 
think but they're in the army why are they running er and then er like you say 
on the sheet you don't know how they get back on the boat but you see a shot of 
the boat in the sea and with the mountains in the background and it's turning 
out 
this big black smoke which kind of seems as though it's like ruining the the 
perfect nature it's like 
nm5019: mm 
sf5026: man's intruding on the perfect world and the U-S army's intruding 
nm5019: mm mm 
sf5027: i think it kind of asks questions of what is nature not just in kind of 
natural world or environment but what is nature in general what is the nature 
of humanity what is the nature of man what is a man 
nm5019: mm 
sf5027: what kind of constitutes man or makes up man er it doesn't actually 
give you any answers which is what's so amazing about it i think it does kind 
of 
sf5026: but it raises questions for you to think about 
sf5027: it raises questions i think it is a dialectic 'cause it just covers 
everything it's all so interwoven and that's i think where its power comes from 
nm5019: let's go back to something you were saying about the the village we see 
in the beginning to 
what extent is that maintained as an ideal or as a as a as a as a as a place of 
wonder throughout the film 
sf5026: well you can't sor-, he each constantly talks about having seen this 
different world but er sort of they go back later and er he doesn't really know 
how to react to it then he goes back and he's just seeing all these people 
dying and i think it's 
sf5027: well 
sf5026: it's very different then 
sf5027: it's quite ambiguous 
nm5019: yeah 
sf5027: it's what we were saying with you the other day it's a point of view 
shot is really it sets itself up as being a point of view that his because at 
the beginning when he's having the conversation with Sean Penn he's talking 
about this world as being in his imagination so he he changes throughout the 
film as well he isn't just this person who is representative of something it's 
his education as well as the people who come into contact with 
him so when he goes back and he sees the skulls and he sees the sores on the 
child's back and he can't quite kind of correlate it 'cause it's no longer ima-,
an imagination er because the war's been affect-, has affected him the death's 
affected him but then he has the conversation with the the child's mother again 
and she says er oh they've always fought you know they look like they're 
playing but they're fighting you know so it's i think it's still quite it's 
quite ambiguous 
nm5019: mm-hmm 
sf5027: though even though she says that and it hi-, is primarily his point of 
view er of kind of like a distorted vision the illusion's kind of broken down 
so don't quite know what its relation is to the big picture 
nm5019: mm what were you going to say namex 
sm5028: i was just going to say that er however it appears to me that the v-, 
the 
depiction of the village is kind of the the this whole notion of beauty being 
disturbed is kind of how the film criticizes er war rather than you know doing 
a spie-, Spielberg and kind of you know saying war is bad it it it shows war is 
having an effect on the the purity of the village er it disturbs the you know 
what was once serene is now you know it is it's all gone 
sm5028: and i mean i wasn't so sure that er Witt had changed i thought that it 
was just the village had changed and he he's kind of making an observation 
about it i mean it it is filmed in er this kind of documentary s-, style like i 
mean i think a lot of it could come out of a nature movie 
nm5019: yeah 
sm5028: but it's it's through these kind of you know personal voiceovers and 
stuff where we get the er you know it kind of colour colours it in you know 
specific ways and it especially through Witt we get the you know what he really 
thinks 
nm5019: 
yeah i wonder i've got a real problem with that i've got a real problem with 
the village as a as a kind of site of purity and wonder er 
sm5029: yeah i thought the point was that when he goes back to the village the 
point was that it's always been that way 
nm5019: all right 
sm5029: but he does he now sees that he is now able to see it for what it is 
you know and the the skulls have always been on the shelf you know 
nm5019: mm 
sm5029: er and the men have always fought and you know the kids have always got 
sick and that's the point of it 
nm5019: mm 
sm5029: and i know and i actually did er i was sort of uncomfortable with the 
start i thought this is a bit trite you know just swimming in the water and 
it's all very nice and you know so it and then you know the purity of the noble 
savage being corrupted by the modern world you know i was sort of i was 
thinking okay here we go but then when he did go back to the village thought 
that was a 
key point because i thought it's sort of like namex said that we would go and 
see a you know there they look like they're playing but they're fighting or 
whatever that bit is you know that's a key line i think 
nm5019: yes but she says that right at the beginning i mean it's not later he 
he says at the beginning he says to her kids round here never fight do they and 
she says yes sometimes they do you know 
sm5029: mm 
nm5019: that's right at the beginning 
sf5027: oh is it 
nm5019: yeah when he's talking to them at so that's already a a warning i think 
that his what he can see swimming 
sf5027: er 
nm5019: mm 
sm5029: it's all right 
sf5027: moving from imagination to a kind of realist perspective because i 
think that's why it kind of ties into the conversation with er Sean Penn's 
character you know where he's he's saying oh i have my imagination he's like 
and this is the only world you have they're kind of both polar opposites but 
he's set up as a kind of dreamer 
nm5019: mm 
sf5027: and i think his experience er enables him to kind of group and kind of 
to a certain extent er gel his his imaginations his aspirations for a better 
world with er a kind of neo-realist framework as opposed to within a kind of 
fantasy framework which is set up at the beginning 
nm5019: mm 
sf5027: er this i think it is tied to his point of views er er for the two 
opposing scenes 
sf5026: but that's quite interesting as well the conversations between er Witt 
and Sean Penn's character because er they they have then 'cause Sean Penn says 
well you're not going to ever do any good you're just going to die in this war 
and you're not going to make any difference you're not going to change anything 
for anyone but when it actually comes to it when Witt does die 
then he has he's saved by by distracting kind of all the soldiers away from the 
river he's basically saved the rest of his company's lives so he ac-, ha-, does 
actually do something but like namex was saying it's because he changes all the 
way through the film and he starts off being a bit of a dreamer and then he 
possibly kind of realizes that he has to pull together 
nm5019: but we don't get that moment of realization 
sf5026: no 
nm5019: it seems to me 
sf5027: i think you do in the voiceover at the end though 
nm5019: really 
sf5027: 'cause he says er it is his voiceover he says who are you that i lived 
with walked with the brother the friend darkness and light strife and love were 
they the workings of one mind features of the same face 
nm5019: mm 
sf5027: so he seems to have like the this is what's strange 'cause he's dead 
but his voiceover's still speaking he's kind of transcended li-, literally life 
itself and he's 
still asking that question but he's able to kind of see both sides 
nm5019: mm 
sf5027: er which i think is what the film is you know good side of nature the 
bad side of of human nature and like natural world as well 
nm5019: so sorry how is that final question different from what he's asking at 
the beginning 
sf5027: because i think it's i think at the beginning it's rooted in his 
imagination a bit 
nm5019: oh right 
sf5027: i think at the end he's able to kind of take in both and his 
perspectives change somewhat and you're aware that his perspectives change and 
his death has resonance anyway er 'cause i suppose with like a normal or a kind 
of er Hollywood flick type picture he would be alive he would he would not die 
in it at all 
nm5019: mm 
sf5027: which i think is quite interesting 'cause he's died for a purpose in a 
way it's quite a religious thing i suppose 
nm5019: mm 
sf5027: that's why i kind 
of see it as like er the education of the sergeant 
nm5019: c-, but but that's so interesting because he doesn't ch-, i don't he 
doesn't change you see 
sf5027: Sean Penn 
nm5019: yes 
sf5027: i think he does 
sf5026: i think that he changes enormously 
nm5019: i don't think Witt's death makes any difference to him at all 
sf5026: you don't think his death has any 
nm5019: i don't Witt's death has any dif-, makes any difference to his to what 
Sean Penn's philosophy or isolation 'cause he reiterates immediately afterwards 
he says you know you're in a box a moving box it's it's all a lie it's got to 
be the in here 
sf5027: mm 
nm5019: so why w-, what changes you tell me what changes 
sf5027: i think i think he does change 
nm5019: 
why do you think that 
sf5026: er i'm not going to be able to articulate this though 
nm5019: okay you don't you don't have to answer now but let's hear from 
somebody else namex 
sf5030: what 
sf5027: what 
sf5030: 
nm5019: well your opinions comments and observations on what we've been 
discussing 
sf5030: er i think i'm not sure whether i do think Sean Penn's character 
changes and i think if he doesn't it's quite effective in balancing the whole 
message of the film 
nm5019: mm 
sf5030: 'cause i think it some bits of it are a bit kind of crappy psychology a 
bit kind of look at nature and isn't it beautiful which 
nm5019: mm 
sf5030: is very limited and especially about war it it it it can't get you very 
far er and i think that kind of him saying it's all about property and not 
getting too carried away with your 
idea of human nature because he's like it's not human nature it's you've been 
put into this it's someone else's battle it's all about property 
nm5019: mm 
sf5030: keeps the film kind of saves it from being wishy-washy and 
nm5019: right kind of mysticism and 
sf5030: yeah 
nm5019: and yeah i yeah does anyone else feel like that about about it i mean 
you really as far as only talk about that kind of danger really of the film i 
mean it does have those moments where you think oh s-, you know stop this is so 
er you said wishy-washy and thinking about pop psychology 
sf5030: it is kind of like it it's like kind of er 
nm5019: right 
sf5030: the plague that kind of nature and i-, is it all beautiful and it's 
like yeah but that that can't get really get you anywhere 
nm5019: mm 
sf5030: at the end of the day 
nm5019: mm 
sf5027: do you think it's kind of asking if there's a place for that kind of 
mysticism 
in the modern world is there a place for somebody like Witt in the modern world 
nm5019: i don't think it's if you say that i don't think it's one thing er 
sf5027: or the kind of difficulty of accommodating that kind of philosophy 
nm5019: i think 
sf5027: i think you can accommodate it if you don't something that that's 
that's basic 
nm5019: mm 
sf5027: and i mean like a beginning you know that kind of philosophy works in 
his own mind within that environment but when it's put into kind of the 
imaginations of war and everything is is re-, actually replaceable really 
nm5019: well i think it it retains this oddness actually er that i think some 
of Witt's questions seem quite odd now whereas they wouldn't have seemed very 
odd at all er even thirty years ago forty years ago er the idea of the family 
of man for example er just yesterday my parents brought me m-, 
bringing me books from my childhood years and there's this old book from the 
fifties the early fifties an encyclopedia t-, for children and d-, you know for 
sort of eight to ten year olds so yeah it's all about the family of the human 
race yeah it's one big family it's like it's written as if Witt wrote it yes 
just that it's yes kind of mis-, you know it's idea of the family ma-, man is 
all different races brought together there's always the mother the father yes i 
think George Clooney's bit yeah that's kind of the way the world was thought of 
and actually not that long ago so i think Witt just seems strange his idea of a 
unity of a coherence of a of universality that runs through objects and er er 
through nature and through people and the the kind of sense of seeing beyond 
appearances into just kind of essential bonds between things i think that seems 
very rather strange and kind of arty now whereas before it would be just if you 
like what was taught in 
schools and things er so now actually i don't even think it's it might've been 
might be asking that but i don't think there is a place for it all right what 
do other people think namex 
sf5031: don't really know 
nm5019: what do you think of the er the Ben Chaplin character er he's had the 
one he we see his wife and yes he's talking about his wife a lot we see him at 
the beginning yes quite early on in the movie we actually you see him he's 
talking saying he got drafted because he wanted to be with his wife he wasn't 
actually high up in the in the er engineering corps whatever and then later on 
we discover that his his wife has left him i mean how do you think that that 
sort of big thing that happens with his wife's asking for a divorce doesn't she 
it's a kind of a big kind of shock moment i think in the film what did you 
think of 
that 'cause it's quite a risk 
sf5031: er er i think my problem was i have only seen the film once 
nm5019: u-huh 
sf5031: and it was quite difficult for me to understand some parts of it 
nm5019: mm 
sf5031: 'cause i wasn't there on Friday 
nm5019: oh okay 
sf5031: it seemed for most of the film it seemed like a loss of illusions all 
the way through it but i think i need to watch it again to kind of 
nm5019: mm 
sf5031: i don't know it's quite difficult to get to grip with it 
sf5030: there's that bit isn't there with his voiceover saying 
sf5031: mm 
sf5030: you can't destroy our love and i at that at that bit i just kind of 
thought oh shut up of course it can you know sho-, you shouldn't believe all 
you'll go home to her 
sf5031: yeah 
sf5030: of course it can and then it did kind of i was kind of pleased not in 
you know a sick way but like in a kind of yeah glad it hasn't kind of had him 
going back and everything being the same 'cause that's the point isn't it 
it does change people 
su5032: mm 
sf5031: mm 
sm5028: do you think it was at odds with the k-, er kind of Witt's philosophy 
about er his kind of romanticism it er i think it was trying to say that 
basically when i think er Ben Chaplin's character's kind of the more er 
traditional role of er oh i've got my girlfriend back at home and and that's 
what i'll focus all my attentions on i think he's trying to say well those sort 
of things aren't are are just sort of passing fads whereas you know er you've 
got you know your love affair with nature is is forever and stuff i mean er y-, 
you write down on the sheet it it's a collection of romantic ideas of er it's a 
lot of kind of er issues from romantic poetry 
nm5019: mm 
sm5028: sort of sur-, surfaced in the film and that's one of them 
sm5033: er i think it sort of it almost seems right that er his his wife should 
leave him 
'cause those those sequences that punctuate the film er of of him and his wife 
seem sort of strangely out of place er and it seems appropriate that er those 
sort of ou-, out of place moments are are er are lost by his wife leaving him 
nm5019: yeah 
sm5033: and he returns to that sort of idea of the family of man and i think 
that that no-, that notion of families and er universality is something that 
the film sort of values a lot i mean there 
nm5019: mm 
sm5033: there are innumerable characters that sort of feel compelled to help 
their fellow man by telling them you know telling people they're not going to 
die when they when they are and er Sean Penn going to help the soldier who is 
wounded 
nm5019: yes why does he do that do you think 
sm5033: well 
nm5019: given 
sm5033: we're invited to belive that it's to keep him quiet 
nm5019: yes 
sm5028: but i don't think it is i 
think it's sort of the ge-, er the and compassionate gesture and er like the U-
R-S coach's character refusing refusing orders to to help his you know fellow 
man and Witt at the end does exactly the same thing er you know that that sort 
of more er e-, explicitly sated stated at the end with George Clooney's sort of 
mother father kids but which is er 
sf5030: it really reminds me in bits to of the er has no wife about like we're 
doing Holocaust literature in films narrative 
nm5019: mm 
sf5030: about the like the two separate universes that you can't really bridge 
that gap once you have that experience of like say a concentration camp normal 
life er y-, you're completely separated from normal life and it kind o-, like 
all through it i was just thinking these men how could you go back and go back 
into normal life how could you you would need to tell someone you would need 
you couldn't go back into that romantic situation it 
kind of gives a kind of ironic twist almost to this idea of kind of think 
everyone being part of the same thing because it's like that war is fracturing 
that completely 
nm5019: mm 
sf5030: by just separating people into their own madness kind of people shaking 
and never being able to go back into that whole big family of man really 
because er 
sm5033: but at the same time the sort of family of man is is reinforced because 
they they are all the same like towards the end where they the camera sort of 
weaves its way through the all the er soldiers on the boat they're all the same 
they all look the same and er even when they're they're trying to take the 
bridge er the er all the enemy soldiers they they look the same from a distance 
you can't really tell who's who at at at some points 
sf5030: although the voiceover by choosing voiceover instead of conversation 
kind of there is no point 
in all being the same is if mentally you are all completely separated from each 
other and like 
sm5033: er 
sf5030: when that guy's going on about family and he's just looking at him and 
saying you're dead basically and it's like the don't know it just seems like 
kind of it's kind of saying don't believe this kind of nice family of man thing 
there's a kind of little twist in it which kind of so you don't buy into it 
nm5019: which is i-, precisely what they it's a it's a i mean it's a hard bit 
listening to Sean Penn the voiceover when Clooney is speaking precisely 'cause 
of the star thing you know it's 'cause it's Clooney's moment yes and he's 
talking rubbish he isn't talking rubbish but he's he's saying thing about the 
family the mother and father at the same time that Welsh is saying don't 
believe whatever you see and hear yes you're in a moving box and there there 
are 
moments of the movie which seem to be directly relevant to the audience and 
it's it's saying it's commenting on the movie yes we're in a moving bo-, 
everything you see and hear is lies yes so we get this kind of there's an issue 
about seeing in the movie clearly you see a lot of people seeing things and you 
there's a lot of attention given to eyes and looking yeah in the movie even 
animals are looking you know so like the little possum on the tree and the sort 
of tree lizard looking the owl that's staring seems to be there's an issue 
about you know what is consciousness what is seeing er and certainly i think 
you're right that that er that moment the sergeant is speaking i think that bit 
that confirms what you were saying about the uncertainty of the movie in 
relation to some of its articulations there it seems to be saying don't trust 
what you see and hear you know there's a possibility it's er and on on the 
other hand i mean i there there's 
this this issue of er Witt who seems to unify the separate identities yeah so 
on one hand war fractures though we all have our own different particular 
experiences yeah so but then there's a moment where Witt returns from the 
village er and he meets someone alone on the hill yes he returns from the 
village and he gets back and he's kind of shaking everyone's hand on the way 
back yes like some kind of you know i strange don't know why he seems to know 
everybody then you see him looking around the camp and he sees some people 
playing cards or just talking characters we don't know and then we get instead 
of cutting back like in a point of view shot we see Ben Chaplin alone in the 
fields yes it's just after we find out he's been dumped by his wife and i think 
we see something else before we return back to the shot of Witt and he cries we 
see a tear coming out of his eye yeah so he seems to unify these different 
fragments er in his gaze in if you like that point of view structure so we do 
get these opposing forces in the film you know on the one hand there's a a 
sense which you've got of pulling together of the family of man who who are you 
my brother you know my soul that that unifies all l-, looks out through my eyes 
and unifies all opposed to er Sean Penn really his philosophy of isolation i 
don't think it's reconciled in the film because what's the final image yes it's 
a very quite isolated object yes you know the coconut growing in in the sea and 
you know the final three images seem to be about those kind of balance you know 
this sort of the journey down through the you know the people on the boat going 
through the kind of rainforest area then we see two er parrots are they parrots 
or lorikeets i'm not sure but they're beautiful beautiful birds they're 
obviously a pair are mates yes and then we see the final image 
of a f-, completely isolated this very strong horizontal length just this 
isolated coconut what do you make of the what do you make of that final image 
it seems so utterly beautiful er don't know but it's what did you make of it 
sm5028: well er it's beautiful but at the same time i i saw it as it's sad in 
that it it reminded me of like a grave 
nm5019: right 
sm5028: and the way that Witt was buried and the sort of long er gun it it kind 
of the same sort of sh-, visual shape 
nm5019: yes 
sm5028: and and it's i'm i'm not sure what i make of it but it kind of ju-, it 
wants to sort of it again it's sort of harking back to a lot of the other 
things talking about it's kind of implicitly ref-, referring without you know 
he's drawing the audience to make their own conclusion 
sf5030: mm it's definitely quite a positive image though like well 
sm5028: well that's the thing i i didn't see it as positive 'cause i thought it 
looked like a 
like a tombstone like like a natural tombstone like maybe nature is it's 
nature's tombstone or something you know and it's it's all it's all bad it's 
all going to eng-, 
sf5030: but it's growing though it's like something out something's coming out 
of i read it as kind of i probably just didn't get it properly but i read it 
sm5028: mm 
sf5030: as kind of quite twee kind of life goes on kind of rebirth 
sm5028: no i mean i can i can see that completely but er er i i think it was 
probably just trying to make the audience kind of make up what what they 
thought of it it's like the old adage you know it's half full or half empty 
sf5030: mm 
sm5028: i suppose we 
sf5027: i think it is really sad i mean er i think it's 'cause er it's such a 
small object compared to such a huge space and i think er i mean the film i 
think the way that it ends it ends on that stillness and it is a kind of it is 
a very still film and considering the size of it the 
script is probably not that big really er and i think it's like er it it's 
quite a nostalgic film i think that's where its sadness comes from it kind of i 
mean i-, whilst Witt is a dreamer and he's a romantic and he's everything else 
at the same time he's still extremely privileged throughout the film by by the 
camera and by the amount of lines er the emphasis on the lines he has to speak 
as well er and i think it laments a loss of that a loss of that that level of 
humanity perhaps perhaps that ability to to see beyond the self i think for me 
like the ending's er is perfect because it's just still if it had lan-, if it'd 
ended on just the boat sequence which it could have done it wouldn't have had 
that same impact just to have the solitary object which is go-, growing again 
which 'cause i kind of see like you know life goes on but where is it placed 
within the space it's just placed on its own with just the sound and the 
sea it's really sad and moving the only thing that i don't understand so i'm 
just going to ask you this is i can never quite get straight in my head why he 
actually commits suicide which is is kind of what he does i i can't grasp that 
it's 
nm5019: mm 
sf5027: i don't think it's articulated clearly 
nm5019: mm-hmm does anyone else want to offer a suggestion 
sf5027: 
sm5028: i mean is it suicide i mean is it 
sf5027: er points the gun at them 'cause you just see his gun go up he knows 
that he's surrounded he looks round at them all and they walk towards him and 
he he can't understand what they're saying 
sm5028: well i i saw it as 
sf5027: then he just puts his gun up why doesn't he drop his gun if he believes 
in humanity so much why doesn't he drop his gun 
sm5028: i i thought that he might be killed and i thought that his his soldier 
friends were 
going to they kind of found him and they were killing all the the the the the 
soldiers then and he got caught in the crossfire that's what i mean 
sf5027: no they was he was still on his own there was just all 
sm5028: mm but it's kind of so abstracted that you don't really know what's 
happening here 'cause you on the soundtrack you hear kind of like a like a 
helicopter or something and it it s-, sounded like some sort of military 
activity and i i i mean 'cause like how how how do they bury him you know what 
i mean if he does would they just leave him on his own and then if that's the 
thing i mean er it's one of those ellipses you you you it's er er like a hole 
that's not been filled yet you sort of 
nm5019: mm 
sm5028: er i mean i you're right i mean it could be that he commits suicide but 
it's left so open that you you're not really sure 
sf5026: 
i think he does commit suicide 
sf5027: 'cause you see the gun go up you know 
sf5026: but i think it i think it's because er he has seen how him and the 
other soldiers have treated their prisoners that he just doesn't want to be 
faced with that that's what that's what i took out that he seemed when 'cause 
when they've got the prisoners er somebody says something about vultures or 
birds of prey and there's a bird circling in the sky and that's like that's 
used about three times i think and er it's like war is this big bird of prey 
that's preying on all these people and when Bell's wife goes to the army 
barracks for some reason er you see her looking up and she sees these birds of 
prey in the sky and it's like they've taken her husband away from her and then 
you get the same just after Witt's after Witt's died it cuts to the birds of 
prey again and it's like they've taken 
Witt the war's taken Witt away from the world it's very don't know if that 
makes sense 
nm5019: er c-, 
sf5026: no 
nm5019: you you yeah you quite right that motif is the bird circling high and 
it's repeated on tho-, on those on those occasions again i don't think namex 
was right at the beginning it's difficult to p-, to pin it down to one thing er 
anything related to the meaning sure it's just the one thing er but it's pretty 
clear that Witt chooses his death i don't think that's quite as ambiguous as 
namex suggests 
sf5026: maybe it's also to do with er he because he believes in God and er he 
says he's seen this this other world maybe he just thinks that er dying will 
sort of take him to heaven 
nm5019: did he say he believes in God 
it's 
sf5026: i don't i don't know that's what i interpret 
sf5030: if you are a bit more pessimistically in that he's well he's well he 
needs to be like a hero and he the loss of dignity to be a prisoner of war 
would be unbearable to him and so he has to die and i think there's some i 
don't i think i that's it's quite the film is kind of a bit negative about Witt 
like when Sean Penn stands over his grave and says where's your spark now 
'cause at the end of the day that kind of romantic hero figure won't survive 
like a person who's out for himself and is really hard will survive 
sm5029: i think one of the most important things about that sequence for me was 
when er they first go down the river with er Fife and the other little guy er 
the japane-, 
i mean i think a very important choice of the Japanese some sort of appear out 
of n-, out of the trees you know you sort of think what's that and then you 
know one guy and then there's dozens and dozens that s-, that blend out you 
know it's because you know they aren't they aren't they are part of nature as 
well you know it's emphasized by the fact they've got their camouflage sort of 
nm5019: yes 
sm5029: leafy hats and sort of stuff like that then it happens again when they 
sort of catch him in that er clearing and even though it's obvious even though 
you know i don't speak Japanese that er the guy wants him to surrender and you 
know doesn't want to kill him and there's a note on the sheet which confirms 
that er you know could be sort of like he's realized that er he he sort of can 
see the bigger picture now and there isn't this sort of you know maybe he isn't 
this sort of moral mystical conflict between nature and man at least sort of 
but i do 
think there is the for me anyway there is the synthesis of like er the Japanese 
soldiers and the surroundings that er synthesis between nature and man and he 
does seem to be and he you know he looks around he looks at them for such a 
long time er you know while he's being shouted at i think you know that his i i 
think er like a really er concrete moment of realization for him but i do think 
there is an element to that it's like he is realizing something er but then 
what he actually does and i agree like with er some of the people over there 
that er he does commit suicide why he does that i don't know er maybe it's 
because once he's realized that there is this er it's all just the same big 
myth it sort of doesn't make much difference whether he lives or dies you know 
if he if if things he's held up to be er you know beautiful the village er it's 
these values are not these values are in-, undermine you know reappropriated er 
you 
know the distinctions that he once had are now gone you know it's like you do 
there are no concrete values for him to er believe in or sort of educate others 
about which is what the relationship between him and Welsh is about i think 
nm5019: mm 
sf5027: think it's er because directly following his death it's really unclear 
whether he's dying or he's having a kind of you know they say your life rolls 
before you because after that it's a montage of him swimming in the water in 
the beginning then a shot of the trees above and the light er and then i think 
it's something else as well 
sf5030: 
sf5027: so it's either i don't know whether it's a kind of symbolic death 
within the kind of framework of the text well that's his do you know what i 
mean it's quite ambiguous as to whether that's his kind of last memories 
nm5019: mm 
sf5027: his his his soul's leaving his body 
type of spiritual thing 
nm5019: i think the film has already cautioned us against such a s-, direct 
association with what we're seeing er for example close to the beginning it 
it's apparently had a flashback to his childhood when he's on the the field and 
see him with his father he's still looking at the this this wind is blowing 
bits of hay and that yes whilst more or less direct here for a flashback but 
given the rest of the film is the the the connections between memory and image 
aren't that strong for example er the Bell character er when he's wh-, when we 
see his wife we see her there are moments where he can't have remembered tha-, 
those moments 'cause we see her without him yes so it isn't always a direct 
correlation between the characters' mind screen and what we can see er i think 
that's the the case with Witt's death which i cannot understand i don't i can't 
work it out either i know i can link 
it to the beginning where he says i wonder what it would right at the beginning 
he says i wonder what it would be like to to know this is my last breath and 
how i would okay so and of course that's three hours later he's in that 
situation where he's about has the choice of whether to draw his last breath or 
not er so i suppose one can read it quite as being in relation to that to that 
moment of speculation at the beginning which is so characteristic of the film 
that kind of philosophical question about the en-, the last point of one's life 
it's also a very ordinary question that most people would ask themselves at 
some point in their lives 
sm5029: mm 
nm5019: it's ordinary language philosophy what would it be like to be at the 
last moment of your life the last instance it's something that everybody will 
experience right in this room er but also will be survived that's the Cavell 
point 
again about being survived by a film and the film articulates that wonderfully 
yes the Witt dies we have the sh-, the shot of the sun coming through the tree 
then immediately he's alive right swimming around under water yeah that's the 
film's ability to survive you nature's ability to survive you is part of the 
promise it seems to me and also the melancholy of the film mm that's part but 
it's not one i don't think it's one it's one thing mm 
sf5030: there's an a different thing proving himself as a man as well which is 
the hero thing 
nm5019: right 
sf5030: to it 'cause he says to Sean Penn i'm twice the man you are and i'll 
prove it or whatever and then we've got more a couple of them when they dock 
when Woody Harrelson character says i want my wife to know i i was a man 
nm5019: die like a man 
sf5030: it's like a man dying 
nm5019: mm 
sf5030: that proves you're a and the lawyer going home 
like he's like you can't stay here because you're too soft you're not manly 
enough for this 
nm5019: mm 
sf5030: that death in war proves well that ultimate proof of being a man you 
know in a kind of military way 
sf5027: i think it's like locked to a kind of a military manhood type of thing 
that he's obviously very aware of those kind of constructions of masculinity it 
turns on its head because they're the ones who are shown to be very bad or they 
die er the people that have true humanity that's almost like what being a man 
is in a kind of generic sense er as opposed to like being very kind of rooted 
in masculinity which is what a lot of war films are about 
nm5019: mm 
sf5027: 'cause he gets i mean Woody Harrelson i mean the whole thing why he's 
upset is is 
sf5030: 
sf5027: he's more upset that he's like blowing his penis off than that he 
won't be able to like you know that's like for him that's like his masculinity 
what what how to you know don't tell her what's er 
nm5019: why to tell her 
sf5030: but then it's n-, 
sf5027: the man will 
sf5030: yeah 
sf5027: which 
sf5030: yeah but it's also like kind of tell her i died in combat not that i er 
b-, 
sf5027: yeah 
sf5030: blew myself up 
nm5019: well 
sf5030: instead of er 
nm5019: yeah what would you what would you prefer then what would you prefer as 
your last message to your loved one i mean you blew your butt off probably not 
er er you'd have to i mean in a way i think it's an remarkable acknowledgement 
of his yeah it's partly that macho thing yeah die die like a man but it's much 
more than that 'cause we see him dying you know 
like a child not like a man he's getting dizzy and he's cold and he's looking 
for comfort he's he's dying like a little child er and i think it's much more 
artic-, it's much more again like most of the film it's it's slightly there is 
more than one viewpoint er 
sf5030: what i mean is like most interesting is that Witt for all of his 
spirituality is kind of still buying into the same thing it's still going out 
with a bang 
sf5026: but the hero thing's kind of problematic anyway because none of them 
want the awards like they various people at various stages say oh i'm going to 
recommend you for an award and every single one of them says no i don't want it 
they that's not fair like really don't everyone's done the same amount as i 
have i'm nothing special and i think that that kind of puts er com-, you kind 
of compare that with with the people 'cause they are heroic in that they go and 
do things to to save their friends but they don't want the acknowledgement at 
home or i don't know it's it's really 
strange and then and that and i think that's when Sean Penn says it's all about 
property and er i mean i don't know what to make of that but 
sf5030: and you're also kind of told that you know medals don't mean anything 
anyway oh he says to the lawyer oh you know have them all kind of thing just go 
away kind of er you know it's a bit corrupt it's a bit it's not a true 
reflection of who were the heroes it's like probably just something they can't 
live with 
sf5026: which means that that means it's problematic when they go home and then 
the all the people who kind of like you were saying everybody who's died is 
seen to be a hero even though they're incompetent or or just careless or 
whatever and and those people who who were the heroes don't have anything to 
show for it it's ver-, it is really strange 'cause in er in kind of your 
average 
Hollywood film you'd come out at the end and whoever had saved all the lives 
would be receiving some the best medal possible and at the White House but some 
special award their name on a plaque or something but this is different they 
don't want 
sm5029: one thing the film does really well is er take up all the sort of 
conventions and the stereotypes of the war movie and so on doesn't just subvert 
it's almost it fulfils them and subverts them at the same time for the like war 
mo-, i mean you know almost every war mo-, movie i can think of er you have the 
sort of more sort of dreamy idealistic guy er who's not who's not up for the 
fight and then he turns out to be a real hero and then you've got a like real 
sort of tough talking hard-arsed guy who sort of er who then start ends up 
crying like a baby 
nm5019: mm 
sm5029: and then you then you have a real mix of that you do you do have 
characters a bit like that and then you have 
but then you have Sean Penn who's very bitter and tough and twisted but he's 
still genuinely courageous and cares about the men and er i think that you have 
you know you have all all the characters the whole the whole gamut the one with 
the sweetheart back at home er the sort of cynical er colonel who doesn't know 
what real combat is and you know th-, throws his men into 
nm5019: mm 
sm5029: terrible situations the sort of embittered this sort of incompetentish 
er captain who then and then his deputy is the sort of real the working class 
leader of the team you have you have all of these characters and but they're 
what i really like about it is they're not sort of you know just flipped upside 
down they are in some cases they they are like that and you know they're given 
real depth and er each one of them is believable but you can you could really 
just in terms of describing them reduce them down to the same sort of character 
types 
as you'd see in Platoon or something 
nm5019: mm-hmm 
sm5029: and i think it's really er odd that it's not i think er the rel-, 
interrelationship with the Vietnam films is really er interesting and like 
problematic because i mean the choice of setting i mean you know you've got er 
the Sands of Iwo Jima and films like that 
nm5019: yes 
sm5029: most World War Two films are not set in that sort of jungle terrain 
like which is and it looks so much like a a Vietnam film much of the time you 
know 
nm5019: yes 
sm5029: partially 'cause of the m-, technology er you know er of filming the 
action and stuff like that 
nm5019: but it's a jungle isn't it yes 
sm5029: yes but it's ma-, basically the jungle and you know weakness and going 
mad and er and terror which you know we're allowed to you know i mean even with 
films about the Second wo-, World War being made in the fifties they weren't 
allowed to show real sort of terror or going to 
pieces you know it wasn't just wasn't wasn't done and er they can see i think 
it's a reappraisal of the sort of Second World War with a massive influence of 
you know Vietnam and the American sort of experience 
nm5019: okay i'm going to have to draw to a close er thank you that's Jima 
comparison was right i mean the obvious other comparison's Saving Private Ryan 
i mean if you're thinking about war on er the Pacific war and the if you like 
the colonial wars wars fought for property yes that issue as contrasted against 
the sort of 
myth of the wars fought against fascism yes the different sorts of er legacy 
associated with two kinds of war that contrast is important okay now remember 
er revision sessions on Friday okay if you want them to take if you want them 
to take place at all people have to volunteer to do presentations okay if you 
want clarification on it you can see me er er either this afternoon or or er or 
later this week okay well er thanks a lot then
