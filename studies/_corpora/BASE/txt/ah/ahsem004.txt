nm5095: here's my experience of being filmed er as er a teacher and as a reader 
er it usually makes a better a better a better seminar because er there's a a

nm5095: okay right just bear those things in mind for a little while because 
now between now and er eleven o'clock i want you to compose a limerick based 
upon everything that you have just discovered in that i want you to compose a 
limerick based upon what you just discovered from that do you think you can do 
that 
sf5112: funny or serious
nm5095: mm
sf5112: is it funny or serious or
nm5095: oh this is because the however how do you want to turn it at all the 
thing is namex that they i advise them in form they can choose a funny form you 
have ten minutes ten minutes ten minutes of quiet composition try and get used 
to this writing in class because when namex takes over she'll have you doing 
this three times at a session that's why i'm doing it with you now one of the 
reasons why i'm doing it with you now okay namex you might have to read yours 
out 
sf5109: fantastic
nm5095: but you will have to send it to ten people within er an hour within two 
hours obviously and if you do that your wish will come true if you don't it 
will become the opposite 
nm5095: how is it going
sm5113: not very good
nm5095: just get the rhythm the rhythm of the first line going in in in in in 
your head and even if you don't have to read it out i would quickly like you to 
try to write it you you will have to get used to this so so you better start 
now don't forget that namex talks at least five times faster than i do and will 
bombard you with exercises and in your second year if you work with me for 
instance in The Practice of Poetry this is the thing we'll just be doing very 
very quickly teaches you a certain facility try not to worry about it just er 
pen it out batter it out er there's a couple of other people i'd like to come 
to my office hour too er namex and namex as well could you both come together 
you're okay come on Thursday between four and six 
sm5142: four and six
nm5095: yeah sorry it's nothing bad for those of you who have finished er it 
might be a good idea if you just make a list of the people that you're going to 
send this game to otherwise you'll have to do that rather quickly and also a 
list of ten people that you're going to send the poem to because if you do i 
assure you your wish will come true this is actually a game that was invented 
in Hong Kong about a month ago this game that you're doing now it's a Chinese 
New Year game and it's the it's the it's the game of the iron dragon if there's 
somebody born in the year of the dragon and i think i think it's a fine year it 
has a particular end justifies its means there i'll come to that because i see 
people's pens dropping shall i just spin the pen or shall i pick out i read a 
book about this what you do is you get you to choose this now you're in charge 
of the seminar namex it's your job to get er three people to read out 
voluntarily 
sm5114: okay
nm5095: it's not in my hands it's in yours and you'll have to learn how to do 
this very quickly because you shall see that the second year and and the third 
years of this course has their own writing groups and writing societies their 
own writing magazines and all that and although i can i can i can kind of help 
you to kick-start at all those things it's not really my job to involve myself 
to closely in this you got to learn to do to do those things yourself 
sm5115: okay does anyone play a musical instrument put up your hands please 
nm5095: who plays a musical instrument 
sm5115: okay
nm5095: did you see the people over there
sm5115: yeah yeah oh sorry can i counted four all those people do you enjoy 
playing your instrument if not why do you play it 
sm5116: er i don't play it any more but er well i do play it but er i don't 
enjoy it so much 
sm5115: oh 
sm5097: 
sm5115: has anybody has anybody ever enjoyed playing a musical instrument
sm5117: yes, i enjoy it 
sm5115: well i think you should read your poem then because i hope that'll give 
you the same sort of buzz
nm5095: very good
sm5117: okay er a momentous feeling and a good mistake is how my life will end 
it's you i dare for you i care and i'm in love with my best friend i fall and 
you will fall i need i need to work you out for real my lucky star is way too 
far but you're still here and close to me 
nm5095: what's your response to that
sm5115: er i i thought it was great i was er too busy thinking about i don't 
know who's my next person
nm5095: you were trying to think ahead to what was going to happen next 
sm5115: i'm afraid i was
nm5095: and not able to think on the spot that was very good you're using 
extreme long a long line 
sm5117: oh yeah okay
nm5095: yeah there's another er secret with the seminar but you should never do 
this you should always pick up on the people who're most confident all right 
'cause they're easy they always want to be there you know it's like you know 
you and and it's it's it's easy peasy but you got to do something likely to 
stun just more random so who's going to be in charge of the seminar now to get 
another person to read out namex so you're in charge of the seminar yeah okay 
teach us choose somebody but bring somehow bring them out 
sm5117: er 
nm5095: flush them up
sm5117: what i mean i just read my poem so you can do it as well 
nm5095: ahum
sm5117: er er and it's not a brilliant one and er so just go ahead and do it
nm5095: how are you going to find the person who's willing to answer that 
particular message that you just said there which was very good 
sm5117: well i'm not very good at this but i like poetry and i think we're all 
here because we do like poetry and just like namex said just now i love music 
as well and i just read my poem out it doesn't hurt i promise 
nm5095: ahum
sm5117: er so namex you try you try
nm5095: so good very good
sf5105: okay my lucky super star is namex my music is smoke my pain i can't be 
without it yet i can't reach taste all that bittersweet rain
nm5095: good namex try and flush somebody else there
sf5105: er namex
sm5115: i met namex about six weeks ago and she still thinks my name is James 
so that shows how well she knows me 
sf5105: so perhaps you should read read
sm5142: my name is namex right
nm5095: namex namex you're going to be in charge of the seminar in about a 
minute
sm5142: okay
nm5095: so sit back and read
sm5142: right er i wish i could find a way to say all i want to say but i can't 
hear the song and i sing it all wrong so i sit on the dock of a bay
nm5095: very good very genius er now what you could do now is trying to find 
something to read out something probably written in the previous seminars which 
is a dark limerick
sm5115: right er put up your hand if you went to a private school or public 
school where you paid fees 
sm5117: what for for the whole thing for a bit of it for a 
sm5115: for for for all of your education yeah
sf5119: all right
nm5095: one two three four five six seven just what i that's er very 
interesting right that's er yeah it's about twenty-five per cent well below the 
national average
nm5095: that's the Warwick way
sm5115: er right i then pick er 
nm5095: there's one right next to you
sm5115: yeah otherwise he'll do it to me so he he 
nm5095: fair enough even though he it's already happened to you
sm5115: true okay namex
sm5142: thanks for the support then
sm5115: it's all right
nm5095: while he's flicking through his pieces you might also want to be 
flicking through your pieces too
nm5095: what do you think is the best thing you've written namex 
sm5142: er i did have several and they were really quite pleasant and er er 
nm5095: good
sm5142: and i tried i er can i read something else
nm5095: sure
sm5142: er and i'll come back to these
nm5095: make a choice why do you think i'm asking you to make the choice of 
piece of work in this sidelong way simply because in er Monday after reading 
week you'll be handing in piece of work that you consider your best piece of 
work that's arisen out of the four poetry units in this course so you need to 
be making the choice and if you want to discuss some of your choices come and 
see me in my office hour or er come and see me next week in my office er hour 
too back to namex
sm5142: okay er last weekend i er wrote a poem about Saigon because i just er 
got back from there er it had quite a profound effect on me and it's called 
Saigon traffic a colourful hat scuffles down the clamouring street swallowed up 
by hungry marked eyes a hound fork sales by angry money a despondent fray in 
frantic struggle for a ticket to tomorrow voices shriek like two cats in a 
tussle the sky draws in the a whiskey beard is selling some incense fingers 
purpled by vegetables and blood coaxing the aged with syncopated French the 
language of a relented past occasionally you'll hear a clause of ingenious 
youth drinking cokes in white man's bars night air speaks in pidgin American 
twenty dollar Bruce Willis New York Superman a frail gone suite has been 
counting the days since sound was forced to head homeward bound were his legs 
but saved is his face the ubiquitous sun blotted out by a moon and all that 
remains where the bodies lay strewn are ancient paddies visuals of wounded 
ground a cotton suite wades in these fields to his knees with a strong and sure 
hand he scatters some seeds 
nm5095: well done namex who are you going to choose next 
sm5142: er well er i think we should have a girl because we don't have many and 
namex was looking interested
sf5120: mm thank you er mm
nm5095: which would you like to read
sf5120: er i don't mind reading them right but i can't decide if i'd rather 
read on of the more comic ones or one of the dark ones er 
nm5095: why don't you just give me one of each
sf5120: oh okay er okay here's the first one she held her body so tightly and 
touching her lightly her hands were stained red from his still head but she 
couldn't l-, let go even slightly and that was like my slightly dark one and 
then this is er a more comic one he looked at his wobbling pot-belly itching 
and twitching like jelly the demon was beer he discovered with fear whilst 
watching soft porn on the telly
nm5095: that's pretty dark too but but but but but but by the way you know this 
feeling of fear and er apprehension you're feeling about this reading out in 
class and also what you choose to read out and what you choose to submit for 
this course or what you choose to submit for magazines this is a terrifically 
important part of being a writer tonight Doris Lessing is going to er arrive at 
the university she's eighty-two years old she was born in nineteen-nineteen and 
she's obviously an incredibly world famous writer she's published been 
publishing since the nineteen-fifties and was up for the Nobel Prize i know 
that when she arrives at six o'clock i'm going to have to take her through very 
carefully what she's going to be choosing to read to you guys and she won't 
know what to read and she won't know which pieces she should be reading and 
she's been doing this for years and also she needs help from her editors about 
what she puts in particular books and also from even her readers about you know 
which which is her best or most representative work you could go on and on and 
on but you need to find other people to help you with making these choices and 
you need to learn also a little bit about how how you do it yourself or how you 
help other people to do it now namex er taken us some longer 
sm5096: you want me to
nm5095: i want you to read something that you've written er out of this 
particular unit
sm5096: er 
nm5095: scary isn't it 
sm5096: i'll read my fifty-nine poem
nm5095: okay do it live do it fast
sm5096: 
nm5095: very good er before we take a break i'm going to give give you a very 
short practical session in how you submit your work to magazines this isn't 
often done it's usually done with postgraduates not with undergraduates but i'm 
finding more and more that the the standard of the writing that my own 
undergraduates are producing is of a publishable standard but because they lack 
confidence about their own writing they don't often send it out and the other 
reason why they don't send it out is because they don't know how to er this is 
how it works in this country this a very boring part of the seminar and i'm 
afraid it's not going to work on the film but it's important for you guys even 
though it's boring and i wish somebody had told me this when i was 18 or 19 
right when you when you're choosing to submit pieces of work to a magazine or a 
journal first you have to do you you have to be familiar with with with with 
the journal you have to know what the journal is like what the magazine is like 
there's no point in sending a nature poem for instance to Leaf Scientist or the 
Independent there's no point at all you won't get read or get accepted you have 
to know which kind of magazines are going to take your poem so how do you go 
about that step one read the magazines where are they some of them are in the 
are in the library here now listen er most undergraduates do this when they go 
into the library you see them doing this they go straight in they swipe their 
cards they go up to the third floor and they sometimes use some of the books 
from the OPAC there you shouldn't always do that when you go into the library 
instead of going straight on on to the lifts turn left turn left against these 
things there which are the magazine racks those magazine racks contain if you 
go to the Arts er area about twenty poetry magazines from around the world 
including things like you might want to write this down Poetry Review Poetry 
Chicago P-N Review it's called Poetry Nation Review The London Review of Books 
The Times Literary Supplement The Realtor The London Magazine which is by the 
way the magazine where Keats was first published still going er that's just a 
few what i want you to to to do probably between now and and the end of week 
six is actually to go to that magazine rack find a magazine read them and see 
which one best suits you now it has to be said that there're hundreds and 
hundreds of magazines some are small press some are bigger press and if you 
want to find out all the magazines the place to go to is not our library or any 
library but a place called the Poetry Library the Poetry Library could you 
write that down this is an incredibly good resource it's one of the best 
resources in Europe well it's it's it's certainly one of the best outside a-, 
America it's in the Royal Festival Hall on the fifth floor of the Royal 
Festival Hall on the South Bank Centre in London fifth floor Royal Festival 
Hall now however poor or rich you are either take a train there through all 
those smashed trees or hitchhike er if you're interested and concerned about 
poetry that place is heaven it's also a house of heavenly poetic opening hours 
too it doesn't open at nine and and close at five so it opens at eleven which 
is good and it closes at eight o'clock at night which is also good now it 
contains you might want to write this down again every book of contemporary 
poetry every book of contemporary poetry in English that's been published in 
the twentieth century two copies of each one for reference that you can't take 
away and one copy that can be taken away membership is free and the librarian's 
name there who's in charge of the whole thing is called Mary Enright Mary 
Enright please please write that down i'm giving you i'm giving you contacts 
now er she knows me and the work i do and if you go along and you say that 
you're a student and part of this course she will know exactly what you're 
talking about and will help you it's a great place to research if you're doing 
research it's also a very good place to write it doesn't just contain books it 
contains audio audio and video C-D-ROMs and importantly magazines it contains 
and takes a sub-, a subscription of every poetry magazine that's published in 
this country and most of them in America too that's the important thing what i 
would suggest that you do sometimes maybe as a maybe as a team or i-, 
individually is going to that library and spend an entire day or two days 
reading those magazines and see what they feel like everything from Haiku 
Quarterly if you're into Haiku there's an entire magazine devoted to that to P-
N Review which you can get in in the library here to strange things like 
Psychopoetica really small press weird things there's some very strange 
magazines out there but often that's where the most valuable and interesting 
work is taking place 'cause if you write something bizarre sorry i wasn't 
looking at you there that sort of thing the there bizarre speciously even if 
you send that to the London Magazine they ain't going to take it because it's 
slightly conservative in its take-up on poetry it's nothing entirely wrong with 
that it's just that they want to publish a certain type of poetry the psy-, 
Psychopoetica say would have no problem with that so just because your work 
might get rejected from one magazine might not mean that that work is somehow 
bad or has failed it just means you've sent it to the wrong magazine now that's 
terribly terribly important now other magazines you should know about too which 
you probably do on the campus here er one magazine that grew grew out of the 
programme about two years ago and was run by some students like like yourselves 
it's called The Moebius let me just write that down on the board i remember 
what fun we had choosing that title The Moebius which is now a national 
magazine for poetry and takes submissions from er anybody but which is rather 
largely dominated by ex-Warwick students has to be said because they they 
writing about it and the Malacoda have you come across the Malacoda that's a 
campus-based magazine that's asking for submissions right now and it's run by 
two students who are second years in your degree er namex and namex and the 
third one is called The Black Beast the Black Beast now the good things about 
all these magazines is that they're not just er er amateur productions they 
actually have quite high professional standards of production and also and this 
is something that i very much insist on right from from the beginning they have 
very high editorial standards too it's actually quite hard to get into but the 
standard of the work is terribly terribly good as a result now those are those 
are three magazines on the campus i think you should try and read those two 
right now this is how you submit writing to magazines you don't submit your 
life's work nothing is more i've edited my work for er poetry presses too 
there's nothing more off o-, o-, o-, off-p-, p-, p-, off-putting than somebody 
submitting a huge volume of inadequate poetry choose your best poems and send 
no more than four to one magazine at any time if you're not happy with any of 
those poems don't send those poems because if you're not happy with them the 
editor certainly won't be either that's just basic common sense er and although 
it seems like a truism honestly most people who've sent stuff to magazines 
don't have a clue about this sort of thing they just think that they're 
geniuses to start off with and would send it in and lots of it too rather than 
just a kernel of really good work right when you send work you should also also 
send a short covering letter now i emphasis the word short there it should be 
no more than two paragraphs you should not make a personal plea for your work 
your work should speak for itself many people make the mistake of sending a 
letter which is like sometimes extremely long long winded and very personal and 
it's not really about their own work it's about themselves and their view of 
themselves as an artist and frankly that's of no interest i'm sorry but that's 
of no interest to an editor at all unless you become terribly well known like 
Mark then journalists might start preying into your personal life and your 
activity or might be interviewing you at namex or Cheltenham Literature 
Festival about your personal life but when it comes to sending new work out 
your own personality is of no interest the work is short two paragraphs and it 
should be something like this please find enclosed X number of poems for 
consideration second paragraph i enclose an S-A-E for their return i enclose an 
S-A-E for their return because the likelihood is they will be returned to to 
you but you never know now the S-A-E is a stamped addressed envelope and one of 
the cardinal sins that many writers and new writers do is not just that they 
write long letters and submit their life's work but they don't enclose a self-
addressed envelope er a publisher of a magazine is under no obligation to read 
your work or to send it back to you unless you enclose a self-addressed 
envelope if you're submitting work overseas particularly to America you 
obviously can't enclose an an American stamp on your envelope therefore you 
enclose an envelope and what's called an international reply coupon an I-R-C 
which you can buy in the post office they cost about fifty-P an I-R-C you'll 
get your work back and you will other rules of the game never submit work by 
email never submit work by email it's too easy to do these days it's too easy 
to do and most magazines will not accept submissions by email in fact when i 
get work sent by e-, email i delete it straight away there's not enough time 
other things to bear in mind too the long wait you will have to wait for this 
work to come back allow up to about three or four months for a message to come 
back as in saying yes or no takes a while why does it take that simply because 
most magazines are underfunded and 
most most of the editors of these ma-, magazines work for nothing but they do 
it in the small hours er the London Magazine is a famous magazine it's edited 
in a shed you know you have to bear those things in mind this magazine is 
eighteen years old it's edited from a shed now it may have a huge international 
reputation but it has those constraints upon it so wait and wait and wait do 
not hassle the publisher or get impatient other rules too poets don't have 
agents poets do not have agents unless you're a performance poet poets do not 
have agents that's terrifically important and if people think they can send 
their work to agents now those people will be snapped up fiction writers use 
agents because fiction is an engine for creating money i talked about this i 
think in er in week two big difference between poetry and fiction poetry is not 
going to earn you any money okay you do it for other reasons you can be Seamus 
and still be making fifteen-thousand a year he makes money by other means by 
teaching actually he teaches at er Princeton now don't hassle agents with your 
poems send it directly to the editors and do not hassle the editors stamped 
addressed envelope and no more than four poems everything should be typed or 
word processed and it should all be in one-and-a-half space okay one-and-a-half 
space so it's clear use a good printer do not use a dot matrix printer or an 
inadequate typewriter make sure it's really crystal clear and that the poems 
appear on on the page exactly how you wish the poems to appear sometimes your 
work will be accepted sometimes it will be rejected how do you cope with 
rejection how do you cope with rejection
sm5121: er 
nm5095: 
sm5121: just do it 
nm5095: mm there's a a certain thing about those things they're called 
rejection slips now rejection in this case is not rejection of you as a person 
it's rejection of your work and most writers not just not just all writers will 
be rejected at some point from James Joyce to Richards Adams to whoever they've 
all been rejected most people get for a lucky break Seamus is a very good 
example of that for a time he was quite anonymous it was only because a friend 
of his who knew his work well tipped of Favour that he was any good and Favour 
got in touch with him and he it was just luck it was just a lucky break he 
could be instead and still be as good as Seamus is you can be invisible and you 
you can still be good so how do you cope with rejection when that work comes 
back this is how you send it off that day to another magazine immediately send 
it off on the same day now the reason to do that you do that is that when 
you've got work out sent out when you got work out to be considered there's a 
strange feeling of hope that will be inside of yourself that next day something 
is going to come through your letterbox and it's going to be something 
accepting your work make sure that that work that comes back from somebody goes 
straight out again so you can keep that feeling going the last bit is about 
vanity presses there are a lot of vanity presses about vanity presses exist to 
take your work whatever quality dubious or good and publish it and charge you a 
fee for doing so if anybody ever asks you for money for publishing your work 
you should not proceed further with the deal do not sign anything do not send 
in any contract do not get into that area 'cause this is the big warning if 
you're good and you're published by a vanity press and you then send your work 
to a reviewer or another editor however good you are the chances are is that A 
you will not be reviewed and B your work will not be accepted by a mainstream 
or even a small press ever again because be aware that with a vanity press and 
a vanity press is in short a corrupt and a corrupting business a vanity press 
is just for one purpose and that is to make money for itself not to sell your 
work now vanity presses are often advertised in things like The Times Literary 
Supplement they say we want war memoirs poetry children's books nobody wants 
more war memoirs poetry or children's books there are millions of theses things 
nobody no publisher in their right minds would advertise for more submissions 
but the will then send their work whatever the quality good or bad to these 
places and you will get a letter back often within two days saying we think 
you're outstanding this is fantastic you're the next Keats now we're going to 
publish you in this anthology which will be leather tooled now to help us with 
our printing cost could you please send us two-thousand pound now this may this 
may sound strange but people then do send them and they say no you can you can 
pay you can pay in thirty pound instalments you sign it away because you're so 
pleased the next thing you're tied to a contract which is going to mean you're 
sending out thirty pounds a month for maybe a couple of years you then receive 
back a leather tooled book which looks absolutely ghastly where all the poems 
are going to be packed in in a really really intelligible typescript with a 
letter saying we're sending this book for review to The Independent The Sun The 
Express The Mail now the only paper that might review poetry is The Independent 
The Sun doesn't review poetry or literary stuff it doesn't review it neither 
does The Mail nor The Express but it sounds good and if you don't know this 
information you may fall for it but The Independent doesn't review vanity press 
books so what's happened is that you've you've lost two-thousand pounds you've 
got this book that looks like a book which actually isn't a book and nobody's 
going to read it apart from you and your own friends and it's about your own 
vanity now i'm not saying this to be hard up on anybody who's ever got into 
this what i'm saying is is that you got onto this course because we believe in 
you as good prospective potential writers or even real writers now if you get 
into that particular vanity area at an early stage it can destroy you as a 
writer because you'll get positive feedback which is actually false positive 
feedback and you'll be paying for it let's take a break come back in ten minutes
nm5095: hello it just occurred to me during the break now what i was saying 
about vanity publishing that applies very much here in the U-K and in er and in 
America which are the two principle markets for poetry er that doesn't hold 
true in places like Greece or er India or er Russia where quite simply there 
aren't any presses there are there are some particular presses and in those 
particular presses you might you might have to pay but it's not va-, it's not 
actually vanity vanity publishing simply because the presses don't exist so you 
have to make it up as you go along on the board is the word poetics poetics 
poetics is a crucial matter that you need to introduce yourselves to as soon as 
possible it applies not just to yourself as a writer it applies across the 
board of all your academic studies and it applies to you as a person too 
poetics is a very loose phrase though er what it means is just like up on up on 
the board it's the implicit principles the implicit principles of your own 
writing and that can also mean the implicit principles of yourself as a writer 
now having written down the two things that are generally important to you as 
you could you try and write down two things that are important to you as a 
writer or the writer that you would like to become two things that you imagine 
are really really crucial to you as a writer now or as the writer that you'd 
like to become try and look ahead maybe twenty years time and think of yourself 
as an immaculately turned out super writer with a Noble Prize and think about 
the principles that you might be hanging on to that you might have now or you 
might have had but which are going to get battered as the years go by but you 
need to hold on to them because they're important to you as a writer or to your 
writing because those my friends are your poetics those are your poetics so why 
devote an entire lecture to what poetics is because if you actually open a one 
of these excellent texts like this which is my bible which is The New Princeton 
Encyclopaedia of Poetry and Poetics you will see that the the chapter on 
poetics is about that big lots of poets have their own poetics let me just 
introduce you to some aspects of poetics before i ask you for yours one could 
be you might want to write this down the choice of what you write about your 
subject the choice of what you write about you make the choice about what to 
write about your subject now one of the reason of this as a set text in the 
Modes of Reading The New Poetry one of the reasons why this is a set text for 
the Modes of Reading and the Modes of Writing er is because it is it is 
apparently a divers enough book to illustrate a number of poetics as well if 
you look into this book you'll find people like Caroline Duffy writing from the 
point of view of a psychopath a male psychopath now that's a of what poetics 
means she's chosen a subject and a voice in order just to make a particular 
point you'll also find poems in here that are intensely political by people 
like Sean O'Brian you might want to write this down too something by Sean 
O'Brian which are basically political attacks upon right wing thinking now he's 
chosen to write those attacks in the forms of poetry he's chosen a subject 
politics and that's part of his poetics because he cares Sean O'Brian and 
Caroline Duffy care deeply about the political landscape of the last twenty 
years another aspect of poetics language language and i don't mean languages as 
in French Spanish Indian Chinese whatever i mean how you choose the language of 
your poems whether you choose to say write in a contemporary voice as though 
you're speaking to people or an example again from The New Poetry who chooses 
to write in a very colloquial voice now that's a deliberate choice that has 
made and it's part of his poetics it's to get across to a large number of 
people using dialect voices i'm going to read you an example of this to see if 
you can pick up the poetics behind it the implicit principles er have you have 
you all read the poem that finishes this book which i have very deliberately 
placed at the end of the book so that people would read it it's called Very 
Simply Topping Up The Brake Fluid why not open your copy of The New Poetry i'm 
going to read it out so you don't actually need it in front of you but if 
you've got it in front of you you've got the trick now i put this on page two-
hundred-and-forty which is the last page of this book i put it there to make a 
statement about what i thought poetry was up to at this moment in time er Very 
Simply Topping Up The Brake Fluid is the title of the poem now that's an 
interesting act very interesting title it's not called ode to it's called Very 
Simply Topping Up The Brake Fluid yes love that's why the warning light comes 
on don't panic fetch some universal brake fluid and a five screw driver from 
your tool kit the prop the open go on it won't eat you now without slicing 
through the belt try and drive the sharp end of the screw driver under the lid 
and push the go on that's it now you're alright screw clockwise and you'll see 
it's rusting love back to front that's it you see it's empty now gently with 
your hand and i mean gently try and create a bit of space by pushing the float 
chain sideways so there's room to pour gently does it that's it try not to 
spill it it's corrosive rust you know and fill it till it's level with the 
notch of the clutch reservoir lovely there's some in the office if you want to 
wash and some soft roll above assistant for well you know oh don't mind him 
love he doesn't bite come here and sit down my Prince Prince now where's that 
bloody alternator managed oh any time love i won't charge you for that because 
it's nothing of a job if you want us again we're in the book tell your husband 
now you can tell what sort of voice that's written in what sort of person 
that's written in who's supposed to be who's supposed to be writing that poem 
what's namex done there what choice has he made with the language namex
sm5142: mechanic
nm5095: yes it's it's it's written of a of a mechanic now i know lots of 
mechanics who don't speak like that and you probably know lots mechanics who do 
speak like that and speak like that to women when they come in with their cars 
and say things like if you want us again we're in the book tell your husband 
now er those of you who're working into form by the way if you're looking down 
that poem i read it in a particular way i read it quickly as if it was spoken 
by a real person it reads as though it's written by a real person as though 
it's spoken that's a deliberate choice that Simon has made but if you go down 
you'll see there're not a lot of half rhymes and full rhymes in there he rhymes 
brake fluid with tool kit which is er an one don'ts and won'ts are full rhymes 
er screwdriver and connector er and or rushing and pushing is rhymed empty ad 
gently pour and reservoir it's and its office and prints and above and love and 
managed and husband which is a consonant alignment and then that and want 
they're loose half rhymes there's a kind of form imposed upon there he's made 
he's also made a choice of form if you look at it it appears to be in what call 
chains four line stances it's a poem it's a poem it's in a form it's in chains 
it's got half rhymes it's a poem but it doesn't sound like it does it now he's 
made a choice about the language he's chosen colloquial speech why do you think 
he's done that so what do you think 
sf5122: 
nm5095: sorry
sf5122: he's exposing the stereotype
nm5095: yeah he's he's he's displaying and exposing the stereotype why do you 
think he's he's choosing to to do that
sm5123: it's not generally associated or
nm5095: it certainly isn't yeah that's that's that's right it's not associated 
but by by doing that he's exposing a masculine stereotype and in the way of 
mocking it he's he's using a poem in order to as his vehicle to do it which is 
which is political it's political not only that it's also a political poem it's 
a feminist poem written by a man in the 1980s late 1980s and it's called Very 
Simply Topping Up The Brake Fluid it's also it's also having a little go at 
poetry as well surely because most people's ideas about poetry are yeah yeah it 
might be in chains it might rhyme but it is certainly not called things like 
Very Simply Topping Up The Brake Fluid is it it's called ode ode to this and 
ode to that so he's breaking ground with poetry as well as trying to get some 
political message across at the same time without sacrificing any of the art 
that's part of Simon 's poetics and it's part of the poetics of a lot of poets 
in this why i'm writing i'm saying this to you is because i want you to be 
thinking about your own poetics that's why i want you to actually write these 
things down let me just touch upon something else syntax syntax by the way all 
these things apply in other forms of writing they apply in fiction as well they 
apply in the way in the way that a novel might be put together too they're 
deliberate choices made by the individual writer syntax syntax is the order in 
which the words are the order of the words you choose to order your words in a 
particular way you'll have your reasons even if you're free writing you'll have 
your reasons now syntax in this
book again as an illustration has anybody here read the poem by er Tom Ten 
o'clock News let me just try and find it for you is anybody here Scottish 
excellent have you got a copy of The New Poetry close to you 
sm5098: aye
nm5095: great right well go to page seventy please and go to the poem called 
Unrelated Incidents syntax syntax folks the order of the words the way that 
words are put together do you think you could handle reading Unrelated 
Incidents to us
sm5098: certainly
nm5095: you have to read i mean look at that poem in front of you Unrelated 
Incidents it's written in Scots it's written in Scots dialect now i can't do a 
Scots accent could you handle it
sm5098: possibly yeah
nm5095: have a go at the first the first part
sm5098: how am i supposed to read it
nm5095: sorry
sm5098: how am i supposed to read this
nm5095: er it's it's the language 
sm5098: no i mean
nm5095: oh the no oh that you just read it down
sm5098: (poem in Scots)
nm5095: yeah okay yes that's fine yeah now why is that poem written in that 
particular way what do you reckon namex
sm5098: 
nm5095: what about part three this is the six o'clock news the man said and the 
reason i'm talking with a B-B-C accent is because you want me to talk about the 
truth (poem in attempted Scots from here) this is the six o'clock news belt up 
why is that written in that particular way as you see i really can't do a 
Scottish accent i just read it i just read it er namex 
sm5097: he's talking about language 
nm5095: yeah he's making a particular statement about about about about the 
languages and also about the the validity of language too what did the Simon 
poem do think about the Simon poem again and think about this one the Simon 
poem is is read out best if you talk like myself or Simon that is you have a 
northern accent it's written in a northern accent this is written in a Scots 
accent and it's about it's about the six o'clock news and it's about truth and 
the way we talk and about language he's using syntax he's disturbing the syntax 
the order of the words in the way he's writing for a particular point what do 
you think that point is
sm5124: er that er things only sound relevant said in a certain accent
nm5095: mm yeah you also you also have to locate this poem in the time it was 
written which is probably about the early eighties i mean it's changed now if 
you listen to the er six o'clock news now or the ten o'clock news there are 
people on who are indeed Scottish or or Welsh and at this particular point they 
were they were usually white they were usually er middle class and they had er 
Received Pronunciation er the idea behind that poem is that is that the way 
that truth is told in this particular country is usually best received if 
you're if you're white middle class and you have Received Pronunciation and not 
if you're Scottish Indian Asian Welsh Irish or whatever now that's changed and 
that's one of the reasons why this that poem introduce you to the idea that 
there's a lot of plurality in poetry in the way it can be written and there's a 
plurality in this country too so it's again syntax for a number of purposes 
language itself playing with the language but also a political point too couple 
of other things too voice and persona this is again part of poetics voice and 
persona persona is when you is when you as you actually probably know if you 
put on a mask persona is about putting on a mask is when you put on a mask and 
you write from a completely different point of view you'll be asked to do this 
quite a lot by namex writing from from another person's point of view now 
there's a lot going on here with that particular thing one is er er in terms of 
namex there are poems here by Fred as well who was with us er a couple of weeks 
ago a little late er and Johnson where they they're using a a voice and a 
persona in a particular way to get across to you and expose what it was like to 
be a black person in this country in the nineteen-eighties and the nineteen-
nineties and still is sometimes i i suggest that you read these and you think 
about them and you think about your own poetics and the last one i wrote down 
here is form form that's a kind of poetics too choosing to use form in a 
particular way from now for four weeks and different forms and trying two 
different things the choice the choice to write in form is something that you 
deliberate about you do choose to write in form you know when i say write in a 
write in a limerick write me a sonnet write me twenty lines of this write me 
five lines of this i'm asking you to do that in order to practise rather than 
to produce great works of art but just to practise but some people very 
deliberately choose not to write in form and example of this here might be 
something like namex and again you have to ask yourself no i'll give you a 
different example i'll give you er Paul Paul is an Irish poet er now the poem 
that i am going to read to to you is not in form there's there's no form to it 
at all and he's deliberately chosen not to do so At The Funeral Of The Marriage 
this is about his divorce at the funeral of the marriage my wife and i passed 
on either side of the grave our children racing (?) behind it by the way it's 
on page 60 as the coffin was entered down in the bottomless grave our children 
stood in a half circle playing on flutes and recorders my wife and i held hands 
while the mourners wept and the gravediggers unfilled shovelfulls of clay down 
on top of the coffin we solely walked away accomplices beneath the trees we had 
a cup of tea in the graveyard cafe across the streets from the gates and 
discussed the texture of the undertaker's face it's beaten quality as i gazed 
at my wife i wondered who on earth she was i saw that she was a green-eyed 
stranger i said to her would you like to go to a film and she said i'd love to 
go to a film in the back seats of a cinema sorry i would love to go to a film 
in the back seats of the cinema as we slid up and down in our seats in a frenzy 
of hugs and clasps the manager courteously asked us not to take off our clothes 
we walked off urgently through the rain strewn street into a sudden cul de sac 
and as from the of our bed with sighs and cries we threw our funeral garments 
to the floor we could hear laughter outside the door there is no noise children 
love more to hear than the noise of their parents making love oh my darling who 
on earth are you now that's not written in form at all why do you think it's 
it's about it's about divorce and getting back together why has he chosen that 
to be er 
sm5125: because it's complex
nm5095: mm-hmm
sm5125: pattern 
nm5095: he's found some pattern too hasn't he er for the sake of the subject 
and if you like the the the address that is the person he's speaking to er who 
is he speaking to oh my darling who on earth are you he says is he speaking to 
his wife and er the thing the thing i'm trying to get get across to you here is 
that this is actually quite an extreme poem it's it's talking about an extreme 
event and often when you're when you're writing in extremism it's called 
extreme form sometimes lets you down form sometimes just isn't the right thing 
to be using and free verse is often what a lot of confessional writers use it's 
worth bearing in mind that now from my point of view i think there's a kind of 
er something that you can attempt writers such as who are what you'd call 
confessional poets writing about extreme events doo-, doomed affairs for 
instance suicide er depression often write in free verse they're pioneers of 
free verse but as i said to you two weeks ago there's no more to my mind 
confessional poem than say Dante's The Divine Comedy which is about a personal 
and real to in order to find his lost love Beatrice and yet that's written in 
total now six centuries ago or eight centuries ago when Dante wrote that 
obviously people didn't write in free verse that wasn't the convention these 
days it is a convention that when you're writing in extremism you use free 
verse because of the success if you like of the confessional poets convinced a 
lot of people you might be a generation you might be a generation that might 
want to think about whether form could once more be regenerated and used in 
extremism i think it's an interesting area you could go into it's one i'm 
trying to push the second year at the moment to so they're finding that if 
they're writing triple sixtiners () about loss they have a lot more impact than 
say one page in free verse about loss okay my poetics my poetics my own poetics 
are things like er i think the the language of science and the of science are 
terrifically important and as important is anything that could be discovered in 
philosophy or in the arts therefore my own poetry does have a lot of science in 
it er perception i think one needs to keep at all costs one's perceptions as 
clear as possible whether that perception is of another person or a political 
situation or a form for me like my own poetics perceptions is a key being clear 
being clear and not obscure is also one of my poetics other things more 
personal i think one should try to be in er in our life and all our lives are 
in many ways dishonest in various corners in your own poetry you should be 
utterly honest that's another one of my poetics and probably my last poetics 
and this is er i was born as a Romany and for me that identity as a Romany is 
important within my own poetics because i want to speak if you like on behalf 
of a lot of people who can't write or read but on the other hand i don't want 
that to obscure my own life entirely i need to you know look after myself too 
so i have a little struggle there but it's part of my poetics and i explore 
that a lot in my poetry your poetics namex what do you think your poetics are 
or could be
sm5097: being honest with myself when i've written it and writing every day
nm5095: mm-hmm that's very good yeah in fact let's just pass it around
sf5126: er mine is respect 'cause er not just respect for myself but respect 
for other people and originality 
nm5095: two very good strong ones yeah
sf5126: one of my efforts is not just to have published what the publisher 
likes and also work that like means something to me 
nm5095: yeah you know about that first one i think i may have touched upon that 
and er i'm certain that er writers like Jim it's it's a real battle er it's a 
lot easier with poetry er and it gets harder as you get into literary fiction 
er as soon as you you cross the line a little bit in the land of say and that 
first poetic that you got there gets battered and then if you step even further 
across then you just become a tool of the publisher and it's difficult to tell 
whether you're a writer or not 
sf5126: i kind of have obviously as well and try and change the subject voice 
and person in my poems so i don't just keep writing like 
nm5095: interesting very interesting
sf5126: 
nm5095: do you want to try do you want to attempt something like that now i 
might i might set an exercise in which you are to try write in in in persona 
and tell a story just to force you to have a have a go where i'd like you to 
choose your own persona i spent ? i spent an entire in the persona of who was 
dead er for sixty years and obviously in order to inhabit that persona ? i did 
dreadful dreadful things such as er i i had i had no understanding what it what 
it would feel like for instance to lie in snow for two hours in the way that 
he'd been forced by by the K-G-B so i went i lay in snow for two hours to see 
how it felt
sf5126: i don't know if i would do that
nm5095: i mean people do try things out just to see how they feel Maxwell a 
friend of mine who was who started the writing programme who was with me right 
at right at the beginning in nineteen-eighty-six er he was under the under the 
well he read somewhere that the best writing the best poetry got got written 
got written if you're in a state of mania er and starvation which is not true 
by the way it it it gets better when your when your belly is full actually so 
what he did is he starved himself for for er for four days and then he wrote 
and it was crap that he discovered er and by the way also tells a tells tells a 
very interesting er story story too which i'm going to tell very quickly 
because it answers something that namex and i were talking about during the 
break which is about one of the key differences between fiction and poetry 
poetry is a much harder harder genre in which to write well wrote three books 
of poems er which are published by Books he took a long time over the 
apprenticeship of these books and he got them right he then turned his hand to 
write his first novel Blue which and as he put it to me you should try it Dave 
it's a piece of piss took me it took me it took me six weeks it's just like 
it's just like taking it's just like taking the brakes off prose is prose is so 
much easier so much easier so bear that in mind when you're making decisions 
about genres i think you should try them all out firstly what are your poetics
sm5127: er double edged and downsided perspective (coughing) in the poetry and 
clarity and er at the moment er language of belonging
nm5095: could you say say more about that
sm5127: er i'm very interested well i'm kind of struggling with the idea of 
sort of being belonging in sort of all sorts of different er institutions or er 
just as yourself or why we're doing this and the reasoning behind things i'm 
very interested in and er i think that will come out quite strongly in poems
nm5095: yeah
sm5127: alright
nm5095: very interesting you can see why all these people are on this course 
it's a bit like the interview you see i was talking about that again with one 
of the things that that unites all of you whether you believe this or not is 
that er you will kind of identify just having a certain condition a certain 
kind of writerly condition it's very unacademic it's very writerly however 
which is er sometimes may seem like a certain uncertainty about your own 
writing er that's a very important quality to have because everyone sort of has 
that whether they're Doris Lessing or Mandelstein or or you now ask her tonight
sm5127: i want to try and keep a strong social perspective
nm5095: mm-hmm
sm5127: in my own writing and also to be as as personal as i possibly can in 
different situations 
nm5095: mm-hmm well make sure you hold on to that 
sm5127: yeah
nm5095: okay namex
sf5128: er freedom not just in writing but not having to conform to not having 
to conform to things that's what do and allowing myself not to know where i 
want to take a piece of work just letting it letting it take itself somewhere
nm5095: yes make it give it its own life i mean you have to give it the kiss of 
life first with your own imagination you just have to swing it onto its own 
legs one of the things that i i i've got to stand up tonight in front of two-
hundred-and-fifty people to make a speech about Doris and i was writing this 
last night and i was discovering on the internet all sorts of amazing things 
about her life er such as er she i actually cut them out of the speech because 
they were too personal but one of the things that that she did she went through 
two marriages and she actually gave up the marriages because she didn't she 
found herself kind of being condemned to a particular persona being sucked into 
a particular persona that's going to eventually rob her of her own identity as 
a writer and she said that being a writer of the sort that she is had made her 
a freer person it actually freed her and that she regards herself as a free 
human being they're very rare by the way free humans and writers are usually 
quite free human beings and that that freedom er not to conform is not just 
about about conforming conforming within your own writing it might actually be 
about conforming within society too but let's not press that button too hard at 
the moment okay
sm5129: it's like you can write something that people read then and understand 
with their ears and not their mind because you know you can write a sentence 
and then somebody reads it and just reads it for the meaning of the sentence 
you can just write something that meant totally nothing but somebody will read 
and just understand it with his heart if you
nm5095: yeah yeah fascinating er idea too of course what you want is at the 
same time namex
sf5130: er ideology is very important to me i mean i should the readership 
should be able to understand what er my ideology is what i'm feeling and also 
free verse i mean i hate conforming to form i just want everything unrestricted 
and everything has to fit together i mean when i finish it it has to be appeals 
to me it doesn't matter if it doesn't appeal to anyone else but i have to be 
happy with it and
nm5095: yeah excellent now hold on to those yeah
sm5131: er rather than sort of just sitting down and thinking that i would be 
writing er being prepared to experiment with form even if i don't stick myself 
with them in the end
nm5095: true 
sm5127: and being prepared to er out things more rather than just er giving up 
you know 
nm5095: yeah yes that means cutting it in into tiny little pieces and and 
reassemble it from like like a fine good again stick stick with these things 
namex
sf5132: productivity in a way causing i think it's quite important er either in 
a personal to a reader or a political outlook in society and also i think on a 
wide perspective of experience and learning from everything that happens to me 
in
nm5095: yes yeah how are you how are you going to go about acquiring that wide 
perspective
sf5132: er expose myself to a lot of different experiences different people and 
different arts and everything else
nm5095: yes very yeah
sf5132: er yeah clarity of perception and expression and i don't know there's 
like a lot in the world that can bring you away from yourself and if you're 
writing it writing for me is a way of kind of coming back to just being with 
myself and exploring things more deeply
nm5095: mm-hmm nobody's nobody's mentioned emotions really i've noticed but 
yeah it gets close to emotional truth
sf5132: er i'll stay keeping my own voice retaining my own voice wherever i am 
and er knowing my own values and strengths and what i want
nm5095: mhm very good you should talk to namex that's that's part of her part 
it's not and 's too actually
sm5133: er i want to write clearly i want my writing to have an effect er and 
er i want it to speak to i want it to be able to speak to individuals i'm not 
particularly interested in the idea of speaking to social groups er as i don't 
necessarily see myself as as one as as part of one already er and so i'm just 
into that idea and putting my interests into writing er into my writing and the 
idea of of just movement of er of of of the self and if interests really
nm5095: mhm very interesting very good pass around
sf5134: er not getting up sort of caught up in er the same subject matter all 
the time finding new experiences and new 
nm5095: what sort of what sort of thing you think you might get caught up in 
sf5134: er sort of and very sort of free verse er 
nm5095: mm-hmm that's one of the reasons why i give you things to write which 
you can't
sf5134: 
nm5095: what would you like to be in twenty years with your poetics
sf5134: i've no idea 
nm5095: yeah
sf5134: er always force people to think in a new way with what i've written er 
and make people look at something that i'm writing about in a way they've never 
considered it before
nm5095: mm-hmm yeah er once again you should be reading this book with one of 
those things in mind what are these people's poetics i want to take it up to 
here this time and then down here what are your poetics please
sf5134: er to transport and absorb and er sort of expressing something that 
everybody perceives in a way that's accessible and that they can understand it
nm5095: mhm ambitious but good namex 
sf5135: er 
nm5095: i kind of interviewed you i interviewed you on the basis of your 
poetics i think
sf5135: yeah i was going to say er what the the the first word that comes to 
mind we talked about articulation er and because i tend to well i i mean i i 
don't feel i can control what i'm writing sometimes and my get away and you 
know so articulation is and clarity
nm5095: yeah articulate energy that's a good book by the way articulate energy 
by Donald you should read it
sm5136: er voice and reinvention
nm5095: voice and reinvention how do you get to choose that brevity
sm5136: i'm not sure
nm5095: how did you mean reinvention
sm5136: er i tend to i have a tendency to to get stuck in the same writing the 
same sorts of things to stop myself doing that
nm5095: mm-hmm how can this course how can this course help you to reinvent 
that and to to
sm5136: well it's just it's just making me think a lot more and i'm not being 
lazy i'm not writing lazy which is what i get into really
nm5095: yeah i suppose that's something we all need to be less lazy
sm5136: and takes it away from where it started of which is really good i like 
that bit
nm5095: okay your poetics sir
sm5137: er make sure i have respect for the subject i write about er hopefully 
nm5095: i'm very impressed by er all your poetics i'm also very impressed by 
the word respect turning up so often here too some do it some honour do 
something's that some honour
sm5137: mm-hmm 
nm5095: that's very interesting do you mean celebrate things as well
sm5137: yeah or attack things purely because i can so to be true to the ideals
nm5095: very interesting yeah hold hold those very hard no those are those are 
really er 
exposed exposed po-, exposed poetics er a lot of people will try to take those 
of you sorry you'll be fine he'll be trained he'll be fine your poetics
sm5138: to er to strive for clear vision and without er becoming stale er but 
always everything has to be totally personal and something that i believe in 
strongly and then to provoke a healthy cynicism and scepticism er of humanity 
and modern culture and be identifiable through that
nm5095: would you also want to be providing some answers at the at the end of 
that too
sm5138: i'll have to see about that
nm5095: okay whatever you do okay namex
sm5139: er imagination it's a tool of limitless greater power so use it and in 
so doing fire at other people's er and to balance out self discipline be your 
greatest critic but also your
greatest fan er knowing if you go to far keep yourself in cheque but give 
yourself support
nm5095: mm-hmm yeah fair enough er that's quite pedagogical actually isn't it 
wouldn't you say that's do you want to teach
sm5139: er that's what i teach myself it's
nm5095: yeah what about other people
sm5139: if they're if they're willing to listen then i i er well it's i don't 
know if it's proven that it seems to work for me if someone wants to take a 
leaf out of my book then good bless them and so be it okay 
nm5095: no it's not okay but we shall work upon that it's it's fine they're 
good they're good that's that i know that you're capable of something
sm5139: yeah okay
sf5140: er i'd like to try and preserve a slight sense of mystery about it i 
don't like to write something that's totally exposed you know because i think 
people should be able to seek something in it and try and find their own truth 
in whatever you've written rather than just say you know here's a can of Tango 
and describe iterm and 
nm5095: that's that's the workshop by the way 
sf5140: and and as a result of that i'd like the product to be something that 
that flows that er i would enjoy reading myself and i think that's that's how i 
decide whether it's good or not if i would enjoy reading it
nm5095: yeah yes i have i have to own up to you to to something here which is 
that er i i actually didn't read any any stuff really until i was fifteen years 
old and then i read ferociously as you know er i still do read f-, ferociously 
but er about two years ago having read pretty well much of the poetry that was 
on on offer certainly in er Europe and America and Australia er i became 
intensely dissatisfied with most of the poetry that i that i previously had 
liked and part of the reason was that thing about the mystery i wasn't being 
challenged any more by it and that's one of the reasons why i now er read 
things which are kind of allied to poetry er like mathematics almost as though 
they're a kind of poetry or people like Dante because i want to be challenged 
again by the er initial mystery that i really enjoyed when i was say fifteen 
sixteen when i first encountered poems which is so i'm hoping through the 
writing programme by the way to to help you become the people who are going to 
challenge me as your reader i'm your reader never forget that and i want to be 
surprised namex
sm5141: all right er i i don't like to be restricted in my poetry you see and i 
want to write what i want to write about and not be conform to like a certain 
kind of 
nm5095: good
sm5141: form as such i'd rather do free verse and
nm5095: what about what about restriction being liberation
sm5141: restriction being progression in the sense of that
nm5095: Igor Stravinsky er said restriction is is liberation restriction that 
that if you're given a a particular form in which in which to write whether 
you're a writer a composer or an artist or a film maker where there are 
conventions too er it actually is much more liberating than just being into 
your own devices
sm5141: i'm willing to try that it's just i don't want to be i want to be my 
own individual as in rather than conform to certain ways 
nm5095: yeah
sm5141: write how i want to write and most of it is like more emotional in the 
sense as about me as a person and more sort of philosophical ideas and 
nm5095: mm-hmm it's good it's good it's a good it's a good it's a good poetic 
the wider though the public though is the reason that i that i i give you and 
the writers that you're working with give you particular exercises which are 
restrictive is that is to help teach you and develop a facility that's that's 
the important thing a facility so that you can actually fulfil that poetic of 
of yours so that when the moment strikes you you'll be equipped to carry it out 
because otherwise you won't be you'll be you'll be basically splashing around 
not able to swim so i'm going to set you a final a final exercise which is to 
er no let's er two there are two there are two exercises one one is er one one 
will make one of these exercises will make you hate my guts i'm afraid but 
everybody's done it and it's your turn in The New Poetry on page one-ninety 
there's a poem by Sean O'Brian Sean O'Brian it's called After the Fall you'll 
find it on page one-ninety of The New Poetry and er on page one-nine-three 
there's another poem by Sean O'Brian called Fiction and the Reading Public 
what's that funny noise
sm5097: somebody whistling 
nm5095: Fiction and the Reading Public i want you to memorise that poem that's 
the one that's going to make you hate me i want you to memorise that poem 
Fiction and the Reading Public you'll find that it's easy to memorise because 
it's in a very strong rhythm got it and with the After the Fall piece what i 
want you to do is is to do what he's done here which is find a poem in another 
language you can do this by all sorts of tricks by the way because there'll be 
translations available translate it or have it translated or just choose a book 
that's where it's already translated and copy it out and then write an 
imitation of it write an imitation of that poem write an imitation i want you 
to imitate it and turn it into your own poem find a poem in a foreign language 
find a translation of that poem imitate the translation make it into your own 
poem those are those are the four steps Sean O'Brian takes this poem here by 
the nineteenth century French p-, poet and he updates it so it's now taking 
place in the early nineteen-nineties i'm sure if you read this poem you'll find 
phrases where it says like Mrs Selfridges Sock Shop and this world is not 
Eastbourne it has no opinions Songs of Praise all sorts of things like this are 
mentioned in this poem that weren't actually in the poem he's made it his own 
poem i want you to make your own poem out of something from another language 
because honeys that's actually what we do all the time when we're writing 
poetry thank you for your watch it's now twelve-thirty see you tonight Doris 
Lessing have lots of questions ready
