nm5197: okay i'm going to er work with you now for about an hour and i'm going 
to talk with you about trauma now this is not a lecture and i'm not going to 
stand here and lecture you at all i'm going to try and encourage you to talk 
with me so that we can develop and understand some basic principles that's why 
i want you all to sit down here so we're part of a little group and there'll be 
some fun activities for you to take part in as well now i've got some of your 
colleagues helping me and er we've picked a couple of patients who i think 
reflect er two different aspects of trauma one patient who had a hip fracture 
and one patient who was run over by a truck and we're going to talk about those 
two patients not to talk about how they were treated but rather to understand 
the disease that they had and you should start thinking right now about trauma 
as being a disease something which has risk factors something which has causes 
and etiology something which can be measured in the population something that 
can be diagnosed so we're going to speak about trauma as a disease and we'll 
focus o-, in the two cases on some of the etiological factors and some of the 
aspects of diagnosis and initial assessment so Tim why don't you begin
sm5198: sorry can we have the machine on please [laughter] it would help hi 
everybody that's me wiggling my hips er i'm going to present a case to you on 
hip fracture er a very nice ninety year old lady er and this is the A and E A 
and E assessment that was performed and er documented the incident on the 
twenty-ninth of April this year she had a fall while she was walking and 
experienced some left-sided hip pain and she was categorised into the yellow 
category of in triage which is not that severe and at this point it wouldn't be 
irrational to assume that she'd suffered from a neck of femur fracture given 
that it's the most prevalent one whoops so here was the history er presenting 
complaint just painful left hip er if we delve into that a little bit more she 
tripped off the bus in town er and she fell onto her left side er she 
experienced immediate pain in her left hip without loss of consciousness 
drowsiness or nausea er she was unable to mobilise or weight bear on that leg 
and she denied any pins and needles and other symptoms so her past medical 
history we know that she's got osteoporosis she's had that for many years er 
she suffered a fracture before er namely a left proximal humeral fracture in 
October in last year she's an known hypertensive hypothyroid suffers from a 
hiatus hernia she's depressed and gets the occasional stress incontinence so 
just to give you an insight into osteoporosis er the definition is that it's a 
disease characterised by low bone mass and microarchitectural deterioration of 
bone tissue leading to enhanced bone fragility and an increase in future risk 
of fracture er and it's important to note that er the deficiency lies in the 
quantity and the quality and the structural integrity of the bone and er not in 
the mineralization of the bone which we call osteomalacia and you can actually 
see in this graph here er if we consider Mrs M's case she's over eighty-five 
she's ninety years old so she's going to be on the brown line of that graph her 
femur bone mineral density is likely to be less than six-hundred and so her 
percentage risk of a hip fracture is going to be edging towards about thirty 
per cent but we'd need to confirm this on a dexa bone scan er obviously in 
fracture patients it's important to consider all the social implications er 
just initially er she's not smoked she doesn't drink excessively and she has a 
good diet these factors are essentially important because smoking actually 
accelerates bone loss and can negate the benefits of oestrogen therapy like 
accelerating oestrogen metabolism er diet i'm particularly interested in the 
intake of calories vitamin D and calcium here er it's actually recommended in 
post-menopausal women to be consuming fifteen-hundred milligrams of calcium 
daily and between four-hundred and eight-hundred I-Us of vitamin D which is 
quite sort of sufficient isn't it er normally goes into town once a week if you 
just read through that where's it say that yeah only daughter lives close by 
and takes her out weekly in the car unfortunately on this occasion her daughter 
was on holiday and that's why Mrs M went into town by herself on the bus er so 
her family work full-time she has an upstairs bedroom which is going to have 
profound implications on her management she lives alone in the three bedroom 
house er she was receiving day care but she cannot afford that anymore er and 
she was mobilising with one stick before so we'd like to get her back on her 
feet these are the risk factors that can be grouped into skeletal and fall 
related variables er and as you can see Mrs M is clearly disadvantaged already 
because she's er got osteoporosis so bone mass microarchitecture already down 
she's post-menopausal she's a female she's white er and she's had a previous 
fall before er however she's hypothyroid so she's likely to be overweight which 
she is and er her low body weight is likely to be her increased body weight's 
likely to be protective in the future er so that's one of the advantages er 
she's also relatively mobile she doesn't sort of run about but she does go into 
town a couple of times a week er she's never smoked never consumed alcohol in 
excess so we can er disregard the fall related ones as well er drug history the 
obviously ramipril ACE inhibitor paroxetine SSRI she's on detrusitol for her 
incontinence thyroxine fifty milligrams and ranitidine for a hiatus hernia but 
the fosamax is really what we need to home in on here that's alendronate and is 
a bisphosph-, sorry bisphosphate so if i just talk you through what 
bisphosphonates are they're actually er designer drugs based on the naturally 
occurring pyrophosphate molecule er now when they found pyrophosphates they 
were actually searching for an agent that would prevent er calcification in 
soft tissues and they found pyrophosphate inhibited crystallisation in the 
urine er pyrophosphate is actually cleaved by alkaline phosphatase er and that 
prevents it from gaining access to the bone collagen er in the case of the 
bisphosphonates you can substitute an oxygen in place of a carbon er in the 
pyrophosphate molecule which renders it er resistant to cleavage by the 
alkaline phosphatase enzyme so therefore enabling it to attach to calcium 
containing crystals in the bone and therefore increasing the bone mass in both 
the cortical and the trabecular bone the fist bisphosphonate noted was 
etidronate but that tends not to be used now because it can actually cause 
osteomalacia due to er osteoclastic effects as well so role in osteoporosis of 
the bisphosphonates is er in osteoporosis corticosteroid-induced osteoporosis 
Paget's disease and hypercalcaemia of malignancy the next slide er just to show 
you how alendronate actually has it's actions er you can see on the spine and 
the hip that it's improved the bone mineral density and in this study the dose 
was actually doubled after y-, after two years the er graph down in the bottom 
there the two of those graphs the NTX and the BSAP are biochemical markers that 
are released er during times of bone resorption that will the N-telopeptide and 
bone formation which is the bone specific alkaline phosphatase and you can see 
improvements in both those markers there with the alendronate observations and 
examination er general observations er patient was comfortable this is 
obviously following the A and E assessment er no pallor cyanosis no jaundice no 
lymphadenopathy and neck mo-, mobility was fine mouth was opening thyroid was 
normal er her left leg was shortened and externally rotated and as i'm sure 
you'll all be able to tell me it's due to the action of the quadriceps 
specifically the rectus femoris the adductors and the hamstrings which pull the 
leg in that sort of position er it's important to test for the pedal pulse 
there because fractures of the neck of the femur can cause er avascular 
necrosis because of the way that the medial circumflex artery goes around the 
neck of the femur into the head so the plan the most important thing there 
really is the X-ray just random bloods done as well and transfer to the 
orthopaedic ward er i've got the X-ray to show you actually we're looking in 
this area here obviously any guesses
su5219: intertrochanteric
sm5198: no it's not actually sorry namex [laughter] it's a subtrochanteric 
fracture of the left femur and here's one i made earlier i got off the internet 
because that one wasn't particularly good er that's actually a spiral fracture 
of the femur as well just to point out that's not really relevant in her case 
there we go subtrochanteric fracture of left femur what did they do about it 
she had surgery pre-operatively they checked her haemoglobin cross-matching 
obviously important if she has er a bleed U's and E's requested starve from 
midnight er she was given local anaesthesia and consent was requested so that's 
a cross-section of the hip joint there and if there's any surgical boffins out 
there i'm just going to read through the approach that was taken not that i 
quite understand it so it's a lateral approach was favoured and they reflected 
the vastus lateralis m-, muscle which has it's proximal attachment on the 
greater trochanter and it's distal attachment on the patella and the patellar 
ligament going to the tibial tuberosity the trochanter was exposed and a guide 
wire was passed into the head and neck then using a triple reamer it was reamed 
to ninety millimetres tapped and then a guide wire was inserted ninety-five 
millimetre DHS was passed through a hundred and thirty-five degrees and then a 
four hole plate was fixed with cortical s-, cortical screws er and it was noted 
to be a stable fixation image films were obtained and found to be satisfactory 
although there was some rotation of the head and the neck fragment then 
obviously wash out and closing and staples to the skin that's er a reamer at 
the top there shooting into the bone post-operatively regular blood tests were 
done er she was mobilised for weight bearing clexane also known as enoxaparin 
is a low molecular weight heparin and that's used to prevent embolism analgesia 
was given morphine and co-codamol and she was discovered to be moderately 
anaemic so that warranted the administration of ferrous sulphate i just 
included senna and lactulose er not importantly but because of the opioid 
analgesia she was on she's obviously at risk of constipation er she is due to 
be going off to a rehabilitation hospital soon er where she will require 
rehabilitation physiotherapy and occupational therapy and they're really going 
to try and er mobilise her with one stick or possibly two sticks er i have been 
told by a physio that er walking with a frame isn't really getting an old lady 
into a normal straight back walking position so they will always try and get 
her to use her sticks okay er last slide prevention of hip fractures again 
divided into skeletal and fall related factors er you can see bang in the 
middle there oestrogen therapy in the form of HRT is of proven value er with 
regards to prevention of future fractures and er especially in post-menopausal 
woman the SERMs are selected oestrogen receptor modulators and they're under 
trial at the moment for stimulating receptors in the bone there by increasing 
the bone mass and they don't have the same effects on the endometrium as the 
HRT does er they've also they're also of benefit in lowering total cholesterol 
and LDL cholesterol and an example of an S-E-R-M is raloxifene the tibolone 
included there er combines oestrogenic er progestagenic and androgenic 
activities and it's indicated in the prophylaxis of osteoporosis quite a new 
therapy coming out er so obviously those are the drug choices for managing Mrs 
M's case in the future but er it's going to be essential to re-establish her 
mobility in the form of rehabilitation and er preferably getting her back onto 
sticks or soon there's going to be huge social implications her family all live 
quite far away and she's only o-, one daughter who lives close by er and 
hopefully she won't be going into town on the bus by herself again
nm5197: so have you got any questions you'd like to ask Tim
sm5198: bear in mind i'm doing dermatology at the moment i've just done my G-P 
casework
nm5197: yeah so you've heard his presentation it was extremely interesting 
comprehensive did it er make you curious about anything 
sm5202: one of er Claire and i were in care of the elderly for our first place 
and he was mad he used to run around the wards and open up cardexes and see and 
make sure that all his old ladies were on vitamin D-three and calichew er do 
you know wheth-, whether there's any point in er pre-menopausal women taking it 
as in like prophylactic prophylactic things or is there no point at all 
[laughter] 
sm5198: no er i don't see why not though vitamin D
nm5197: does anyone know the answer to that 
sm5201: is peak bone mass like an important factor for osteoporosis 
nm5197: can you talk us through that
sm5201: well i mean er like women pre-menopausally if they're taking vitamin D 
or or calcium will obviously have a higher peak bone mass so even if they don't 
take are therefore predisposing themselves to fractures i can't really give you 
any more than that really
sf5214: but if you're getting adequate vitamin D and calcium in your diet then 
taking a supplement probably is just going to increase your bone density 
nm5197: so er this is exciting it sounds like we're talking a little bit about 
calcium metabolism so who's excited about that anyone over this side or is it 
only on that side you guys know a bit about calcium metabolism right all the 
girls in the audience here at what age is your bone b-, bone mass at it's peak 
ss: thirty twenty-six 
nm5197: on this side only 
su5219: thirty
nm5197: thirty about thirty someone else 
su5219: twenty-five twenty-six
nm5197: right so you're talking about sort of er early adulthood and er in in 
the course of your whole life at least so that means that some of you are 
around about your peak bone mass now so it's all downhill from now on now the 
boys here what about your bone mass
sm5203: pretty similar isn't it about twenty eight or something thirty
nm5197: yeah any difference
sm5203: oh yeah m-, males have a greater than females anyway don't they
nm5197: right any difference though in the profile of bone mass as it changes 
with time between men and woman
nm5197: yeah we'll let you come in on this side go ahead
sm5203: there's a reduced decline over time 
nm5197: yes it doesn't go down as much we said it gets to a higher peak
sm5203: and er women live longer than men anyway don't they so er they've got 
like 
nm5197: right so so in fact er men and women both have an increase in bone mass 
as they get older er from childhood and then in their late twenties or 
thereabouts it reaches a peak and in men it's much higher than it is in women 
and then they decline roughly parallel until an event that only occurs in women 
menopause so women end up with a a lower bone mass than men but it's only been 
going down proportionately until menopause and then suddenly it just collapses 
and why's that
ss: oestrogen
nm5197: oestrogen or
nm5197: the lack of oestrogen okay so oestrogen in women maintains bone mass we 
could take through the biochemistry of that but let's not so in women suddenly 
a lack of oestrogen causes collapse in bone mass and that's why oestrogen 
replacement therapy is proposed for the purposes of maintaining the bone mass 
okay so that's it now in men it reaches a peak which is er larger than in women 
but differs between men and what sort of factors might influence that 
su5219: race
nm5197: race yes 
su5219: smoking
nm5197: smoking that's not one i know about it could be makes sense maybe 
su5219: activity
nm5197: activity yeah men who are physically active sports people people who do 
a lot of weight training they lay on a much large bone mass in fact exactly the 
same applies to women anything else 
sf5215: family history obesity
nm5197: yeah clearly there are genetic factors as to how much bone mass you lay 
down obesity er that's interesting now i have a sort of theory that obese 
people carry more weight so they lay down more bone but they are also people 
who tend not to be physically active so they don't get as much muscle er work 
and that seems to sort of roughly balance out so being obese doesn't seem to 
make much difference
sf5215: i thought that it was if you were obese you had more oestrogen and 
therefore you might actually be at an advantage
nm5197: in women only or in men as well 
sf5215: no women
nm5197: yeah i don't know that's interesting anyone got any information about 
that no i'd like to know that's interesting okay er so men who are active men 
who are er physically active men who are er er black have a higher bone mass er 
at peak what about vitamin D and calcium though you mentioned that earlier on 
sm5212: people who live in the dark or sort or cover themselves up could be at 
risk
nm5197: i don't want to know about that you carry on so certainly people who 
are deficient in vitamin D or calcium will not lay down as much
sm5212: nutrition
nm5197: oh so nutrition okay major major very very important environmental 
factor that applies to lots and lots of people in the world and that brings us 
back to the women again and whether having vitamin D and calcium pre-
menopausally could increase their peak bone mass anyone know of a-, any 
evidence on that asked that question 
sm5198: Paul
sm5212: yeah i asked that originally
nm5197: yeah do you of any
sm5212: no that's why i asked
nm5197: there's been there's been some work that's investigated that and 
essentially the bottom line is that er vitamin D and calcium are both very 
cheap and so even a small benefit might be worth having but in fact that 
benefit hasn't been easy to show and it looks like at least in this country a 
great majority of people already max out on calcium and vitamin D in their diet 
and adding it to their diet doesn't provide any benefit there has been an 
argument that for some people living in this country particularly black people 
who tend to be more in in the north of England live in Scotland tend to be more 
likely to suffer vitamin D deficiency they might benefit and so widespread use 
might be indicated but it's not it's clearly not very important now what about 
vitamin D and calcium after menopause anyone know anything about that 
sf5216: well most women seem to be recommended to take it by their GP so i 
assume there's probably an evidence base 
nm5197: either that or a very strong pharmaceutical benefit to the 
pharmaceutical companies now actually there is quite good evidence but you 
should always think about that why would lots and lots of people be prescribed 
something is there good evidence to support that i mean many example of such 
mass prescribing that are not supported by good evidence but in this case there 
is reasonably good evidence that in this country again er women post-
menopausally can benefit from vitamin D and calcium but the benefit is very 
small and so there's a massive prescribing going on for a very small benefit 
and the reason for that again is most people have an excellent diet but we're 
now talking about elderly people who were young and therefore at their peak 
bone mass often in around about the war years when diet was very poor and those 
people often had a low peak bone mass so they're more at risk so a small 
benefit in people at higher risk is worth having more than a small benefit in 
people at low risk we've done a bit of statistics haven't you you don't want me 
to talk about that do you but it that's the sort of time when thinking about 
relative risk and risk reduction and absolute risk reductions it starts to get 
interesting and that's where you'll need to remember all that statistics when 
you're working as a GP you start to answer the question should i prescribe this 
treatment routinely in my post-menopausal ladies 
sf5214: i can't remember what your list was for risk of falls but the same 
consultant that was giving a lot of vitamin D and calichews also on 
polypharmacy and he considered that did you ever come across this if a patient 
is on three or more drugs that's considered a risk of falls 
sm5198: sorry you were talking about the risk factors like on the vitamin D and 
calcium you're not talking about the thyroxine and the 
sf5214: not in terms of not on a biochemical level or any well in terms of her 
bones at all but 
sm5198: which which drugs are you talking about specifically then 
sf5214: any drugs just that if anyone's on any drug more than three drugs it's 
considered at risk of falls
su5219: is it is
sm5198: i just heard about cortical steroids i didn't really
sf5214: yeah a-, any drug any 
sm5198: i mean obviously in this sorry to cut you off
sf5214: no no sorry i'm
sm5198: in in this case you have treat her known hypertension and her 
hypothyroidism you can't just completely ignore that can you and by correcting 
the er those problems she's less likely to have a fall on the long run
sf5214: yeah i just wondered if you came it all in your reading that 
sm5198: no 
sf5216: is it clear which direction in whether it's that that predisposes 
people to falls or whether it's the people who are taking who are needing that 
many drugs are also more likely to fall because they're iller anyway
sf5214: well yeah but this i mean he would literally walk round the er the bays 
and slash drugs off
su5219: right
sf5214: off and then the next doctor would come along and put them all back on 
again thinking about that but yeah and then he would just stroke them off
sf5217: i don't know about all of the drugs on the list but the anti-
hypertensives can make you dizzy can make you hypertensive
sm5198: i think it's difficult to actually tell if it's an iatrogenic cause of 
a fall of whether it's been caused by the underlying hypertension or whatever 
else the underlying pathology that's there i don't think you could really tell 
that
nm5197: so let me just explore that for a moment er you're asking whether the 
fact that she's on six drugs or thereabouts is itself a cause
sf5214: a risk 
nm5197: of her falling
sf5214: of her falling 
nm5197: and that might therefore cause her to have a fracture
sf5214: yeah
nm5197: yeah and er between you you explored two possible scenarios either that 
is the case that the drugs themselves are causing her to fall and we've had 
some suggestions as to how drugs like anti-hypertensives might actually do that 
by making people dizzy or whether the fact that a person is on lots of drugs is 
a marker an indicator of the fact that they've got lots of physiological 
disease and therefore they might fall in that second situation what would you 
call all those diseases that they've got 
ss: co-morbidity
nm5197: co-morbidities yes and you'd call them something else if you were 
thinking of what this association between having lots of drugs and falling 
might reflect 
su5219: compounding 
nm5197: okay someone's got it compound that's what i'm getting at yes so there 
are two possibilities you've got an association between having lots of drugs 
and falling then it may that there's a causal relationship between those that 
the drugs cause the falling and that would be very interesting because then if 
you could take some of those drugs away in other words be the doctor who 
slashes them out then maybe you'd stop the falling occurring on the other hand 
it may be that something you haven't thought of like a whole bunch of diseases 
are confounding factors and they're associated both with having lots of drugs 
and falling if that were the case then crossing out all the drugs won't get rid 
off the falls it won't reduce the falls and so the reason that i bring that up 
is that we're talking here about risk factors and whenever we talk about risk 
factors it's worth you thinking about how did anyone figure out what a risk 
factor was for a fall and i can tell you the studies you're talking about er 
describing on falling have been done by looking at large numbers of people and 
measuring the fall rates in groups of those people and then trying to find 
differences between those groups and if you find the difference between people 
who have less than three drugs and those who have more than three drugs in 
their prescription chart then you might say ah there's a association between 
polypharmacy and falling but then you always need to think as doctors and 
scientists you always need to think is that association causal or is it a 
reflection of confounding by something that the investigators didn't think 
about and it's when you think like that that you'll know whether it's right to 
be the doctor who slashes the drugs off the drug chart or whether it's right to 
be the doctor who goes around and treats each of the possible causes i don't 
know what the answer is maybe one of you will figure it out because i can tell 
you no-one knows the answer to that question at the moment okay i want to ask 
you a question Tim you showed thirty per cent risk of fracture in this lady in 
one of your graphs can you put that graph up again that's great just tell us 
what that thirty per cent risk is what do you mean by that
sm5198: she's got a thirty per cent chance of having a another hip fracture 
specifically hip fractures
nm5197: do any of you want to ask him any questions about that 
sf5214: is that in a long time or in ten years one year
sm5198: in her lifetime i assume 
nm5197: no i think actually those numbers that you're looking at are risks per 
year and an eighty-five year old lady who has that bone mineral density which 
is extremely low does have about a thirty per cent risk of having a hip 
fracture in a year she doesn't have to have had a risk a hip fracture already 
in fact having had a hip fracture and having it fixed halves her risk of having 
a hip fracture because she's only got one hip now to fracture because the other 
one's been fixed with a metal plate that won't break so in fact if you go out 
into the population and measure bone mineral density then you can plot graphs 
like this of risk per year of having a hip fracture now we've got how many 
people in this country
ss: sixty million
nm5197: about sixty million a bit less and er lot of them are old er you know 
what the demographics look like probably but there's lots of old ladies among 
those fifty-nine million if i were to tell you there were about a hundred and 
fifty-thousand hip fractures a year in this country that won't come as a 
surprise to you when you've seen those sorts of risk rates that's more than the 
knee replacements and hip replacements done in total in this country every year 
in fact it's about double those so hip fractures and hip fracture treatment are 
exceedingly important and internationally in this present decade of the bone 
and joint as it's called there's a great deal of interest in osteoporosis 
associated fractures and hip fractures are perhaps the most important of those 
and the World Health Organisation sees hip fracture or perhaps more generally 
osteoporosis associated fracture as the most pressing public health problem in 
the developed world for this decade and i tell you that because hip fractures 
aren't very sexy they're not really that interesting to surgeons and er people 
like me who are happy to fix them but we don't really get that much involved in 
the patients and in the etiology of that disease and in thinking about 
prevention but some of you may be interested in doing that and i think the chap 
that you mentioned who chased around with the calichew he's really onto a 
winner there there's an enormous amount of work to be done in improving the 
health of our population by thinking about osteoporosis related fractures i 
just want to ask you one more question er osteoporosis you gave a definition 
can anyone remember it now don't be shy i gave you a definition just a few 
moments ago
sf5204: decrease in bone mass due to changes in the balance between er bone 
formation and bone destruction er leading to changes in the bone architecture
nm5197: okay good lots of lots of right things in there i want to pick out just 
the very last thing you said about architecture now what's that what does that 
mean not you but someone else any idea you heard Tim talking about bone 
architecture you've just heard it again what's that all about then
sm5212: is it that there are thinner trabeculae or something
nm5197: yes so here's a bit of bone can you switch this can i have the er 
visualiser on please okay this is a bit of bone if you could look inside a bone 
which part of the bone would i be in here 
su5219: spongy bone
nm5197: spongy bone yeah or another word more Latin
su5219: trabecular bone
nm5197: trabecular bone okay that's as compared to what sort of bone
ss: cortical
nm5197: cortical bone so whereabouts in your body is some cortical bone just 
show me a bit everyone show a bit of cortical bone come on guys you've got a 
whole body full of it here show me some cortical bone where have you got some 
where have you got some cortical bone 
su5219: i've no idea
su5219: it's the outside of every bone isn't it
nm5197: anywhere
sf5205: yeah all bones 
su5219: skull
nm5197: er yes er skull's not a very good example actually the really good 
example of cortical bone is the tubes of bone in your long bones so your femur 
femoral shaft tibial shaft the shafts of your long bones in you arms there are 
all cortical bone so what about trabecular bone where's that
nm5197: sorry whereabouts 
nm5197: you don't know okay anyone else 
su5219: cortical bone
sf5205: it's the bit on the outside isn't it 
nm5197: right on either end of the long bones yes er and also some bones are 
almost entirely made of trabecular bone actually the vault of the skull is 
mostly trabecular bone er and er where else is a good trabecular bone the 
body's of the vertebrae most of the pelvis that's mostly trabecular bone so 
this would be some trabecular bone and we'd looking down at what sort of scale 
how wide are these trabeculae what's the distance from there to there
nm5197: you've done a bit of bone histology have you have you
ss: yeah
nm5197: so these are fairly straightforward questions really where's trabecular 
bone and how wide's trabeculae er how wide is it give me a guess go on 
nm5197: say again
nm5197: i'm sorry
sf5205: point one of a millimetre
nm5197: point one of a millimetre a bit big
nm5197: yeah they're only they're only in the sort of er ten to a hundred 
micron range so getting up perhaps so let's say that's about ten microns wide 
er and there's lot's of space in here in fact most of trabecular bone is just 
filled with space er filled with air
su5219: no
nm5197: no okay it's filled with air in the dry bones you look at what's it 
filled with in life 
nm5197: bone marrow which has got all sorts of good stuff in it and er you will 
have some of you seen bone marrow samples being taken what does it look like 
when it comes out has anyone seen a bone marrow sample done
nm5197: anyone no-one's seen that okay you need to look out on a haematology 
ward it's commonly done it looks like blood with lots of fat in it so there's 
lots of fat in here lots of cells and a lot of blood in there and remember 
that's where a lot of the er synthetic activity for the haematological system 
goes on so in osteoporosis what happens is these trabeculae get thinner and 
your colleague i'm sorry i don't know any of your names was describing how that 
happened it's because this bone gets removed more quickly than it gets laid 
down and it gets very thin and then eventually some of the trabeculae actually 
lose bits of them so this trabecular here say which is going between here and 
here it might thin down and thin down until it ends up just being like that now 
that's a discontinuity in a trabecular how useful is that to you that 
trabecular how useful is it now
nm5197: that's completely useless it might as well not be there because it 
can't work as a strut to resist compressive forces which is what the trabeculae 
do so in fact you can still have this bit of bone here but it can't do anything 
at all so osteoporosis is about losing bone mass so there's less bone and 
that's what we measured on those graphs but it's about much more than that it's 
much more complex than that it's about the bone being lost from particular 
places it's being lost from the sides of the trabeculae and it's increasing the 
number of trabeculae that are discontinuous and that's why these graphs look so 
dramatic because if you lose a certain amount of bone mass take it away take it 
away and it's not until you actually make those trabeculae discontinuous that 
it stops working and then you're going to fracture more easily so that's a bit 
about osteoporosis let's move on any final questions for Tim before he sits 
down one more thing i want you to do have a seat Tim is er i want you all to 
get a bit of paper and er draw on the bit of paper have you all got a piece of 
paper everybody draw on the piece paper a picture of a hip i'll only give you 
about twenty seconds so get cracking to help you i've drawn one here so you can 
just copy that now i'm a surgeon and i'm an orthopaedic surgeon and er i'd have 
to say that i a little bit when i detect Tim's er er how should i put this er 
er lack of respect for anatomy Tim clearly doesn't think that anatomy's very 
important er or indeed a subject that any of you should know anything about so 
i'm going to show you why Tim really did need to know about anatomy in order to 
know anything about how this patient was treated and how the surgeons if they 
hadn't done this bit of anatomy would have completely screwed up the manage of 
this patient and you'll see why that term's particularly relevant in a moment 
so er here we go here's a picture of a hip what's this bit called
ss: acetabulum
nm5197: and this bit
ss: femoral head
nm5197: and this bit
ss: femoral neck 
nm5197: and this bit
ss: greater trochanter
nm5197: and this bit
ss: capsula articularis
nm5197: and this bit
ss: shaft 
nm5197: so someone said intertrochanteric fracture earlier on what does that 
word mean 
ss: between the 
nm5197: and so a fracture that goes like this would be an intertrochanteric 
fracture okay er Tim reckoned that that patient that we just looked at had a 
subtrochanteric fracture so where would that fracture be 
nm5197: so down here somewhere okay and er another term that's often talked 
about is a subcapital fracture what would that mean 
nm5197: so that would be usually in the neck about here somewhere so they're 
three pretty common hip fractures this one actually the subtrochanteric is 
quite rare in comparison and these are roughly equally common er these ones 
usually occur when people fall down and land on their hip as our lady here did 
and these ones usually occur spontaneously so they're just walking along and 
all of a sudden they fall down because their hip breaks and these ones are much 
more associated with osteoporosis than these so this is the the way that those 
patients with discontinuity of their trabeculae will probably get a fracture be 
walking along one day and their hip will break and that will cause them to fall 
now let's just focus on these two for a moment so on your diagram show me in 
some way the blood supply of the femoral head i'll give you a few seconds to 
draw that and then once you've drawn it you can come and show everybody what 
you've drawn 
nm5197: okay er who'd like to come and show us what you've drawn come on i 
don't want to pick someone let's have a volunteer yeah come what's your name 
sf5205: 
nm5197: okay show us what you've drawn 
sf5205: 
nm5197: have you got a drawing 
sf5205: sorry
nm5197: have you got a drawing 
sf5205: er yeah
nm5197: bring it with you go on show us on the er on the demonstrator 
sf5205: on this thing 
nm5197: yeah
sf5205: er there's one here to the head of the femur and er the medial 
circumflex femoral artery i think comes round here 
nm5197: that's brilliant okay have a seat thanks okay Tim let me see yours 
you're the anatomist 
sm5198: the medial circumflex artery goes round here and then the two arteries 
bunch up into the femoral neck into the femoral head 
nm5197: good and what about the one that er showed coming in from the medial 
aspect 
sf5206: that's obliterated at the back at five years old
nm5197: say that again
sf5206: that's obliterated at about five years old and then it becomes a 
ligament at the head of the femur
nm5197: yes so there's a ligamentum teres which is the ligament between the 
acetabulum and the centre of the femoral head and in children there's a little 
blood vessel in there actually in children it's quite a big one and an 
important one but in adults it it does get much smaller and is probably not 
very important in most elderly people you're absolutely right so Tim who was 
pre-warned had drawn some blood vessels that came up here and supplied the 
femoral head and er actually they're plastered down on to the neck of the femur 
there what would plaster them down 
nm5197: not the capsule because the capsule of the hip joint would be like that 
and so there's a a potential space there with a little bit of synovial fluid in 
it so they can have that part plaster those down on to the femoral neck
su5219: is it the periosteum
nm5197: periosteum what's periosteum 
sm5203: it's er 
nm5197: it's the bit that plasters down the blood vessels so it's er it's the 
material which is all over the bone er but that's actually quite thick usually 
er in the er around the femoral neck and doesn't go any further than that why 
not
nm5197: say again
su5219: because of the articular surface 
nm5197: yeah because there's an articular surface here of hyaline cartilage so 
er runs over the femoral er neck on either side er all the way round and is 
plastered down onto the femoral neck and that holds those blood vessels onto 
the femoral neck now apart from this little teeny weenie blood vessel that 
maybe is there er in adults but probably not in most adults essentially there's 
no other blood supply to the femoral head than these ones that are coming in 
here now that's actually quite an unusual situation isn't it because if we 
think about your hand for example its blood supply is er there there are 
various bits to it so tell me about some of the blood supply to your hand 
ss: radial artery 
nm5197: the radial artery that's coming down on the radial side ulnar artery 
over here they they come together in anastomosis in the centre and there's a 
whole bunch of little vessels under the skin er all around the wrist so that 
even if you lose both the radial and the ulnar artery there's still a potential 
for some supply to the hand so you've got lot's of options for how you get 
blood supply to your hand but in this sort of situation if the patient has a 
fracture which runs across there you can see how all those blood vessels that 
are plastered down onto the femoral neck would be ruptured by such a fracture 
and then what would happen to the hip
nm5197: it would die and that's called avascular necrosis and in those 
circumstances this head would be no use at all because it's all going to die 
and fall to bits and so that patient would need some sort of hip replacement 
and who was the hip replacement guy so that's the answer to your question there 
but what about if the fracture was here would the blood supply be disrupted
ss: no
nm5197: no it won't because the blood vessels come in from here and then ru-, 
run up the femoral neck and the fracture down here just the same that's not 
going to disrupt the head so it's possible for the surgeons to fix this with a 
screw device that held it all together and they can expect this bit to have a 
good blood supply and this bit to have a good blood supply and therefore here 
and that's what should happen in our patient here and clearly if they've not 
understood that they hadn't understood how the blood supply works then they 
wouldn't be able to choose which operation to do and so assessing this person's 
fracture involves thinking about not just what you can see on the X-ray of a 
broken bone but thinking about the anatomy which may have been disrupted and 
that brings us on nicely to our second case who's going to begin okay go ahead 
can we have the off please
sm5199: okay so our clinical case presentation is on multiple trauma Adeline 
and i spoke to Mr H who is a twenty-two year old army tank operator er who has 
no significant previous medical history that i need to tell you about at the 
moment er he's a motorcyclist er and he had to er effect a sudden deceleration 
when he was driv-, er cycling along er which apparently if you do it too 
quickly on a motorbike you're going to fall to one side or another he was 
unlucky and fell into the oncoming traffic on the other side of the road and 
was hit by a van er he actually rated his pain on the impact as only six out of 
ten and compared it with when he broke his arm as a young child er he he said 
the pain was actually worse when he was just lying in bed in the rehabilitation 
ward er than it was when the accident actually happens which i thought was 
quite interesting er pre-hospital er management when the ambulance crew arrived 
on the scene er was purely moving him onto a spinal bed and er giving him 
analgesia and a leg splint before bringing him into hospital er when he came to 
A and E er the primary survey of A B C D E which is probably familiar to a lot 
of people was er performed his airway and breathing were non-compromised 
circulation wise he was tachycardic he was pale and he had er a borderline 
impaired capillary refill which are signs of hypovolaemic shock which we might 
talk to you about later if you're lucky er disability wise his Glasgow coma 
scale was fifteen throughout fifteen out of fifteen and then the er er hospital 
staff moved on to exposing to look for further injuries er and this secondary 
survey revealed a continued hypovolaemia er substantial perineal laceration and 
bruising which apparently er the perineal area is one that's very easy to 
overlook when you're assessing trauma cases er and he also had suspected damage 
to his pelvis and his left leg so he was zoomed off to CT which gave this 
groovy picture er which er i've been asked to ask you to tell me about anybody 
er there's two main things really i think compare the left to the right 
sm5199: anybody want to tell me 
su5219: is it a comminuted fracture of the left er anterior superior aspect 
sm5199: er i don't know whether it's comminuted or not but there's definitely a 
fracture there yeah er it was s-, severe disruption to er the left sacroiliac 
er joint in fact and apparently there's er some lesser damage to the right one 
as well there's also er at the front disruption of the synthesis pubis er 
nm5197: let's just er nail this word comminuted what does that mean 
su5219: in loads of pieces
nm5197: right so that's a that's a sort of big word really but i think it's 
just about confusing patients because i don't think we use that word in any 
normal life and you might as well just say lots of bits or multi fragmentary or 
smashed to smithereens almost but er comminuted is a word that doesn't really 
mean anything extra which is i think is why there is a little bit of 
uncertainty between you as to whether it was comminuted or not so even among 
doctors people don't really know what it is er general point try to use the 
simplest word that will address the situation 
nm5197: er i understand you won't always be taught the same things by your 
teachers you need to get used to that but i would 
sm5207: 
nm5197: say that again
sm5207: you go into hospital 
nm5197: oh no not at all i mean er i work i work with sixteen other orthopaedic 
surgeons and i would think that er three-quarters of them would use the word 
comminuted routinely every day but some of us don't think it's a very useful 
word and i'm alerting you to the fact that in your practice when you become 
doctors you will need to think about what sort of language and on the whole the 
simplest language that conveys the message is the right thing to do but you'll 
therefore need to think about everything you hear not just now but throughout 
your working lives and think what does that really mean does that actually 
convey anything to me other extra to some straightforward word and you'll find 
that some doctors are dreadful at this and they will use highly complex words 
for no good reason at all and you'll find that other doctors er will rebel 
against that and use very straightforward words and you need to find your own 
place in that what i'm saying to you is think about it a bit don't be surprised 
when your teachers use take different approaches to that and you need to work 
out what yours ought to be 
sm5199: thank you er after the CT was performed he was taken straight to 
theatre and for those bud-, budding surgeons among you they sliced open his 
tummy er they found significant retroperitoneal haematoma er bleeding into the 
abdominal cavity er severe disruption of the pelvic floor apparently his er er 
rectum had become completely dissociated from the supporting structures but 
other than that there was no major other major pelvic or abdominal damage his 
livers his kidney his spleen were all still intact er while he was still on the 
table er further surgery was performed to find er to fix the bits that they'd 
found that was wrong there's simple language for you er so they sutured the er 
mesenteric er artery they found that had caused the majority of the bleeding er 
they gave him a colostomy to defunction the damaged lower bowel er they also 
inserted a suprapubic catheter because with disruption of the synthesis pubis 
there's er a large chance for er er laceration of the urethra so they decided 
to put a catheter in they packed the perineal wound and er they fixed the 
pelvis externally as well er i've got a nice picture of that er this is 
indicated again where the synthesis pubis has been disrupted to stabilise the 
pelvis and stop the two halves rubbing together to cause more damage and now 
purely because we're half way through the talk i'll hand you over to Adeline
sf5200: thanks okay right so they then went on to take a look at the damage to 
the femur and saw that there was a closed transverse fracture to the shaft of 
the femur and because it was er because he was actually suffering from multiple 
fractures this was an indication for stabilisation with surgery rather than er 
simple plaster of paris so a nail was inserted and this is an X-ray of the 
fracture to the femur the er i think i'm going to be ask some questions about 
this in sec but first just to say that the sciatic nerve was left undamaged and 
as you can see there was obviously no damage to the joint and both of these 
indicate a better prognosis than if either of those had happened sorry did you 
want me to stop this so you could ask some questions
nm5197: no carry on okay
sf5200: okay right as you can see he was given quite a bit of blood products 
while in surgery to combat the hypovolaemia that he was suffering and then post-
surgery over the next week or so he was er he was weaned off the ventilator 
which i've heard can actually be quite a traumatic process and he was treated 
for a left sided pneumothorax which was discovered on chest X-ray rather than 
actually clinically he developed a spiking temperature and MRSA was er cultured 
from a throat swab and Candida from his central line and he was treated 
accordingly by isolation antibiotics and antifungals he was then moved to 
Coventry and Warwickshire for their expertise in pelvic repair and here he 
initially er underwent examination under anaesthetic and this perineum they 
removed the stabilising bridge that had been put in place previously not 
because it was no good but because it's not a permanent procedure and they 
replaced it with something more permanent er fixation with a screw which 
actually went from the ileum through to the sacrum er to stabilise the 
sacroiliac joint which was the site of the ma-, the major injury they also 
removed quite a lot of necrotic tissue from his buttock muscles because 
obviously he was at risk of infection from that then during the next couple of 
weeks he made a number of trips to the theatre er of which i think Macbeth he 
particularly enjoyed and less enjoyable er was the further tissue removal from 
his buttocks and thighs the colostomy er examination which then revealed that 
yet more er skin and tissue had to be removed they re-dressed the wound er on a 
separate occasion and a skin graft was performed to replace some of the tissue 
which had been the damaged tissue which skin which had been removed earlier 
just very quickly er i'm going to mention some of the possible long term 
complications i don't really need to go into these in detail because you're 
probably quite aware of them physically the the most obvious is the mus-, 
musculoskeletal damage which if if we're not careful with his er rehabilitation 
could lead to long-term immobility and disability the genitourinary and GI 
complications as yet aren't particularly clear and probably won't be until they 
reverse the colostomy et cetera and then of course there's the er possibility 
of social and psychological complications things like anxiety and depression 
are very common in this sort of situation and so er we've split the 
rehabilitation up into surprise physical social and psychological and again you 
kn-, you all know about physiotherapy occupational therapy walking aids et 
cetera socially good communication with his family and employment er his 
employee employer's particularly important so that he can get back to if 
possible the work if not the work he was doing before as close to it as 
possible and evidence had shown that er a more psychological base to 
rehabilitation is of benefit one last thing to mention that i think's important 
i've sort of noticed while in hospital not just looking at this case is the two 
extremes of patient attitudes following something like trauma er at one extreme 
you have the sort of patients who really want to hand everything over to the 
doctors and don't want that that much involvement in their care they don't want 
to take it on board and at the other en-, the other end you have those who 
really want to be empowered and want to do as much as possible for themselves 
and i think from speaking to him although at the moment he's still in obviously 
quite a state of shock he seems to fall into that end of the spectrum and he's 
a pretty motivated individual and that obviously bodes very well for his 
recovery okay thanks
nm5197: do you have any questions 
sf5218: how can you wean somebody off a ventilator
sf5200: i think it's er yeah an unnecessarily complicated way of saying take it 
out and see if they can breathe without it or take it off see if they can 
breathe like without it on but the but now er i think there's a more 
sophisticated type of ventilator which er is able to respond somewhat to the er 
i'm not sure of the name of it but it's able to respond to the amount of 
breathing that the patient can do and yeah respond accordingly so the 
ventilator is in a sense telling what the patient can do and not taking too 
much away at once am i right er yeah
nm5197: yeah that's a good description
sf5200: but i think that's quite new and not all ITU's have them i don't think 
but as far as i know anything else
sf5208: i was just wondering about the if had quite a significant amount of 
tissue damage due to the fact i guess the fact he and that sort of thing that 
went on for him i mean i'm assuming that because of the multiple trauma he's 
unable to move himself and and they're afraid to move him because of any more 
damage and because he's had this bridge what sort of things can he do to avoid 
tissue damage like that because i mean sometimes they have these mattresses 
that you know that they're er to avoid but i'm assuming that you couldn't 
replace them with those and that's how he got this tissue damage 
sf5200: i think a lot of it probably er occurred around the time of the injury 
but
sm5199: er i also think that the presentation probably gives a bit of an 
exaggera-, because he went back for further debridement and further debridement 
it we didn't actually write down how much was taken each time so it could of 
just been a little bit each time certainly the photos er of sur-, the surgery 
that i saw in his notes er there weren't great big areas hacked out of his 
buttocks at all [laughter] it er it did look er like quite a lot of tissue was 
still intact so i i i don't think the tissue damage was as major as possibly 
the presentation made out er 
sm5209: was there any grafting done to the buttock tissue or i mean some muscle 
was er removed as well so how did they rectify that
sm5199: again i don't think they took away enough to be to give a significant 
loss er but don't quote me on that one 
sf5200: no all that was mentioned in his notes was that he had a skin graft and 
he was pretty unaware of exactly what had been done and he's a little too 
shocked to really take it all on board and ask too many questions at the time 
so he hadn't really asked the doctors for details of his injuries 
nm5197: see about half of the muscle here has gone a little bit more than half 
maybe two-thirds which muscle is this 
nm5197: gluteus what sorry
sf5200: medius
nm5197: gluteius medius good yes so where's gluteus maximus everyone stand up 
put your hand on your gluteus maximus
nm5197: right round the back here the gluteus maximus is the back part of the 
buttock and most of it's comes off the sacrum and most of it's 
sf5217: can i just ask he was on a motor bike wasn't he
nm5197: yes he was
sf5217: was he wearing motor cycle leathers and do they actually make much 
difference to whether he'd lose much of his bum or not when he's skating along 
on it
sm5199: i don't know whether he was wearing leathers or not no 
su: i can vouch for the fact they do make a big difference i mean i don't know 
about in his case but yeah i've come off motorbikes and they make a very big 
difference yeah 
nm5197: i think that's certainly true they definitely an enormous difference er 
especially if you see the leathers after the accident when someone has had an 
accident they've been going sixty miles and they've come off their bike and 
they're skidded along the road you look at their leathers afterwards you 
realise how they've benefited from their skin not looking like their leathers 
in fact this chap's injury was primarily caused by him being run over it wasn't 
the fact that he came off the bike that did him much of the damage he was 
actually driven over by a large truck and the truck came diagonally across his 
body er that side so it came one of the sets of wheels came between his legs
ss: oh
nm5197: across the middle of his pelvis and came off over here and you could 
see when he first came in the tyre tracks 
ss: oh [laughter] 
nm5197: and er because the injury was actually therefore caused by pure 
crushing and that's what damaged the muscle on the side and that muscle was 
just killed its there there was nothing that could ever be done about that 
because he was going to lose that 
sm5209: er his rectal muscles were completely removed from the surrounding 
structures and he was on a colostomy i-, is there surgery that can repair that 
so that he won't have to be on the colostomy long term
nm5197: er yes but let's go back a few steps so he'd been crushed and he'd lost 
about half two-thirds of the gluteus medius so what sort of functional deficit 
might he experience 
ss: adduction
nm5197: he's going to lose adduction so how will he notice that what you can be 
sure of is he won't come into the clinic and say doctor doctor i've lost my 
adduction power how would he complain what would he say 
nm5197: so what would he complain of 
nm5197: he's on the end of the phone now and he's trying to describe to you 
what the problem is what would he say 
su5219: can't walk properly
nm5197: can't walk properly okay what happens when you try to walk 
sf5216: he won't be able to support himself on one leg 
nm5197: now that's exactly what he won't be able to do he can't stand on one 
leg because if he tries to stand on his left leg he hasn't got enough adduction 
power he can't tilt his pelvis like this to bring his centre of gravity over 
that one leg and so when he tries to stand on one leg his weight will still 
hang over to the right side and he'll fall over so he won't be able to stand on 
his left leg and when he walks every time he's in the stance phase on his left 
leg he'll be falling over so as he walks he'll do something like this okay so 
he's going to have a functional deficit and there's not much we can do about 
that but what we're trying to do is just to get his pelvis sufficiently 
reconstructed thank you very much get his pelvis sufficiently reconstructed to 
make it work later on okay let's talk a bit then more about the injuries can 
you get back to his er his initial X-ray great so have a look at this and er 
here's a pelvis which you can compare with that one that's er a reconstruction 
from the CT scan and he's got er a lot of fracture around here a multi 
fragmentary fracture in this area this side of his pelvis this of the ileum is 
just smashed into lots of bits but that's not really a his big problem although 
that reflects how much damage has been done there and hence why gluteus medius 
was so crushed his big problem was that his whole pelvis was completely 
disrupted it was taken into two pieces one bit went that way and the other bit 
went that way when the tyres when over the middle and it separated here what 
structure is this 
ss: sacroiliac 
nm5197: sacroiliac joint and here
nm5197: right and in fact we know that this part of his pelvis went backwards 
with respect to this part as well now that's actually quite a technically 
difficult problem for us to manage but what you need to think about just now 
when you first see him is what are the implications of that that's what the 
picture looks like but what will that mean so what sort of big stuff is in here 
that might get damaged when the bones do that sort of thing 
nm5197: his bladder okay where's his bladder
nm5197: okay it's about here sitting behind the synthesis pubis and you can 
imagine it when his bladder fills up it comes up like this and his urethra is 
at the bottom of the bladder and comes down between the two rami of the pubis 
and that's why his urethra was damaged and that's why he had to have a 
suprapubic catheter okay what er other big stuff's in here no we're not talking 
about here we're talking about matter
su5219: intestines
nm5197: intestines yeah lots of intestines all wriggly stuff in here lots of 
intestines any of the intestines damaged 
nm5197: what did you hear in the presentation
su5219: his rectum was damaged
nm5197: his rectum was damaged actually his rectum was damaged right down here 
where he had a great big wound where his pelvis had sort of been not just the 
bone of his pelvis but the whole soft tissue structure had been split so a 
great big wound down here which went into his rectum so that was the damage to 
the rectum what about further up here i think Adam mentioned it in the 
presentation 
su5219: mesenteric vessels
nm5197: mesenteric vessel so one of the mesenteric vessels what's the mesentery 
su: something that suspends the colon into the rectum
nm5197: okay so there are there's a a thin relatively delicate structure which 
joins the whole bowel the whole length of the bowel onto the back of the 
abdomen onto the retroperitoneal area and all the blood vessels which supply 
the bowel come from the back there and so they're thin relatively fragile 
structure the mesentery's got lots of mesenteric vessels in it and one of those 
was ruptured so he was bleeding from that and that required surgery and we've 
heard about that during his abdominal surgery what else is in here 
su5219: aorta
nm5197: aorta yeah aorta where does the aorta stop how far does it come down 
nm5197: someone L4 T10 
nm5197: about T10 and it's at the level of the so it's up here somewhere so 
down in here there's not really any aorta but what are the two big vessels that 
come off the aorta 
ss: iliac
nm5197: the iliac arteries and then subsequently the external and internal 
iliac arteries and where do the external iliac arteries go into the 
nm5197: they become femoral arteries and go into the leg so where are they on 
this model they're lying over here like this and each one's about the size of 
my finger so big vessels and you can see how maybe some of that disruption you 
can see on the left hand side might be getting quite close to where the femoral 
artery is on the left okay what else the internal iliac arteries where are they 
nm5197: they're in here they're in this space so they're winding around in here 
and the internal iliac arteries are not much smaller than the external they're 
really quite big structures and what runs along beside them 
su5219: veins
nm5197: veins what are they called 
nm5197: the iliac veins the internal iliac veins it's easy isn't it and the 
arteries are sort of stretchy they're very elastic so if you take the pelvis 
and go like that the arteries stretch out and it's quite difficult to injure 
them the veins are not like that at all they're very very thin walled 
structures if you do this they will just tear and so the veins are all lying in 
this sort of place on the side big ones where they come off the er er before 
they before they join the to form the inferior vena cava and these veins are 
therefore right in front of where the sacroiliac joint disruption is can you 
see it on that picture by the way where it says degree there's a whole bit of 
bone missing because that's all gone backwards the sacroiliac joint's 
completely disrupted and so those big big veins have very very likely been 
damaged in here and many other structures as well now did you get the 
impression that he almost died or did he come through this no trouble at all 
sm5199: stiff upper lip and all that 
nm5197: stiff upper lip
sm5199: yeah er i never got the impression that he almost died did you
sf5200: some well if i'd just read his notes i would have thought he'd come 
pretty close to death but from speaking to him i didn't get that impression he 
he didn't sound like he thought it 
nm5197: that's interesting how much did he know about what was going on when he 
was initially being resuscitated
sm5199: not much 
nm5197: no quite a long time ventilated and sedated in the intensive care unit 
so he probably doesn't remember any of that so in fact i can tell you that he 
did almost die and we'll see a few bits of direct evidence for that in a moment 
but lets go back a little bit er to some of the things we were thinking about 
with the lady who had the hip fracture we talked about her being elderly female 
white we talked about bone mass we talked about osteoporosis so what sort of 
risk factors did this chap have for trauma
ss: motor bike
nm5197: rides a motor bike he's a young man young man 
sf5218: speed he was travelling
nm5197: say again
sf5218: the speed he was travelling
nm5197: er yeah and how fast was he going actually in fact he could have been 
going very slowly couldn't he because er his main injury was being driven over 
su5219: his occupation
nm5197: what's his occupation 
su5219: tank operator
nm5197: no he's a soldier so he's a sort of rough and ready sort of chap i can 
say that because i was in the army too what else what other risk factors might 
you be interested in maybe you'd like to ask the chaps about them
sm5210: they said there was no relevant past medical history
nm5197: no past medical history what what would be relevant
sm5210: depends whether or not there's systemic illness so if he was diabetic 
or 
nm5197: a bit more broad
su5219: psychiatric
nm5197: psychiatric history certainly what about previous trauma trauma is a 
repeating disease my best is a patient who was shot five times on five separate 
occasions right on the third occasion when i saw him he was shot in the heart 
he had a bullet that went right through his heart we managed to keep him alive 
he survived i then saw him two subsequent times having been shot again on two 
separate occasions this is a person who got shot five times to my personal 
knowledge i don't know whether he's still alive or not but trauma is something 
that happens to people again and again and i want you to think around the idea 
that this is a disease it's not an accident it's not just hard luck some people 
are trauma patients they get it in the same way that some people get hip 
fractures some people get run over by trucks and the people who get run over by 
trucks are young men who are physically active and often have a particular sort 
of er er maybe we'll call it outgoing but it might be aggressive er personality 
they're people who get involved in activities which are more likely to result 
in injuries and some things you haven't mentioned at all they're people who 
drink they're people who take drugs they're people who are antisocial in their 
behaviour these are trauma victims and just the same way that not every person 
who gets a hip fracture is a little old lady with osteoporosis not every person 
who gets run over by a truck is in like this but you can categorise what these 
patients are like and think about the epidemiology of trauma in just the way 
you can think about the epidemiology of pneumonia okay er these patients who 
get trauma as a disease what kills then
su5219: infection
nm5197: i want you to think of the most common cause of people dying from 
trauma in this country 
su5219: infection
nm5197: so a few possibilities infection is not the right answer
su5219: shock
nm5197: shock is not the right answer
su5219: hypoxia
nm5197: hypoxia yes talk about about that a little bit more
sf5217: well the breathing or circulatory failures then they won't get enough 
oxygen to the brain and they'll die
nm5197: yes that's not really hypoxia although that would be a cause of 
everyone dying really not enough oxygen in their brain but er i think you're on 
the right track but it's a little bit more straightforward
su5219: airways
nm5197: yeah most people die as a result of trauma from airway obstruction so 
of the people who have trauma and die it's airway obstruction that's the most 
common cause i'll tell you a little story one of my colleagues a consultant 
orthopaedic surgeon very famous scoliosis surgeon working in Oxford was killed 
when i was a medical student in Oxford and er he was killed in pretty similar 
circumstances really he was on a push bike and was run over by a er bus and er 
the bus didn't actually do very much damage but he banged his head on the road 
and so he was a bit concussed and he was taken by an ambulance to not the 
nearest hospital but the hospital that happened to have a C-T scanner at the 
time and on the he was taken there because a junior doctor jumped in the 
ambulance and said ah this chap's got a head injury we need to take him to a C-
T scanner and in fact er he died when he got to that hospital because no-one 
thought about common causes of death they were all thinking about what was 
going on inside his head and he died on a trolley in the accident and emergency 
department because no-one thought about the fact that he became unconscious 
because he had a head injury and he developed respiratory obstruction and he 
died so airway obstruction commonest cause of death in people who suffer injury 
in this country second commonest cause 
su5219: blood loss
nm5197: bleeding exactly could you just talk about hypovolaemic shock 
sm5199: yeah okay it's only quick i think and i wasn't expecting this er er 
hypovolaemic shock you're losing blood volume er which gives you a fall in 
venus pressure and therefore reduced cardiac output er your arterial pressure 
will also fall er it's detected by your baroreceptors which er increase your 
heart rate er and as a result of that your total peripheral resistance raises 
as well in an effort to get the cardiac output up and er also venoconstriction 
but er obviously the main er way to treat it is by replacing the volume that 
was lost and is there anything else you want to know
nm5197: no that's fine any questions 
sm5199: good
nm5197: so er when er do sit down Tim when someone takes a blood sample with a 
syringe er we lose some volume there does that person develop hypovolaemic 
shock 
ss: no
nm5197: why not 
sm5213: does it have to be more than seven-hundred and fifty millilitres 
nm5197: how much
su5219: is it seven-hundred and fifty millilitres
nm5197: eh er so what we're saying is that there's some sort of threshold once 
you've lost more than a certain amount of blood you're going to develop 
hypovolaemic shock which is in a sense a disease isn't it caused by bleeding 
some people are going to be able to respond their haemostatic mechanisms will 
be more effective than others what sort of people are likely to have relatively 
ineffective haemostatic mecha-, mechanisms 
nm5197: elderly people yeah
nm5197: say again 
sm5203: people with kidney disease maybe
nm5197: yes that's usually not much good any way what else 
nm5197: children yeah children don't have very much reserve so they can lose a 
small amount of blood and be very severely affected so how much blood did this 
guy lose 
nm5197: what what was the answer 
su5219: we don't know
nm5197: oh we don't know how much does he have replaced 
nm5197: seventeen units how much is a unit 
su5219: five-hundred mils
nm5197: five-hundred mils okay and how much blood's in his body to start with 
nm5197: five litres okay so he's er er had replaced how much in total 
nm5197: eight and a half litres okay so we don't really know how much he lost 
exactly but we do know that by the end of it he had another eight and a half 
litres put in so unless he's become very very big then probably he's lost 
something in the order of except it's not an exact match it's something in the 
order of one and a half blood volumes now that's an enormous amount that's a 
gigantic amount if i put seven er eight and a half litres of blood on the floor 
here we'd be awash with blood it's a gigantic amount of bleeding and a large 
proportion of people who lose that much blood will die just from the fact 
they've lost all that blood even if you replace it complications of the losing 
of the blood is enough to kill you so in fact he did come very close to dying 
with regar-, regardless of anything else just because of his blood loss now 
let's think a little bit generally and he'll be a good example here where do 
you think people can lose blood after major injury 
sm5211: where where to
nm5197: yes where does blood come from 
sm5211: from the bones
nm5197: from bones okay so he had some fractures so he had a fracture of his 
femur and he had a fracture of his pelvis so talk about the pelvis in a minute 
but the long bones the femur the tibia the arm bones these can all bleed quite 
a lot and big amounts of blood can be in the cavity around that bone er femur 
for example easily fit two litres of blood in your thigh around your femur so a 
lot of blood can be lost there pelvis he had a big fracture of his pelvis you 
you'd expect him to bleed from the fractured surfaces but much more importantly 
is the bleeding from those blood vessels that we talked about where else
su5219: into the abdomen
nm5197: into the abdomen he was bleeding into his abdomen he had a mesenteric 
vessel rupture so bleeding in the abdomen 
su5219: wound onto the floor 
nm5197: good onto the floor and it doesn't matter how it gets out but somewhere 
onto the floor and probably quite a lot of blood was left on the road in this 
case so somewhere out in Worcestershire there's a very bloody road and that 
bleeding could be left at any point along the track and usually some everywhere 
so you leave some blood on the road leave some in the ambulance leave some 
blood in the A and E department floor leave some blood in your clothes leave 
some blood in your car blood gets left in lots of places where else 
su5219: intracranially
nm5197: inside your head how much blood can you lose inside the head
su5219: probably not a lot
nm5197: yeah i mean about er two-hundred mils will kill you because of the 
pressure effected that volume of blood if you you bleed quickly into you head 
like that think about an extra er sorry a subdural haematoma or an extradural 
haematoma those sorts of acute bleeds can lead to death with only a very small 
volume of blood so no not much blood loss inside his head and we're not going 
to explain anything like eight and a half litres in his skull
su5219: into the chest
nm5197: into his chest yeah so er into his chest so into the pleural space er 
he can't really lose blood into the pericardium because a smaller volume there 
would kill you again er two-hundred mils easily enough to kill you a hundred 
would certainly make you very ill but quite a big volume in your chest how 
big's the volume in your chest 
nm5197: ten litres you're a big man 
su5219: about five
nm5197: yeah about five litres is the maximum er think about two litres in each 
side of the chest because you can't obviously fill the whole chest up because 
you've still got some lungs and other stuff to fit in there so er again some 
litres inside the chest where else
su5219: into the gut itself
nm5197: into the inside of your gut 
su5219: uh huh 
nm5197: yes certainly bleeding can occur there but to be a large amount it's 
either going to stay in the abdomen and just fill up your abdomen with blood or 
it's going to come out er at one end or other of the gut in which case it's on 
the floor
su5219: the retroperitoneum
nm5197: yeah the retroperitoneal space that's really about bleeding in the 
pelvis that's where it goes when you bleed in the pelvis so into the posterior 
wall of the abdomen well the answer is that's it it's really pretty simple 
they're the only places that you can lose blood so if you've got a person who's 
suffered a big injury and you can secure their airway and make sure their 
airway's not obstructed and be certain that they're not bleeding in any of 
those places then you will avoid about seventy per cent of all the deaths that 
occur after trauma so for all those young smoking alcoholic men that get trauma 
that's the sort of way to minimize the impact of their disease now we could 
talk about this chap all day and i'm sure some of you would be interested in 
doing so in fact how many of you would be interested in doing so not tonight 
but i'm interested to know how many of you find this sort of patient the one 
we've just discussed interesting how many of you find him so interesting that 
he's the sort of thing that you would choose to make your professional career 
around about six or seven of you then of those of you would you be interested 
in the initial assessment and initial treatment in other words the emergency 
room medicine the ER type stuff or are you interested in the subsequent 
management in other words how to fix him up and and make him work 
nm5197: so how many of you interested in the ER bit and the subsequent 
management okay that's just my own my interest to know that good we've talked 
about two different sort of extremes in trauma we've talked about a little old 
lady with a hip fracture and we've talked about a young man run over by a truck 
and er they don't cover the whole spectrum of trauma by any means but what i've 
tried to do is just to illustrate to you some of the complexities that you need 
to think about when you're considering what fractures and other injuries er 
mean to patients and in particular i'd like to take you to take away the 
thought that trauma is a disease and you can think of it in the same way you 
think of any other disease so you can think about risk factors you can think 
etiology you can think distribution and just in case your examiners thought the 
same way i'd like you to spend just one minute writing down three bullet points 
that would be the main headings of your essay answer to write on the 
epidemiology of trauma i'll give you one minute to write three bullet points on 
the epidemiology of trauma this is not a real exam i can see someone looking 
over their hand at their neighbour there okay so give me some bullet points 
sf5217: risk factors
nm5197: say again
sf5217: risk factors
nm5197: risk factors okay so we've seen how risk factors could be applied 
across the board okay
sf5218: statistics
nm5197: statistics what does that mean 
sf5218: you need information you need 
nm5197: yeah
sm5210: could be quantified and analysed 
nm5197: yes 
su5219: 
nm5197: i guess you're talking about descriptive statistics you're talking 
about how many cases are there or the incidence er that may be associated then 
with risk factors you might talk about how some of those graphs show how the 
risk factors affect the er prevalence 
su5219: prevention
su5219: trauma as a disease who gets it 
nm5197: isn't that the same thing okay 
su5219: prevention
nm5197: some one says prevention okay so that could be a whole topic on it's 
own and you could pick either of these and talk about prevention we talked 
quite a little bit about osteoporosis and we need to take the next step when 
talking about treatment of osteoporosis but of cause prevention would mean 
identifying at risk people and then treating them with effective treatments and 
we mentioned early on that maybe some treatments that we use aren't really 
effective
su5219: mechanisms
nm5197: yeah mechanisms and we just talked a bit about why people die er we 
could easily have talked about why people get hip fractures and er in one of 
your slides you showed hip hip protectors and there's been a whole load of 
interest in the fact that people get hip fractures because they fall over and 
land on their hip and those intertrochanteric fractures seem to occur like that 
so there's been a massive amount of interest in inventing devices that you wear 
inside your pants that are sort of like cushions that protect the trochanteric 
area so that when you fall over you don't fracture your hip it works actually 
if you can get people to wear them but people don't like wearing balloons on 
their hips one thing it doesn't very look very nice so actually the research 
has moved onto in elderly people's homes should we put very thick underlay 
under their carpets the problem is that in fact in most elderly people's homes 
they don't have carpets at all they have er smooth floors because carpets make 
people fall over so we're not quite sure whether having the rough surface of 
the carpet is er outweighed by having the soft cushion underneath it of course 
you can make it very soft and it becomes like walking around on a bed on a 
mattress with all these little old ladies we're not sure whether that works at 
all any other bullet points 
su5219: complications 
nm5197: complications yes er we'd be talking then more on the treatment end 
wouldn't we what about assessment diagnosis er we've talked about various tests 
that were done and it would be well you could talk about how you assess someone 
who's suffered an injury 
su5219: costs
nm5197: costs very good trauma is probably the most expensive health problem in 
the developing world and is almost certainly the most expensive health problem 
in the developed world and for two different reasons in the developing world 
there's an awful lot of it which is why it's so expensive and then in the 
developed world it's costing an enormous amount to treat it because we can do 
lots of very very expensive fancy stuff but it's also expensive because on the 
whole people don't get that much better afterwards they don't get back to their 
jobs they don't get back to their normal lives a lot of these hip fracture 
patients never get to their house where they were living alone with their 
family looking after them this young guy probably will never work in the Army 
certainly again and probably never work in a physical job again so it's very 
expensive because then we've got a whole life time of expense in front of us
su5219: when you say it's the most expensive what er proportion of the NHS 
budget does it er 
nm5197: well in fact treatment terms it's a small fraction of the NHS budget 
and less than one per cent of the NHS budget is spent on trauma and that's 
because the actual treatment bit doesn't cost very much in comparison to other 
hi-tech treatments for things like heart disease and cancer but it's expensive 
to the s-, to society because of the loss of income the fact that you have to 
spend a lot more money on these people in the future to look after them and the 
other heading i would talk about would be er social impact we touched on these 
little old lady is going to be desperately er disabled in the future certainly 
in the medium term if not in the long term and that's going to have a big 
impact on her and her family one of the questions i wanted to ask you Tim is i 
wonder how her daughter feels about the fact that her Mum's been living on her 
own in a house which she had an upstairs bedroom she had some help but they ran 
out of money and so now she doesn't have any the daughter used to take her 
shopping but didn't on that occasion because goodness me the daughter wanted to 
go on holiday and the one time her daughter doesn't take her shopping her mum 
goes out and breaks her hip so when you imagine looking after that patient 
maybe you need to look after her family as well okay i'm going to stop there i 
hoped you've enjoyed that session
