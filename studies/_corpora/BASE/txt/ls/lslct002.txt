nm0191: try and run the course [0.7] is [0.2] by i'll give you at the there'll 
be a handout each week [0.6] which will [0.3] more or less summarize the 
information content [0.4] that i'm trying to get across [1.0] and most weeks 
there will be [0.6] exercises [0.8] er in the sense of [0.2] data handling [0.
5] and [0.6] er [2.1] er [0.8] written exercises [0.7] for you er to try and 
consolidate [0.3] the material [0.5] in [0.8] er [0.3] this [0.3] spoken [0.2] 
session [1.5] what i say in the spoken session [0.3] should correspond almost 
exactly [0.7] although [0.5] we will take longer [0.2] with what is written [0.
3] in the handout [1.0] and [0.9] but [0.4] no sorry but [1.0] nonetheless [0.
2] since there is only one [0.3] of you [0.4] whose native language [0.2] is 
English [1.9] if i am going too fast [1.0] please ask me to slow down [0.3] if 
i say something that you don't understand [2.0] give yourself ten seconds to 
understand it [0.7] and then ask me [0.3] because it is much better [0.3] if i 
can keep you with me i would [0.4] some of the material [0.7] the logic [0.3] 
is quite complicated [1.2] and if i lose you on the second step and i carry on 
to the end [0.4] we've wasted a lot of time [0.5] and you will feel depressed 
[0.3] whereas [laughter] 
if i sort it out as we go alone so don't hesitate to interrupt me [1.4] er [0.
5] the more we can do it [0.2] as [0.2] er a question and answer session [0.3] 
the better [1.0] if you read through [0.3] the handouts [0.4] before you come 
[1.2] again [0.4] i hope [0.5] that will be [0.5] helpful [3.0] er [0.3] i 
ought to say something about the general [0.3] pattern [0.3] of [0.3] the 
course because it's been taken out of the [0.2] handbook [2.0] so [0.7] er [1.
7] i'll do that on the [0.8] board [2.7] hope we can rub out kilodalton [0.7] 
yes [0.5] good [1.3] oh and they've got pens here too [0.3] right great [0.7] 
okay [2.1] er [2.7] should have given you a handout for this [0.3] sorry [0.8] 
roughly speaking i'm going to talk about [4.2] the population [2.0] dynamics [4.
7] weeks one and two [2.2] i'm going to talk about [2.6] yield [1.8] er [3.2] 
disease [2.7] and [1.5] pathogen [2.3] relations in week three [4.1] i'm going 
to talk about [0.8] the [1.6] genetic basis [1.3] or the [0.2] the use of [0.6] 
genetic resistance [1.1] in [0.2] both as to both how it works [2.0] how it can 
be used in populations how pathogens respond what happens in the wild [0.3] so 
that's [0.3] four [0.4] five [0.6] six [1.3] i'm going to talk [0.8] er [1.7] 
about [4.6] that may even be four 
five six seven [0.2] no i think it's four five six [0.8] er [2.0] sorry [0.9] 
it's late in the term [0.5] er i'm then going to move on to [1.7] er [0.3] 
chemistry [3.9] which i shall be spending a couple of sessions on [2.0] oh it 
is seven as well [1.0] genetic resistance [1.3] and [1.3] that [0.2] moves in 
by a curious piece of logic [0.3] to talking about space [0.9] chemistry [1.6] 
eight nine [0.6] and then a sort of consolidation session [4.9] in week ten [1.
8] the assessment for the course [1.1] is [0.5] er usually an exam [0.3] er [0.
4] which [0.8] i think you two will take [0.8] are the rest of you here in the 
Summer term [0.8] 
sm0192: no 
sm0193: [0.9] 
nm0191: er [0.9] okay well if you're here in the Summer term [0.6] er [1.0] 
there will be an exam [1.5] and [0.2] an in course assessment [0.4] which takes 
place [0.4] over these [0.3] three weeks [0.4] in which i ask you to manage an 
imaginary crop [0.6] i'll explain more about how that works but [1.1] basically 
you have to [0.3] research what you would actually do in terms of [0.4] 
planting a variety of wheat [0.4] er [1.9] when [0.2] and what chemicals you 
would apply [0.8] and why [0.8] and i keep feeding you information about what's 
happening to the season and you keep telling me [0.5] what's going 
on as if we were running a whole year [0.3] over a couple of weeks [0.8] so 
that will happen at the end of term [0.3] for those of you not taking the exam 
[0.3] there will probably also be an essay to do [0.5] over the following 
vacation which you can send back [1.5] okay [0.4] 
sm0194: er so this er module is going to be carried out er through the Summer 
term [0.4] 
nm0191: no 
sm0194: 
nm0191: but [0.2] the exam [0.2] is timetabled [0.2] in the first week of the 
Summer term [1.8] er so if you are here in the Summer term [0.5] 
sm0194: yes 
nm0191: it will be easiest [1.5] and most consistent [0.2] for me [0.6] if [0.
3] you take the exam but for those who are actually not going to be here [0.9] 
i can't insist you come back to do that obviously [0.4] so i will set an essay 
type assessment [0.2] instead [2.8] okay [1.3] am i talking clearly enough for 
you to understand so far 
sm0193: [cough] [cough] [0.5] does not has to be hand in at week ten or [0.8] 
nm0191: er no i [0.3] well i can arrange that if you prefer [0.9] but [0.4] i 
would [0.6] i feel that the cour-, you will gain more from the course if you 
reflect on it a bit afterwards [0.4] so i would prefer [0.3] to set you an 
essay with a deadline three four weeks after the end of the course [0.3] you wi-
, mi-, may wish to complete it after 
you go back to Germany [1.0] and then send it by post [1.3] it depends if you 
need to take do you need to take marks with you when you go [1.1] or can we 
send the marks on afterwards [0.6] 
sm0193: i think you can send the marks afterwards 
nm0191: yes 
sm0193: because even if i hand it [0.2] in at week ten 
nm0191: yeah i'm not going to mark it immediately [0.2] yeah [0.4] well [1.1] 
probably not 
sm0193: 
nm0191: yes [laughter] [1.0] okay [1.6] so that's the course structure [0.3] er 
it's not a practical course [0.5] er in the sense of hands on [0.6] er but i 
hope it will engage with reality [1.9] you may need to be a little bit patient 
[0.3] about that engagement with reality [0.3] because i am going to try and 
build up the subject systematically [1.6] so [0.6] i'm going to er [0.5] 
develop things [0.5] from [1.1] a fairly basic [0.4] point of view i'm not 
immediately going to say in fact i'm almost never going to say [0.3] if you're 
growing [0.2] this crop [0.4] you spray this thing at such and such a time and 
you plant this variety [1.0] i'm always going to be talking about underlying 
principles [0.9] or almost always [2.5] okay [4.1] can i wipe this off [0.4] 
now [1.4] thank you [9.7] so [0.2] some of you have already picked 
up that the course is entitled Management [0.3] of [0.3] Disease [2.1] and [1.
6] that is a deliberate form of words [0.7] i think that the best [0.2] 
management of plant disease arises if you think of it [0.3] as a management 
problem [0.6] and not [0.2] a control problem [0.8] control [0.2] implies [2.3] 
right [0.8] that [0.7] isn't going to lead you to the most economic [0.4] 
environmentally friendly [0.5] and effective [0.3] solutions [0.5] the most 
effective solutions [0.4] are ones which work [0.2] with [0.4] what's going on 
[0.4] based on an understanding of what's going on [1.1] and [0.3] only limit 
disease to the extent [0.2] that is necessary [5.3] and in order to do this the 
two things that you need to know are [1.4] how do you find out [0.3] at any 
given moment [0.2] in growing a crop [0.3] what is the best decision [2.7] and 
the second thing [0.7] is [1.6] what decisions [0.3] could i possibly make [2.
8] okay you need to know the spectrum of things you might do [0.5] and then you 
need to know how to choose among them [1.8] and i'm going to begin with an 
example [1.2] which will probably take me about twenty minutes or so [0.4] to 
[0.3] set out [1.0] and then we'll have a short break for 
you to get your brains back [1.1] er and ask any questions [0.3] and maybe 
stretch your legs and so on [0.5] and then i'm going to talk you through [0.2] 
some [0.2] theory [1.1] of [1.5] er [0.9] which will [0.8] explain and provide 
a foundation [0.2] for what i've said and for [0.4] the general population 
dynamics [0.6] of disease [0.5] and that will take us to all about half past 
twelve [1.8] okay [1.0] so [1.5] what i want to do as an e-, with an example [1.
3] is look at why it is [0.9] that [0.3] wheat growers [0.6] in Australia [0.9] 
do not use fungicides [0.8] on their wheat [1.1] but wheat growers [0.4] in 
England [0.8] or the U-K [0.7] or indeed Germany [0.5] apply [0.2] two [0.2] or 
three fungicides [0.4] to their crops [3.5] so i'll try and develop this [0.3] 
as a contrast [3.6] U-K [1.9] Germany i'm getting obsessed [0.5] Australia [3.
9] i say U-K [0.3] that will apply to [0.8] most [0.5] of [0.4] northern Europe 
[0.4] welcome [0.3] 
sf0195: sorry [0.2] so sorry [0.8] 
nm0191: abo-, 
sf0195: about late er [0.9] 
nm0191: that's okay [1.1] you are [0.7] can i [0.2] just 
pass you this so that we have a record of everyone who's here [2.1] you are [0.
3] 
sf0195: namex [0.6] 
nm0191: namex [0.8] from 
sf0195: i'm a [0.5] from er doing M-S-C horticulture [0.3] 
nm0191: M-S-C horticulture okay [0.3] thank you [3.5] okay [2.5] the first [0.
2] difference and perhaps this is probably the key one [0.8] is that [0.4] in 
the U-K [0.9] we are growing [0.2] our wheat [1.0] with [0.7] cool [0.6] summer 
[0.7] conditions [2.3] the average temperature in June [0.4] is fourteen 
degrees [0.3] the average in July [0.3] is eighteen [3.3] whereas [0.7] in 
Australia [0.4] you're growing [0.2] under a hot [0.6] summer [1.3] conditions 
[0.3] temperatures up to thirty [0.3] even more [2.5] because [0.6] the s-, [0.
7] summers are hot [0.4] the wheat [0.2] ripens [0.2] rapidly [1.2] because [0.
4] the development [0.2] of the crop [1.8] depends [0.2] on [0.3] the 
temperature [2.0] okay [0.5] it develops very slowly at low temperatures [0.2] 
very fast at high temperatures [0.3] development in the sense of going from 
stage to stage [0.2] in the ripening process [4.0] and [0.8] the days [0.3] are 
[0.9] relatively short [2.1] they're quite close to the Equator we're talking 
twelve or thirteen hour days [0.7] whereas [0.6] in the middle of the summer [0.
6] we're talking [0.4] long [0.5] days [1.1] and it's no accident [0.4] that 
the world 
record [0.2] wheat yield [0.5] actually comes from Scotland [2.2] the further 
north you go [0.3] with a sufficiently mild climate [0.8] the better the summer 
yields you'll get [0.5] because [1.8] with a cool summer the crop develops 
slowly [1.6] because it develops slowly [0.4] and the long days [0.2] there is 
a lot of time [0.2] for so-, photosynthesis [2.6] so [0.3] these two together 
[0.7] mean [0.3] a low [0.6] potential [0.6] yield [2.4] the crop [0.2] has to 
make [0.4] all the sugars it can [0.3] to [0.2] fill the grain [2.7] with an if 
if you find it [0.3] i'm going to use this board [0.3] it may be helpful to sit 
further forward if you're having [0.4] having [0.3] trouble seeing [0.8] 
sm0196: oh i can see but the [0.6] [0.2] 
nm0191: but is the light bad [0.2] shall i adjust the lighting [0.9] er [1.3] 
sm0197: i think it's the reflects the [0.5] 
sm0198: yes that's it's some kind of reflection [1.0] 
nm0191: yes that's er hang on 
sf0199: the pen is red [0.2] so can't see that [1.6] 
nm0191: okay the red doesn't show so i'll [0.5] change that then [0.6] er oh [0.
2] no i want [0.2] that don't i [0.9] sliders [1.6] which is reflecting [1.1] 
is that [1.0] better [0.6] worse [0.4] 
sf0199: same [0.3] 
nm0191: same [1.0] it's just that it's red 
sm0200: 
sm0201: yep [0.2] change pens 
nm0191: okay change pens [2.0] i like playing with the lights that's better [0.
8] [laughter] okay change pens [1.6] aye [sigh] let's try b-, green [2.9] so 
this just says cool [1.4] summer [3.4] and this says [0.2] long [0.6] days [0.
3] and they are anyway remember that this is all written down already in the 
handout [1.0] but the consequence of that is that you have [0.3] a high [0.5] 
potential [2.9] yield [5.1] not only that [0.5] but [0.5] generally speaking [1.
1] water [0.6] is [0.3] not [0.3] an important limiting factor [3.8] it rains 
it rains all the year round [1.4] whereas in Australia [1.7] with [1.9] hot 
summers [6.9] short days [2.6] and therefore [0.4] low [1.1] potential yields 
[0.8] there's also [1.4] generally speaking [0.3] a shortage of water [0.5] 
Australia is the sort of place where wheat evolved it's quite good at surviving 
on relatively low amounts of 
water [0.7] but it doesn't encourage it [0.4] to make [0.7] high [0.3] yields 
[2.1] and [0.2] because [0.6] the water [0.2] is limited [2.8] that means that 
fertilization [0.4] and nutrient supply [0.2] is not [0.2] a limiting factor [1.
0] therefore there is no point [0.2] in adding fertilizer [1.3] whereas water 
is not limiting in the U-K [0.6] so [0.7] the crop [0.5] is responsive [0.4] to 
nitrogen [3.1] nitrogen [0.2] generally is a limiting factor [1.3] and so it [0.
2] pays farmers [0.4] to add [0.2] nitrogen [0.7] and f-, frequently [0.4] that 
would be in the region of one-hundred-and-fifty [0.5] to two-hundred-and-fifty 
[0.6] kilos [0.4] per hectare [0.6] really quite a lot [5.6] unresponsive [2.3] 
to [0.5] N [2.5] so [0.3] this yie-, [0.4] gives us [0.6] average yields [1.7] 
i'm just abbreviating average to A-V-G-E [0.3] average [0.6] yields [1.3] in 
the region of seven to eight tons per hectare [1.9] whereas [0.7] the [1.1] 
with a good yield being [0.5] ten tons [0.9] or more [1.1] per hectare [0.5] 
whereas in Australia [0.2] you're talking [0.3] one to two [0.4] tons [0.5] per 
hectare [0.4] with three tons [0.4] being good [3.8] 
sm0193: i've got a question [0.3] 
nm0191: have it [0.4] 
sm0193: er [0.6] the plant density in Australia [0.5] 
nm0191: it's much lower [0.9] 
sm0193: and how much er are they sowing [0.9] per hectare how much kilogram [1.
5] 
nm0191: er i [0.3] couldn't give you an actual figure for the seed rate but if 
we're sowing [1.2] two-hundred-and-fifty here i would guess they were sowing [1.
0] actually no i would guess they were sowing a more or less similar seed rate 
[1.0] but the tillering [0.3] will be much less effective [0.6] here you would 
expect each seed to produce [0.4] two to three tillers [0.6] so you would aim 
for a final plant density [0.5] of [0.6] eight to nine-hundred stems per square 
metre [1.0] whereas in Australia [1.3] you'll be you may well be sowing the 
same number of plants or [0.3] more or less the same number of plants [0.2] but 
you might well get only one one-and-a-half stems [0.2] per plant [0.4] so you 
might have a density [0.3] perhaps four-hundred stems per square metre [0.2] in 
a good crop [0.6] and it could be lower [0.5] depending on when it [0.2] runs 
out of water [1.5] the essential point is that the limiting factors are 
different in Australia [0.7] starting right from the top a whole sequence of 
things [0.4] mean [1.4] that the potential yields are much lower [1.4] that's 
what i need for now [1.8] now consider [0.3] the question 
a farmer faces [0.4] when [1.3] asking [0.7] shall i apply a fungicide [0.3] 
which may cost me thirty pounds [0.6] per hectare [6.8] er [1.4] i'm afraid i 
haven't revised the wheat cost [0.5] on your handout [1.3] but [1.3] it doesn't 
actually alter [0.6] the answers [1.8] i've said that the wheat was costing a 
hundred pounds a ton [0.7] i think the current figure is probably [0.6] nearer 
[0.3] eighty pounds if you're lucky [2.6] so [3.8] with wheat at [2.1] at [0.5] 
eighty pounds [1.5] per ton [1.1] that fungicide cost [5.8] er fungicide costs 
[0.8] about [0.6] four-hundred [0.6] kilos [0.9] nought-point-four [0.4] of a 
ton [2.7] per hectare [1.0] okay [0.5] what i'm doing is translating [0.7] the 
price of the fungicide [0.7] into [0.6] an equivalent [0.3] weight [0.4] of [1.
2] wheat [4.7] okay you can [0.2] still see it yes yeah 
sm0202: [1.3] 
nm0191: okay [1.3] now [0.4] that [1.0] is around [2.0] let's say roughly [2.4] 
a five [0.6] per cent [2.2] of the crop value [1.7] so [0.3] if [0.3] applying 
a fungicide [0.3] will increase the yield by five per cent [0.5] it's worth 
doing [2.1] so [0.2] a relatively minor [0.6] disease problem [1.9] which 
reduces yield by five per cent [1.1] will still be worth spraying against [3.5] 
and [0.8] in the days 
before fungicides were added [0.7] before fungicides were used [0.5] we have 
survey data [0.5] showing [0.3] that an [0.2] average [0.4] wheat crop [1.0] 
was losing about three to ten per cent [1.1] of [0.3] its [0.2] yield [0.9] due 
to disease [0.6] the figure could be much higher [0.3] occasionally [0.3] and 
it could be lower [0.4] but on average [1.3] it was a figure [0.2] larger [0.3] 
than five per cent [1.7] therefore it is profitable to apply fungicides [1.1] 
and of course [0.3] once you've applied a fungicide [0.5] your yield increases 
slightly [0.4] so it is favourable to apply more nitrogen [0.3] you make good 
use of your high [0.6] water retention soils [1.1] and [0.4] it goes around [1.
4] in Australia by contrast [1.8] fungicide [2.1] costs [2.2] er [1.0] if we're 
talking let's take this [0.7] er [1.2] two t-, ah well let's take i took the 
high figure there i'll take the high figure here [0.5] er [1.1] you e-, we're 
getting a yield of [0.6] two-hundred-and-forty [3.2] pounds [0.3] a hectare [2.
2] sorry [1.3] costs fifteen [0.3] to twenty [0.5] per cent [1.0] of [0.5] the 
crop [1.2] value [2.1] okay [0.7] so [1.2] 
sf0203: er is the [0.3] price of wheat in Australia the same [0.9] 
nm0191: yes [0.3] 
sf0203: 
nm0191: this is more or less the world price 
sf0203: it is [0.3] 
nm0191: 
it is now [0.2] yes [0.8] the calculation would have been different [0.6] and 
even more dramatic [0.6] when [0.7] er at current [0.3] present day prices [0.
4] wheat in the U-K was a hundred-and-sixty pounds a ton [0.4] and wheat in 
Australia [0.4] was [0.2] a hundred pounds a ton [1.2] but the E-U price the E-
U support is much reduced [0.6] the price of the wheat is more or less the 
world price [4.0] so [1.8] here the fungicide [0.5] on average you'd have to 
get about twenty per cent extra yield [1.4] and on average [0.2] you don't [1.
2] so [0.3] the routine management of crops in Australia [0.4] does not include 
[0.3] the use of fungicide [5.3] er [2.1] whereas [0.6] in the U-K [1.9] it's 
[0.2] logical from this analysis that fungicide will usually be used [0.4] and 
indeed [0.4] it is [0.7] er [0.3] by now something like ninety-five to ninety-
eight per cent [0.4] of all wheat crops in the U-K [0.2] except organic ones [0.
8] are [0.2] have a fungicide applied [1.0] and about two-thirds of those cases 
[1.3] the fungicide will be profitable [3.3] er [2.1] there's a little footnote 
here [1.1] for those who are actually interested in wheat management [0.4] 
that's the general 
principle [0.5] okay so this is little footnote [0.7] the little footnote [0.7] 
is [0.5] that [0.5] the Strobilurin [0.2] group [0.2] of fungicides [4.6] so 
i'll come back to this in lecture eight [1.0] Strobil [0.3] urin [1.6] which [0.
2] are a novel group of fungicides introduced [0.3] in the last three or four 
years [1.2] er [0.3] give a substantial yield increase [1.1] of the order of 
ten per cent [0.5] in the absence of any detectable disease problem [2.3] and 
therefore [cough] [0.7] it is almost always profitable [0.3] to apply one of 
those [0.3] so [0.5] the actual er [0.9] profitability of fungicide treatment 
has increased recently [0.8] as has the profitability of the manufacturers of 
Strobilurin fungicides the A-S-F and Zeneca [1.3] so [0.3] people have shares 
in [1.1] okay [0.5] 
sf0203: does that mean the Australians have started using this Strobilurin 
nm0191: well [0.6] 
sf0203: so does that one give them 
nm0191: no [0.6] it wouldn't [0.3] because their crop is water-limited [0.5] 
effectively what the Strobilurin is doing is enabling you to use nitrogen 
better [0.9] because it's keeping the crop green for longer [0.4] a crop which 
is green for longer in Australia may actually yield less [1.0] because [0.4] 
it'll be pumping water out into the atmosphere [0.5] and it 
will get shrivelled [0.3] and die [0.3] it won't get [0.3] the [0.3] won't be 
able to translocate any photosynthesis it does do [0.3] into the grain [1.9] er 
and again [1.4] er one can come back to that [0.3] there are actually cases [1.
7] in Mediterranean climates [0.8] where a small amount of disease [0.2] is [0.
3] causes [0.6] a yield increase [2.6] because [0.6] it [0.3] improves the 
overall efficiency [0.2] of water use [0.3] by destroying leaf tissue [3.4] 
okay so [0.5] it it gets very complicated but once you're into water-limited 
situations there's no point in retaining a green crop for a long time [2.4] 
okay [0.2] so [0.5] this is the first half [1.3] here i'm showing you [0.5] 
that Australians won't apply fungicides for very good reasons [0.7] there's a 
positive feedback [0.4] you've got [0.2] a high-yielding crop [0.2] which 
therefore justifies expensive management which makes it even more high-yielding 
[0.2] which means that it's justified [0.2] to put in [0.2] even more inputs [0.
6] we've got a potentially yo-, low-yielding crop [0.4] which is low-yielding 
so it isn't justified to do anything difficult so it stays [0.3] low-yielding 
[0.8] so there's a [0.2] a a positive feedback in there [1.8] but [0.9] this 
analysis [0.4] doesn't apply [0.8] if we're talking about [0.4] genetically 
based [0.5] resistance to disease [0.4] if we're talking about the choice [0.4] 
the management decision [0.7] to plant [0.3] a variety which has good disease 
resistance [0.5] as against a variety [0.4] which has [0.2] worse disease 
resistance [1.0] but [0.2] is higher yielding in the absence of disease [2.2] 
so i'm going to wipe this off now [15.1] okay [2.3] and i'm going to make the 
point [0.5] that [5.3] the yield [1.1] if you're breeding [0.4] a crop [0.8] 
it's difficult to breed for 
several things at once [2.1] that means that [0.3] if you've got [0.9] a 
resistant crop [4.4] and a susceptible crop [3.0] you will often find [0.2] 
that you have the situation [0.7] where [0.2] without [0.3] or [0.2] let's put 
disease [2.3] without disease [0.6] in the absence of the disease [0.6] the 
susceptible crop [2.1] is the best [1.1] it outyields [0.4] the resistant crop 
[0.6] whereas [0.3] the situation [0.3] is reversed [1.4] for [1.1] the case 
where you do have where you have disease [2.7] the cost of changing a cultivar 
[0.2] isn't usually very expensive [0.8] there's small differences in seed 
prices [0.4] but seed prices [1.1] are [1.3] er [1.0] a percentage [0.2] of the 
production costs the example i've written down [0.4] is [0.3] that if seed 
costs [2.9] if [0.4] seed [0.2] was as much [0.5] as [0.5] twenty per cent [0.
7] of [0.8] the [0.4] input [0.5] or production costs [1.4] if it was as much 
as that [1.2] then [0.3] a ten per cent [1.0] difference [3.2] in [0.4] seed 
cost [2.7] would be [0.8] only [0.4] two [0.4] per cent [1.9] of your input 
costs [0.4] so the cost of changing variety [1.4] is not normally very large [4.
1] and therefore [0.3] the continental system which we've already seen [0.4] is 
not [0.2] able to use fungicide sensibly [2.0] will therefore [0.4] use a 
resistant variety [0.3] when it's available [0.8] even if [0.3] there is a 
small premium on the seed price [1.5] whereas the farmer in the high input 
system [0.5] who's applying fungicide anyway [0.9] and who only requires a 
small yield response from the application of fungicide [1.0] will be tempted to 
say [1.0] the fungicide's dealing with the disease [1.3] i will continue to 
grow [0.3] my susceptible variety [3.2] and [0.2] the example i would give of 
that [0.5] is [0.2] the [0.4] wheat variety Riband [0.4] in this country [0.4] 
which is still grown i think on seventy per cent of the Scottish acreage [0.5] 
and a substantial fraction of the English [0.3] acreage [0.3] sorry [1.1] 
acreage means the same as area [laugh] [0.2] the acre is an old unit [0.3] of 
[0.8] agricultural area [0.5] so and i [0.2] will slip into saying it i'm sorry 
[1.2] so seventy per cent of the agr-, of the Scottish area is sown [0.3] to 
Riband [0.3] which is [0.5] appallingly [0.3] susceptible [0.5] to [0.2] the 
commonest wheat disease in this country which is septoria tritici [1.4] 
similarly [0.3] er [3.3] well [0.2] no i'll i'll but i can [0.3] 
multiply examples but i i won't [1.2] i won't bother [1.0] er [0.3] now [0.7] 
the only caveat [0.3] i want to add to that so i want to qualify this statement 
somewhat [0.9] by saying that obviously if there is no great [0.3] disadvantage 
[0.4] to the resistance [1.4] then a farmer will adopt the resistant crop as 
well [0.4] if you can have the resistance without [0.7] much yield penalty [0.
5] then obviously you'll take it [1.3] and [2.0] the phrases resistant and 
susceptible [0.2] are always [0.3] relative [2.1] all of our [1.3] crop 
protection [0.3] all of our disease management is based [0.6] on [1.7] er [1.2] 
crops [0.2] which have [0.3] very good [0.3] resistance [0.3] to [0.2] almost 
all [0.2] diseases [2.4] chemistry [0.5] chemicals [0.4] can help you a bit [1.
3] but [1.8] the [0.3] closer you get to a [0.6] non-resistant [1.2] to a 
completely susceptible [0.2] variety or cultivar [0.7] the less [0.3] effective 
[0.6] the chemicals [0.8] and other protection measures [0.3] can be [0.5] and 
if there is one message [0.2] that i want to gev-, [0.2] gi-, [0.5] get across 
in this course [0.7] it is [0.4] that [1.3] everything [0.3] helps everything 
else if you start from a resistant crop [1.1] everything else is easy [0.9] if 
you start [0.2] with a disease-susceptible 
crop [0.6] everything else is difficult [0.9] there is no such thing as [0.4] a 
solution [0.4] a protection measure [1.3] management of disease always comes in 
a package [0.6] and comes [0.3] with [0.4] feedback loops [0.3] like those [0.
2] i've described [0.4] one thing [0.2] leads to another thing which leads to 
another thing [0.4] which [0.8] causes you [0.2] to make [0.3] particular 
decisions [3.5] if you're interested in arable crops and [0.3] wheat [0.3] then 
[0.9] that [0.3] example and analysis is fine [1.0] but [0.2] you might like to 
consider [0.6] in particular if you're a horticulturalist [laugh] you might 
like to try and run through [0.5] a similar analysis [0.3] for apples [1.1] 
where the information is fairly easily available [0.9] or [0.2] some other [0.
4] er [0.2] culinary [0.3] crop [1.0] and there are quite interesting 
differences [0.4] if we're talking about a bulk [0.3] arable crop [0.4] or if 
we're talking about [0.4] something that is consumed [0.5] as a vegetable as a 
culinary crop [0.3] where quality considerations [0.2] become more important [0.
8] but i will come back to that in lecture three [2.6] so [1.0] i've given you 
an example [1.2] i don't want you to learn the example i 
want you to pull out [0.5] the general ideas [0.4] by reflecting on the example 
[0.8] 
sf0203: can i just [0.6] ask a question 
nm0191: do [0.3] yeah 
sf0203: you haven't mentioned it's like you mentioned Riband but that's 
nm0191: but i didn't say it was because it could be sold for biscuit in Spain 
[laughter] 
sf0203: well yeah and because the millers like Riband as well [0.3] 
nm0191: yes 
sf0203: it is [0.9] though there's also an 
nm0191: well [0.2] our millers don't like Riband [0.6] but 
sf0203: mm [0.3] but [0.7] but it's grown because they [0.2] 
nm0191: it [0.2] you can se-, you can sell it for export markets [0.3] 
sf0203: m-, 
nm0191: no i haven't [0.3] and that's the extra factor which comes in [0.3] if 
you start to analyse apples you can no longer leave that out [0.6] wheat is 
simpler to consider [1.0] it's easier to see the underlying principles [0.3] 
because [0.4] it is a bulk crop [0.7] and although increasingly it's [0.8] that 
that that is breaking down but [0.3] you can say you just want to buy some 
Canadian hard red wheat [0.8] and nobody worries what the variety is actually 
called [0.9] and it makes it easier to see what's going on [1.1] yeah [2.6] so 
what were the what are the [2.4] overall [0.8] er [2.8] what's been going on 
there what is a farmer doing [0.5] we've got we've had a number of things that 
i've supplied you with a-, [0.3] 
answers to [0.6] so [1.5] one question is [0.4] how much [0.7] disease [1.2] is 
[0.5] likely [1.8] okay [0.3] i put that in by saying [0.2] that losses were 
around five per cent [0.8] and there's a subsidiary question of [0.5] is [0.5] 
there [1.0] a [0.4] serious risk [2.7] of [0.7] a [0.2] lot [0.2] of disease [0.
8] in other words is there a serious risk of losing the crop [2.6] which you 
may want to in which case people may take measures [0.6] which [0.2] on average 
[1.0] costs them money [1.3] it's known as an insurance premium [1.0] okay [1.
2] insurance companies make a profit [1.7] therefore [1.2] on average [0.8] it 
must cost more [0.5] to insure something [1.3] than to just pay for the loss 
when it c-, occurs [2.6] the problem is that if it's your car or your house [2.
3] we don't have the capital [0.4] to buy a new one [0.9] so we opt for the 
option which is more expensive on average [0.2] which is to pay a small amount 
[0.3] to an insurance company [0.6] they take a slice [0.2] and then they pool 
the slices and people whose houses burn down [0.5] get a large sum of money [1.
0] so [0.9] i talked in the wheat [0.5] because [0.4] it's an 
example where [0.4] crop destruction is relatively unlikely [0.6] but this kind 
of serious risk could modify decisions there [0.4] so we need to know about 
both [2.0] and we need to know [2.6] what [0.3] will [0.5] the disease [2.0] do 
[0.5] to [1.4] yield [3.5] the reason i put yield [0.3] in quotation marks [1.
6] is because some diseases will mean that you don't get much off the land [1.
8] other diseases [0.2] will mean that you get the same amount as you would 
have had [0.5] but you can't sell it [2.1] there are lots of examples [0.3] in 
[0.4] horticulture [0.3] of diseases which are completely [0.2] the plant 
doesn't care about in the slightest [0.9] but the customer won't buy it [0.8] 
that's equivalent to a complete yield loss [0.9] so [0.5] when i say yield i 
suppose i'm meaning something like marketable yield [1.4] and then you've got 
[1.5] what [1.6] management [3.4] actions [3.0] will [1.0] alter [1.6] disease 
amounts [4.0] 
how much do they cost [6.9] and [1.5] how [0.3] reliable are they [1.4] now [0.
9] this is where [0.9] this course i hope where the emphasis of this course 
differs most [0.4] from what you may have had in introductory [0.4] pathology 
course [1.1] where [1.0] people tend to say oh well [0.3] you can control this 
disease by [0.8] and then there's a sort of list of things rotation chemistry 
whatever [2.1] some of those will be completely ineffective [0.2] for certain 
diseases [2.3] or in certain settings [1.0] so the question is [1.2] always [0.
5] what things can you do which will alter disease [0.3] if [0.3] you take 
great care to plant a clean crop [1.9] but the disease [0.4] comes from 
elsewhere [1.2] then [0.3] you won't alter the amount of disease [0.3] there's 
no point in spending huge amounts of money [0.4] on crop hygiene on [0.3] not 
planting infected seed [1.0] if the disease is going to come from somewhere 
else anyway [2.4] and [0.4] once you know something that will work you need to 
know how much it will cost [1.2] and you also need to know [0.9] will it always 
work [0.3] will it sometimes fail [3.2] and [0.2] 
the answers to those questions [0.3] are [0.7] put [0.8] in the context of [0.
9] managing a a growing business [0.4] a a farming business [0.2] or a 
horticultural business [0.7] which has two objectives [0.5] first is to stay in 
business [1.7] which is mainly about minimizing the risks of things going wrong 
[1.4] and then provided you can stay in business [1.6] most organizations 
attempt to maximize their profit [0.8] consistent with [0.9] certain social 
societal pressures [3.1] so [0.7] that all gets a bit big [0.2] what does a 
disease specialist need to do a disease specialist [0.4] needs to know the 
answers [0.6] to these questions [0.2] in the context [0.4] of their client [1.
5] er [0.6] it mean [0.2] they need to know [0.6] what management options are 
possible [0.8] what they will do [0.3] how they will interact [0.3] how they 
will interact in the system that they're looking at [2.4] and you've seen the 
example of wheat [0.2] identical crop [0.2] different places completely 
different decisions are appropriate [1.9] and [0.6] the rest of the course is 
really concerned with setting up a situation in which we understand [0.4] the 
answers [0.4] to these questions [5.8] 
i'd like to give you a short break now [0.4] er [0.5] i am going to start 
talking [1.2] at [4.3] twelve [1.4] gives you time to go to the loo and [1.2] 
okay i'm going to start talking at twelve [0.3] and i'll run for about another 
half hour [2.0] okay i suggest 
nm0191: okay [0.9] so [0.2] now [0.2] i'm going to try and answer the questions 
which i set out earlier [1.1] and the first one i'm going to tackle [0.7] er [0.
5] which is going to take me basically [0.6] er this lecture the rest of this 
lecture and the next one [0.8] is [0.4] what determines [0.3] how much disease 
[0.2] there is [0.3] in a crop [2.6] okay [6.3] and in particular [1.2] how [0.
9] does [1.0] it [0.3] change [2.9] and [0.4] increase [3.0] in time [1.8] what 
i'm not going to do yet [0.7] is to talk about how we actually measure [0.3] 
disease [1.0] i'm just going to assume [0.7] for now [1.1] that we can measure 
disease [0.2] that we can get a number [0.3] which corresponds to some notion 
of [0.3] how much disease [0.2] there is in the crop [2.3] and that that 
measurement of [0.3] how much disease there is in the crop [0.5] is in some way 
related to how much pathogen [0.6] there is in the crop [1.1] and [0.2] how 
fast it [0.4] and and its capacity [0.3] 
to [0.2] multiply [1.5] so i'm going to begin [0.5] by showing you [0.4] some 
examples [0.3] of [0.3] how [0.7] er [0.6] disease [0.4] builds up [0.3] in 
time [0.7] so i'm going to show you [0.4] er [1.8] actually a slightly more 
limited number than is on the back [0.8] er [1.3] of [1.0] disease [0.3] 
increase curves if you turn to the extreme back of the handout [2.1] okay [1.9] 
the first one i'm going to show you er [0.2] i'm sorry i had s-, we have [1.1] 
some problems [0.4] er which meant that i didn't have as long to look for the 
overhead [0.2] which turned out not to be in the place where i thought it was 
[0.3] this morning [0.5] as i should have had [0.2] so i haven't got the first 
overhead [1.5] the basic [0.5] point here [1.1] i'm talking about [1.2] a 
disease called Dutch elm disease [0.4] elms are large [0.2] forest trees [0.4] 
which used to be [0.3] one of the commonest trees [0.3] in the U-K [0.4] and 
across northern Europe [0.8] in the [0.3] nineteen-seventies [0.5] an epidemic 
[0.4] of [0.7] a disease called [0.8] Dutch elm disease [5.8] caused by a 
fungus [1.2] ophiostoma [3.1] novae- [1.8] ulmi [2.0] fungus disease [2.3] and 
[0.7] this increased on two different varieties [0.3] of [1.0] elm [0.3] two 
different species of elm [0.6] 
roughly [0.6] like that [0.6] small-leaved elm [1.2] carpinifolia [2.6] and [1.
2] what's known as the English elm [0.3] ulmus [0.7] procera [1.4] okay [0.3] 
an increasing curve [3.6] now i do have some overheads [5.7] here's [0.5] a 
curve [0.4] of [0.2] can you see this [0.9] this thing is always a 
sm0204: closer 
nm0191: a great [0.3] nuisance and [2.2] for the less pompous among us [1.8] er 
[0.3] this is [0.8] 
sf0205: can you just lift it a bit higher [0.7] 
nm0191: yes i can 
sm0206: [0.4] 
nm0191: it's all right [0.3] it's got something on the bottom which i'll 
explain i'll explain this bit later [1.0] okay [1.6] so [2.0] it's an [0.2] S- 
[0.2] shaped curve [1.4] very little disease very little disease very little 
disease very little disease [0.3] and then a very sharp and sudden increase [0.
6] this is a rust disease [0.2] yellow rust [0.5] of [0.4] barley [1.4] er [0.
8] so i [0.3] take it [0.7] you're all familiar with [0.3] rust diseases with 
[0.2] what a rust [1.1] is puccinia yep [1.8] yep [0.3] 
sf0207: yep [0.7] 
nm0191: yep good okay [0.9] er so it increases like that [3.3] then a very 
different one [1.2] er [2.3] so this is a disease of cocoa [4.0] in [0.2] West 
Africa [2.2] i should have drawn your attention to the time scale on this one 
[1.0] which is running [0.3] over forty days [1.4] from day one-sixty of the 
year [0.2] so 
that's mid-June [0.9] to [0.2] the end of July [3.3] whereas this [0.5] is 
running from nineteen-forty-four [0.2] to nineteen-fifty-two [1.5] so that's an 
eight year [0.3] run of data [1.2] and [0.2] you'll see that there's a general 
[0.5] S- [0.4] shaped curve [0.9] with most rapid increase [0.4] in the mid-
nineteen-forties [3.9] here's one from even earlier [2.0] this is [0.2] cotton 
[2.9] i should have said that [3.2] P- [1.1] omnivorum [1.7] on [0.7] cotton [3.
2] between [0.5] nineteen-thirty-seven and nineteen-forty-one [0.3] 
so this is [0.2] repeated crops [0.5] of cotton [0.4] planted each year [1.0] 
but planted [0.8] in the same general area [0.9] whereas [0.2] the cocoa 
swollen shoot [0.7] is a tree crop [0.4] those trees were all there at the 
beginning and they're all there at the end [2.7] and [0.3] you see [0.2] again 
[0.5] this [0.4] low level to begin with [0.4] and then a period of very rapid 
increase [2.4] and the final example [0.8] is [3.0] P-I- [0.3] two where's P-I-
one [4.7] where indeed is P-I [3.3] had it this morning [4.5] sorry this is [0.
2] classic [1.1] which i should not be doing at this stage [8.1] the final 
example [0.3] then [0.7] appears on your handout [1.1] over the page [2.8] at 
the bottom [0.5] and is potato blight [0.3] phytophthora infestans [0.3] on 
potato [3.7] showing [1.1] an increasing curve [0.8] over a time scale [0.7] of 
around [0.9] fifty days [0.7] reaching [0.6] about [0.4] fifty per cent [0.2] 
or nought-point-five [0.4] severity [1.8] oh here it is [0.6] sorry [2.1] put 
it out ready and then took the [0.2] board away [0.4] there you go [0.6] so [0.
4] that is a hundred per cent severity [2.3] that is 
fifty per cent severity [0.9] that's none [1.1] okay [0.6] so we have an [0.2] 
increasing curve going up fastest [0.2] at the end [8.2] now what i want to do 
[0.9] is [0.5] ask [0.5] is that what we expect [2.1] and not only is that what 
we expect [0.5] but how can we describe [0.4] these [0.3] different [0.5] 
curves [3.6] so [0.3] the arg-, the the method of of reasoning i'm going to use 
is one that you may not have come across too much in biology [0.4] it's to 
start from [0.8] some assumptions [2.5] use those assumptions to argue [1.2] 
for [0.3] what we would expect [0.4] to happen [0.4] in a crop [1.6] and then 
[0.2] compare our expectation [0.4] with reality [0.9] in order to find out how 
things are different [1.6] and as it happens [0.4] this reasoning process will 
also allow us to describe [0.4] all of these different situations [1.6] disease 
which increases over ten years [0.3] disease which increases over twenty days 
[0.7] by [0.3] one number [3.6] okay [1.4] so [2.9] imagine [0.7] a pathogen 
individual [1.3] in an otherwise healthy crop [2.2] so [0.7] er [0.7] i think 
i'll do this [0.9] on the board [6.9] so i'm 
going to draw a little [0.4] imaginary crop on the board [0.8] in green [1.0] 
here are my plants [13.8] okay [1.0] and [0.7] one of them [1.3] becomes [1.1] 
diseased [2.3] for some reason [4.2] now [0.2] this [1.3] disease this pathogen 
[0.2] must have some way of propagating itself [2.6] either spores [0.3] or [0.
3] vectors [0.3] if it's a virus [2.3] and let's suppose [0.6] so i'm talking 
an imaginary situation at the moment [0.5] imagine that [0.7] a week later [1.
1] its spores [0.5] have infected [1.4] two [0.5] other [0.3] individuals [2.8] 
so in the week one [5.5] in week [3.3] one [0.6] we had [0.6] one individual [1.
4] in week [0.2] two [0.5] we've got [0.3] three [2.5] and i'll just put in the 
new ones [0.3] which is two [1.0] one new one in week one two new ones in week 
two [0.6] now [2.9] all [0.2] of these [0.3] if [0.2] nothing changes [0.2] 
okay [0.5] i'm specifically trying to argue [0.4] if [0.2] nothing changes [2.
5] in week [0.2] three [2.8] these two [0.9] will each [0.4] infect [1.0] two 
more plants [1.3] on average [4.1] because if this one infected two plants over 
a period of week and nothing else changes [0.9] there's no reason [0.4] why [0.
5] these [0.3] won't infect two more plants [0.2] in another week [1.3] so in 
week three [0.2] we're going to have [0.8] er [2.2] if we assume it's probably 
simplest to make them die after the first week [1.5] though the sums come out 
the same [0.7] we'll have four [0.2] new [0.9] diseased individuals [3.2] okay 
[1.0] so what will happen in week four [1.4] each of the new diseased ones [0.
3] becomes infectious [0.2] is producing spores [1.6] so what number should i 
write here [4.6] 
sm0208: can you repeat that please [0.7] 
sf0209: yes [0.8] 
nm0191: okay [0.7] in week four [0.7] each of the four new infections [0.2] 
that occurred in week three [0.5] will become infectious [0.3] will start 
producing spores [0.4] 
sf0209: will contaminate another two [0.4] 
nm0191: so they will each contaminate another two [0.2] so what number goes 
here [0.5] 
sm0194: two-, twelve [0.5] 
sf0209: eight 
nm0191: eight 
ss: 
nm0191: exactly [0.9] yeah 
sm0194: [2.3] 
sf0209: [0.3] 
nm0191: population [0.2] sorry [0.4] 
sf0210: [2.6] 
sm0194: the infection [0.9] [1.3] 
nm0191: and then it says [0.2] new [1.5] er [2.3] okay [5.0] so [0.8] what we 
have here [1.5] is [0.3] an exponential [0.4] progression [5.9] so [1.7] what 
we'd expect [1.1] is that [1.1] if [0.4] nothing else [0.2] changed [1.2] 
disease [0.2] would grow [0.7] exponentially [0.8] it would go [0.8] 
on whatever time scale was appropriate [1.1] it would go [0.4] something like 
[0.2] one [8.5] it would go one [1.1] ah that's two that's where i've gone 
wrong [laughter] [0.4] knew there was something funny about this [3.5] two [1.
2] four [1.1] eight [3.3] sixteen [0.2] okay an exponential [0.2] increase [0.
5] 
sf0209: quite the imaginary though isn't it
nm0191: i-, [0.3] 
sf0209: even the if you don't use like er er if you don't like use fungicide i 
mean [0.8] then 
nm0191: even if you use fungicide [0.8] 
sf0209: 
nm0191: the effect will be [0.4] that instead of [0.4] each [0.3] diseased 
individual succeeding [0.4] in infecting [0.8] two more [0.7] each diseased 
individual [0.4] may only infect 
sf0209: one more
nm0191: half or one [1.0] that does not [0.2] alter [0.3] the argument [0.3] 
that it should be [0.5] an exponential [0.5] but bear with me [0.2] because i 
have pointed out that i'm trying to argue [0.3] what we would expect to happen 
[0.6] if [0.2] we didn't change anything [0.5] 
sf0209: 
nm0191: and it's worth [0.2] arguing that through [0.9] because otherwise [1.8] 
when you look at a [0.9] i maybe i should have [1.4] done it like this [2.0] if 
i put [0.4] this up [3.2] the farmer's [0.3] field [0.8] in 
mid-June [0.3] was free of disease [1.8] two weeks later it was nearly free of 
disease [1.2] three weeks later [0.2] it was completely devastated [1.0] the 
natural question to ask [2.3] is [0.4] what happened here [1.6] and [0.2] if 
you [0.2] go out [0.4] into the field and start looking for [0.3] funny weather 
conditions [0.9] in that [0.4] you're going to find them [1.0] if you look for 
an eclipse of the moon [0.2] you may find it [1.0] if you look for [0.8] er [2.
0] somebody who wal-, a black cat walked in front of me [0.4] you'll find it [0.
2] you will be able to find something strange [0.4] about [0.4] that period [1.
2] but the question is [1.1] did anything funny happen there [1.5] and that's 
why i'm trying to work out [0.3] not [1.3] because [1.1] the argument that 
something funny happens there [0.3] is actually based on an implicit assumption 
[2.9] if somebody thinks something funny happened here [2.2] they're saying [0.
3] well what i would have expected [0.5] is [1.2] that [2.2] i am saying [0.3] 
well let's just think about that [0.3] what would we expect [0.7] and so far [0.
6] i've established [0.4] that we would expect [0.3] exponential growth [0.2] 
initially [5.1] 
yeah [1.0] 
sm0194: sorry er so we have to determine which factors er er has er [0.4] an 
effect er to the rapid development of the disease [0.4] that case [0.8] 
nm0191: well [0.2] but what i'm arguing [0.3] is [0.2] that no let let me 
finish constructing [0.2] the 
sm0194: 
nm0191: no no no it's all right sorry you're getting the point [1.1] but [0.5] 
the point that's what you would [0.2] you would tend to say okay what factors 
cause the rapid increase [0.3] i'm saying [0.5] i don't yet know [0.2] whether 
there is a rapid increase i don't yet know [0.3] whether anything changed [0.3] 
because i don't know [0.4] what to expect [0.4] from [0.2] a disease [0.5] what 
would i expect disease progression in a field where nothing changed [0.3] to be 
like [1.7] okay [0.3] we are very used to the idea [0.4] that [0.6] if nothing 
happens [0.9] things stay as they are [2.2] but [0.2] when you learned physics 
in school [1.6] and we're also used to the idea [1.8] that if you drop 
something [0.6] it'll fall [0.7] but when you learned physics in school [0.7] 
you did a lot of thought experiments [0.6] in which [0.5] the teacher said 
contrary to all [0.4] everything you knew [0.5] that if no 
force acted on an object [0.9] it would stay where it was [1.7] yeah [0.9] and 
they said [0.9] so if you were out in space and not on Earth [0.2] and you let 
go of the pencil [0.6] it would just [0.5] stay where it is [1.6] it doesn't 
stay whether it is therefore okay so there's a whole lot of thought experiments 
going on in the background [0.3] if you were out in space and let the pencil go 
[0.4] what would happen to it [0.7] the answer is nothing [0.4] therefore [0.7] 
there must be something acting [0.3] to make it fall [0.5] i want to do the 
same kind of thing [0.3] i want to construct [0.3] a rational expectation [0.3] 
of what would happen in a field [1.3] which we can then use [0.3] to compare [0.
2] against what we actually see [2.0] 
okay [2.0] and so far i've shown [0.4] that [1.2] i've got [1.4] what i would 
expect [0.4] is that [0.3] the log [1.6] of the population [3.5] will [0.6] 
increase in a straight line [1.1] initially [1.6] because i have [0.2] 
exponential growth [3.3] but [0.4] of course [0.3] once disease [0.3] is [0.4] 
really common [3.9] lots of these spores [0.9] will start to fall [0.5] on 
tissue [0.2] which is already infected [3.4] yeah [0.5] is that [1.1] and [0.4] 
one way to see what effect [0.4] we would expect that to have [0.8] is to say 
okay imagine a field which is half infected [0.7] half diseased [1.7] the 
diseased material produces spores [0.4] or vectors [0.7] which fall randomly 
all over the field [4.0] half of those [0.2] will therefore fall on infected 
material [2.4] and won't [0.2] produce any new disease [2.8] so the rate of 
increase of the disease [0.9] will [1.1] decrease [0.6] in proportion [1.7] to 
the diseased [0.4] fraction [0.2] of the field [2.7] as disease becomes [2.4] 
if it's increasing exponentially [3.3] as [0.3] it becomes commoner [0.9] the 
rate of that exponential will fall off [0.5] until [0.3] when almost the whole 
field is infected [0.5] almost no spores will be able to cause any new disease 
[0.2] because they can't find a host [2.2] so the shape we expect is something 
that starts off exponential [0.6] and then [0.3] turns over [2.3] and [1.1] a 
little mathematics [1.4] which might be a dangerous thing but a little 
mathematics [1.1] shows [0.6] that [5.8] the [0.7] logarithm [1.8] of the 
healthy fraction [1.1] of the diseased fraction over the healthy fraction [1.3] 
increases [0.2] smoothly [0.3] with [0.3] time [1.0] that's [0.3] equation one 
on your handout [10.3] so [2.9] if [2.7] nothing changes [5.6] in [0.5] the [0.
6] host- [1.7] pathogen [3.2] relation [3.7] and [1.0] if [0.7] spores [0.9] or 
vectors [1.6] are evenly [1.8] distributed [3.6] over the whole area [1.0] we 
expect [2.7] the logarithm [1.7] of the [0.5] diseased [2.0] fraction [3.3] 
over the healthy [2.0] fraction [3.9] to increase [2.6] steadily [3.0] with [1.
6] time [1.4] okay [0.5] and that's written out in mathematical symbols [0.5] 
as [0.2] equation one [2.9] and this thing here [3.7] has a name [0.3] because 
we use it quite commonly [1.9] it's called [0.6] the logit [1.4] not the log [0.
4] but the logit [0.8] of [0.7] the [0.7] diseased [2.1] fraction [3.8] okay [1.
9] now [1.3] what i've done there [0.3] is just [0.3] argue [5.6] informally [0.
3] and then [0.6] if you wish [0.2] you can see what the formal mathematical 
argument is [1.6] what [0.6] should happen [0.7] if [0.2] certain conditions 
hold [4.7] now [2.7] 
here [1.1] is the yellow rust case [2.8] here's the original data [1.9] and 
here it is [0.4] replotted [1.0] on [0.5] a new scale in which [0.2] this is [0.
3] logit [0.4] of [0.5] disease [11.7] okay [1.3] it doesn't matter what the 
actual numbers work out at to er work out at [0.7] the important point is [0.8] 
that it's a straight line [1.7] 
sm0193: and where [0.2] course there is er [0.4] half of the field [0.4] filled 
with disease [0.3] 
nm0191: no no no no [0.3] sorry that was a [0.3] that was the [0.2] easiest 
case to see [1.1] here [0.2] there is a very small proportion of the field 
filled with the disease [1.0] here ninety per cent of it is filled with the 
disease and [0.4] just there [laugh] [0.2] only on that one occasion is half 
filled with disease [0.8] 
sm0193: yeah i thought about er [0.2] the log [0.2] of [0.2] disease fraction 
of [0.4] 
nm0191: divided by the healthy [0.2] 
sm0193: yes [0.4] then it's one to one and
nm0191: no [0.6] if the diseased fraction is [0.4] let's do some examples [2.3] 
if the diseased fraction [1.1] is nought-point-one [2.6] then this thing [0.6] 
is [0.3] log [0.8] of nought-point-one [0.6] divided by [0.2] nought-point-nine 
[1.3] 
sm0193: no i thought about [0.2] er [0.4] if half of [0.2] the field is 
nm0191: yes [0.6] 
sm0193: diseased
nm0191: yes [0.2] 
sm0193: then we have [0.3] O-point-five [0.8] 
nm0191: yes 
sm0193: diseased fraction [0.3] 
nm0191: yes 
sm0193: and O-point-f O-point-five healthy fraction 
nm0191: yes [0.5] yes [0.2] 
sm0193: then we get a log of one [0.7] 
nm0191: then we get the 
logarithm of one [0.2] 
sm0193: yes 
nm0191: which is zero [0.2] 
sm0193: yes and i ask if there is [1.1] 
nm0191: there it is 
sm0193: yes [1.1] 
nm0191: so that corresponds to that 
sm0193: yes 
nm0191: yes sorry i [0.3] i thought you were asking a different question [0.2] 
i beg your pardon [2.5] okay [1.1] so this is [0.3] this data replotted [0.7] 
and we see a straight line [1.6] okay it works for winter barley [0.8] if you 
look [0.3] at [0.2] the [0.6] er pictures at the back [1.7] you'll see [0.7] 
that it works [0.2] for [0.3] Dutch elm disease [2.6] and [1.1] if i take the 
cocoa swollen shoot example [1.6] show it in a slightly different way [1.9] 
there's our curve [0.3] running over a period [0.7] of eight years [3.5] if we 
[0.2] replot on a logit scale [0.7] but the same time scale [2.1] here's the 
blue line [0.6] corresponding to the blue axis [0.2] a logit scale [1.3] this 
bendy curve [1.1] is more or less a straight line [0.4] not [0.8] that point is 
a little bit off at the end [0.8] but basically over this period [0.6] it runs 
as a straight line [1.8] 
sm0194: sorry at the logit er axis er zero is the point that the half of the 
nm0191: yes 
sm0194: plants are infected 
nm0191: yes [0.6] that's right [0.4] 
sm0194: okay [5.3] 
nm0191: and it even works [0.3] for [1.1] the phymatotrichum case [2.0] er [0.
9] if i can get the [0.4] 
axes [0.2] to overlap [0.7] again the time scale stays the same [0.7] but [0.9] 
the [0.4] disease has been replotted on a logit scale [0.8] and [1.9] we have a 
straight line [0.4] for the first four points [0.3] and then [0.3] this one at 
the end [0.3] which is decreasing here [0.2] is quite obviously not on the 
curve [1.2] that actually corresponds then [0.7] here [0.3] is where something 
has happened [1.4] not the sharp increase [1.2] but at the end [0.2] something 
has happened [0.3] and what happened here of course was that [0.4] when they 
reached the situation with eighty per cent of the cotton [0.2] infected [0.4] 
they did something about it [1.4] wasn't a terribly effective action [1.0] but 
[0.8] it was perhaps even more effective than they realized [0.3] in that 
without that they'd have probably gone to ninety-five per cent [1.5] okay [1.2] 
so by [0.6] replotting the data you begin to see [0.3] what's happening [1.6] 
cocoa swollen shoot and the final one is [1.0] phytophthora [4.3] that's 
puccinia striiformis i th-, this [0.5] i seem to want to lose this one don't i 
[0.7] here it is [1.9] yep [1.0] potato blight [0.4] the great [0.2] classic 
plant disease [1.0] here we are [2.6] very different scale of 
epidemic [0.6] but [0.2] replotted on a logit scale [0.6] it's a straight line 
[9.7] and not only this [0.7] but [0.6] we've also now [0.4] got a way of 
describing these very diverse diseases [1.5] in a way which makes it possible 
to compare what is different about them [2.2] here's phytophthora infestans [1.
7] the [1.1] logit [0.3] rate of increase i'm sorry this isn't [0.4] terribly 
distinct [0.6] owing to [0.5] having got [4.2] and that says nought-point-six 
[0.7] okay [0.9] if we [0.4] go [0.4] from [1.6] there to there a span of fifty 
days [1.0] the [0.2] change in the logit amount of disease [0.5] is [0.4] minus-
two-point-five to nought-point-six [0.4] which is [0.2] three-point-one [0.9] 
over fifty days [0.3] so the slope [0.7] is [0.2] point-o-six-two [0.4] per day 
[3.4] if we compare that with the phymatotrichum [1.6] the slope [0.6] on this 
one [2.4] is an increase of five logits [0.4] over four years [0.6] sorry i was 
blocking that [0.3] an increase of five logits [0.9] over four years [0.8] so 
[0.5] the rate of increase [0.2] is [0.2] one-point-two-five [0.4] per year [3.
3] far far far slower than the potato blight [0.3] but just [0.5] the same 
pattern [3.7] if we look [0.2] at [1.2] the [1.5] cocoa swollen shoot
