nm0504: right [0.2] er [0.5] the subject this morning is an important one [0.2] 
er [0.6] i'm sure all lecturers tell you that [0.5] er acute renal failure [0.
6] er i'm timetabled to have two sessions [0.4] er [0.3] but er [0.2] unless 
you particularly want a break [0.5] i was thinking of just merging it into one 
[0.7] er [0.4] see if you can concentrate for an hour and a half [0.7] er acute 
renal failure [0.4] before we talk about acute renal failure [0.4] tell me what 
er [0.3] tell me what medicine's all about [2.1] what's medicine all about [3.
1] what's the point of being a doctor [1.4] remember if you don't [0.3] answer 
and [0.2] i start picking on people [0.2] 
sm0505: relief of symptoms [0.4] 
nm0504: relief of symptoms yeah [0.2] yep [0.3] anybody else [2.4] lady yawning 
here [1.0] what's medicine all about 
sf0506: that's a vague question [0.2] 
nm0504: it is it is in fact [laughter] very good in fact it's a vague question 
[0.5] all right [0.3] what i would say that er medicine is about biscuits [0.4] 
er [0.4] why is 
medicine about biscuits [3.8] what happens when you make people better [2.9] 
are they happy or sad [1.6] speak up [0.8] 
sm0507: happy [0.3] 
nm0504: happy 
sf0508: depends on their quality of life 
nm0504: sorry [0.8] 
sf0508: depends on their quality of life 
nm0504: depends on their quali-, that's a that's a good answer to do with their 
quality of life isn't it i mean a m-, [0.4] you know if they [0.3] tried to die 
of an overdose [0.5] and you saved them [0.4] they may not be very happy with 
you er i was on medical yesterday and [0.5] er [0.9] eight o'clock and get the 
violins out now violas whatever you like [0.3] i was at the namex Hospital 
trying to save the life of a [0.2] an eighty-two year old man [0.3] who came in 
with a G-I bleed [0.5] er aspiration pneumonia [0.3] and was dying [0.2] 
basically [0.3] and he'd probably taken an overdose which is very sad at eighty-
two [0.4] and er [0.2] i think he'd almost [cough] dead by this morning [0.4] 
but er partly 'cause we allowed him to die [0.5] and er [1.1] that is quite sad 
actually you know 
why do eighty-two year olds take overdoses his wife said there were financial 
problems the business had gone bankrupt [0.4] and you know i'm sure if he goes 
to I-T-U [0.5] and [0.7] stays there for a couple of weeks and survives he 
won't be very happy with us [0.2] because er i'm pretty sure he wanted to die 
he [0.3] he took er an overdose three years ago [0.5] and i don't know why i'm 
telling you this [0.3] but biscuits yeah [0.2] so if you make people better [0.
6] they buy you biscuits [0.4] and that's why i brought some along this morning 
just to er remind you what medicine was all about in my opinion it's about [0.
4] biscuits [0.4] er biscuits because [0.2] people are generally happy when 
they make you better [0.9] er very important when you're looking after a 
patient to specify what type of biscuits you want [0.5] otherwise you just get 
bog standard old rubbish from [0.4] s-, [0.4] ASDA or somewhere like that 
[laughter] so you must specify at the start when you go and see exactly what 
biscuits you want [0.5] Marks and Spencer's [0.2] every time [0.5] [laughter] 
okay [0.2] so er [0.9] it's not just about biscuits though er [0.3] it's 
actually quite good [0.4] making people 
better and er [0.3] you're wondering what on earth this has got to do with 
acute renal failure well i'm [0.2] getting round to it in my long and 
convoluted way [0.5] er [0.4] making people better is good [0.2] er [0.6] i've 
been doing it for nearly twenty years and it still gives me a buzz when you [0.
4] leave the hospital at like [0.3] eight ten o'clock [0.3] whenever you leave 
the hospital [0.4] er [0.3] you do know it's not a nine to five job don't you 
[0.4] you do know that you are aware of that [0.5] [laughter] and er [0.5] just 
to get that imprinted in your brains at an early stage [0.3] and er your 
careers will not progress [0.7] if you consider it a nine to five job [0.7] er 
[0.9] don't think that has changed either [0.4] but when you leave the hospital 
at eight ten o'clock at night and [0.6] a patient or [0.4] more often the 
relative of a patient grabs your hand [0.3] and says thank you doctor you saved 
[0.3] my life or my husband's life or my wife's life [0.4] that still gives you 
a kick even twenty years later [0.5] and er [0.7] one of the ways in which 
kidney doctors get a 
kick [0.6] is [0.5] the handshake when you've [0.3] got somebody through acute 
renal failure [0.6] er [0.8] i think it's possibly because [0.6] from the 
patient's perspective acute renal failure's a bit like a dream [0.4] and er 
they know they're ill they don't know how ill they are [0.2] they usually 
nearly meet their maker [0.4] er [0.3] and if they get better [0.2] they don't 
quite know what's happened but they know something very bad has happened and in 
fact most [0.2] body systems failure [0.5] patients don't remember they're that 
ill whether it's respiratory failure cardiac failure or renal failure [0.4] 
obviously my specialty's kidneys [0.5] acute renal failure [0.4] er like most 
failures is very bad for you [0.4] er [0.7] it's probably got a near hundred 
per cent mortality if you do nothing [0.9] and you'll notice on on the handout 
have you all got a handout [2.0] there is a handout [0.3] anybody [0.3] put 
your hands up if you haven't got a handout okay [0.6] you'll see [0.2] er fact 
number one at the top of your handout is kidney failure's very bad for you [0.
5] er [0.3] even in two-thousand-and-three 
fifty per cent of people died [0.4] er [0.3] and that hasn't really improved 
since the nineteen-sixties [1.5] so [0.7] hundred per cent or nearly hundred 
per cent die if you do nothing fifty per cent die if you do something so 
there's not a great strike rate [0.4] er there aren't too many handshakes and 
there aren't that many biscuits but you must specify on your biscuits [0.7] er 
[1.4] just let's talk a little bit [0.3] er about [0.3] a few words and and the 
word failure [0.6] er [0.5] traditionally in in talks such as this you don't 
start with outcomes you start with definitions and [0.3] standard things like 
that but i thought [0.9] the outcome of acute renal failure is so bad i thought 
you'd better know it is so bad [0.5] because a lot of people [0.2] think oh 
it's all right have a bit of dialysis they all get better [0.2] and that that 
really isn't true even with dialysis the [0.5] mortality's fifty per cent [0.4] 
so the word failure let's have the lady in pink at the back there [0.6] tell me 
about the the word failure and what do you think the patients [0.2] what's your 
[0.6] me-, [0.2] what's your understanding of the word and and what do you 
think the patient's perception is [0.4] 
sf0510: that it's not working any more [0.3] 
nm0504: yeah [0.2] and [0.2] how much is it not working [0.6] 
sf0510: quite a bit [0.4] 
nm0504: quite a bit [0.3] and patients normally perceive the word failure to 
mean complete failure [0.3] you know [0.2] if you say your car has failed that 
means it doesn't drive [0.7] or [0.2] the [0.2] washing machine has failed it 
means it doesn't work and you can't put your clothes in the washer any more [0.
3] and if you use the word failure [0.5] and if you think about it i think 
you've probably already started to use the word failure has anybody [0.5] seen 
a patient yet and those that the F word come out has anybody said [0.3] heart 
failure [0.5] congestive cardiac failure [0.3] and ha-, has anybody said that 
in front of a patient [0.7] lady in pink nodding there anybody else [0.3] said 
the word failure [0.5] with a patient around them [2.0] read in the notes said 
oh i 
see you've got heart failure oh bloody hell [1.2] bit of nodding okay [0.5] er 
[1.7] i'd avoid the word failure i think that's what i [0.2] i'm getting at in 
my long and convoluted way [0.5] it implies absolute failure [0.6] okay if 
there is absolute failure use it [0.3] but if there isn't absolute failure [0.
2] don't use it [0.5] diabetes is not absolute failure of the [0.3] pancreas 
and we don't call it pancreatic failure [0.4] it's partial pancreatic failure 
[0.4] if you think about it if you have complete failure of any major [0.2] 
body system you're dead [0.7] you can't live very long with complete liver 
failure complete heart failure complete pancreas failure complete et cetera et 
cetera [0.4] and k-, the kidneys are no different [0.7] and [0.3] absolute 
complete [0.3] anuric [0.2] zero [0.8] kidney failure [0.3] is almost unheard 
of [0.7] now [0.2] i say almost unheard of because as you know i'm sure you've 
heard this [0.4] old maxim by now [0.2] always and never [0.2] are words a good 
doctor never uses [0.2] ha ha [0.4] er but that there is some truth to that [0.
2] there is no always and never in medicine there's no always and never [0.2] 
in nature 
there's no always and never in life these are [0.2] not words [0.3] that we are 
familiar with in medicine and if you find yourself using them you probably 
don't understand what you're talking about [0.9] er [0.8] so try to avu-, [0.2] 
avoid the word failure so lady in the pink doing well [0.2] so if you're not 
going to talk about failure to a patient what what can you say [0.6] 
sf0510: impairment [0.4] 
nm0504: impairment [2.1] Guardian all right [0.6] 
sm0511: dysfunction [0.3] 
nm0504: dysfunction ooh yeah [0.2] New Scientist [0.4] bit [0.3] no [1.3] 
[laughter] you know [0.4] man on a [0.6] on the bus you know [0.3] they don't 
understand dysfunction [1.2] dysfunctional families but but er [0.9] what's 
what's another way of talking to a patient a-, about [0.8] a bit of them that 
doesn't work [0.7] what l-, what language can we use [0.3] gentleman there [1.
0] 
sm0512: 
can you explain that it isn't working [0.2] as well as it could be 
nm0504: mm [0.6] just use simple words it's not working as well as it could be 
okay [0.7] er [0.8] you can give a percentage if you like and it's made up [0.
2] seventy-five per cent [0.3] dysfunction [0.6] but er [0.5] what's the 
problem with percentages [0.7] lady here [0.5] 
sf0513: [0.7] 
nm0504: they're not [0.2] that accurate i mean they're but we we made up some 
of the numbers i mean [0.6] deeper level they don't exist but [1.5] what else 
is wrong with percentages [1.1] i mean we talk in percentages all the time 
don't we [1.3] 
sf0514: they don't mean much to patients 
nm0504: they don't mean much to the patient why don't they mean much to the 
patient 
sf0514: it's giving 
nm0504: yeah exactly [0.3] and you know most of the older generation i don't 
know what that is [0.3] don't understand percentages what do they what do they 
understand [1.0] 
sm0515: fractions 
nm0504: fractions yeah [0.2] try to talk in fractions if you want to talk in 
numbers you know [1.6] or talk [0.3] 
what's another way of expressing a fraction in in common language [3.7] you're 
obviously a very clean-living lot never put a bet on [1.0] 
ss: odds 
nm0504: odds yeah [0.2] two to one three to one [0.3] and that's the type of 
language people understand [0.4] they don't [0.2] okay you understand 
percentages and you can expect an educated person of your age [0.2] but a less 
educated person of your age won't understand percentages [0.2] they understand 
football league tables [0.3] and they understand [0.4] fractions and they 
understand odds but they don't necessarily understand percentages [0.8] er [0.
2] so be careful if you talk about dysfunction and seventy-three per cent 
dysfunction [0.3] doesn't mean r-, mean very much to most patients [1.1] now [0.
5] the reason i'm [0.3] emphasizing this point [0.3] er i-, is that you can 
cause a lot of [0.3] mental pain [0.2] just by talking about failure and 
talking about percentages and and you know they don't understand it [0.4] er [0.
7] and then you've got to be careful [0.2] so [0.7] as the 
gentleman said there no [0.2] you know your kidneys don't work and they'll say 
well how bad are they and you can say well [0.6] very bad or [0.3] bad or quite 
bad use words they understand [0.2] if they want some data [0.2] try and give 
it to them in language they'll understand [0.2] and it may be that if they're a 
[0.5] University of namex [0.4] professor of economics you can say seventy-four 
per cent function or dysfunction or whatever [0.7] er [0.6] what's the other 
problem with the word failure apart from the fact that they [0.2] assume that 
means complete failure [4.6] when a thing has failed completely [0.3] it may 
not 
sm0516: work again [0.2] 
nm0504: work again okay [0.3] so it always implies that but [0.2] but we know 
[0.3] many body systems can recover the liver is a classic organ that recovers 
of its own accord i wish the kidney did [0.5] but [0.3] er so [0.6] when a 
patient's in heart failure it may not be permanent heart they may just had an M-
I last night [0.5] a tachyarrhythmia and they may be fine by the morning with a 
bit of frusemide and a bit of digoxin so [0.3] it also implies 
that [0.6] you could never going to work again [0.5] and when somebody's 
fighting for their life [0.3] you mustn't r-, remove all hope from them because 
[0.3] it's hope that's keeping them alive [0.3] so if somebody's had an M-I and 
they've gone into heart failure and they're panting away and feeling awful and 
sweating and everything [0.5] and they're about to have an arrest and you're 
going to shock them and then they'll come back [0.4] but at that point they 
don't know that's going to happen [0.5] and if you say to them [0.4] i'm 
terribly sorry Mr Jenkins you've got complete heart failure [0.6] er [0.7] 
they'll think bloody hell [0.3] bloody hell f-, that's bad isn't it and my 
heart doesn't work [0.8] it's never going to get better [0.2] so i might as 
well pop my clogs [0.4] and [0.3] you you must never remove a patient's hope 
and in the acute situation [0.3] language is important [1.5] okay [0.6] so i 
don't have er a word or a phrase for you invent your own one you know [0.2] 
talk in language [0.3] the patients understand [0.6] and [0.2] hopefully that 
that you 
understand [0.5] okay [0.5] so [0.5] we haven't got very far we're still on 
point [0.4] point one outcome [0.8] with drugs drugs drugs drugs drugs you'll 
notice that a theme of this talk is going to be drugs [0.3] er drugs are very 
important [0.4] both recreational and non-recreational [0.6] er [0.3] drugs are 
very important in terms of renal disease because they are a cause in part of [0.
2] up to thirty per cent of people [0.3] with acute renal failure [1.5] and 
rather worryingly er this is a little maxim that er an intensivist taught me 
when i was at an S-R at at King's in London [0.6] if you're on I-T-U and you're 
on a ventilator and your kidneys go down [0.8] you have eighty per cent 
mortality you're on a very low chance of leaving that I-T-U [0.2] if you 
develop one more body system failure up you're up to ninety [0.2] one more [0.
3] and you're bust a hundred per cent mortality [0.6] so having kidney failure 
on an I-T-U is a very very bad sign [1.5] er we don't quite know why there's 
been a lot of research in the last few years of of of why [0.5] kidney failure 
on in the I-T-U 
setting is such high mortality [0.2] and it may be very simple you know if 
you've been smashed to bits in a road traffic accident you've got five 
fractures and a ruptured spleen your head's come off and [0.3] you've got no 
arms [0.3] you know the [0.5] i-, [0.2] it is bad for you it's bad for the 
health to be involved in that road traffic accident but [0.5] but [0.4] we 
don't really know why you read in whatever you read in these is such a bad 
thing [0.8] but that's quite a useful maxim if you ever go on to an I-T-U and 
you're trying to [0.4] er [0.2] talk to a patient or [0.2] probably not to the 
patient but talk to the family about [0.4] are they going to live doc [0.4] and 
and i start adding up the failures in my head when i start talking about [1.1] 
little chance of survival but there is s-, some hope [0.6] or [0.4] a [0.2] 
small chance of survival and if they ask what the percentages are i'll give it 
to them [1.5] okay [0.4] so def-, definitions definitions i think you know by 
now i'm not very keen on definitions and most 
things are [0.3] indefinable [0.5] er [1.1] and [0.8] before you read the 
definition on that handout [1.4] what would you have guessed [0.3] might have 
been in the er gentleman on the end there [1.3] what might you have guessed [0.
6] er as the definition of acute renal failure [1.1] 
sm0517: er an inability for the kidney to function [0.5] 
nm0504: yeah i mean that's probably [0.2] as good as any [0.4] er [0.4] i'm 
sure you might want to slip the creatinine into your definition wouldn't you [0.
2] 
sm0517: yeah [0.4] 
nm0504: you probably would [0.5] er [0.9] don't [0.5] is the go home message er 
[0.8] the creatinine and the urine output have nothing to do with the desh-, 
definition of of acute renal failure certainly when i was a student i [0.3] i 
always was pestering them okay well what was bad you know what what's normal 
what's bad and what's failure [0.5] er [0.8] there's no such thing because 
remember as i talked about before how we get normal ranges [0.4] you know we [0.
3] measure creatinine in a lot of 
people and we stick everybody [0.2] within two standard deviations the mean 
within that normal range [0.2] so perfectly normal people [0.2] have a 
creatinine of a hundred-and-thirty remember the magic number up up to a hundred-
and-twenty [0.3] it's just voodoo [0.4] hundred-and-twenty creatinine hundred-
and-twenty [0.4] er G-F-R [0.3] it's the only number you need to remember to be 
a kidney doctor or know anything about the kidney [0.3] and [0.3] that voodoo 
is not there in the States and other countries where they use other units but 
it the voodoo is there the hundred-and-twenty number [0.6] so [0.2] it is 
almost impossible to define [0.9] because [0.2] people's baseline creatinine [0.
5] is variable and what does the creatinine your baseline creatinine depend on 
[0.6] 
sm0518: er [0.4] the muscle bulk 
nm0504: yeah your muscle bulk mainly your muscle bulk so age sex [0.3] mass [0.
3] muscle bulk use of muscles [0.5] so i'm sure Jonah Lomu before he got kidney 
failure had a normal creatinine of a hundred-and-thirty [0.4] and that could 
either have been a hundred-and-thirty because it's [0.7] within statistical 
error or it could 
be genuinely a hundred-and-thirty [0.3] because [0.2] he's a big bloke and has 
big muscles how on earth he plays [0.4] top class rugby i've got no idea on 
dialysis [0.5] but he does seem to [0.7] er [0.7] so [0.4] it's very difficult 
to define according to a certain number and it's more important [0.9] whatever 
your baseline is and movement from the baseline that if if you want a number [0.
3] i've copied a definition out of a book there [0.2] for those of you who who 
cannot leave this room without some form of number in their head [0.5] er [0.2] 
a recent [0.5] rise [0.3] of fifty micromoles per litre of creatinine [0.4] er 
if the baseline is less than three-hundred over hundred it's over over three-
hundred [0.5] you can learn that if you like i took it out of a book [0.2] i'd 
forget it [0.4] just [0.4] remember that it's indefinable and movement away 
from the baseline is the important thing [0.8] why does [0.2] oliguria [0.2] 
let's have this gentleman here why does that play no part in 
the definition of of acute renal failure [1.6] 
sm0519: er [2.7] well you [1.4] well [0.5] i don't know er [1.2] well you you 
hope that your kidneys are [0.5] er [0.6] filtrating [1.1] 
nm0504: yeah okay you're getting there so [0.8] how do you know [0.2] that that 
nice glass of red wine there [0.5] is a good glass of wine [0.9] 
sm0518: er [0.4] the colour and er [0.5] the smell 
nm0504: and what do you need to do [0.2] 
sm0518: taste it [0.2] 
nm0504: you need to taste it don't you [0.2] it may look all right [0.3] and 
urine may look all right i'm not advocating you drink urine [0.3] [laughter] 
but but you [0.3] but you've got to taste it haven't you [0.4] and and [0.5] 
what urine is like wine it's all about quality [0.3] and so you could be 
passing ten litres a day and if it's it's of low quality if it's not getting 
rid of urea creatinine phosphate potassium all the rest of it [0.3] then it's 
not good urine so [0.2] you have to know what's in it [0.3] and that's why 
oliguria and there are plenty of people with non-oliguric [0.3] or even 
polyuric acute renal failure [1.5] okay [0.6] er so we're saying it's 
indefinable we're saying [0.3] that er [0.7] movement from the baseline is 
important but that does mean that a little old lady [0.8] with no muscle bulk 
[0.2] if we're taking the normal range [0.5] to be sixty [0.2] a hundred-and-
twenty for example [0.2] a little old lady may have [0.4] a creatinine of 
baseline creatinine of forty partly out of statistical error or partly because 
she genuinely does [0.4] because she's a little old lady who doesn't have very 
big muscles and doesn't use them [0.9] er [0.6] and that's why it's always 
important to look back through the notes if [0.2] the patient's [0.5] had 
bloods done [0.2] ten years ago twenty years ago [0.4] er then seek them out in 
the notes they won't be on the computer system [1.7] right epidemiology we 
mentioned a lot about epidemiology er [1.8] if you want to make yourself famous 
do a PhD on epidemiology of acute renal failure nobody's ever done one [0.2] 
er [0.4] i think it's the only major body system failure where nobody's ever 
looked into it in an-, any great detail i don't know why [0.4] er [0.4] perhaps 
because it's a relatively rare diagnosis [0.4] actually it isn't that rare [0.
4] about thirty per cent of people entering hospital [0.2] on a medical or 
surgical take have a raised creatinine i'm not saying they've got kidney 
failure [0.5] they may have renal impairment for a period of time [0.3] before 
you give them normal and before the creatinine is normal and it fails [0.3] and 
a raised creatinine on admission to hospital is extremely common [0.6] and 
surgeons don't ring us every time [0.6] somebody has a raised somebody has a 
raised creatinine level they'd be ringing us all day long every day [0.8] [0.2] 
they note the creatinine's really abnormal on the first day they give the 
patient fluids [0.3] give the creatinine the next day and if it's come down 
fine if it's not come down give us a ring although they should give us a ring 
[1.2] so we know very little about the epidemiology of acute renal failure er 
i've listed some 
risk factors there and if you look down those risk factors they're the sort of 
standard risk factors that [0.2] you know [0.3] of anything really aren't they 
diabetes old you know pre-existing failure [0.6] er [1.0] and [0.4] the the one 
theme that comes through those risk factors i think is atheroma [0.4] w-, why 
why is it atheroma's important [0.5] let's have this lady here [0.6] why do you 
think atheroma's important [0.7] 
sf0520: er [1.2] in acute renal failure 
nm0504: yeah or predisposing to acute renal failure [1.2] 
sf0520: well [0.2] blood flowing into the kidney is going to be hindered [0.3] 
nm0504: yeah very good so you know [0.2] if somebody has [0.2] pre-existing 
renal vascular disease [0.4] then they may already have partial blood flow to 
the kidney and then [0.2] if another event happens if another insult happens 
they're more likely to get acute renal failure [0.6] er [0.3] and there are 
some worrying 
statistics i've put down for you there [0.4] er there have been studies done of 
[0.4] angiography [0.3] both of [0.2] angiography of the legs [0.2] and 
angiography of the heart [0.5] and if you look hard enough if you do a cardiac 
angiogram or a leg angiogram [0.3] for no kidney reason [0.4] and you happen to 
squirt some dye down the kidneys [0.2] about fifty per cent of people will have 
[0.2] radiologically significant renal vascular disease [0.4] so er and not 
know it they may have a normal creatinine [1.3] er but it is there [0.2] and so 
most of the patients out there in the ether [0.2] the type of patient you're 
looking after are sitters [0.3] for [0.2] acute renal failure or more commonly 
acute onchronic renal failure [0.3] which is sometimes [0.3] er written as A- 
[0.4] C-R-F rather than A-R-F [1.8] okay [0.3] er trauma [0.2] why does trauma 
cause kidney failure let's have the gentleman right at the back there [0.4] why 
does trauma [1.0] 
sm0521: er [0.8] direct damage to the blood vessels 
nm0504: 
er [0.2] yeah no good point actually yeah possibly [0.3] er i mean yeah if if 
you avulse your [0.4] er [0.5] renovascular bed [0.4] then that's not very good 
for you and that can happen [0.2] it's quite hard to damage the kidneys as you 
know they're behind the ribs there [0.4] and you have to really try hard to [0.
4] damage somebody's kidneys [0.3] they are sometimes damaged in road traffic 
accidents but not very commonly 'cause they're at the back [0.3] you're more 
likely to cause trauma to the front [1.0] er [0.6] you know some violent sports 
you're get punched or kicked or [0.9] baseball batted in the in in the kidneys 
[0.4] but er apart apart from that any any any other ways in which trauma can 
cause [0.5] acute renal failure [0.3] 
sm0522: 
nm0504: speak up anybody else 
sm0523: 
sf0524: [0.3] 
nm0504: er yeah good yeah yeah yeah yeah [0.6] 
sm0525: [0.5] 
nm0504: 
yeah very good rhabdomyolysis [0.4] er [0.3] and [0.2] er [0.2] the study of 
acute renal failure in war has led us to [0.3] er a much [0.5] greater 
understanding of the pathophysiology we still don't understand it [0.4] but a 
lot of important research came out of the Vietnam War [0.3] er in terms of 
acute renal failure [0.4] and there's nothing like a good war to improve [0.3] 
doctors' understanding of disease [0.6] er [0.8] and rhabdomyolysis [0.3] which 
can come on secondary to any form of of muscle trauma [0.5] er whether it be [0.
2] spontaneous muscle trauma alcoholics [0.2] for example drugs can 
spontaneously [0.3] develop what's called compartment syndrome [0.4] and [0.6] 
from that develop rhabdomyolysis and that go acute renal failure or you can non-
spontaneously you know [0.3] a bus hits you [0.2] you played rugby et cetera et 
cetera [0.3] and you damage your muscles in some way [1.2] er [2.2] pregnancy 
pregnancy [sigh] [0.8] the only interesting thing in from my perspective about 
pregnancy is the fact that they [0.5] get kidney failure [0.3] er [2.3] when do 
they get 
kidney failure why [1.0] gentleman there on the right [0.5] when do pregnant 
women get kidney failure [1.3] 
sm0526: er [0.6] during hypertension [0.6] 
nm0504: yeah yeah [0.3] d-, is it hypo or hyper [0.3] 
sm0526: hyper [0.3] 
nm0504: hyper yeah i mean [0.4] why do they get hypertensive [0.8] 
sm0526: it's a a complication of pregnancy 
nm0504: yeah [0.2] very good [laughter] okay [0.7] it is a complication of 
pregnancy [0.5] er [0.2] particularly [0.2] er the last trimester [0.3] er [0.
4] pre-eclampsia or eclampsia these are these are names we call for a specific 
syndrome which incorporates [0.5] kidney problems and hypertension [0.4] er [0.
3] bleeding [0.2] you know [0.3] ab-, ab-, you haven't done your obs and gynae 
yet have you [0.4] 
sm0527: no 
nm0504: no [0.7] you will [0.2] do obs and gynae you will go to deliveries it's 
very messy there's blood everywhere [0.4] er it's very exciting [0.3] yes i 
cried at my first delivery yes most of you will all those hard men [0.6] though 
you'll 
all cry too it is an amazing experience seeing a baby born [0.4] but er it's 
very bloody [0.8] er and there is blood loss even with a a normal delivery [0.
8] er [0.2] so there are a lot of reasons that a woman can go into acute renal 
failure [0.2] pre-eclampsia [0.2] eclampsia blood loss [0.3] but there's also a 
specific syndrome [0.4] er it goes by a variety of names [0.3] pregnancy-
related acute renal failure [0.4] there's a load of other names for it some 
people say it doesn't really exist and it's actually just [0.4] a variant of 
pre-eclampsia but there certainly [0.3] is a syndrome it can come on even after 
delivery [0.5] er of acute renal failure the aetiology of it is not really 
understood [0.3] it's something to do with pre-eclampsia it's something to do 
with [0.3] microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia it's something to do with low 
platelets it's something to do with kidney failure [0.4] and this triad [0.2] 
of haemolytic anaemia [0.3] acute renal failure low platelets [0.3] you'll see 
in many bits of medicine [0.2] er [0.4] dermatologists will [0.3] stand here 
and talk about scleroderma causing i-, an 
intensivist [0.2] D-I-C [0.3] a blood pressure doctor malignant hypertension a 
pregnancy doctor [0.4] er [0.6] pregnancy-related or [0.6] acute renal failure 
[0.2] HELP syndrome to a ler-, liver doctor [0.3] if you think about it these 
things are all the same [0.3] or they're [0.2] they're probably a final common 
pathway from from endothelial damage [1.2] fascinating subject [0.2] can't go 
into it today i'm afraid [0.7] er i hope somebody else will [1.3] okay er [0.2] 
so [0.8] there are certain patients that we know get kidney failure they're 
sitters for it [0.5] pregnant women [0.4] people who've had road traffic 
accidents trauma old people et cetera et cetera [1.7] it is however traditional 
to talk about the causes [0.4] of acute renal failure [0.8] and [0.3] er [1.1] 
i'm going to try to present this in a in a different way or hopefully a 
different way [0.2] but can you [0.2] could you read that at the back [0.7] my 
writing okay [0.5] er [6.7] tubes you remember [0.3] what i said the kidney was 
it's a tube [1.9] with [0.2] a sieve in the middle [1.7] and a way 
of [0.3] sending the blood back [0.4] er if you think about it [0.2] that's 
actually [0.2] also [0.5] what a liver is [0.2] and what a heart is what's a 
heart oh well it's a sort of a pump thing isn't it with a few chambers [0.4] 
and blood goes into it and blood comes out oh yeah [0.7] that's actually what a 
liver is isn't it but there's two [0.3] sources of blood and then blood comes 
out of it [0.5] they're all tubes i mean [0.2] there are embryological reasons 
why they're tubes they started off as tubes [0.6] er and they've become other 
things [0.8] and [3.2] rather than think of the kidney [0.2] in the traditional 
way of being [0.2] a kidney-shaped thing with blood going to it and from it [1.
0] and [0.5] i'd like to try [0.2] to change your mental image by [0.3] 
unravelling that in your head and thinking about it as a tube [1.6] having said 
that because i think then you'll understand [0.3] the physiology and the 
pathophysiology more [1.0] if you are going to 
think about the causes of acute renal failure sometimes [0.4] a good old-
fashioned diagram such as this is still useful [0.9] because traditionally we 
talk about the causes as being pre [0.5] as being renal [0.7] and being [0.2] 
post-renal [2.6] but equally [0.6] you could get rid of that [0.8] and draw a 
tube [1.5] and draw your sieve [0.4] and talk about prerenal renal and post-
renal [0.3] you could also get rid of that [1.9] and talk about a liver [1.0] 
not a very good liver [1.3] and talk about a tube as well [0.7] how [0.3] can 
the liver be extended to this analogy [0.5] in terms of liver failure [0.3] 
that lady at the front there [0.6] we're going to in a minute we're going to 
talk about kidney failure but let's just [0.3] go a bit left field [0.5] field 
[1.1] ho-, how can [0.2] the traditional way of 
describing [0.4] kidney failure be extended to another tube the liver [0.9] 
speak up [1.1] in other words [2.4] what three groups of causes of liver 
failure do you know [3.9] it's not a trick question [0.3] not a Dr namex trick 
one it's a simple question [0.8] so [0.3] the liver's a thing where there's two 
sources of blood to it there's one source away [2.4] on [2.9] 
sm0528: pre prehepatic hepatic and 
nm0504: yeah so we talk about it in the same way [0.6] so we talk so what's an 
example of a prehepatic cause of [1.7] liver failure [0.5] 
sm0529: haemolytic anaemia 
nm0504: haemolytic anaemia okay [0.4] hepatic [0.5] 
sf0530: hepatic [0.5] 
nm0504: speak up 
ss: [0.3] 
nm0504: cirrhosis did somebody say 
sm0531: yeah [0.3] 
nm0504: okay so there's something wrong with the liver itself [0.3] post-
hepatic [0.3] 
ss: 
nm0504: 
[0.3] okay [0.7] i mean yes it is a bit more complicated syndrome there are 
other ways of thinking about obstruction of the liver [0.4] but the analogy [0.
2] runs for a liver and it runs for a heart [0.3] and it runs for a kidney [1.
0] and [1.1] although the topic of today's talk is [1.1] kidneys so we'll go 
back to the kidney [0.6] er [0.6] and [0.5] the [0.3] classical way [0.3] and i 
think it's still useful [0.2] of dividing up the causes of kidney failure into 
[0.2] pre [0.4] renal and post-renal so [1.0] rather than take a big book and 
look at the lists of causes of [0.2] renal failure the lists of causes of liver 
failure [0.3] try to work it out conceptually in your head and you won't have 
to learn the lists [0.3] and also if if you find you've got to learn a list [0.
4] then you're going to forget it anyway the next day or you can just remember 
it for the exam so it's not a good way of learning learning lists [0.5] okay [0.
5] so i've listed there [0.5] three types [0.5] of 
prerenal failure [2.2] one [0.3] true volume depletion [0.8] two generalized 
ischaemia [0.5] three local ischaemia [1.7] so [1.2] i'm doing a bit too much 
talking [0.2] let's have the gentleman at the back there with the black top on 
on the right [0.4] tell me about [0.3] er volume depletion what do i mean by 
that and and what are some examples [1.1] 
sm0532: well [0.4] 
nm0504: speak up so we can hear [0.8] 
sm0532: it's just a depletion of the circulating [0.5] extra ex-, [0.2] 
circulating round 
nm0504: yeah okay and and and what can cause volume depletion [0.6] 
sm0532: cardiac failure [0.4] er sorry [0.5] cardiac heart failure 
nm0504: you speak up yeah 
sm0532: heart failure [0.2] 
nm0504: yeah yeah very good i mean har-, i'm glad you said that i mean [0.3] 
i'm glad you didn't say that [0.6] what you would normally say which is 
bleeding i mean bleeding yes perhaps is the most common and the most one of the 
most simple to understand but heart failure isn't [0.4] but it's actually 
it's the same thing [0.2] in some ways [0.2] and the body's pathophysiological 
reaction to heart failure is the same as bleeding [1.1] and i'll come back to 
that [0.8] so [0.6] you can become volume deplete [0.5] if you lack fluid in 
the body [0.7] you may lack blood if you're [0.2] bleeding [0.8] as the 
gentleman at the back [0.2] said [0.2] you may lack [0.5] fluid of other types 
such as extracellular fluid such as [0.5] er [0.9] er interstitial fluid in in 
various failures such as heart failure [0.5] oh pen's running out [0.9] er [5.
5] break for a new pen [1.4] make sure that works yeah [0.5] er [1.0] or you 
may lack [0.6] plasma or o-, other substances [0.6] and the treatment of volume 
depletion [0.3] depends on what you lack [0.3] so if you're bleeding [0.2] you 
treat the patient with blood [0.5] if you've got heart failure [1.6] are they 
truly volume deplete well they are [1.2] in terms of how the body perceives the 
problem but the treatment is not to give them fluids [0.7] but if they are 
volume deplete 
because of pancreatitis [0.8] or a burn [0.7] pancreatitis or so-called [0.3] 
intra-abdominal burn [0.5] then you may want to give them what they lack which 
is plasma [0.4] but either way [0.3] in all [0.5] er four of these examples the 
patient is [2.6] i knew this would happen i had a nice pen [2.5] [sigh] [6.1] 
oh i've ruined the board forever [4.8] [laughter] [laughter] okay [0.5] we'll 
ignore that bit [1.0] [laughter] er [2.4] so [0.8] let's talk a bit more about 
th-, this whole idea of of volume depletion [0.3] er [0.2] it certainly was 
something i i didn't understand as a medical student and i think i'm only just 
starting to understand it now [0.9] er [1.3] true [0.7] volume depletion [0.2] 
or what [0.2] we normally consider true volume depletion [0.3] is [0.7] 
typified by something like bleeding [0.3] or diarrhoea [0.4] or polyuria where 
you are genuinely losing fluid [0.2] 
outside your body [1.1] and [1.2] that's why i've written on your handout there 
is a concept of true volume depletion [1.7] now a more important concept [0.7] 
is relative [0.7] volume depletion [1.8] relative volume depletion is a bit 
harder to understand but is a nic-, [0.3] an example of it is heart failure as 
the gentleman said at the back [0.8] and by relative volume depletion what i 
mean [0.3] is fluid in the wrong compartment [0.4] and heart failure is a 
classic example [0.2] you've got fluid around your ankles [0.2] you've got low 
blood pressure your heart doesn't work [0.2] you can't pump [0.5] blood or 
plasma or anything round your body [0.5] and you are [0.2] intravascularly dry 
you are volume deplete [0.4] but the treatment is not to give them more fluid 
because they they've got an excess of fluid anyway [0.8] so you have this 
rather odd situation where you can be [0.4] if you like generally overloaded 
with extra [0.2] water in the body but it's 
in the wrong place [0.5] so it's not in the [0.2] intravascular compartment 
where it should be [0.9] so this [0.4] it's quite difficult to get your head 
around an idea where you can be both wet and dry at the same time and you say 
well [0.2] you can't you know you can't be black and white at the same time [0.
4] you can't be fast and slow at the same time and [0.8] but in terms of fluid 
shifts [0.3] you can be both actually [0.2] it's taken me a long time to 
realize this i used to think you ha-, you you've got to be [0.2] wet or dry but 
you can be both [0.8] it depends how you get your head around it [0.4] er you 
could say the purist would say [0.4] of course that somebody who is fluid 
overloaded due to heart failure or liver failure or any other failures [1.1] is 
not dry [0.3] they can't be dry because they've got ankle swelling and they've 
got fluid in the lungs but the you can be intravascularly dry [0.5] and 
peripherally wet [0.9] and the body's reaction is the same which is often acute 
renal failure [1.6] why is this why am i rabbiting on about this so much 
wh-, wh-, why is it such an important distinction in terms of of of of 
treatment [0.8] that lady in the blue there [1.2] 
sf0533: er [0.9] is it if it's true [0.4] er [0.3] volume depletion then you 
can replace it 
nm0504: very good and 
sf0533: but if it's er relative [1.5] you can't [0.2] 
nm0504: you can't [0.2] and 
sf0533: just get volume overload if you 
nm0504: correct [0.4] absolutely [0.6] and [0.3] er [0.2] you've got to correct 
the underlying problem so as in heart failure they give you a heart or er boost 
the heart or liver failure you need a liver [0.3] or whatever [0.4] or you need 
to tide them over while the heart recovers or the liver recovers [0.6] but er 
the treatment is quite different a-, and the principles [0.4] i mean sometimes 
we cover our bases when we're not sure we do what i call a push me pull you 
which we give them fluids and frusemide which is completely 
illogical and [0.3] defies all [0.6] physiology and pathophysiological 
textbooks but you know we know it works [0.4] we i call it a push me pull you 
[0.7] er [0.8] okay [0.7] there is a concept that the Americans have come up 
with which is called third spacing [0.6] er [0.7] i mention it partly because 
you may hear of it but i'd [0.4] i'd [0.4] rather like you to forget about it 
and and try to think of it i-, in this more simple way [1.0] i don't know what 
the third space is [0.8] i think what the Americans mean by third spacing [0.4] 
is [1.2] either true or relative volume depletion [0.6] causes of of volume 
depletion [0.3] in an area of the body you can't see [1.4] er so what's an 
example [0.2] of a true [1.3] volume depletion [0.4] leading to [0.4] so-called 
third spacing [3.7] what w-, what do you think the first and second spaces are 
[1.8] we talk about the third word come on who did what's the first word [0.3] 
sm0534: is it going to be something like inside the blood vessels and the in 
the extracellular fluids [0.5] 
nm0504: 
yeah i mean basically yes i mean you have things in the cells and outside the 
cells [0.4] er i think [0.4] i think that's what the first and second space is 
i'm not absolutely sure i've never seen it defined [0.6] but if [0.6] er [0.2] 
but the you know the Americans have come up with this idea of a third space i 
think it's a bit like the Third World it's a pile of bollocks you know and 
[laughter] [0.7] i'm not meant to swear on video but [laughter] [0.3] the the 
er [0.5] it it's er [1.5] okay so [0.3] just [0.9] take it as read that this 
concept exists [0.4] er w-, er what what would be an example of it [1.5] true 
volume depletion [0.5] in an area of the body you can't see feel touch perceive 
[5.9] think of hidden [0.7] bits of the body 
sf0535: G-I bleed [0.9] 
nm0504: yeah yeah yeah very good G-I bleed [0.2] i'm glad you said that because 
people don't think about [0.3] the early stages of a G-I bleed [0.4] when the 
blood has gone out of the body [0.2] or gone out of the 
wrong bit [0.2] the right bit of the body and it's just sitting around in the 
bowel waiting to come out [0.2] if you're bleeding slowly it may take a long 
time to come out [0.4] and there's often a twenty-four [0.2] forty-eight hour 
delay before you start seeing melena [0.6] for example [0.7] there are other 
spaces aren't there [0.2] the abdomen there's a big hole in the abdomen [0.3] 
pancreatitis classic example of a third space [0.3] cause of [0.6] true volume 
depletion [0.8] burns [0.4] well you can see burns maybe that's not a third 
spacing [0.9] can you think of another [0.6] space [1.2] 
sm0536: lungs [0.6] 
nm0504: lungs yes very good you can bleed in the lungs and not know it [1.3] 
fractures [0.4] fractures are probably the the classic example of third spacing 
particularly [0.3] beware the fractured femur in an apparently fit young man 
after a game of rugby or football [0.4] they may be bleeding pints [0.3] into 
their [0.3] thigh and you'll not see it they've got big thighs and they don't 
notice it [0.2] they're bleeding into 
their bones remember the bone is not [0.6] a bunch of calcium it's a it's a 
vascular organ [0.5] so there are areas of the body where you can easily hide 
blood so maybe this does exist [0.4] er [0.3] and er which is part of the 
reason i'm i'm talking about it today [1.1] of course third spacing could be 
relative volume depletion [0.5] you know [0.3] it is possible [0.6] that i've 
said you can have fluid in the wrong space the wrong space can be invisible [1.
2] er i just can't think of an example of the one at the moment but usually 
third spacing [0.3] is i think a variant of true volume depletion [1.7] okay [0.
8] so [1.0] generalized ischaemia this is a bit simpler to understand [0.4] and 
is really the causes of low blood pressure [1.2] there are only [0.2] seven 
major causes or groups of causes of low blood pressure of shock or hypertension 
and i and i've listed them there [0.4] er but anything that causes [0.2] low 
blood pressure around the body is also going to cause [0.2] low blood pressure 
in the kidney so any 
cause of low blood pressure can cause kidney failure [1.9] this [0.3] er 
concept of renal ischaemia is is [0.3] a bit harder to to understand [1.0] and 
[0.4] you can understand it in a [0.2] simple way just thinking well if you've 
got something [0.2] blocking say even a partial [0.9] renal arteriosclerosis 
then you get a thrombosis or you you've got [0.3] a [0.3] renal vein thrombosis 
[0.8] er [0.7] that's easy to understand [0.5] er but that structure [0.7] 
function can go wrong here too [1.5] and i'm not going to go into it today but 
there are a whole range of drugs [0.2] that can affect the renal artery [0.4] 
or [0.2] more particularly the afferent and efferent [0.5] er capillary [0.3] 
to the glomerulus [0.4] er such as non-steroidal such as ACE inhibitors [0.4] 
such as [2.2] they're all i can think of at the moment [0.6] er [0.2] so [0.4] 
both the structure of the renal artery vein and the function of the renal 
artery of the vein can be affected [0.6] and if you think about it [0.5] there 
must be a disease you know generally speaking if the if you can conceive a 
disease in the 
body [0.3] it's almost certainly possible and it has happened at some point or 
it will happen at some point in the future [0.7] er [3.0] renal [0.2] renal 
causes of [0.3] acute renal failure are rare [0.4] these ones are the common 
ones and the they make up ninety per cent of what we see in the hospitals [1.0] 
the renal causes which is [0.3] er [0.6] part of the reason or [0.2] the main 
reason why [0.2] most kidney doctors go into kidney medicine [0.4] er are 
extremely rare [0.5] and if you're a G-P you might see one in your whole 
lifetime [0.7] and [0.5] having said that [0.2] er when you get one it's very 
exciting [0.6] and remember what i said that the kidney's a tube [1.1] er [0.2] 
with a with a sieve in the middle [2.1] when we talk about the renal causes of 
acute renal failure we're largely talking about the sieve or problems on the 
other side of the sieve in other words the glomerulus [0.4] or [0.2] the [0.6] 
tubules of the kidney the proximal the distal convoluted tubule the collecting 
tubule et 
cetera et cetera [0.5] er and so you therefore have diseases such as [0.2] 
acute glomerulonephritis [0.2] acute vasculitis [0.4] acute interstitial [0.5] 
er nephritis [0.6] and [0.3] these are all autoimmune inflammations [0.2] of 
either the glomerulus or the drainage system of the kidney [0.6] and again 
today i'm not going to go into them in any gree-, great detail [0.2] they are 
the thing we get excited about they are the thing we jump up and down about [0.
5] they are the thing that gets a [0.4] kidney [0.2] doctor most excited as i 
said last time [0.8] but they're not that important in the real world [0.4] 
Wegener's granulomatosis is a nice phrase [0.4] er it's complicated [0.3] er we 
talk about [0.3] this endlessly on on [0.6] er kidney ward rounds is this a 
case of Wegener's granulomatosis or a case of polyarthritis nodosa and what 
would Dr Wegener the number of [0.4] old git nephrologists who've actually said 
to me what would Dr Wegener say you know [0.4] i don't know what he would have 
said it doesn't matter [0.2] it's not a common 
cause [0.3] of acute renal failure [1.0] er [1.1] what is a more important 
cause [0.2] is what i call established renal failure [0.7] now you'd have to 
forgive me [0.3] er [1.3] in-, inventing a few words [0.3] or inventing a few 
phrases [0.3] and this is a Dr namex invention the concept of established renal 
failure [0.2] it's not in your books [0.3] it doesn't exist [1.1] i'm telling 
you it probably exists why 'cause i've got the microphone [0.6] er [1.4] i 
don't like [0.2] the phrase [0.2] acute tubular necrosis and in some ways this 
is [0.2] analogous or [0.2] perhaps it is acute tubular necrosis [0.3] 
gentleman at the back on the left there [0.5] what's wrong with the phrase 
acute tubular necrosis [0.7] have you heard of the phrase 
sm0537: no i've not 
nm0504: okay [0.9] [laughter] we'll we'll er let's have a l-, lady with the 
with the light blue T-shirt on there [0.6] have you heard of the phrase of A-T-
N 
sf0538: er [0.7] no [0.4] 
nm0504: 
oh [0.2] you must have heard of it [0.5] lady in the red there [0.4] no [0.5] 
nobody's heard of that phrase seriously [0.9] come on [0.8] 
sm0539: it suggests that the tubule is completely dark [0.3] 
nm0504: yeah that's the problem [0.3] i mean you ha-, if you look in your renal 
book you'll be on chapters on acute tubular necrosis [0.3] it it it suggests [0.
4] that [0.7] necrosis happened [0.2] that acute it's acute [0.2] tubules 
there's a problem with the tubules they're all dead [0.8] and and [0.2] lady in 
the red there red top with er long hair what er 
sf0540: 
nm0504: why er [0.4] i always stop people talking don't worry [0.3] [laughter] 
er [1.7] what's what's wrong with using a pathological phrase [0.7] it's a 
pathological phrase acute infarctal cirrhosis [3.0] we use them all the time 
don't we myocardial infarction [1.6] we don't do heart biopsies we don't know 
if they're infarcted or not [1.3] 
sf0540: 
it's not suggestive of what's actually happened [0.2] 
nm0504: yeah it doesn't really tell you about absolutely about the 
pathophysiology which is much more important than the nephrology [0.3] [0.8] er 
[0.2] the the the it's the pathophysiology that'll help you understand [0.4] er 
[0.2] how diseases happen and also how it's taught to patients you don't tell 
them [0.3] you know you could be the world authority on the Kimmelstiel-Wilson 
disease [0.3] try explaining that [0.5] you know [0.3] to [0.4] Joe Public it's 
impossible [0.4] but you might be able to explain diabetic nephropathy if you 
talk about [0.2] the kidneys and blood sugar and damaging the kidney et cetera 
et cetera [0.4] er [0.4] and the same is true of a-, acute tubular necrosis 
that's why i don't like it [0.4] there is another phrase which is acute tubular 
damage you may hear that phrase and that's a slight [0.2] you know if you want 
[0.4] a pathological phrase [0.7] but these patients don't get renal biopsies 
and we don't know they've got acute tubular 
necrosis we don't know they've got acute tubular damage it's just a presumption 
[1.7] er i'm going to come back later on and talk to to this differentiation 
between [0.3] prerenal failure [0.2] and Dr namex's established renal failure 
in a bit more detail [1.6] okay [0.2] post-renal i'm not going to talk about in 
any great detail i think it's covered later on today [0.4] er [0.2] and is in 
some ways [0.4] the simplest to understand [0.6] if [0.2] er [0.4] when one of 
you is very naughty later y-, later on and we take you down the front and 
operate on you in front of [0.2] everybody else [0.3] and tie off [0.3] your 
ureters [0.3] and er absolutely or cut the ureters there are absolutely [0.2] 
zero [0.3] i mean no possibility of any urine going from the kidney to the 
bladder [1.5] that's obstructive nephropathy [0.8] that i understand [0.7] 
that's simple [0.3] actually it's like [0.2] minijoke what are what are the er 
[1.1] three operations that a a gynaecologist is competent at [0.5] have you 
heard this one [2.6] [2.6] oh come on [2.7] [laughter] well they can either tie 
off one ureter [0.3] the other ureter or both 
they're the three operations that a [laughter] [0.4] that a a gynaecologist is 
competent at [0.4] and er [0.2] if if you er er [0.4] give me a few drinks i'll 
tell you about some things they are less competent at [0.4] [laughter] the er 
[1.3] so er and this does happen actually they do tie off ureters [0.3] i mean 
i i i i don't know how i mean i thought you know God if you believe in God made 
[0.4] kidneys be yellow and [0.7] arteries red veins blue and you know this is 
easy you go in there you know [0.3] tie off the red ones [0.5] [laughter] blue 
ones you know but you don't you don't sort of put a stitch round the yellow one 
[0.4] but if only it was so easy [0.5] and it is apparently very easy [0.4] to 
tie off a ureter [0.3] and i certainly have seen patients [0.3] and one poor 
woman who was unlucky enough to have one kidney and the [0.3] went on some 
vaguely [0.5] minor or from a man's perception minor hysterectomy and [1.1] 
[laughter] er [0.7] in the end they er so they actually she she went in for 
something i can't remember and [0.2] she was 
unfortunate enough to have one kidney and he tied off the ureter [1.4] 
[laughter] that patient was in true proper obstructive [0.2] nephropathy zero 
renal output we like that [0.3] i've never seen that before [0.7] [laughter] er 
and that was one of the reasons that made us think that the surgeon had had 
committed an error [1.3] okay slight aside [0.3] er [0.9] if only it was so 
easy [0.4] er [0.3] actually obstructive nephropathy i don't know if if the 
following lecture's going to go into this in great detail it's very difficult 
to understand [0.4] because if you think about it [0.7] it usually isn't 
complete obstruction [1.5] er [1.3] we know that because we see it all the time 
it's it's one of the commonest causes of both acute and chronic renal failure 
[0.4] and they don't have zero renal output [0.3] in fact if anything they're 
usually polyuric [0.9] and for reasons we don't understand [0.4] partial 
obstruction [0.5] to the ureter or the 
drainage system to the kidney at some level [0.3] doesn't normally cause [0.7] 
er [0.5] oliguria [0.3] it's for some reason again this is nobody's ever worked 
this out [0.2] do a PhD work out [0.3] the pathophysiology of obstructive 
nephropathy [0.5] save the world [0.9] er [0.9] it's very very interesting [2.
5] having said all of that what do i actually see in my normal life do i see 
people with Wegener's granulomatosis do i see people with their kidneys tied 
off by a gynaecologist no i don't [0.2] what i actually see is what i call [0.
3] the surgical cocktail [0.2] don't tell that to the surgeons [0.6] the 
surgical cocktail [0.3] is three things and this is the mantra [0.3] i want you 
to recite in your head every night [0.4] dry [0.2] sepsis drugs dry sepsis 
drugs dry sepsis drugs [0.2] that is the mantra [0.2] that is what surgeons do 
[0.6] after the operation [0.4] dry sepsis [0.2] drugs [0.2] why [0.3] how does 
that happen gentleman [1.0] perceptive gentleman at the back on the right [0.8] 
why how do surgeons cause a 
patient to be [0.3] dry septic [0.3] and have drugs [1.2] 
sm0541: 'cause [0.5] they bleed [0.4] 
nm0504: they bleed so they become dry yeah 
sm0541: er they're open [0.3] so they get septic 
nm0504: speak up 
sm0541: they're open so they get septic 
nm0504: yeah so they open them up so they get septic spit in the wound 
sm0541: and they pump them full of drugs during the operation [0.3] and then 
afterwards 
nm0504: absolutely simple as that anaesthetic agents [0.3] post-op what do they 
give them [0.4] 
ss: painkillers 
nm0504: pain relief non-steroidals [0.4] okay prerenal failure local ischaemia 
what else do they give them post-operatively [0.8] [3.3] for the fever [0.8] 
sm0542: antibiotics [1.8] 
nm0504: speak up [0.2] 
sm0542: antibiotics 
nm0504: antibiotics which one [1.5] which group [0.7] 
sm0542: 
nm0504: gentamicin aminoglycosides [0.3] notorious nephrotoxins [0.4] so this 
is a lethal combination [0.3] being dry being septic and having drugs now of 
course [0.2] these are connected [0.2] you know you may become septic post-
operatively 
which makes you dry [0.4] via [0.6] a volume depletion cause in other words 
septic shock [1.0] and sepsis leads to drugs [0.8] so [2.0] you're septic you 
become dry and you get drugs for the whole thing so these thi-, three things 
are connected so [0.3] whenever i go to the surgical wards and see somebody 
with er [0.3] acute renal failure [0.2] that is always my presumption that the 
patient [0.2] has been given what i call the surgical cocktail [0.6] so the 
treatment is actually quite simple [1.2] you give them fluids you take away the 
drugs [1.1] and [0.6] you make them bi-, bit less septic [0.6] er and it may 
involve writing up more drugs but at least you're going to cross off the drugs 
they were on and put them on [0.3] on less nephrotoxic drugs [0.9] and they 
almost always get better [1.1] okay [0.7] so [0.4] the clinical features [0.4] 
of acute renal failure are largely predictable [0.6] er i don't particularly 
want to go [0.3] through them in a-, in any great detail because [0.4] it's all 
too easy [1.0] er [0.2] but basically [0.7] the clinical features are those of 
the [0.5] fluids and solutes that you can't get rid of [1.4] and [0.5] 
the only two important clinical features i've listed there in bold [0.3] which 
are [1.3] fluid overload [1.1] and hyperkalaemia [0.5] and in fact [0.5] these 
are the two [0.6] important clinical features of acute renal failure [0.2] and 
they're also the two reasons we normally do dialysis so [0.2] you need to know 
those two [0.4] for for those two reasons so if you forget everything else i 
say this morning [0.3] just remember [0.2] the two important and life-
threatening complications of acute renal failure [0.2] are fluid overload and 
hyperkalaemia and they are also the two [0.2] absolute reasons [0.2] or 
indications for dialysis all others are relative [1.3] the other clinical 
features again you don't get rid of hydrogen ions [0.2] metabolic acidosis 
Kussmaul's breathing [0.2] er any anybody seen anybody with Kussmaul's 
breathing [1.8] nope [0.6] okay [0.3] er [0.3] in the books it's described as 
air hunger absolute rubbish [0.3] but you know [0.4] people say they then go 
[gasp] [0.3] [sigh] they sort of sigh a bit they don't c-, it's severe short of 
breath [0.4] and it's the differential diagnosis for somebody who's short of 
breath [0.8] they're not hungry at all [0.5] they're just [0.6] dying [0.5] 
hungry [0.5] er [0.6] Kussmaul's breathing [0.7] yes the phosphate goes up the 
calcium goes down the haemoglobin goes down these are more features of chronic 
renal failure [0.4] they do happen to an extent in acute renal failure [1.5] er 
[0.3] there are other causes of anaemia in acute renal failure if the 
haemoglobin is inappropriately low or going down quickly [0.9] what might be 
lady there [0.7] what might be the [0.2] cause of acute renal failure if the 
haemoglobin is inappropriately low six [0.7] six and falling rapidly with a 
creatinine of four-hundred [1.5] it's inappropriately low and falling rapidly 
[0.5] so it's [0.4] 
sf0543: 
nm0504: six today four tomorrow [0.8] 
sf0543: decreased oxygen 
nm0504: mm [1.4] yeah due to [2.8] 
sf0543: less oxygen bound to the haemoglobin [0.6] 
nm0504: 
possibly [0.4] anybody else 
sm0544: E-P-O [0.6] 
nm0504: sorry 
sm0544: E-P-O lack of E-P-O 
nm0504: no no that's what i want you [0.3] wanted you not to say 'cause that's 
the cause of [0.4] anaemia in chronic renal failure [2.9] it's only part of the 
cause of anaemia in acute renal [0.5] bleeding [0.5] so [0.3] there are only 
two ways of having a rapidly falling haemoglobin bleeding and [1.8] how can you 
get rid of blood cells from your body quickly if you don't bleed [1.9] 
sm0545: 
nm0504: speak up 
sm0545: [1.8] through the urine [0.5] 
nm0504: er [0.6] yes eventually yeah but [0.3] before that [0.3] 
ss: 
nm0504: speak up [0.7] 
sm0546: haemoglobin [1.1] haemoglobin [0.2] 
nm0504: mm yeah [0.8] haemolysis is the answer there are only two common causes 
of [0.5] rapid you know haemoglobin's ten six two [1.0] not [0.2] nine eight-
point-eight [0.6] seven-point-nine [0.3] rapidly falling haemoglobin there must 
be some way [0.3] of getting blood out of the body quickly and they're the only 
two ways [0.5] and 
so if somebody's haemoglobin is inappropriately low in acute renal failure [0.
4] just a-, as if they're inappropriately low and falling in the disease 
they're [0.2] the two diagnoses we we think of [1.4] okay uraemia [0.2] uraemia 
[0.6] now there's a word [0.4] er [1.3] Greek derivation [0.2] probably means 
urine in the blood er have we got much further than the Greeks [0.4] probably 
not actually [0.3] i i don't think they [0.3] understood uraemia i'm not sure 
all that we understand it [0.8] all i can say is there was an ill defined 
syndrome in which you don't feel very well doctor [0.6] er [1.4] in which 
toxins build up in the blood there are tens of thousands perhaps hundreds of 
thousands [0.3] there is a modern concept of middle molecules [0.3] big toxic 
things [0.5] of middle size that are [0.2] er damaging or make you unwell 
nobody actually knows [0.6] find out do a PhD probably already done one [0.2] 
find out what the middle middle molecules are find out why people are unwell [0.
4] in both acute and chronic f-, you know we still don't know [1.1] er [1.3] 
medicine is not all over i'm sure i'm not 
the only lecturer who's stood in the front [0.3] and said it's all sorted out i 
mean [0.2] i think if [0.3] if er [0.3] if we if medicine was a clock [0.5] and 
we were [0.3] attempting to sort it out we're probably about five past the hour 
at the moment [0.6] er we're nowhere near having sorted it out we're no-, 
'cause we're nowhere near understanding [0.5] the pathophysiology of most 
disease processes and acute renal failure's just an example cancer [0.3] 
atheroma whatever you like [1.1] er [1.5] okay [0.6] there is an ill defined 
syndrome which i've [0.5] listed the effects of there [0.3] er [0.3] it's ill 
defined therefore i'm not going to try to define it [0.8] the history well of 
course the history is important history is always important [0.5] er [0.4] 
kidney doctors are famous for not taking histories [0.2] we're numbers doctors 
we like numbers we [0.2] say hello to the patient look at the numbers decide 
whether he dies and go home go to the pub [0.4] whatever [0.5] we we [0.2] we 
er registrar hangs around puts a line in the patient gets better or dies we get 
biscuits [0.7] [laughter] 
but we we er [0.5] the history is important [0.3] and i shouldn't knock the 
history [0.2] probably the most important thing that you can do in the history 
is find out what drugs they're on drugs drugs drugs [0.4] okay [0.2] because [0.
3] it's both the cause [0.4] of acute renal failure in up to thirty per cent of 
patients [0.4] er and it may also [0.2] er [0.3] give you clues about the 
underlying aetiology so if they're on a drug [0.3] for hypertension [0.3] 
perhaps an ACE inhibitor it may be they've got renovascular disease and they 
should have had the ACE inhibitor [0.6] so the drugs are important in a variety 
of for a variety of reasons [0.4] how do you how do you take lady at the black 
there with your thermos [0.4] er [0.2] [laughter] you you er [1.1] is that 
coffee in there or 
sf0547: no it's water 
nm0504: water 
sf0547: it's not a thermos [0.3] 
nm0504: er [0.5] it er [0.6] how do you [0.2] how do you take a drug history 
then [0.2] from the patient [1.5] just a bit of role play 
sf0547: 
you ask to see their chart [0.3] 
nm0504: bit of role play [0.6] 
sf0547: [sigh] [2.0] [laughter] if they're in hospital you can ask to see their 
chart rather than ask them 
nm0504: yeah i know but they're not they haven't got they're in the medical 
admissions [0.2] ask me some questions [0.2] 
sf0547: what drugs you're on 
nm0504: about what what drugs i'm on [0.3] 
sf0547: what tablets do you take every day [0.7] 
nm0504: i'm not telling you [1.5] [laughter] come on [2.2] 
sm0548: what are you taking 
nm0504: oh you better go than that [0.8] [laughter] that's just one you've got 
to ask the question again 
sf0547: er can you as-, [0.2] could you tell me what drugs you're taking [1.1] 
nm0504: [sigh] g i gave them to the other doctor earlier [1.0] didn't you write 
them down [0.3] 
sf0547: do you have them [0.2] them with you any of them 
nm0504: well they're in my bag they're [0.9] do you want me to get it 
sf0547: yeah 
nm0504: all right 
sf0547: 
could i have a look at them 
nm0504: okay [0.6] [laughter] so er [1.7] i don't know i don't know which one 
i'm i i don't know which one i'm i'm taking but you know and i've got a big 
i've got a list here from my G-P [0.5] and and i've got a load here [1.0] and i 
i i don't know you know i j-, i i don't know i mean every doctor i see puts me 
on a different tablet [2.5] 
sf0547: er [1.3] 
nm0504: come on Gestapo [laughter] [3.1] 
sf0547: which of those did you take this morning 
nm0504: very good all right we're getting there very good [0.7] d-, do you 
really want to know all right okay i took this [0.3] er well i don't know what 
it's called it's blue [1.0] [laughter] do you know the do you know the blue one 
doctor [laughter] [2.0] 
sf0547: [laughter] do you have the bottle so i can 
see the label 
nm0504: all right here is here it is here it is okay so you're writing it down 
okay [0.6] so [0.3] very good okay i'll we'll stop there but [0.2] but it's 
very hard to take a drug history [0.3] er [0.2] often the patient's got no idea 
[0.4] the drug list is wrong [0.3] and you actually have to get the actual 
tablets actually in front of you [0.3] compare it to the drug list unless 
you've got a particularly articulate patient and you trust the drug list [0.5] 
you know and find out what they're actually taking [0.6] by taking a precise 
and careful drug history [0.3] you may save the patient's life by being a bit 
of a pain in the arse [0.4] er and it may involve sending the wife home to get 
the tablets from the bathroom by er you know ringing the G-P in the morning [0.
4] you've got to be a detective in terms of drug history and it's very very 
important not just in in in renal disease [1.2] people [0.3] er in my opinion 
[0.3] very [0.2] er too readily give up on a drug history of the patient and oh 
well i 
don't know you know or [0.4] and they don't pay [0.2] you find there aren't any 
pink tablets you know [0.4] er they you know they [0.6] the [0.2] don't give up 
take the history put the screws on [0.6] get the light out Gestapo treatment is 
what's needed for [0.3] er a drug history [1.4] i missed some other [0.2] er 
important features of the history there there is one [0.3] modern myth [0.4] er 
about er kidney failure [0.3] which i've listed for you there which is [0.2] 
high blood pressure causes kidney failure kidney failure causes high blood 
pressure it's a nice little mantra and if you'll repeat that you've read it in 
your book [0.8] absolute rubbish [0.3] absolute lie [0.2] it's like most [0.4] 
verbal [0.2] oral myths [0.4] it's it's a m-, oral myth because somebody told 
somebody who told somebody who told [0.2] namex who told me to tell you [0.8] 
and that's how it's come [0.3] into being [0.6] there is no evidence [0.7] that 
[0.3] high blood pressure [0.5] causes kidney failure [1.2] so if you forget 
everything else i say just remember that [1.2] kidney failure causes high blood 
pressure both in 
acute and chronic kidney failure [0.3] but bog standard mild to moderate 
essential hypertension no other risk factors does not cause kidney failure [0.
4] and never accept it as a diagnosis [1.0] er [0.3] accelerated hypertension 
can cause acute renal failure [0.6] but accelerated hypertension is quite rare 
[0.3] and it's [0.3] only a major problem in blacks and Asians whites can get 
it but blacks and Asians in particular [0.3] d-, do you all know what i mean by 
accelerated hypertension [1.4] anybody not know some shakes in the back [0.2] 
accelerated hypertension i'm not going to talk about it in detail today a well 
defined syndrome it's been written about for a couple of hundred years [0.3] 
combination of extremely high blood pressure systolic over two-hundred [0.2] 
for example [0.3] being unwell [0.2] hepatic encephalopathy [0.2] hepatic 
retinopathy [0.5] acute renal failure [0.5] dissecting [0.2] aneurysms a 
constellation of all the problems [0.5] er [0.3] which fits into the dimensions 
of accelerated or sometimes [0.4] use of the malignant hypertension 
that does cause acute renal failure [0.5] but never take hypertension as a 
cause of acute renal failure otherwise [1.5] okay [0.4] er [0.6] i've put a 
little phrase there funny diseases in the family [0.4] er when you take a 
family history it's not enough to say [0.5] what did your mum die of what did 
your dad die of oh sorry not [0.4] sorry about that [0.4] er what did your mum 
die of yeah oh your dad's still alive yeah sorry about that [0.5] assuming your 
both your parents were dead [0.3] er [0.7] er be careful when you know you have 
a patient who's about [0.2] fifty their parents might be alive or even sixty 
they might be alive so don't or go straight into what's what did your mother 
die of [0.5] just be careful [0.2] to say [0.2] er [0.3] is your [0.2] mother 
well or you can start off with you know [0.5] er do you still have your parents 
something a bit softer [0.4] than what did they die of d-, don't assume 
everybody's dead [0.6] [laughter] er [2.8] er funny diseases in the family er 
important in 
kidney disease er [0.2] there may be a family history of organ-specific 
autoimmune disease their [0.3] auntie's got diabetes their cousin's got thyroid 
disease [0.3] and these all [0.2] er increase the possibility of of autoimmune 
disease so we're talking about [0.2] glomerulonephritis vasculitis [0.3] 
extremely rare [1.3] examination [0.4] what is a rena-, a student asked me 
couple of days ago that's why i put this section in [0.4] when i was preparing 
this at two o'clock last night don't think look [0.4] when we become consultant 
lecturers we don't do things at [0.2] last-minute-dot-com we do [0.5] er [0.2] 
we're no more organized than you are we're just a bit older have a bit less 
hair [0.4] er [0.4] [laughter] when i was doing this at two o'clock last night 
[0.7] er [0.4] er i remembered a medical student asked me a couple of days what 
is a renal examination [0.3] i thought that's a good question now i don't know 
what a renal e-, i mean there's never a a renal chapter in a book is there [0.
8] there's 
cardiovascular respiratory G-I there's no renal examination [0.3] i think what 
a renal examination is [0.3] is a good cardiovascular [0.5] because that tells 
you about fluid state [0.3] a good G-I 'cause that tells you about the kidneys 
the liver [0.3] plus the bladder which you always forget to feel [0.6] plus 
listening for bruits particularly femoral particularly epigastric [0.3] that's 
where you hear renal bruits in the epigastrium [0.8] other things cause 
epigastric bruits aneurysms a load of other things but renal bruits [0.2] also 
[0.3] occur there [0.3] and the very important thing the finger up the bottom 
[0.6] [laughter] the finger must go up the bottom every time you see a patient 
[0.3] [laughter] with acute renal failure [0.6] er [0.3] and in a woman [0.2] 
should go [0.2] er into the vagina as well [0.2] er unless there is a good 
reason not to [0.9] okay that's a gross generalization there's never really too 
many in a hospital only a hundred-and-thirty a bit dry going to have a finger 
up the bottom no [0.9] [laughter] but [0.6] if the renal 
failure is unexplained [0.2] and you have reason to think they may have 
obstructive nephropathy [0.2] remember the common cause of obstructive 
nephropathy [0.2] in men is prostate in women is pelvic cancer [0.3] pelvic 
cancer till otherwise proven [0.8] and [0.5] if you don't want to do those 
things fine but the-, then the onus i-, on you is to get somebody else to do it 
so [0.2] my advice to you is as soon as you get on the surgical ward [0.2] 
start putting your fingers up people's bottoms just get used to it [0.3] you 
know [laughter] [0.4] all doctors have to be able to do it [0.3] and er and 
you're no different and just get over that mental barrier [1.5] er [1.1] and 
maybe the only clinical signs if you don't do it you're doing a patient it's 
like [cough] not examining you know you're actually not helping them very much 
[0.2] because you don't want to do it [0.5] 'cause you don't like [cough] [0.9] 
er [2.9] in terms of anything else to examine not really [1.0] it's a complete 
examination a renal examina-, but s-, [0.2] but er s-, 
specifying those particular areas [1.6] right [0.5] er [2.0] investigations i'm 
not going to go into in any great detail i've listed a few questions for you 
there [0.4] just remember the big three [0.4] the creatinine [0.7] what do you 
think the other [0.3] two big ones are [0.6] the big three there's always a big 
three [1.6] key investigation of somebody with acute or chronic renal failure 
[0.5] creatinine [1.4] 
sm0550: urea [0.3] 
nm0504: no [1.3] anybody else [1.1] speak up [0.7] have a guess [1.3] 
sm0551: calcium [0.3] 
nm0504: no 
sm0552: [0.3] 
sm0553: G-F-R [0.5] 
nm0504: no [0.6] 
sf0554: calcium 
sm0555: calcium in urine [0.9] 
nm0504: sorry [0.3] 
sm0555: calcium in your urine [0.7] 
nm0504: dipstick [0.8] 
sm0555: okay 
nm0504: okay [0.3] and [0.4] important radiological tests [4.0] calculated 
guess [0.7] 
sm0556: X-ray [0.7] 
nm0504: no [0.2] 
sf0557: ultrasound 
sm0558: ultrasound 
nm0504: 
ultrasound okay [0.2] X-rays can kill you [sniff] [0.3] ultrasounds don't [0.6] 
er [1.0] so these are the big three tests [0.3] and anybody with acute renal 
failure [0.3] needs a complete history and examination [0.6] and a knowledge of 
the result of these big three tests within twelve hours or you haven't done 
your job right [1.1] if the renal failure is unexplained if it's explained [0.
3] on clinical grounds you don't have to do everything all the time [0.2] you 
don't have to do [0.3] an anchor [0.5] er antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody 
on everybody with a creatinine of hundred-and-thirty in medical admissions 
who's got appendicitis [0.5] but if the renal failure's unexplained you have to 
do it [1.3] er [1.0] and they are the big three tests potassium yes is all 
right big four but [0.5] potassium in my mind slips in with the creatinine you 
know if you're doing a creatinine you're checking the potassium [0.4] er [0.2] 
yes you want to know the potassium because that's what kills people and that's 
[0.5] the important thing on which you decide whether to dialyse people or not 
[0.4] er but it doesn't tell you about kidney function and that's what the 
creatinine does [0.3] what's what's the creatinine for the liver [2.0] 
gentleman 
in in red there [0.4] what's happening to the liver [0.7] 
sm0559: no idea [1.6] 
nm0504: anybody [0.8] do you want to [0.7] he's the liver man is he [1.9] 
what's the creatinine for the liver [0.2] [laughter] he's [0.3] pointing to you 
so [0.9] 
sm0560: cheers [0.5] er i don't know [1.6] 
nm0504: how do you measure liver function [1.9] 
sm0561: L-F-T [0.2] 
sm0562: L-F-T [0.4] 
sm0563: L-F-T 
nm0504: i'm glad you said that no [0.5] er [0.2] I-N-R the I-N-R is the 
creatinine for the liver that's what they measure on liver transplants four 
times a day [0.5] there is to be honest there isn't a creatinine for the liver 
there isn't as good a way of [0.4] measuring liver function i mean [0.2] okay 
they're bright yellow liver in the three-hundred in [0.2] trouble with the 
liver but [0.5] there [0.4] there isn't really a good creatinine they need they 
need a creatinine [0.6] to to m-, as a m-, good marker of liver function but [0.
2] when the liver actually fails the I-N-R goes up and it goes up rapidly it 
goes up exponentially so 
as soon as your I-N-R starts going up [0.2] you're in big trouble [0.9] er [1.
3] okay [0.3] so they're the big three tests [0.3] er [2.4] are they easy to 
get yes all very easy the dipstick you can do the creatinine you can do the 
ultrasound you can organize it's a Friday evening you want to go home the 
patient's unwell [1.0] you don't know whether to ring a radiologist they might 
shout at you [0.6] who cares if they shout at you they don't have to like you 
[0.4] you're not in this game to be liked [0.6] er get that ultrasound by hook 
or by crook [0.5] er within twelve hours in somebody with unexplained renal 
failure [0.3] lie [0.2] give your right arm [0.2] firstborn whatever you like 
[0.2] just get it [0.5] er [0.2] why do people become radiologists why do 
people become radiologists [2.7] technicians [1.6] why radiologists [0.7] 
sf0564: they can't be a doctor [0.6] 
nm0504: 'cause they can't be a doctor [2.6] [laughter] what 
a dreadful thing to say you [1.1] evil cynical woman [0.7] yes [0.8] er [1.9] 
er [1.8] there then [0.2] er [0.2] yeah no they don't want to be doctors [0.3] 
[laughter] they don't want to take complete responsibility they're [0.2] 
they're [0.2] er [1.1] they're very important they're vital [0.7] but they 
don't want to take complete twenty-four hour it's like G-Ps i mean i was 
appalled yesterday at the crap i heard on the radio [0.3] about [0.2] G-Ps not 
wanting to take responsibility [0.4] why do they become doctors that's what [0.
2] medicine's about taking re-, biscuits [0.3] [laughter] taking responsibility 
[0.4] and er [0.2] i almost rang up a few of my mates who are G-Ps and gave 
them some of my mind [0.6] [laughter] but er i knew that would have no effect 
'cause they they hate doing on call [0.5] er [0.3] if you don't like doing on 
call then don't be a doctor you know get out of the kitchen [0.5] and er [0.4] 
you know go and do something else go back and do microbiology at Liverpool or 
you know just don't be a doctor 
[laughter] if you don't like doing on call or or you're not willing to do on 
call [0.7] that's my opinion [0.7] harsh i know [0.5] er [1.0] okay so 
radiologists yeah they they [0.2] they're nine to five people they're not you 
know they're nine to five Monday to Friday people [0.4] actually i i'm 
maligning the namex radiologists ours ours are quite good they're actually 
quite easy to get scans but they'll always say oh can't i do it in the morning 
[0.6] no [0.2] you can't do it in the morning [1.6] [laughter] one night i 
think i got four consultants in the hospital after midnight [0.7] absolutely 
hated me in the morning [0.5] i was completely wrong as well on on my diagnosis 
[1.1] [laughter] er [2.1] and there was a lot of lot of mumbling and swearing 
un-, under the breath going on about me that that night but er [0.3] you know 
sometimes i get consultants in the hospital after midnight and i'm right 
and and then [0.3] that's that's okay [0.6] so if you're on call you're paid to 
be on call [0.4] and you come in if you're asked [0.8] it doesn't stand up in 
court [0.6] er [0.3] not coming in [0.3] you can come in and moan you can come 
in and swear you can come in and malign [0.5] er my parentage [0.3] [laughter] 
you can say what you like [0.3] but you have to come in [0.2] it does not stand 
up in court saying [0.2] oh well i gave some advice on the phone and yes Dr 
namex asked me to come in but i didn't think it was important and anyway i was 
watching er y-, you know and oh [0.4] oh it's one minute past midnight [0.2] 
doesn't stand up in court [0.2] if you're on call [0.3] you're asked to come in 
you come in there is no [0.3] there's no middle there's no grey area you come 
in [0.6] er [0.3] it's completely indefensible [1.5] one night actually a 
slight aside er [0.3] i [0.3] i was a locum [0.9] locum renal S-H-O in 
Portsmouth and i was on without a registrar it was a it was a D-G-H type [0.2] 
renal unit [0.5] do you know what i 
mean by a D-G-H district general hospital 
sm0565: district general hospital 
nm0504: it's a non-teaching hospital [0.5] and i was on with the professor [0.
2] who was er a well known er [0.5] er extrovert [0.5] a bit cravat-positive 
and [laughter] [laughter] [0.5] er [0.9] he [0.3] i i'd never ever put a er er 
a peritoneal dialysis catheter into anybody [0.3] and a patient came in [0.2] 
very sick with acute renal failure over the full monty [0.6] and i rang him and 
he said oh namex er just pop a catheter in [0.5] [laughter] and i said but i've 
never done one sir [0.3] actually we did use to call the bosses sir in the bad 
old days [0.5] and er [0.8] he said oh get the nurses to talk talk you through 
it [0.6] [laughter] and i say [0.4] well i i really don't think that's a good 
idea sir you know i think i think you'd better come in and supervise he said 
oh all right all right then [0.6] and he just sort of had another port and 
came in [laughter] pissed out of his head [0.8] er and i remember er to this 
day it was way past midnight [0.2] and er i remember pushing him out of the way 
'cause you could smell the port [laughter] [0.3] you didn't have to see it [0.
6] and he talked me through it [0.6] and [0.6] the patient survived [1.5] er 
he's [laugh] now retired the great Professor namex [0.3] er in Portsmouth [0.5] 
er [2.0] [laugh] [0.7] forgot what i'm talking about now anyway er [laughter] 
distinguishing [0.2] er [0.8] prerenal [0.4] and established renal failure [0.
6] er [3.2] or distinguishing [1.0] er what some people call a tu-, [0.3] 
tubular nec-, necrosis [0.3] why [1.3] what is this [0.3] syndrome of 
established renal failure stroke A-T-N stroke A-T-D [0.6] what is it [0.5] 
let's [0.5] anyone like to have a stab at it [1.4] and i want [0.2] a full-
blown 
teleological evolutionary argument involving life the universe and ev-, [0.2] 
and everything in the last ten minutes of this talk [3.1] who's going to have a 
go [2.4] come on [0.3] doesn't matter if you get it wrong [2.1] lady in red 
there [0.5] no [0.3] not brave enough [0.2] no i wouldn't be either [0.9] 
[laughter] er [0.2] there is a phenomenon [0.4] there is a syndrome of 
established renal failure stroke A-T-D stroke A-T-N [0.6] which does exist [1.
0] and [0.4] there may be an evolutionary basis to it [0.5] er [0.4] what 
happens if you go into kidney failure whatever cause [0.2] usually prerenal 
failure [0.2] for a while you don't reverse the prerenal failure [0.3] and the 
kidneys shut up shop [1.2] so why might there be an evolutionary advantage to 
the kidney shutting up shop [1.9] lady in red you can answer that [1.6] why 
might it be a good idea [0.8] for you to be able to [0.3] stop your [0.3] nodes 
working your kidneys working [0.6] your heart working obviously it's not a good 
idea to stop your heart working [laughter] but why might it be a good idea to 
stop your 
kidneys from working [0.2] 
sf0566: it might be er taking away from [0.3] else [1.5] kind of [1.6] 
nm0504: er lady on your on your right in the [0.6] cream 
sf0567: to give your kidneys a bit of a rest [0.5] 
nm0504: [laughter] yeah give them a rest very good give the kidneys a rest okay 
[0.3] and and when [0.2] er you're cornered [0.4] you're in the cave you've 
been gored by a sabre-toothed tiger you're bleeding to death [0.7] it's about 
to move in for the kill you're hiding behind that rock [0.6] you're entering 
prerenal failure it may be a good idea to hang low for a while [0.6] and [0.3] 
for your kidneys to turn themselves off and that's exactly what established 
renal failure is [0.3] an A-T-N A-T-D [0.4] the kidneys have an ability to turn 
themselves off [0.4] ten to fourteen days on average twelve-point-seven [0.6] 
completely meaningless number y-, [0.5] patient has asked you how long am i 
going be in kidney failure for i say twelve-point-seven days sir [0.4] and [0.
2] i don't really [0.3] no i usually say a week or two [0.3] er [0.7] the 
kidneys have an ability to 
turn themselves off [0.6] we don't understand it [0.2] there may be an 
advantage to it or there may be a [0.2] an advantage to it once in other words 
it's now maladaptation [0.2] to the modern environment and therefore evolution 
eventually in a couple of hundred years' time or [0.3] a thousand years' time 
will take it out of the out of [0.5] out of the human being and perhaps all 
mammals [0.6] er there are some clear advantages in being able to turn your 
kidneys off [0.2] when i say turn them off [0.3] they really go into a sort of 
recycled phase [0.3] so [0.2] the blood goes down the tube [0.2] it meets the 
sieve and says no way Jose and comes back again so you don't [0.3] you may make 
some urine you don't make much urine and and usually oliguria is a feature of 
established renal failure but not always [0.4] well it's it's a feature 
initially [1.6] er [0.6] but [1.0] the kidneys [0.2] send the blood back if you 
like [0.8] and you become oliguric [0.8] if you stay [0.3] in oliguric acute 
renal failure and you keep drinking what's going to 
happen [0.5] lady in the grey [0.3] there [1.2] 
sf0568: you're taking in the volume you're not getting rid of it so 
nm0504: yeah so what's going to happen to you clinically 
sf0568: you go into volume [0.3] overload 
nm0504: yeah you can volume overload exactly [0.7] er so [0.2] there is a phase 
in this cycle where you go from dry [0.3] to in the middle [0.3] to wet [1.3] 
and what we try to do [0.2] in nephrology [0.5] is to spot this transition 
point [0.7] and hopefully stop them becoming wet but if they do become wet [0.
4] we get rid of it with dialysis or diuretics or whatever [1.5] and that [0.5] 
is simply what established renal failure A-T-N A-T-D is and [0.5] why the 
kidneys turn off and why they start up u-, up again we don't know what are what 
are the stimuli [0.3] find it out [0.5] become famous [0.9] er [0.2] it's a 
very very interesting phenomenon the the the 
concept of established renal failure [1.1] distinguishing it from prerenal is 
extremely difficult [0.2] and i've listed there or a table i just took it out 
of a book [0.2] it's in all your books [0.5] you can measure the urinary 
osmolarity and the blood osmolarity and all it's all rubbish we don't do that 
[0.5] er [1.2] urinary sodium if you're going to [0.2] pick a urinary test and 
there may be a question about this in one of your exams so [0.3] it's the type 
of table you do need to to know [0.4] er [0.2] the urinary sodium is relatively 
useful i cannot think the last time i measured the urinary sodium [1.1] why 
does a urinary sodium er go up in established renal failure well in prerenal 
failure [0.3] the kidney's still trying to work and if you're still trying to 
reabsorb sodium [0.5] and so the sodium levels [0.2] in the urine stay down as 
soon as they start going up it means you have established renal failure it's 
all rubbish [1.0] you know it's [0.2] er [0.3] and it's all messed up by a 
patient always on diuretics which increase [0.3] er sodium losses anyway er 
it's almost 
impossible to interpret a urinary sodium [1.5] er i visited er a unit in in New 
York once drop that in the conversation [0.4] [laughter] and er [0.4] and they 
start at [0.7] six-thirty [0.2] i mean [0.4] their lectures start at seven [0.
2] i mean [0.4] my God if you ask a British medical student to appear at seven 
[0.4] why i sincerely hope you wouldn't turn up [0.5] [laughter] and i remember 
sitting through this like terrible lecture on urinary osmolarity and sodium at 
seven o'clock in the morning i [0.3] i thought this this is this is just hell 
[0.4] [laughter] and the only thing that kept me going was that knowledge you 
had pizza at eight [0.7] [laughter] doughnuts at nine [0.4] [laughter] eat all 
day long [1.3] [laughter] with [0.4] and also on on on the I-T-U trolley [0.6] 
i'll never forget this they had cans for your Coke [1.2] [laughter] and 
everybody arrived with [0.5] your Coke and your Diet Coke Sprite Diet Sprite 
and put them in the trolley [0.5] that was the only bit i liked about it [0.4] 
er [1.3] [laughter] okay [0.4] treatment er [0.6] i [1.8] i know the second 
half of this talk is meant to be about treatment and er [0.5] partly because 
we've only got five minutes to go [0.3] and and partly [0.3] er [0.3] i don't 
think it's nearly as important [0.5] as what i've talked about so far [0.4] i'm 
not going to go into it in any massive detail [0.4] other than to say [0.2] the 
key decision [0.3] is the D decision [0.7] in other words [0.5] do they need 
dialysis or don't they [0.7] and that's a decision that i make on a daily basis 
[0.6] and it's not that complicated [0.5] er [0.4] the books will list hundreds 
of indications for dialysis there are only two remember i said ear-, earlier on 
in the lecture [0.4] there are only two important clinical features [0.2] 
hyperkalaemia [0.2] and fluid overload i [0.7] and the [0.2] only indications 
or absolute indications for dialysis are hyperkalaemia unresponsive to medical 
management [0.5] and [0.4] fluid 
overload unresponsive to medical management yeah i've listed a few others there 
[0.3] two-A i've written down as acidosis [1.3] so having said that sometimes 
we do dialyse people for rather obscure reasons particularly on an I-T-U [0.3] 
if on an I-T-U [0.2] situation somebody's got a creatinine of two-hundred [0.2] 
a urine output of [0.2] forty mls a minute [0.9] they're going into renal 
failure [0.2] but they don't really need dialysis but we know tomorrow we may 
want to give them a lot of fluid for some reason [0.3] or we may want to give 
them an angiogram [0.3] which is nephrotoxic [0.3] or tomorrow we may want to 
give them T-P-N or N-G-P [0.3] we may dialyse people for rather odd reasons but 
but [0.4] most of the time they are the only two absolute reasons for dialysis 
[0.8] i don't think it's necessary that [0.2] you [0.3] er [0.6] go into how we 
dialyse in any great detail [0.3] er [0.2] just [0.4] it's much more important 
you understand the physiology and the pathophysiology [0.3] and the indications 
for dialysis [0.5] the technicalities you'll learn later you put a 
tube in the neck you attach them to a whirly [0.2] it isn't much more 
complicated than that [1.3] er [1.6] finally finally [0.2] er [0.3] who should 
be managing people with renal failure i've said that [0.6] twenty thirty per 
cent of people coming into hospital have a raised creatinine [0.7] and there 
must be [0.8] between fifty and a hundred people coming to the namex every day 
[0.3] so a lot of them will have a raised creatinine can they all be referred 
to the renal team [0.6] please no [0.5] i hope not [0.5] that's one of the 
points of this lecture that you're going to be managing people [0.2] where when 
the cause of renal failure is obvious and when you can reverse it [0.5] easily 
[0.9] it's when it starts to get tricky you need to call the cavalry [1.5] and 
[0.3] fortunately er in [0.4] namex and namex we have a reasonable cavalry i'm 
one of six nephrologists and there's one that's on every day of the year 
including Christmas Day including New Year's Day [0.7] and [0.4] er [0.8] if 
you're having problems call there's no point in tr-, being a hero you get 
no medals for being a hero in medicine [0.4] just because you can manage [0.2] 
a case of Wegener's granulomatosis on your own as a house officer [0.2] out in 
namex [0.8] it doesn't mean you should [0.5] and i think if you have anybody 
with any major body system failure and you can't reverse it quickly [0.2] you 
can't identify the cause quickly you should be seeking help [0.2] and if you're 
in a hospital without a renal unit such as namex [0.3] Nuneaton et cetera [0.2] 
you need to be [0.2] ringing the namex [0.2] and asking for advice from a renal 
registrar or renal consultant [0.6] and that's true of of a-, any [0.3] major 
body system failure [1.4] okay [0.7] that's it [0.5] questions [1.8] [3.5] not 
too many anec-, anecdotes [0.4] and only one bollocks [0.2] sorry [1.8] 
nf0569: can i just say anybody here who hasn't signed the register can you do 
so [2.9] i don't know whether they are either they must be somewhere [2.3] 
nm0504: 
what happens er [0.4] by the way what happens if you if you [1.0] don't [0.6] 
appear if you don't sign the register [0.3] 
nf0569: [0.4] 
sf0570: [1.2] 
nm0504: namex can fail you [0.9] 
nf0569: last year [1.7] 
nm0504: did you fail any last year 
nf0569: just to let you know it was very close last year there were about [0.4] 
four people who nearly failed the urinary [0.4] 
nm0504: on attendance [0.4] 
nf0569: on attendance yeah [0.3] 
nm0504: excellent [1.3] [laughter] okay any any questions on on acute renal 
failure 
nf0569: whether you agree with it or not is irrelevant it's
