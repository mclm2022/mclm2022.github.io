sm5382: well do you want to get out that handout that we got early on
nm5380: oh yes
sm5382: which says that it has to it has to have a fifteen-thousand word 
summary and then a fifteen-thousand word technical report
nm5380: right
sm5382: which is not how we 
sm5385: yeah its not the standard report layout that we've er 
nm5380: oh right
sm5385: been used to for over four years they've gone and changed it
nm5380: okay
nf5381: is that new this year
sm5382: fifteen-thousand words summary and then up to another fifteen in 
technical report
sm5383: its more like
sm5385: it says er its not quite like introduction and aims and objectives 
isn't it
nf5381: this is going to be
sm5383: the first the first half group summary
sm5384: it is quite open to er to sub-sections
nm5379: so its its right yeah its its quite big thing really the group summary 
report
sm5382: it seems that the first half has to be the kind of thing you'd pr-, 
present to like somebody who doesn't really have any you know deep technical 
knowledge of it
nm5379: i don't i don't think you would necessarily interpret it like that but 
suppose it says venture capitalist doesnt it
sm5385: yeah it also says down here something about
nm5379: it's never going to be simple enough to do it is it
sm5384: no
sm5385: er research project should be laid out in an appropriate manner 
suitable to what they've done if you
nm5380: sorry y-, y-, you're referring to something here
sm5385: yeah in ref-, in referral to research projects something something else
nm5380: oh i'm hopeless at trying to find something in the same i think in the 
group report well lets
sm5382: for more research based projects something there
su: right so
nm5380: yeah right well okay that's a let out that's basically a let out clause 
isn't it really
su: yeah there's nothing we can do
su: ignore the first bit and we'll do what we're hoping to do right
nm5380: i mean business financial and management report er well i don't know 
about a business report i mean this work is of use to people outside but not 
necessarily to business i mean its to sort of technical busi-, i mean you know 
er expensive
su: its not like we're going to market it or anything
nf5381: but that that's more appropriate for a group project where you're 
developing
nm5380: if you're doing a survey 
nf5381: a product or so you know some the groups they work on developing some 
sort of product for instance then so that so that's more appropriate then for 
them to look at a sort of
nm5380: i mean it does say detailing any business plan developed so i mean 
clearly if there isn't a business plan you're not going to be talking about it
nm5379: the-, the-, there are small issues aren't there of the cost i mean the 
the the the the the price is 
sm5385: well there's the cost of the boards and stuff like that yeah
nm5379: and the implications as to why you went down a certain route you know 
isn't it i mean why it sort of mentions if someone says well why didn't you do 
this its expensive isn't it i mean its always going to be too expensive
nm5380: yeah i mean there there are you know ri-, right at the beginning we 
talked about the different approaches i mean you are going down as Mark said 
you're going down a particular road with the er you know mapping onto a micro 
er a D-S-P microprocessor there's still there's the optical route and ma-, 
maybe one could have some some ideas about that you know er are you you you're 
looking at that still
sm5382: yeah i mean i was thinking that would have to go in the technical half 
because it well because it seemed that er with that where it says research 
projects could be laid out differently it it seemed to me to be referring tothe 
layout of the summary not that er it would have to be split in half
sm5385: yeah i thnk it would still have to be
su: you'd still have to do the
sm5385: the fifteen-thousand word summary yeah
nm5379: but the thing is with the summary when you get to as long as that its a 
bit more than a normal summary well you'd just structure it as you would
nm5380: we mark it as well don't we so the basic thing is if we mislead you and 
then mark it as down then you'd have a cause for complaint so if we if we guide 
you in a certain direction we will then mark to that and we will we would take 
the flack from the department because that was what we were supposed to do its 
not you're fault its its our fault isnt it so so so you've done the best you 
can given what we've told you
sm5383: i think we could do much better if we could just follow a standard 
nm5380: can you can you can you get access to previous 
sm5382: well that's what we were going to ask you if there's any way that we 
can get a
nm5380: i'm i'm sure because you know
nf5381: i have got a copy of one but its a few years old in my office a copy of
nm5380: the undergraduate office i presume must hold these because certainly 
certainly i i i i've encouraged third year students doing projects to get er 
third year project reports from the previous years if its appropriate
nm5379: which are held by the general office not by the undergraduate office
nm5380: oh right well generally perhaps
nm5379: no your supervisor has to sign it to to say i mean you know its quite a 
procedure 
nm5380: but really we're talking about those from last year i mean you just 
need to see to see a guide of of course bearing in mind that there's been a 
change but pos-, possiby not make much difference to us because this p-, this 
project isn't really you know we're not manu-, manufacturing something for a 
specific er er market if you like i think
nm5379: mm mm i think i think er you know the the you could probably bring 
yours into this this st-, we could argue that yours was in this structure 
sm5382: we we've got a rough sort of structure thing but its sort of like we're 
working what we do to to do this if we had to just do it it wouldn't be 
anything like this
sm5383: a kind of distraction
nm5379: i think what you have to do is you have to try and do that unless it 
really wo-, won't go because er we we'll we we'll accept an interpretation 
we're not going to rigidly say oh well it doesn't have this that and the other 
because we didn't write this really so er treat it in the spirit of perhaps 
when you're asked to tender for business you'll have very strange ways of 
asking you for tenders that youdn't yourself so you say well given like that 
we'll er 
sm5382: so are there any other any other assessors that mark it there are other 
assessors aren't there other assessors do they mark ike totally independently 
because they might er be expecting a particular thing like that and then if 
they get it and its different they might go well you didn't follow the 
instructions
nm5379: well i think you may have to yes so so keep it so that it could be in 
the spirit of that
sm5382: yes
nm5379: but push it as far as you can you know thats defensible er basically 
you've got sort of t-, i mean those are almost like apend-, the technical ones 
are almost like detailed apendices so you could argue that the you could argue 
that the main the main mathematical bits and pieces were in were in the summary 
and then that you know the fine detail of it was in was in that part so you 
know i don't think that you've got to take all of of the maths out because we 
would argue that it was a research-based project
sm5385: so you have like the answer in the summary bit and how you get that 
answer in the technical bit because it 
nm5380: yes do remember that it says maximum though of fifteen thousand words 
people have been saying you've got to right a fifteen thousand word report the 
wording is maximum
sm5382: maximum
nm5380: so the maximum total is thirty-thousand as well isn't it the whole 
portfolio
nm5380: an upper an upper word count of thirty-thousand words excluding figures 
and apendices right thats to keep it to keep it manageable but it doesn't mean 
that you have to go you have to keep checking the word count to make sure you 
are getting closer to thirty-thousand
sm5383: and things like er wave-length theory and stuff like that would that 
all go in the technical half do you think
nm5380: i would think so yeah i would think so because the group summary report 
might be correct me if i'm wrong i mean yeah i-, i-, it says this it it will be 
going to somebody who maybe who might have done a degree in engineering but 
would not be close wo-, wouldn't have a close relationship wi-, with wave-
length analysis for instance so somebody who could see something th-, that is 
feasible and a possible way of making money since it talks about venture 
capitalism here and so on somebody who could see how it could be developed 
exploited but maybe doesn't understand the finer points of wave-length theory 
does-, doesn't wan-, to doesn't need to really but somebody who is interested 
in the technical work would obviously go to the technical report so its really 
that the group summary report is aimed at a particular group of people
sm5384: well we said we could just refer to anything that we want to state in 
the summary then we could just refer to the technical bit anyway couldn't we be 
sort of er 
nm5380: yes yes just as you would be in just as you would reference books 
outside of those two documents so are there any other because you said you said 
that this was the main point of discussion today was to talk about the group 
summary sorry th-, th-, th-, the reports that you had to write
sm5383: the report yeah
sm5382: er well i've got i've got er something of a rough sort of layout that 
we are talking through and me and Pete changed it a bit last night from what we 
did on Tuesday but its roughly the same we're thinking with the summary we'll 
just start off with aims adn objectives right and er and maybe some stuff about 
sonar active versus passive and maybe a bit of history or whatever and then 
we'll talk about all the different things we could have done like optical D-S-P 
we'll do it quite briefly and then have er detailed er description of 
particularly the optical stuff in the technical report then then talk about 
what we did like mat-lab and the simu-link and then the C code which we haven't 
done yet and then er the front end design which er we need to talk about as 
well today because we were thinking that we need er something to communicate 
with it like er a i don't know whether we write it in J-A-V-A or C-plus-plus or 
something like that and then conclusions and applications and stuff and then 
that will be the summary and then the report would be wave-length theory 
details of the implementations like the optical stuff and details on like 
testing and things like that and hopefully that's enough
nm5380: it sounds it sounds fine from my point of view
nm5379: yes sounds sounds okay
nf5381: yeah
sm5385: great
nm5380: what what was that the end the end of the story then there's nothing 
more to say or er can i i mean in terms of what's been going on in the last 
week er you know i've been in contact with this guy Clayton Hudson well maybe 
some of you well perhaps you all know by now Clayton Hudson of Motorola who was 
very positive wh-, wh-, when do you remember was it last Friday or last Thursday
sm5385: last Thursday i think
nm5380: last Thursday okay and i did email him and er i haven't had an 
acknowledgement but that doesn't mean anything necessarily but you know i'm i'm 
hoping that in the post clearly not today but early next we will get little 
parcel and that will be the boards that we want but i'll wait i don't like 
hassling somebody particularly when they offered it for free
nm5379: yes
nm5380: so i think we just wait a couple of da-, may be to the middle of week 
and then if i haven't received it i'll then phone and politely say did you get 
my email or something you know i i'll perhaps phone him up
sm5382: yeah
nm5380: because maybe there's som-, somebody's had problems sending me emails 
er although generally i get emails everyday but
sm5382: i think its only James
sm5383: yes its just James
nm5380: no no not no some-, somebody from from from Amer-, from from the States 
said that they kept sending emails and they got bounced back but maybe they 
just chose times when our system was off the air i don't know
sm5385: which is about half the time
nm5380: half the time yes
nm5379: internal ones are being lost as well
nm5380: so maybe one should always send emails twice or maybe three times
sm5383: irritate them 
nm5380: so so this this interaction with with Clayton Hudson continues and as i 
said i'll i'll wait if everybody's happy about that yeah we'll wait until the 
middle of the week
sm5382: do you know if its the eight-one-oh-one or eight-one-oh-two thingy
nm5380: er well
sm5382: just to find out where it comes from
nm5380: i was talking i was talking to to Peter about this and i think looking 
at the documentation myself on the on Metro Works website that it was going i-, 
the eight-one-oh-one is this only one that seems to have any valuation module 
which probably the cheaper thing
sm5382: it is yeah
nm5380: yeah so i think yeah if as i said in my email if if there was an eight-
one-oh-two evaluation module yes please but if not we'll be very happy i i i'll 
make that point very strongly you know that we'll be happy with the eight-one-
oh-one
sm5382: and it's free
nm5380: and could we have two of them please even though even though i was 
quite prepared to have one but Peter gave me this great
sm5382: just push him
sm5384: the guy did offer so
nm5380: this great argument why we should have two so
sm5384: make the most of it
nm5380: in case we blow up one probably and then well we won't tell them that
sm5384: as long as you don't let me near it and then it'll be fine
sm5382: yeah apparently you've got previous on this
sm5384: yes
nm5380: oh really you didn't tell us that
sm5384: you're ve-, ver-, i'm surprised Marina hasn't actually
nf5381: don't let him anywhere near the equipment
nm5380: is that right is he he blows things up does he
sm5384: i don't know what happened
nf5381: things happen to people heart attack
nm5380: oh dear me
su: its not proven is it
sm5384: no its not proven yet i-, its not proven it was me yet
nm5380: so i i think well you know i'm still confident i mean he was so 
positive on the telephone and Peter was there listen-, well not listening in 
but you could see the smile on my face
sm5385: yeah 
nm5380: as i was talking to him and i thought you know tell me how much it 
costs and he said no we can we can send them to you for free er thankyou very 
much
sm5383: would we get would we get administrative rights on a P-C in order to 
install the software as well
sm5382: yes we'd need to
nm5380: er which P-C do you mean
sm5383: er any P-C in in engineering
nm5380: ah y-, you mean one of ours rather than one of yours er well i think 
we'll worry about that when we get the boards i mean we can find a machine 
somewhere i'm sure
nm5379: if you'll have it it would have to be installed but they'll come and if 
you got it then
sm5382: i mean if it's a problem then we can put it on one of our systems
nm5379: i think it could be installed and i'm sure come in and login and do it 
really just how they would with any other machine really if its just an 
installation
nf5381: wanted too Mark Hughson and Adrian they
su: i'm not quite certain
nm5380: but that P-C its not quite so bad is it really
nm5380: where where were you thinking of installing
sm5382: do it ourselves yeah
sm5383: well it it would be better if it was in in here just so that we could 
all have access to it at anytime just in case anybody went home or anything
nm5380: er yeah well i mean there's ou-, our there's the research level on the 
way there we can probably fi-, we can probably find somewhere to put it in 
there we have to find a P-C first but
sm5382: one thats not too old
nm5380: one that's not too old yeah
su: so that's an even bigger problem isnt it
nm5380: but there is there is my old P-C which is in the room where my post-doc 
works that he used because the simulations he was doing were taking so long 
that he wanted a separate machine but we could probably borrow that its er its 
its not a very old machine but you know its not you know state of the art so to 
speak but a lot of the i mean its mostly C-programming that you're doing isnt it
sm5382: yeah it is yeah
sm5383: it will just be if there's any like testing software that's probably a 
bit more
nm5380: yeah
sm5383: testing it on the P-C
nm5380: well we'll have to play it by ear i don't know if we've got enough 
money and it would take too long to buy a new computer we we really need to we 
we really need action on all of these things don't we because we're in week 
five this is the end of week five and er 
nm5379: well you could buy a new computer on the budget i never thought of that 
really
sm5383: i can jog down to P-C World
sm5384: i was going to say you can get one almost immediately can't you if you 
want one
sm5383: that's if if we wanted one we could get one that day couldn't we
sm5384: i mean we have to we have to
sm5382: P-C World
sm5383: maybe not P-C World
nm5380: de-, desperation i think er 
su: if they've got them in stock a P-C is a P-C isn't it
su: yes
nm5380: no actually that's a good point
nm5379: it would be a few hundred to get a desktop one state of the art is very 
cheap now isn't really
sm5383: mm yeah
nm5380: okay well we'll bear that in mind i mean we haven't beari-, if we get 
these boards for free i mean we haven't bear-, i mean that was going to be a 
cost
su: yeah
nm5380: but it looks like that cost is zero and the software will also be
su: yeah struck gold here
nm5380: can i
sm5383: sorry go on
nm5380: can i say can i ask about about th-, th-, the software do we have has 
some software been downloaded
sm5383: we've got er the software but er we couldn't really we're not all-, we 
can't use it and we couldn't find any facilities er to enable us to use it
sm5382: its only a thirty day license
nm5380: oh i see i don't know whether we er 
sm5384: its a thirty day license so
nm5380: oh right right
su: and we've downloaded it
nm5380: well hopefully within
su: thirty days isn't that
nm5380: well hopefully within thirty days we'll hear form Clayton and we'll get 
the acc-, we'll be able to then talk to and then
su: then it won't matter 
nm5380: but i er i was really asking from the point of view of whether whether 
you'd been able to do anything with it thats the
sm5385: no no basically no
sm5383: i have been reading the C-book recently
sm5385: yeah apart from sitting there looking at the documentation for it all 
which is somewhat daunting to say the least that's about it really
nm5380: but i mean is it standard C or 
sm5383: its standard yes
nm5380: oh right right
sm5383: but looking at all the memories and the registers of the four core 
processes that the thing has is
nm5380: well you would choose you would choose this
sm5385: worrying
nm5380: yeah i was reading up about this style its quite a its quite a 
sophisticated thing
sm5385: yes it is
nm5380: so are they four identical processors or or
sm5385: it has four which can do things at the same time so
sm5382: lets just hope sort it all out
sm5385: so its four which can do the multiply accumulate stuff so
nm5380: that's pretty stunning really isn't it on one chip this is on one chip 
quite amazing okay so tha-, that's one issue then er and then the other issue 
was the er er sorry er kinetic you know th-, th-, the simulation stuff
su: oh yeah
nm5380: and again you know i i i'm hoping you know Rob-, Robert is the guy the 
guy i know down there i mean he's he he he won't let us down but its a case of 
him getting round to it and i don't want to hassle him because i i;ve known him 
for a long time and i know he'll deliver and he knows the time scales and so on 
so i would hope to find a C-D in my post next week and hopefully it will be
sm5382: we changed the software didn't we to so 
su: yeah
sm5382: but we haven't had a chance to test it yet we just got it workign last 
night
nm5380: that's great
sm5382: but we just need to plug in the starting length frequencies and the 
length and what have you
nm5380: well i i i'll give him a bit longer before i email him again i'll wait 
until the end of the week but as i say Clayton i'll try and contact in the 
middle of the week by telephone so i think that's probably as much as i can 
contribute this this week er er and i really haven't done anything because i've 
really been waiting for other people to
sm5385: well yeah yeah so
nm5380: well to return the favours so to speak
sm5385: advanced
nm5380: anyone else have any thoughts about it anything optics or
nf5381: well i have found something that er i don't know how keen you are on it 
well i'm keen you know to do something about it but i don't know how much time 
you've got to do it
su: stuff
nf5381: er it's a very nice piece of work on er filters it's all there it says 
what diagram is there and er architectures there you see flow plan is there so 
i'm not asking you to copy it or anything just er to give it some thought you 
know see what we can do implementation side of things its from Stanford 
University its a fourth year project so it is students work and i don't know 
how good that work is but it it probably looks quite quite good and on that 
website if you go on the website they have also code for it as well so it could 
be something that you would like to have a look since you are looking at 
different options of so it might be worth
sm5383: send everybody the er an email of the address
sm5385: it's on the webpage
nf5381: so i don't know who was looking was somebody looking at the 
implementation or was it
sm5382: no no we've sort of er i think i think er put it on hold because it was 
just for the er poster but we do need to do a section on it for the report
nf5381: mm
sm5383: that would be good yeah
nf5381: it would be nice if you do a sort i er i think it would if you have a 
look at it and see how how you can implement it and er 
sm5383: yeah
nm5380: i don't feel there's enough material here to continue this you know to 
another unit maybe but
nf5381: mm yeah
nm5380: and there's some areas we haven't we haven't really given much er 
sm5382: shall shall we hang onto this
nf5381: yes sure yes sure its for you i i mean er obviously five weeks isn't 
much time to er to design anything
su: but 
nf5381: but it would be nice you know if you just explored 
sm5385: well for the technical section we were just
sm5383: we were just going to put that lot in there
sm5384: about all the different types of things and possibilities of continuing 
in different directions so that's easily
sm5382: yeah so we'll talk about each each way we could have gone and then er 
sm5383: so we could easily do something like that 
nf5381: well you would have to put a section on all of them and then justify 
why you have decided to what are the reasons behind behind the chosen path 
whatever
sm5382: the other thing which we never talk about yet is the er front end of it 
like what program er we we'd actually use to communicate by the serial port 
because remember a little while ago we were thinking that we'd need say er tha-,
that it would just have to be a simple window really that that that took in 
the er message of the chip
sm5384: for the development board
sm5382: yeah but we'd need something that could really go with the chip so its 
maybe something that the chip that does this is
sm5383: er er if we're talking about the er development board er it will 
probably have a er program with it
sm5382: er yeah but if we're talking about if you want this to be a standard 
line program
sm5383: er and and run it to another P-C it might only have that one er one 
serial port connection to it an-, and that's the programming board
sm5385: i i think you use the parallel port to
sm5383: yeah it would be the parallel port
sm5385: communicate to it
nm5380: i'm not quite clear i'm not quite clear what what you're saying i mean 
y-, obviously in a real situation er if if if this particular detection system 
was install-, was implemented on a D-S-P processor obviously it would be part 
of a lot more hardware
su: mm
nm5380: and clearly we haven't got the time to to look at all all the 
ramifications of that but i would have thought as Ian was saying that er this 
the evaluation module will give us everything we need for interaction between 
it and the host processor
sm5382: right are we just going to er leave it at that because er 
nm5380: well clearly if we get the i mean we really need to get hold of that as 
soon as possible don't we and if we get it hopefully it'd be next week
sm5383: i think we tackle the situation when we get to it
sm5385: i mean you can you can run it connect it up to your P-C so you can help 
debug it so you can you can have the processor running and it communicates the 
to your programs so you can see what's going on in each register
nm5380: indeed indeed i-, i-, if it if its like certainly if its like things 
i've used in the past yeah you can mod-, er you can downlo-, i mean you can 
develop the software on the er on the host processor and then you know when 
you're happy with it you download it i don't know whether there are simulation 
tools or what i'm not certain or whether you have to just download it to the co-
, you know the star core and then run it on the star core but the question is 
where the data is coming from again i'm presuming that the data will be on the 
host processor and that it will be downloaded to the star-core D-S-P
su: well that's another
sm5385: coefficients should be stored on the er on the chip right
sm5382: yeah but the input wave whether that would be necessarily sent to it 
via a serial port or whether there are other ports on the 
sm5383: you couldn't er program it and send it using the same interface
sm5382: er yeah i'm i'm assuming you could
sm5383: in the end we could just like create a er er maybe stream a file of of 
coefficients for er simulated waves er 
su: do we have an er an on it
su: yeah i i'd assume so
nm5380: sorry sorry on evaluation module
sm5382: er i yeah i suppose yeah
sm5383: it-, its bound to if it's a D-S-P chip
sm5385: well n-, not necessarily
sm5382: i don't know
nm5380: yeah i mean i i we're talking a bit vaguely i suppose because we don't 
really we don't have that information but er some certainly the ones i've used 
the T-I ones were designed you know they had A to B and D to A built in so that 
you could put signals in from outside but th-, this is quite a sophisticated 
beast and i would suspect that the data would have to come from the core pr-, 
th-, the host processor
sm5383: yeah
nm5380: you can't just sort of have two co-, you know B and C sockets co-axial 
sockets or something to put to put data in its but again i'm i'm only talking 
from experience and its somewhat limited to the age of some of my books 
sm5385: i think we just keep it as
sm5383: we don't need to worry about it but i think it will happen
sm5382: but i mean if its going to be if its going to be used in real life then 
it would have to take in a signal from er er microphone or or you could go for 
sm5383: if if it was to be used in real life it probably wouldn't be used in 
this chip at all it would probably be used in the most advanced er er chip 
which is probably about er er using it with a lot of other hardware as well
sm5382: the eight-one-oh-four
sm5385: the next one up from what we're using
nm5380: er er sorry what you're suggesting we wouldn't be using this type a D-S-
P processor
sm5383: we'd be using a D-S-P processor but i think we'd be using quite er 
other things as well
nm5380: of course of course
sm5383: like er C-P-Us and er maybe a maybe a whole er hardware setup 
nm5380: yeah i think i think i think i think we sh-, personally i think we 
shouldn't worry too much about that you know the you know actually 
commissioning a piece of equipment you know for whatever application whether 
its you know maritime or military or or whatever it's a it's a big job and you 
know i've been down to Kinetic and and they have racks of equipment
sm5383: yeah i've seen like er that on ships the computer the computer er just 
sort of one radar fill up massive rooms
nm5380: yes yeah yeah
nm5379: so we argue it's a proof of principle isn't it
nf5381: well there it works and you could scale it up using state of the art 
su: 
nm5380: well it would be incorporated into a bigger whole anyway this is this 
is this is this is a small but significant part of a particular application in 
sonar so i don't i don't think we should we should worry too much about that 
but what we should be concerned about it obviously doing getting a realistic 
simulation well but not exactly simulation because we're using a real processor 
but getting the data to the processor and getting the data back so that we can 
have a look at it and i would presume well i haven't obviously seen any details 
about this that that that this would not be a problem otherwise how would its 
called an evaluation module
sm5385: its not the computer would talk to it 
nm5380: yeah yeah yeah i mean its an evaluation module in order to evaluate the 
processors so 
sm5385: C code just stitch in one value
sm5382: and it would send er send a discreet signal
sm5385: yeah
sm5382: through the chip
sm5385: yeah
nm5380: is it is it possible to get more information about the eight-one-oh-one 
or er 
sm5385: well i've been looking on their on their website i've got a got a load 
of information on the on the sort of the core that it uses and so on but i 
haven't really i haven't really figured how you sort of how you start 
programming it and
sm5383: i think its hard to realise that sort of thing until you actually get 
it in front of you
sm5385: yeah
nm5380: yeah
sm5385: because its about certainly the information on the core is about eight-
hundred odd pages long
nm5380: really
sm5385: er tons of registers to look at
sm5383: but if you read it all it would be totally irrelevant to what our what 
we're wanting to do i would have thought so
nm5379: okay
sm5385: it starts off interesting and then
nm5380: it gets very tedious
sm5385: and you sort of start thinking well i'll miss that one and er 
nm5380: but surely surely that's the advantage of writing in C though isn't it 
that the the th-, you know that the cross assembler is taking the C-code which 
is written in a you know independent code and it will then be mapped onto the 
processor by their software so as far as use of register we hope that the that 
their cr-, cross-assembler uses uses the registers in an efficient way and 
hopefully the work will be done for us
sm5383: hopefully a lot of the work will be done for us
sm5385: but we still need to know the functions
nm5380: yeah but you want some built-in D-S-P functions
sm5383: yeah and if they're well written then it shouldn't be too difficult to 
do it
su: well yeah yes because there's something 
nm5380: there's a lot of trust here isn't there
nm5379: yes actually just the year the year before you were first years they 
still had this difficult interfacing lab so you would have actually had some 
experience it was far too difficult for first years it was one of the first 
things i got given when i came here was there used to be a lab where you did 
this kind of thing with a processor wasn't it i-, i-, i-, in F-two-eleven er 
where you could see that you wrote some assembler and it was hard work and then 
there was a C and it was compiled so
sm5384: we had to do that in C-S
nm5379: did you so you still so you still u-, have done
sm5384: it was a real pain
sm5382: we still do that
nm5379: you've done that yes so it's a bit like just a grander version of that 
but it's the same thing as if the students were given a a very small part of 
the manual because that was really all that was relevant to what they were 
doing to what they were doing they were playing with certain registers there's 
a much thicker manual whichever it was probably something like this and gave 
them this much and that was still too much for a first year lab if you want to 
bottom out they couldn't fathom it at all you know the the various the the i 
think there was only two accumulators and it wasn't a very complicated chip or 
anything but that was still too much for people to take on board so you weren't 
going very far reading it
nm5380: yeah but i i i don't think one's sort of expecting expecting you to get 
to grips with the instruction set for a processor like this i mean that's the 
whole beauty of using a high-level language that we that we use their expertise 
basically to map it onto the processor i mean clearly if you were if you were 
trying to do a very optimised design you might want to try and get into the 
innards of the process to try and cu-, cut down the time
sm5383: cut down all of the things that we're not using functions
nm5379: it's a bit like the cu-, you know whether you if in C-S whether you 
write your own compiler isn't i y-, you know you're happy to use a compiler not 
reinvent the wheel so it's a bit like that you say well you don't know 
everything that goes on do you you're happy to use Windows on top of something 
you don't know you don't want to write your own
nm5380: we're not happy to use Windows
nm5379: no what i mean is that you have a choice we don't write our own 
operating system for the computer so you say oh i want to write my own 
operating system my own language because that's then i know everything about it 
you just have to live with it i suppose you don't know every fine detail really
nm5380: mm mm
nm5379: ve-, very few people do have time to go through that you just have to 
trust that they've done their job without major bugs so that
nm5380: mm indeed well i think i think Motorola have been in the business for a 
a good many years so and they and they you know and this is the latest 
generation of many generations of processors
sm5382: so do you think they'll er er if we have a a lot of multiplications to 
perform supposedly running at the same time that they'll er automate as it were 
between the four er was it four multiply accumulators
sm5385: four cores yes so you can only have
sm5382: do you reckon that would would the compilers alternate would you guess
nm5380: well i mean a gu-, a guess is what you're asking me for there
sm5382: yeah
nm5380: i don't i don't i don't know how you map you know i mean well basically 
you've got a parallel processor haven't you effectively
sm5382: mm
nm5380: er i mean it may well be that that for you know practical designs you 
might not just have one of these you may have several of them i mean maybe 
you'd have f-, you'd have four of them and then you'd have sixteen or however 
many you need you could have an F-R filter running in parallel on on each 
processor but er i i don't know but that that would come into the programming i 
would have thought and i don't know if you've ha-, somebody's looked at the C
sm5385: i haven-, i haven't been able to find the actual C code that you that's 
all 
nm5380: oh right i thought maybe but are there not any examples that you can 
just see how you know how closely it resemb-, whether there may be special 
features that mightn't it
sm5385: mm there are yeah we looked at an example yesterday
sm5382: there was one project with flash gear L-E-Ds and stuff
sm5385: yeah
nm5380: okay er how how are we doing we've covered we've covered quite a lot of 
different things er doe-, does anyone want to say anything particular Cory or 
or Ian or
nm5379: no
nm5380: the short answer yes okay i don't think i've got any-, anything more to 
add er you know obvious-, obviously we're sort of waiting a bit are-, aren't we 
we're waiting we want to move on but until we get this other material
nf5381: it would be nice to get on with some of the stuff that you need for 
your report while we're waiting for this equipment to arrive
su: true get it a bit sorted out
nm5380: yes that would seem very sensible actually very sensible
sm5385: we will get cracking on that
nm5380: okay
sm5384: we've got a lot of information already to write up so
nm5380: and of course there will be presentation as well er at some point
sm5384: it's week twenty-three or something like that i think or twenty-two
nm5380: is that right er 
sm5385: that's the least of our worries at the moment
nm5379: a repr-, a report presentation to last thirty minutes
sm5382: week twenty-three
nm5380: plus twenty minutes for questions
nm5379: yeah
nm5380: all group must members must be present
sm5382: is that up to you guys
nm5380: pardon
nm5379: its not up to us i don't think
nf5381: yeah there will be a there will be another
nm5380: is it any of us
nf5381: second assessor plus moderator i think
nm5379: its not us
sm5382: what and you guys as well
nm5380: well probably probably the guys who were at your poster presentation it 
will probably be at least two people
sm5382: oh so they do all of it i mean that was Godfrey and Tardy wasn't it
nm5380: well it won't
nf5381: it won't be Tardy
nm5380: it won't be tardy because he's on study leave but certainly it'll er be 
Keith Godfrey yeah it'll be him and somebody else i don't know who but yeah the-
, i'm sure those two tho-, th-, you know there'll be those two or except of 
course as i said Tardy's on study leave who will be at the presentation
nm5379: in week twenty-three isn't it yeah
nf5381: mm
nm5379: assess-, assess-, assessors
nm5380: we we do some assessment
nm5379: yeah so its not directed is it
nm5380: and obviously we are also part of the project to some extent
nm5379: so its not the not the directors and the group oral it's the assessors 
we won't be at the presentation because its the
nf5381: well we can be there but its assessors that will be asking questions
nm5379: the pos-, because the poster was the director and assessor i mean like 
obviously i had a look at it and gave a mark when you were off with your
nm5380: when i was off with my arm
nm5379: with your broken wrist er er so its specifically said
sm5384: did you actually get any feedback from that about marks because i know 
some groups actually did get feedback from how that went but
nm5379: er well are we not i mean you're happy i mean you know what i what i 
put down first class marks as far as i was concerned
su: i'm not going to complain
nm5379: but i don't know what i don't know what er the other i haven't 
officially had any report back on that from the other from the other as far as 
i was concerned it looked very good so if you were saying that they were 
marking all of them highly because they're all
nm5380: i think i think i did comment i did comment to somebody what i thought
nm5379: question really but
nm5380: i have see-, i have seen i have seen something
nm5379: because you would probably see it because you're listed as the official 
director so i don't always get the stuff you know official stuff to me
nm5380: but i was in but i was out of action wasn't i though
nm5379: so it didn't go maybe it didn't go to anybody i'll ask namexi'll ask 
namex
nm5380: there was there was no the-, there was feedback that's right and 
perhaps we should've we should've discussed this er from one from one of the 
assessors who i think i mean may-, maybe er the prob-, there was a problem of 
lack of understanding i think from his point of view
sm5385: yeah yes that was obvious
nm5380: yeah about the er i i i i had a feeling we'd discussed this but may-, 
maybe not
nm5379: i i think we've i think we've said something about it yeah
nm5380: in rela-, in relation to he couldn't see that this was a wavele-, that 
this was really wavelengths
nm5379: it was about transform wasn't it he said that he couldn't see 
nm5380: he couldn't see where the wavelength transform came in to it so er i 
mean probably he was confused by something in the presentation i mean i wasn't 
there so i can't comment but
sm5382: it was the er it was the er graphs you know the three-D graphs in 
MatLab and i was saying that it was a continuous wavelength transform and he 
said it wasn't 
sm5385: and you thought it was
nm5380: yeah i think i think i have actually spoken to him since this sin-, sin-
, since the your presentation er pointing out why i believed it was a well i 
mean we know its we know it's a wave that transforms so i think probably it was 
just a feeling that he got on the day and that there wasn't anybody there to 
help him through this problem and so he he he was he then he he he then gained 
the impression that that this was not a wavelength transformer
sm5382: he's been doing so well that the the er the one with the high pass low 
pass filters ones where you just er keep doing the low pass ones you know do 
images
nm5380: the disc-, you mean the discreet wavelength transform yes
sm5382: well i don't know why but he er that's what he's lectured me on it 
before so i don't know whether that's what he does but then he 
nm5379: i think that
nm5380: i don't know i don't know if he actually uses a discrete wavelength 
transform for that i i i i've tended to use it for image compression er T-, 
Tardy doesn't his interests are in other areas of image
sm5382: in D-S-P i think i thought he lectured me on that
nm5380: on no its g-, its g-, this
sm5382: er he did it last year
nm5380: last year right
sm5382: in D-S-P because he did the second half of the course
nm5380: the-, there certainly is some image compression in that D-S-P course 
okay well i think we've drifted off a bit there but anyway er so were there any 
oth-, any other comments on optical or not been any developments in that
sm5384: there's masses of information just being written up at the moment er 
nm5380: right
sm5384: i've er you know i think James i can't ac-, James was supposed to be 
giving you a list of some like some inter-library loans but i'm not sure if we 
actually need to do that or not do you happen to
nm5380: no
sm5384: ah ok 
nm5380: but it may it may be on the website but i haven't looked at it i must 
admit this week so
sm5384: oh right okay
nm5380: yeah
sm5384: er i think he was unless he's ch-, ch-, looked at them and then changed 
his mind and decided they weren't worth it or not but as i say he's not here so 
i can't really ask him at the moment but er its mainly just write up at the 
moment of what we've got
nm5380: are people are still putting putting stuff onto the onto the M-Eng 
website
sm5384: yeah i think yes i think so
sm5384: i haven't put anything up for a while
sm5384: Ja-, i think James James has put a few things on it i'm sure he has 
we're slow-, slowly getting through and we have this to do as well so we'll 
have some more to write up
nm5379: yeah i think there's no problem with with plenty to write about
sm5385: yeah there's quite a lot
nm5379: you know emphasising the option of of and how the principle was proved 
really i think
sm5384: its more being selective of what's more ne-, or what's sort of worthy 
of the project rather than what's sort of vaguely relevant sort of thing so 
sifting through a lot of it is the main thing at the moment
nm5380: indeed indeed okay any other
sm5382: i don't think so i think this pretty much covers most of it
sm5383: just send an email out when it arrives or 
nm5380: i will as i've said the minute the minute i get any information i'll be 
onto my computer wherever i am
sm5385: we'll have to sort the software out as well i mean that shouldn't take 
too long i take it
nm5380: i would have though not its just i'm sure you can download the software 
but we need to have presumably we need him to contact Metroworks or something 
to tell them
sm5382: shall we meet on Tuesday are you here at all
sm5385: yeah
nm5380: does anyone else have
nm5379: no i think i think we've er 
nm5380: okay good
nm5379: got there
sm5384: are you away again next Friday its 
nm5380: er no not next Friday the Friday after
sm5382: the twentieth the er er I-S-Ps cancelled isn't it
nm5380: that's right yes
sm5382: so is it that day
sm5383: i can't do next Friday so
nm5380: we don't have to meet on a 
sm5384: next
nm5380: next next Friday
su: but that's i don't think we have anything major
nf5381: i cant come next Friday i go to
nm5380: do we have to i mean could we meet on another day or i mean its 
obviously good to get most people to come well i me-, a-, all people to come 
really but
sm5384: if we wait for James we could send an email to him
nm5379: i was wondering if you could agree a ti-, you know
nm5380: okay well we we we use email anyway but er we-, we'll have a meeting 
next Friday though yeah
su: yeah yeah
nf5381: i can't do next Friday but er 
nm5380: you can't
su: i can't no i can't either
su: we could draw up a timetable
sm5382: we could say what about Thursday afternoon
su: i can't
sm5384: there's always Wednesday afternoon
nm5380: that's a good idea circu-, circulate something round
nm5379: the problem with Wednesdays is that that you lose us in term to open 
days and things er thats its
sm5385: i'm in a school and have sessions Wednesday afternoons so i'm not 
around so
sm5382: what about Thursday afternoons
sm5384: lets let Ian sort it out well i'll just send some emails and say some 
times 
nm5380: Thursday's afternoon's okay for me i i mean i normally see my project 
students but i i can always reorganise and see them on Friday instead
su: okay
sm5382: till one for the second half of the week i've got lectures
nm5380: okay it could be Thursday
sm5385: Thursday's two o'clock onwards
sm5382: Thursday two is fine
nm5380: is that alright
nm5379: for next Thursday yeah
su: yeah yeah we we er s-, send the email round and check with James
nm5379: because i tended to book the room that's the only danger it might have 
to be somewhere else if if there's an open day because of course they have the 
priority on this room so i mean Tuesday until Thursday this week we could be in 
another room
nm5380: well we'll try and plan it for Thursday we don't need this room do we
nm5379: no no
nm5380: i mean we only occupy a a small part of it
nm5379: its just easy its just a nice place to sit isn't it because its got the 
nice-, the nicest chairs in the department
nm5380: so you you're going to deal with the
nm5379: yeah yeah Thursday
nm5380: to deal with the booking
nm5379: yeah i'll book a room
nm5380: okay good over and out then or
nf5381: 
nm5380: over and out then over and out
su: i think so yeah
su: yeah
nm5380: okay then
