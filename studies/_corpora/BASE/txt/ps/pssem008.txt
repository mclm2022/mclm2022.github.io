nm5386: er okay now we've got that er barrier out of the way now as er Tim was 
saying er at the end of the lecture this is er an er exercise er and an 
exercise which is er designed to er address some of the problems that students 
have typically had with er writing their particular reviews er exercises are 
very useful of course they are not the real thing we haven't got time to do the 
real thing and you're all meant to be doing the real thing when you're doing 
your dissertations but i hope er you'll enjoy doing this and that you'll take 
something away from it er its er actually hand out some pieces of paper er 
which er i will do now there we go what you're going to end up with er in about 
half an hours time is each group is going to have a paragraph er which will 
incorporate some of the information er contained on that sheet you are 
basically going to read it and analyse it and then synthesise it into a 
paragraph as though it were a paragraph in you literature review and then comes 
the fun bit because you are going to inscribe that paragraph on er something 
for the overhead projector and er one of you a spokesman for each group is 
going to talk through how you arrived at your paragraph now obviously there 
will be similarities between the two paragraphs but they will of course be 
different because you're going to be working independently and then er when 
we've got the two paragraphs we er then decide which aspects of them we think 
work and which aspects of them we think don't work so that's the very simple 
brief er one of things looking at this material that Tim dreamt up it has all 
the appearance of being genuine academic material but actually he's just made 
it all up er so that no-one is distracted by their own knowledge as it were of 
whatever er engineering speciality a few of you may have the widget for the 
purposes of this exercise is a thing er an unspecified thing er its not the 
widget we're interested in its the descriptions of it er in fact i believe that 
the widget is a thing in forget that perhaps i'm just bringing my own personal 
expertise in on that point er but as far as we're concerned today a widget is 
just a name of a thing what's important is what these three academic books say 
about it er the first thing that i would suggest that you do after you've all 
read them is identify the aspect of the widget that each concentrates on er 
because knowing what the er literature that already exists concentrates o means 
that you can then identify something that it doesn't concentrate on because as 
namex was saying the lecture that i'm sure you've had drummed into you many 
times by your tutors the point of doing any core postgraduate work is to do 
something new er it won't be massively new and world-shatteringly original at 
masters level but we are looking for somthig which hasn't actually been done 
before so the first thing to do is to identify what has been done before and 
then see what remains where you could squeeze in in this place your particular 
take on the widget so the first thing to do individually i think is to read 
those er read the sheet and make tiny notes one word notes er on on the basic 
theme of each of the books that's the first thing to do and then i'll come 
round in about five minutes or so and see hwo you'e getting on with that and 
then then the next thing will be to work in a group to work out how you're 
going to synthesise this into one well-written clear paragraph for your okay
su: 
nm5386: right i think its time to start talking to each other make sure you all 
agree as we were saying the point of this sort of review is to show what the 
field consists of i think you should also be thinking about or where you would 
be coming in where is the gap what what thesis could you start finding space 
for right so get together and first of all check that you are all agreed on 
what the four the three different books are and then look at 
su: 
sm5387: one gap i see here is that's the test we carried out that's this may be 
right
su: 
nm5386: what sort of perspective on the subject does it have
su: 
nm5386: yes but what does development imply something starts there so it 
develops so you could say if you were just using one word to just give a title 
to that that this has a historical relevance
su: 
sf5388: it is because of the design and the style of the so he has paid 
attention to the 
nm5386: so you could say that the second one although really interested in the 
design okay and then what about 
su: 
sf5388: demand
nm5386: demand these are all words we associate with economics okay now 
obviously there's a bit of economics in all of these design but this one it 
seems to me on economic er aspect so that's one way of just distinguishing 
because the problem with that you concentrated is that you end up with the text 
and you really wanted a banner headline primary concern in contrast and then 
you've got a sort of way of differentiating between them well teh next thing 
that you're going to have to do have you got some paper there have you got er a 
pen er paper
sf5388: oh yeah
nm5386: now between you you've got to summarise all of that as though you were 
writing in your literature review er so you better get started on that
sm5387: okay
nm5386: okay
su: 
sf5388: he mention-, he mentioned that the first one was about 
sm5387: characterised by a different use so maybe we can write something about 
a different use right i mean the first people he mentioned i think so yes and 
then the last one the latest one is the economic and the second one mentioned 
that but because of the of the U-K they ignoring this image and so 
sf5388: can we begin with the er 
su: 
sm5387: the thing is that the first one the first one it doesn't mention the U-
K and U-S market
sf5388: it can be said that 
su: 
sf5388: since i don't know when its written so er er 
sm5387: because we don't know how to start together so we do it separately 
nm5386: well i think if you do just do that quite quickly because er 
sm5387: sure okay
su: 
sf5388: according to the research by Smith it showed that er the 
nm5386: yes now i think that-, that's a good point but what you want to do is 
to make that point but note also that er that the other two authors don't agree 
with her at all
sf5388: yeah just one
nm5386: yeah and what you're trying to do here is to sort of compare and 
contrast all of them
sf5388: yeah
nm5386: so not just say what each says
sf5388: yeah
nm5386: say point out their difference from something else so you can say 
something like while Smith er er er stresses the old traditional methods is 
concerned with the future new age of manufacturing etcetera etcetera so that 
shows what htis is about it also shows 
su: 
sf5388: the increase-, the demand reason is to meet the capacity and the o-, 
another resaon is to make it cheap increasing demand of the 
sf5389: okay we can make it if you want to we can apply the computerised system 
the thing is that 
su: 
nm5386: how are you doing are you doing well
sm5387: its becoming longer and longer
nm5386: well see that's good you've got the final draft on paper before the er 
su: 
sf5388: design is not for aesthetics only design is sometimes for 
functionalities so we want to be specific we want to emphasise that its for 
aesthetics to make it look attractive
su: 
nm5386: now can everybody see er the camera everybody see that
sm5387: the topic of group is focus on nineteen-ninety-five traditional labour 
er intensive way of making widgets er er two-thousand-one mentioned that to 
meet the market and the economical scope
nm5386: skills
sm5387: skills industries should apply computerized systems in widgets in 
addition to make the widgets more attractive to the market the aest-, 
aesthetics of the widgets should be emphasised
nm5386: emphasised
sm5387: emphasised
nm5386: okay thank you very much now er can you do-, you-, can we just have a 
quick comment on that one before we do yours because that will be different 
from yours i would a word that i would have mentioned i mean you're drawing the 
essence of this book so mention is something that i might mention to you drink 
in a minute but that's not you know this is what the book is about so its 
mentioned is just the wrong word er generally i like the way that flows as a 
sentence er i like the way that you haven't been er constrained by the order in 
which these appear i-, i-, d-, doesn't look as though you just lifted things 
from it er now having said that i think it would be better if you added a 
quotation or two now as we were just discussing you haven't put in a sort of 
final bit about where there might be a gap for further research but er anyway 
well done that's a pretty good piece of work and as we're running out of time 
we'll move swiftly on to the second presentation
sm5387: according to Smith widgets have a place in history he suggests that 
methods of manufacture cannot be by new technology methods his views are not 
shared by manufacturing system he ad-, advocates that his new system will 
reduce the cost of manufacture by half implying costs with steady demand demand 
has been declining the he attributes to neglect of design of the widget by 
manufacturers okay i think we missed something we made a mistake there 
practical application to widget style and colour to to prevent that's supposed 
to be to prevent widget 
nm5386: okay thank you very much and now ah you're getting applause from this 
side of the room er do you four want to make some some comments on on that er 
well i think its good too i think er it could still be slimmed down a little 
bit you've got repetition of er yeah it just you know if you find you're 
repeating the same phrase in the in a piece of work which is compressing so 
much then you know y-, you need to avoid that er but er and i think as i said 
with th-, th-, the first group that would be strengthened by bringing one or 
two of the quotations out a-, and putting them in er but er no i mean tha-, 
that represents er a very good attempt at sort of compressing and 
differentiating between th-, th-, the books and again i think it would be 
helpful if you gave sort of as it were headline er identifications of the books 
so that the first one Smith who takes a historical perspective or a historical 
overview that just sort of signals to the reader what sort of a book it is er 
and then you could look at the er Kilroy and say er that this is actually 
looking primarily at the er aesthetic element of marketing er as i was saying 
to you when i came round y-, you may make a wonderful car but if it looks like 
a dustbin no-one's going to buy it er and so although you've compressed most of 
the information on the sheet you haven't brought that sort of new way of 
showing that you've sort of er taken on board wh-, what each of the books was 
about er but that was a a hard exercise you've all worked very hard i hope 
we're going to t-, take things away from this which you'll find useful er the 
last thing i'm going to say er is if you remember in the lecture Tim said if 
you wanted his lecture notes you could sign up with your emails and he'll do a 
mass emailing so i'm going to put this here
