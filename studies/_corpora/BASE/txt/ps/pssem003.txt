sf5331: maybe number whoever's number eight
sf5329: but how do you know who's gon-, going to be number eight
su: yeah
sf5331: whoever's going to be a number eight
sm5341: do we all get blindfolded at the same time
sm5338: we could kind of clap your number or something instead of like
su: yeah
sf5337: yeah that's a good idea
sm5338: clap your number
sf5329: go round in a circle
sf5336: yeah
sm5339: but how are you going to sort out who is going to go first
sm5341: oh we'll just sort of clap and then
sf5337: pick someone now
sf5336: s-, someone just starts randomly clapping
sf5329: well whoever's number one should clap first 
sm5338: yeah yeah and then like
sf5329: and then they should stand away from the group 
sm5341: what if no-one's number one
sf5329: and then link hold out hands or something and be like i don't know
sm5338: and then like number two walk over to them or whatever
sf5337: yeah yeah what if no-one's no-one's one though
sf5329: yeah yeah number two will have to walk over to then cos you will hear 
them clap and er can walk over to them
sm5341: but i think someone should just clap 
sf5337: i think someone should start because if we're not if we don't start at 
once
sm5339: if we sort if we sort out an order of clapping now
sf5336: right you have ten minutes before your task begins during the task all 
members of the team will be blindfolded and nobody will be allowed to talk at 
the start of the task each team member will be given a number which will be 
known only to them your task is to form your team into a straight line in 
ascending order of numbers you will have ten minutes to complete the task
su: sorry continue
sm5339: unfortunately we're going to have to put someone in charge of sorting 
out 
sf5329: the numbers
sm5339: the clapping
sf5337: sorting out the clapping i think the hand on the shoulder and go in a 
line idea is a good plan like the person at the front like just like touches 
someone on the shoulder and then they do their number and then they can 
position it i don't know
sf5329: yeah yeah 
sf5336: but it's going to be a lot of work for just one person
sm5341: that's alright though
sf5336: but then if you have you cant have more than one because you can't talk 
so it's going to have to be one 
sm5339: if you have two then it's going to mess up
sf5336: yeah exactly
sf5337: so who's volunteering 
sm5341: i can just see this not working actually and everybody just walking off 
over there
sf5337: we need to i think we need to sort of sort of join shoulders or 
something at the start so we don't lose everyone sort of thing
sf5329: well we'll just have to make sure that no-one moves really set a ground 
rule that you don't move until the organiser moves you
sf5336: pulls you and pushes you 
sm5339: if we start in a line at the beginning 
sf5337: yeah yeah
sm5339: then we can swap people round
sf5336: yeah that's a good idea
sm5341: yeah if we can we'll do that but if we can't
sf5331: but if we're in a line you and and there's one person sorting sorting 
you out how are they going to reach
sm5339: 'cause if they're staying behind a line
sm5341: i know i've got
sf5329: but as long as you are in a line it will be easy to find the front or 
the back because you'll just you'll know where people are
sm5341: i've got an idea for the numbers sorry right if if we take it in turns 
to clap and we all clap the number we've got and then the person with the 
lowest number steps back and then the person with the second highest number
su: alright
sm5341: if you can see all you've got to remember is like whether your's was 
highest or second highest
sf5337: but we still won't be able to get ourselves in order doing that cause 
we won't be able to see anything
sm5341: you can hear you can hear the clapping
sf5329: we'll have to set someone now to start clapping and it'll have to go 
anti-clockwise or clockwise
sm5339: if we no if we go in a line now it'll be easier to keep in a line as 
opposed to in a circle when we have to spread out
sf5337: i think yeah i think
sf5329: so is one person going to be in charge of organising
sf5337: Charles i think
sm5339: me alright
sf5337: let's get in a line now
sf5329: if if Charles taps you on the shoulder once you're blindfolded then 
clap your number again
sf5331: are you organising
sf5329: yeah
sf5331: right
sf5337: does that sound all right
sf5333: well maybe maybe if say if we choose like Natalie claps first and 
Natalie claps and i think okay my number's lower than Natalie so i'm going to 
go to her left hand side and if your number's higher than Natalie's you go on 
her right and then she gives a signal to say like or maybe we have a signal 
that we've all finished so we could like all do something to say yeah we've all 
finished and then we like maybe then Claire does hers Claire claps hers but 
then i don't know
sf5330: what's the second what can the second one be when you're finished 
besides clapping
su: no that just sounds exactly the same
sf5330: i can't whistle
sf5333: are we allowed to use vocals at all or just not talking
nm5327: you'll have to read the rules
sf5333: it just say nobody's allowed to talk but it doesn't say no noises
sf5334: we could make animal noises moo
sm5340: no
nm5327: except we've got two koalas
su: yeah they don't make any noise though
sf5330: what sound does a flamingo make 
sf5333: what does a giraffe do i don't know
sf5337: okay so should we recap so eveyone knows what we are doing er are we 
standing in a line cause C-, Charles okay if he he's going to be leader if he 
stands at the end
sm5339: if i if i stand if i stand at this end and start the clapping and then 
we go along on a line
sf5337: and yeah and if he and he's going to try and put you in order and if he 
taps you on the side then clap 
sm5341: and then he can just work out where
sf5337: and then he can work it out right so should we get in a line
sm5339: so if someone has someone gets number one-hundred and three 
sf5333: er okay so it can't be clapping we've got that
sf5330: i don't know actually animal noises are quite a good idea
sf5333: we could do that or i can't even do that
sf5334: yeah a noise like that yeah and then we know
sf5333: ok so maybe when we're all so when you've kind of stopped you can just 
go and then like we'll just wait until everyone's done it so you have to wait 
until you've heard it six times or something i don't know
sm5340: what so we're saying highest number to the right and lowest number to 
the left yeah
sf5333: shall we have like a practice run just pretend we've got numbers okay
su: yeah that's a good plan
su: how many of us are there's six
sm5340: okay
sf5333: can we get in a line already so should we go in this order so if we 
remember or do you reckon should we go in likealphabetical order so we remember 
who's next
su: yeah
sf5333: cause i won't remember who's standing next to me
sm5340: okay so i'm at the back
sf5333: where am i C you're at the end you're first Claire so you stand this 
end i'll stand next to you
sf5334: are we doing surname or first name
sf5333: first name i can't remember surnames
sm5340: wait wait names
sf5333: okay so do you want to go first close your eyes so we can feel like 
we're into it
sf5330: okay what am i doing
sf5333: you're just choosing a number in your head pretending we're having a 
practice run
sf5330: okay i'll need to clap
sf5333: so just clap and then when you clap we're all going to move round you
sf5330: all of you okay
sf5333: yeah er 
sf5334: actually no i think she should move into her position she should move 
down the line and go one two three
sf5333: but how does she how does she
sf5330: but i don't know what everyone else has got
su: how does she know
sm5340: yeah what if someone's picked the same number
sf5333: we have got ten minutes to move so we could listen to everyone's and 
we'll remember like what order we're in cause we're in alphabetical order then 
when we've heard everyone's like we could say okay now after we've heard Vince 
Claire moves
sf5330: yeah
sf5334: yeah might be a better idea
sf5330: yeah then we stop and then start
sf5333: so she has to think okay am i going to go like and she can stand in 
well she can feel she can say right okay i'm the i'm like number two so she's 
if her number's fourth in the line she'll make sure she's standing in front of 
sf5330: that's a good idea actually
sf5333: Natalie so if she just moves in front of Natalie and then or maybe er 
sf5330: yeah that's good if we all do it like do our numbers first and then 
we'll move from there once everyone else has done it yeah
ss: yeah
sf5333: okay so should we just have a practice and see if it works go on then
sm5339: start the start the line now 
sf5337: Charles does it yeah
sf5329: are we standing
sm5339: i'll stand this way
su: right we're standing like that 
su: like this 
sf5337: we can't even in a line
sf5331: are we standing side to side or
sf5329: yeah stand like that
sf5331: okay
sf5329: facing this way and then he can walk along our back's and do it
sf5331: okay
sf5337: yeah it'll be easier once its in a line yeah
sf5336: right 
sf5337: we've still got five minutes
sf5336: we've still got five minutes yeah
sf5337: right so is everyone clear
sf5331: so how are you going to confirm at the end just go along and touch 
everyone on the shoulder
sm5339: yeah touch everyone's shoulder and we have to count
sm5338: well touch it twice
sf5337: what
sf5329: well as long as he touches your shoulder you know to clap so
sm5341: yeah but then everybody's just going to be clapping
sf5337: well when he's done it 
sf5330: what if we all get the same number
sf5333: so you're going to do a clap
sf5330: yeah okay
sf5333: oh well that's just we'll deal with that if it happens
sf5330: er 
su: i didn't even hear that
su: honestly
sf5333: no we have to clap pretty loud see we have to i'm thinking now are we 
going to are we going to do a count to kind of five so i'm going to go and then 
do mine
su: yeah i think so
sf5330: yeah
sf5333: just so there's enough gap okay so we've all we've all heard that okay 
sf5336: what if the numbers are really high numbers
sm5339: i know
sm5338: i don't think they will be
sf5331: they can't be that would be cruel surely it's got to be one to eight
sf5337: how long have we got to actually complete the whole thing we've got 
time to clap a hundred haven't we
su: problem is going round
sm5341: right if they are really high numbers we'll just like clap each digit 
so if it's like three-hundred and ten you just clap three times
sm5338: how are you going to know that
sf5331: yeah how are you it's not one two three space
sm5341: for the nought for the nought no just go one two three one and then do 
ten for the nought because you can't do nought
su: and how do you not know it's three-thousand one-hundred and ten
sm5341: because nought is ten claps it's not going to happen so it doesn't 
matter
su: i bet it will
sm5339: if it's a high number right say if you are number ten
sm5341: number ten just clap ten times cause 
sf5337: if it's a high number can't we do the like one O five or something like 
that with our hands
sf5329: he won't be able to see that's the only trouble
sm5339: we have to do we have to do the clapping we have to sort it out if we 
have a if it's a number higher than ten i go with his idea if you do it in sets 
so if it's three hundred you do three then wait a bit then two for twenty
sf5331: what if it's a nought
sm5339: if it's a nought you do ten
sf5337: so if its three-hundred you do three then ten and then another ten
sm5339: you do three then ten then ten
sf5336: or can't cant you just stamp your feet or something for a nought
sf5337: oh yeah okay yeah
sf5336: go one two three and then stamp and then stamp again
sf5337: so that would be three-hundred so three hundred and two would be 
sf5336: yeah 
su: right
sf5331: how will you ever remember all those numbers 
sm5339: i'm not it's gon-, it's going to take about twenty minutes for me to 
sort everyone out
sf5337: but if it's below ten
sf5336: how long have we got
sf5331: it must be just one it must be i hope so
sf5329: okay so what
sf5336: we've got ten minutes to do it
sf5329: which end is going to be the low end and which end is going to be the 
high end
sf5336: right so ascending order
sm5339: okay this is going to be do we have to be in a straight line
sf5329: yeah we've got to be in ascending order
sm5338: yeah people need to move a bit further along sort of thing
sm5339: yeah but if we if we have this end as the low end and then everyone 
turns to the left once we're finished then we'll be in a straight line 
ascending order now which way round
sm5341: i'm sure when when we've heard everyone clap like right near the end if 
someone's in the wrong place we'll know
su: even if we start this way we'll be okay
sm5341: we just go down the whole line
sm5338: we could like pass people along and like if they're a number lower than 
you you pass them that way sort of thing and so go along the line and clap then 
if like 
sm5341: yeah yeah that's what i was saying earlier on
sm5338: yeah why don't we do that then
sf5337: you're just going to have to sort of drag us
sf5331: and to er make sure they who it you've got to be touching as well just 
in case you just sort of fall over or something
sf5329: or somebody ends up down there or something
sm5340: this is so not what are we doing
sf5333: Claire are you going to move first
sf5330: i can't remember what everyone's was
su: it's going to be so funny on the video
sf5333: oh no okay yeah i'm trying i'm trying to do it in my head so i'm going 
okay three like five one two four six and 
su: you did five i did four and six
sf5333: so i was just kind of trying to think that in my head
sf5334: cos maybe if number one moves along the line first the person who's 
number one
sm5340: no what if the person from yeah
sf5332: yeah moves to the end and nu-, number two moves
sf5333: so how do how do we kn-, know we're going to get number one and number 
two and number three and number four and number five we could get like twenty-
five or a hundred
su: well the lowest number then
sm5340: well if we move the back person moves first and then the next person 
and then after you've finished moving you just like clap or something or does 
that sound st-, 
sf5333: that's so the person who knows they've got the lowest number is going to
sm5340: yeah
sf5330: come to the end or go to
sf5334: yeah the person with the lowest number if they just go okay everyone's 
finished clapping and then th-, they just go like this and make sure they're at 
the front and just feel their way to the front
sm5340: oh yeah yeah yeah
su: yeah
sf5333: and Claire's pretty tall so you can just go okay i'm
sf5334: yeah and then just like each person 
sm5340: yeah that'll work that'll work
sf5334: then the second highest number then move until they are second to the 
front
sf5333: yeah
sf5334: what do you reckon
sf5333: and if we if we know this order then we know like what order we clapped 
in so we should know who's got the number next to us so we can say okay this is 
i've got she's next to me and she's next to me
sf5334: if yeah but if they give us really high numbers and we're going one two 
three four five six seven eight nine ten then we're not going to remember what 
we each clapped
sf5333: okay we could we could
sf5332: what could be like a signal to like if we don't hear it we need 
something to like get someone to repeat do you know what i mean
sf5333: we could actually do it two times
sf5334: yeah so we 
sf5333: cause we've got enough time to do it two times i reckon
su: cause it's not timed when we actually do is it
sf5333: it's ten minutes just got ten minutes to get into it
su: ten minutes before your task 
sf5333: you know what we could do if it's double figures we could do like
su: oh yeah ten minutes
sm5340: no we need 
sf5334: does anybody know how long we've had
sm5340: er 
sf5334: no
sf5333: oh shit we didn't do that
sf5334: nevermind we're quite sorted anyway
sf5333: okay i reckon if it's double figures or triple figures we have to do it 
so like maybe if it's twenty-seven you could do like 
su: yeah do that inbetween
sm5340: what hold tight
sf5333: so you know that like
su: twenty-seven twenty-seven yeah 
sf5333: and then kind of because otherwise we're going to be going oh my god 
quick i've got to do thisand to count and it's just going to be crazy
su: okay so that's the 
sf5333: right we'll have to look 
sm5340: i thought this was i thought we'd be i thought we were just being given 
numbers from one to six
sf5330: it just says numbers doesn't it
sf5333: it just says numbers so we have to like just be prepared
sm5340: do you want to drop a hint
sf5335: if it's something like one-hundred then you're going to be like 
su: zero
sf5330: oh yeah what 
su: if it's zero you're going to have to do something else
sf5334: what are you just going to go so you know you've had a number inbetween 
but it's a nothing number
sf5333: yeah but have that for zero oh yeah but what are we going to do if it's 
to separate oh this 
sm5340: this is so not going to work at all er 
su: that doesn't sound much different does it
sf5333: it does sound quite different 
su: you can tell i think
sf5333: so that could be maybe be 
sf5334: we could do a dance
sf5333: that could maybe be zero
sm5339: ah yeah okay 
sm5338: what he's going to tap us on the shoulder and then 
sf5337: oh yeah
nm5326: okay could i have everybody's attention please right could you please 
all put your blindfold's on and you must stop talking at this point
su: what about our number
sm5340: have we actually decided what we're doing
nm5326: stop talking
sf5336: oh my glasses
nm5326: stop talking please and put your blindfolds on alright okay okay 
there's going to be er a couple minutes now whilst we go through er giving you 
all the numbers so jus-, just wait someone will come and er come and one of one 
of my-, myself or my colleagues will come and er tap you on the shoulder and 
just er just do what we what we say and listen listen to us okay remember you 
can't talk and you can't take your blindfold off and just be patient cause it's 
going to take a couple of minutes and then after after the couple of minutes er 
i'll i'll say you can start the task alright so just be patient and wait for me 
to say start and remember there's no talking
nm5326: minus one
nm5326: you're zero two
nm5327: okay i'm just going to lead you off from the group this way yeah okay 
nm5326: okay you're one million one-hundred and three okay you may start the 
task
nm5327: you are pretty much back in your team now okay
nm5326: okay stop and you can take your blindfolds off 
su: don't don't move after you have taken them off
su: hi
su: hi
su: the light
su: in the wrong place 
nm5327: we have an extra team member don't don't don't go over there yet
nm5327: so so what was your what was your number
sf5335: two
su: seven
sm5340: three point one
sf5333: oh no
sf5332: three point two 
sf5333: three point two three point two we thought we were all three point two
sf5334: zero
sf5330: minus one
nm5327: alright pretty good and what's your number
sf5331: i'm with that team and i was number two
nm5327: oh you were number two
su: we were like this
nm5326: so did you were you anywhere near the right order when you finished
sf5329: i was zero so
sf5337: i think we were in the right order
sf5329: they're in order i think he ordered up them but we were kind of stuck
nm5326: so right okay so a few of you were in the right order okay Charles 
Karen do you want to rejoin them
sf5337: he was probably looking for er 
sm5341: Charles did you have your blindfold on you had a blindfold on
su: you know when you were when you were following somebody you were following 
somebody with their feet in the grass it was him filming you
sm5339: yeah oh right
om5328: i thought i was filming a zombie movie there you were coming towards me 
like this
sm5339: how did we do did we get anyone anywhere near
nm5326: i think you got about four people in the right order
sm5339: i found four people and then couldn't find anyone else
sf5336: clapping three times a group of three and then two yeah so i was just 
like
sf5331: yeah i just stood and waited and thought they know what they're doing 
they'll come and get me in a minute
sm5340: cause i thought you'd put us in like different parts of the field and i 
was like hang on where is everyone
sf5333: yeah i was just like and then i could hear you lot laughing and was 
like that's Vince that's Vince
sm5340: i was just pissing myself laughing i just oh yeah i knew it was you i 
knew it was you pissing yourself it was like yeah go on then
sf5333: i couldn't stop laughing i'm like i'm just standing here
su: the signal should have been 
sf5333: and then i was like to you everyone was clapping so i was like i can f-,
and i was just like er no i came to you first i'm just going to write my 
number down cause i don't i didn't know how to mine had got a point
sf5334: i didn't really mind so much cause i was like i'm zero i'm the lowest i 
must be the lowest and you kept moving and i was like
su: when he said three point two i went er oh
sf5333: how annoying
nm5327: what did you think when i showed you there was someone else next to you
sm5340: you didn't
nm5327: to your to your right cause we had an extra team person so you'd all 
sort of arranged yourselves but we had this extra spurious person on the end
sf5330: it didn't feel quite right cause i was sure everyone else was like
sf5333: cause i was we were all standing here then i was like hang on there's 
only like five of us
sm5340: yeah
su: so i just thought er 
nm5327: who was the last person to join
su: yeah i didn't think
sf5335: i know i didn't know where i was
nm5327: they sort of they sort of didn't realise
sm5340: i was completely lost and didn't know what was going on until i i got 
dragged down i was like oh what like just like
sf5332: i think i was just standing there by myself for about like ten minutes 
then
sf5331: oh right
sf5337: see i was like
sf5331: i don't know i just stayed there and waited
sf5329: i followed the whistling
sf5337: oh god
sm5339: was anyone a minus number
su: er 
su: no
sm5339: i was 
sm5338: really
sm5339: i got minus one
sf5337: it's a good job you were like sorting then otherwise
sf5329: and i got zero 
sf5336: and i was a half 
sf5329: you were a half
sf5336: i was thinking to myself how am i going to get a half so i was thinking 
like to do nought point five to go nought one two three four five but i didn't 
know if that'd work
sm5341: that would've worked because no numbers start with nought do they
su: yeah
sf5329: yeah nought five
nm5326: right do you want do you guys want to do the review bit stay outside or 
go back into the place
su: what do you reckon
nm5326: go back in right okay
nm5326: so we'll start the review off in the same way if you don't mind just 
i'll just give you two minutes to er it's the same set of headings i think 
aren't there on the second page there er just er open right yeah okay er so if 
you just do the same as last time
nm5326: so i've just given you a bit of opportunity there to sort of have 
another experience and er just to start reflecting individually so alright with 
your notes if you just draw out some of that reflection into group discussion 
reflections so er anyone want to throw anything in on feelings this time
su: horrible
nm5326: it was horrible
su: yeah
sm5341: i thought it was quite funny actually
sm5338: yeah i thought it was
nm5326: it was very funny watching it i tell you
sf5336: yes i did think about that i was like oh no people are watching me 
doing this just walking around randomly clapping
nm5326: it was bit scary 
sf5329: yeah i wasn't expecting us to all get split up like that
sm5341: i kind of was
sm5339: that was the thing that went wrong
sm5341: yeah i was kind of expecting him to give like decimal numbers and stuff 
but i thought no he won't be do that because 
sf5337: be that cruel
nm5326: now what you didn't realise was of course i was just listening to 
everything you were suggesting and made sure i gave you something that didn't 
you hadn't thought of er ok some of you thought it was funny some of you 
thought it was scary any other feelings
sm5339: i felt like an idiot i was the only person moving around and wandered 
off in completely the wrong direction
nm5326: it was really quite at the very very end of the game it was everyone 
was stationary the whole field and you were just wandering around chasing this 
chap
sf5334: right what reactions did anyone have
sm5340: very hard
su: very hard
su: difficult
sf5333: i thought it was going be actually when when we first read it i was 
thinking ah this'll be easy but i didn't realise when you could hear everyone 
else clapping i was like oh no
sm5340: i didn't know we were getting taken away
sf5332: yeah nor did i 
sm5340: cause i thought we would have stayed in those lines but obviously not
sf5332: but that was the part of our plan i decided that planning was rubbish
su: yeah
sf5334: er so what else very hard
sf5333: i didn't think we'd actually do it i just thought er 
su: no 
sf5332: it didn't work really
nm5327: but your reaction at the end being you said being you said you didn't 
think you were going to do it but
sf5330: i thought it was quite a good result it worked out alright in the end
su: we got together in a line
sf5333: yeah i was quite pleased we all found each other
sm5340: how on earth we managed to like almost do it was like
sf5334: i felt stupid
sf5333: yeah yeah like you were the only person doing it like er cause you 
couldn't like call out and like reassure yourself that there was also other 
people also like feeling as stupid as you 
sf5334: yeah and you felt like everyone else had taken their blindfold and you 
were still standing there going
sf5333: i know at the end cause cause you couldn't tell the time like i was 
standing there and i was thinking what if everyone's taken them off and i'm 
just like stood here on my own er 
sm5340: i felt well uncomfortable with that blindfold on though i just couldn't 
stand it i just oh
nm5327: so uncomfortable yeah
nm5326: how about feelings about how the team worked this specific exercise or 
the more general
sf5329: i think we managed to set up a good plan yeah and we had a good code 
for the numbers cause we managed to deal with like the big numbers
su: yeah
sm5341: i think we all managed to find each other pretty well
sm5338: yeah that was er that was 
sm5341: well we managed to find some of us
sf5329: we did get Charles put four people in a a line so at least you know it 
was
nm5326: yes yes you achieved at least a good quarter of your objectives
sm5339: four out of eight
nm5326: yeah yeah well that that's alright but that's really important because 
but it's it's often very difficult to achieve all the objectives but you can 
feel good about having got some of the way there
sf5334: er what did we do well
sf5335: i think we did plan it though we planned it but it just didn't go 
according to it and i think we did try
sf5333: i think we did good improvisation cause we managed to put we must have 
something that could have worked cause everybody else was doing it so we were 
just like
nm5327: you you you did do a plan now on the way in you were saying well that 
was a load of rubbish making a plan but did any part of your plan help you 
achieve what you achieved
su: i don't
sf5334: the clicking did cause i had zero and that was our signal for zero and 
i was like ah excellent
nm5327: that's right that was quite good and i thought in your plan you 
realised that there could be a zero that's something that not many people 
realise you realised there could be high numbers okay
su: and it wouldn't have to be one to six
nm5327: so i think it was you you said that didn't you it doesn't have to be 
one to six and everybody started y-, challenging you so it seemed to me given 
that the er problem with your plan was that there was er er er unpredictable 
thing happened
sf5333: we should have asked more we should have asked more questions or like 
the like thought of finding out more information like we should like we thought 
we could stand in a line which obviously we couldn't do and like so that was 
pointless and yeah
sf5330: yeah i suppose we didn't think that they were have to negative numbers 
or
su: no we didn't plan for like every occasion
su: or points decimal points
su: yeah
nm5327: well we've gone from in the first task you said we didn't want a plan 
it's useless and now you made a plan and then you're saying well you're what we 
didn't do was plan for every eventuality but should we do that
sf5333: it's a different sort of thing it's you know it's different
sf5334: yeah more like logic thing that was more practical so it's better to 
get in there whereas this was kind of i don't know using all your senses a 
different type of and if you can't see like you really need a plan really 
because you know and if you can't talk either they're two of the main things 
that you'd use 
sf5333: yeah cause the other problem was we were constantly communicating but 
we actually like couldn't almost at all communicate
sf5334: yeah
nm5327: in an-, any situation in any task you do in your life it's er there's 
always something crops up that you don't expect but does that mean you should 
or shouldn't have a plan anyway
su: no you should have one anyway
nm5327: i thought your plan was fantastic completely different you for the 
first task you came back and made a plan you you planned for all sorts which a 
lot of the teams probably would've done but then the worst and this whole task 
is designed to give you unexpected things that couldn't possibly have formed 
part of your plan to say look cope with that
sf5333: yeah like two of the same same number and stuff i thought three of us 
did but
nm5326: er okay what about what you did what was what was best John
sm5338: er i thought like the system was quite good apart from not being 
prepared for negative numbers and decimals and stuff like that but that was but 
i thought that er 
nm5326: so so how about generalising about how the how would how would you say 
say that i agree with you in as the way the team worked in a more general way 
how did you see that how did you come to the system
sm5338: we all discussed it 
nm5326: did you all discuss it anyone
sm5338: 
sm5341: well we sort of
sf5329: we discussed it more than last time
sm5341: i think we sort of split into two little groups talking about stuff and 
then we just joined together
nm5326: so you've got quite a big group so that's interesting isn't it that you 
split up
sm5341: sorry 
nm5326: er how did that happen how did you get back together was it spontaneous 
or did someone
sf5329: it just seemed to happen
sm5339: i just heard them talking and he had a go at it so but he doctored it
su: yeah
sm5341: did you see us talking
sm5339: er clapping stamping your feet
sf5336: yeah they came up with 
nm5326: so that's just so mmm turn your phone off mate er right so so Charles 
you sort of f-, felt that something good was going on in the other sort of 
subgroup so you kind of dragged dragged everyone back s-, so that that's 
interesting you didn't just carry with your own group so you thought well let's 
listen to someone else's findings th-, that's really good that's the thing with 
good things if they happen the team tend to make them make things work okay 
what was bad sorry what could we have done better
sm5339: if we'd had a way of finding each other at the beginning
sf5336: yeah but then that was that was a bit unexpected so
sm5339: yes
nm5326: okay so how did you cope with it
sf5329: who who started whistling then
sm5341: that was me
sf5329: yeah that that helped us all group together i did think if that hadn't 
of happened i'd have
nm5326: okay did you
sf5336: except i didn't know i didn't know if it was another group
sm5341: yeah but i thought
sf5329: i just felt it was in the general direction
nm5326: so with the whistle improvisation and some of you responded so cause it 
could have been a disaster because if what was really funny is three out of the 
four groups were clapping so and er er yeah so so there was was some good 
improvisation there try and do something different
sm5341: i think who is it who got the nought point five yeah i think you 
thought of the right idea i think if you'd done that did you do it
sf5336: well no not really because the way i stood behind the line and then i 
thought somebody was going to tap me on the shoulder and nobody came and is 
anybody there i thought she was already in the line
sf5329: i thought i was in the line but i wasn't
nm5326: what else okay so you you got something unexpected and you dealt with 
it the best you could really that's that's 
er which is which is great er anything else you felt could have been done better
sf5333: i think that er we should have come up with a more original plan cause 
we i mean that i didn't realised we were all going to be mixed up but i think 
we should have thought like well everyone's going to clap and like that
sf5335: to come up with new ideas
sf5333: yeah cause when we were all obviously talking and clapping and it 
didn't really take into consideration that actually there was a lot of noise 
going on around us cause when you're you can hear like you get confusing so
su: yeah more 
sf5333: yeah we could have had something a bit more different we didn't time 
keep again when we had our plan someone said like how long have we got and we 
couldn't time keep when we had our blindfolds on cause i was like oh it's 
alright i'll look at my watch and i was like oh no i won't be able to
su: but we we wanted to but 
sf5333: so that was er 
nm5327: well i don't know did you time keep in the first ten minutes
su: no that's the bit we forgot
sf5335: but we intended to sorry
su: we get so excited by it
sf5333: yeah it was just all exciting again
nm5327: is that how you all feel Vince are you feeling right excited about the 
tasks
su: he loves it
sm5340: no
sf5333: thrilled in fact
sm5340: er no well er kind of well i'm not like really dark about it actually 
i'll go along with it
nm5327: so did you i mean did you did you think you did well in that task
sm5340: but we did surprisingly better than i thought we did when i was like 
stranded on my own
su: i think we did at the other one
sf5333: and we were just laughing i thought no
sm5340: yeah that's the thing oh i thought just forget it just wait here until 
the ten minutes go by but somehow i managed to well figure out what er 
nm5327: so were you o-, you you'd made your plan you was quite confident you 
were going to get it done and then all of a sudden
sm5340: it just went pear-shaped
nm5327: it went pear-shaped and you thought there's no way we're going to 
achieve it but then at the end of it
sm5340: i got dragged about a bit and put in like almost the right position yeah
nm5327: anybody else thoughts on this how their thought process went throughout 
the task
sf5330: i think it definitely felt quite hopeless in the beginning
sf5335: yeah i thought that i was going to have to like stand there for ten 
minutes as well i thought
sf5330: you feel like yeah
sf5333: just wait for someone to find you at some point and then i was thinking 
well no-one's going to find me cause you're probably all thinking the same 
thing going off and then i just and then i just started laughing and then i was 
like i can hear someone laughing oh it's just it was just weird
nm5327: did anybody cheat
su: yeah i could see 
nm5327: did anybody feel like cheating
sf5333: yeah you could see just in front of you so like when i saw like Vince's 
trainers were right there i was like oh it is him kind of thing
su: yeah
sm5340: i was kind of going like that and just trying to see i don't know just 
see the tops or something it was just er yeah
nm5326: what about the initial planning stage could it have been better er 
taking into account
sf5329: take into take into account a bigger range of numbers
nm5326: okay how could you seen how could you have ensured that happened or not 
ensured how could you have tried to make that happen it's difficult that
sf5329: it is yeah
nm5326: but er was there any-, anyone got any comments anyone feel that they 
weren't being listened to or that they think anyone think any any thoughts on 
how could could of how you could of got maybe thought of more numbers how many 
people said oh no they'll never do that
sm5341: i did
sf5337: i thought they might be high numbers but i didn't think of negatives or 
decimals at all i just didn't i didn't even think about
sf5329: it didn't even occur to me
nm5326: so maybe the they'll never do that maybe y-, you should say er maybe 
su: they might
nm5326: maybe what what er what didn't happen was no-one said oh they probably 
will or what else could they do but er so i just wondered there were a few 
people saying they'll never they'll never do that which is what i would have 
said as well i 
it's not a criticism i'm just making observations er any so con-, conclusions 
here on what you might try and do better next time
sf5329: be more open-minded about the possible problems you could have thrown 
at you
su: yeah think about
nm5326: okay so that's where if we look back at our ground rules it's it's 
around here again isn't it it's the er if you think you've got a whacky idea be 
prepared to speak up and er other people should keep an open-mind and er and er 
and er listen listen to others but er overall you felt good about it which is 
great any er any other comments have you got any comments about it
sf5336: no
nm5326: no you agree with the general sort of conclusion of the team anyone else
sf5331: i think we did listen to each other a bit better this time and the 
initial plan would have been good in practice had we been more open-minded
nm5326: yeah you were well on the way to a good plan and you ach-, you were 
well on the way to achieving your objectives yeah so you feel y-, you feel that 
you do you is that true that you feel that you worked better then in this 
exercise than in the first one which is interesting cause you didn't actually 
achieve your objectives before er 
su: yeah but i think we worked
su: i think we worked
nm5326: it was harder it was harder any any more comments
nm5326: i wondered whether at the expense of that time er thinking about er 
because unfortunately the morning's s-, soon going to be over but towards the 
end of the morning i think it it would be nice if you could start pulling out 
some conclusions which you may well take forward with you into the rest of your 
lives er being ambitious here er but what i'd like you to do is er just maybe 
think for a few minutes about coming up with some kind of model some kind of 
plan for problem-solving in a team er now there's two ways you can do this now 
i'll i'll i'll ask you to decide given that we've got the two groups merged you 
could actually split and we could do this would that be a good idea cause then 
we could discuss both
su: both would be 
nm5326: would that be a good idea or would you rather stay in your you've got 
used to being in a big group you want to stay in a big group
sf5336: i think that it'd be easier to split up into two
nm5326: yeah i think that might be quite nice cause er so so you're group ten 
right you four over there and you were group one over this side why don't we 
just spend five minutes then in separate groups of four and think about er just 
coming up with a bit of model a plan er strategy for the future which you can 
apply in the next exercise we're going to do but that you can also apply er in 
the in the more real world situation the future so i'll give you five minutes 
in your do you want to have a little table and just sit round it er f-, five 
minutes just to have a think er and then and then we can just er report on it 
again maybe if you just want to pull back up a bit so i'll give you five to ten 
minutes to think come up with a plan a strategy a vague or a very precise if 
you want strategy of how you how you might do better you know what i'm what i'm 
asking are you clear with what i'm asking you to do
sf5331: i think so yeah
sf5336: er 
sf5329: so we've got to think what's the first thing you do
sf5331: well what's the task
sf5329: yeah make su-, make sure everyone understands the task yeah
sf5331: and then er maybe even er if it's a if it's a kind of complicated thing 
we could just write down the tasks number them
sf5336: er or underline the key points like cause the first one was a really 
big like long bit we could underline that i suppose 
sf5331: and er and tasks need to be delegated efficiently everybody needs to be 
clear first of all of the task what they should be doing and what role they 
should be playing i think it's always what i i feel you should always have a a 
leader and follow what he somebody who
sf5329: yeah yeah somebody who can make sure everybody has okay
sf5336: right er and 
sf5329: i suppose it's more open discussion isn't it
sf5336: yeah like putting ideas forward
sf5331: brainstorming
sf5329: yeah brainstorming yeah
sf5329: and then then you have to cut it down and try and think what's the best 
ideas that have come out of that brainstorming
sf5336: yeah and make sure everyone's involved
sf5329: and make sure everyone agrees as well well to the best er as possible
sf5336: er and make sure you try and think about every like eventuality
sf5329: yeah
sf5331: okay i suppose that's reiterating being more open-minded all round and 
just preparing for every eventuality but then we would never have known that 
for that task would well well i would never have thought we'd be given minus 
numbers
sf5329: i didn't think we'd get split up no er okay and then i suppose make a 
definite plan and run through it a few times
sf5336: yeah make make sure everybody knows what they're doing
sf5329: make everyone su-, yeah what their role is make sure everyone's got 
like their own role
sf5331: yeah do the task 
sf5329: do the task
sf5336: very important part
sf5329: should we start writing this down
sf5336: yeah how are we going to fit it into this space
sf5329: er i don't know some sort of flow diagram i suppose would be alright
sf5336: er so what was the first bit
sf5331: identify a task and er 
sf5336: yeah
sf5329: yeah
sf5331: er 
sf5336: delegate roles
sf5331: yeah
sf5329: do the task but er we've got to pick out the key issues
sf5331: okay
sf5329: brainstorming
sf5336: and make sure everyone in the team is involved
sf5331: and is aware of what their responsibility is
sf5336: yeah
sf5331: prepare for any eventuality depending er nevertheless you know you know 
howev-, however obscure it might be
sf5336: yeah obscure
sf5329: i suppose then you form your definite plan that should be 
sf5331: definite plan 
sf5329: make sure people understand it
sf5331: yeah
sf5329: and then
sf5331: again do the
sf5329: do the task
nm5327: so in your in your plan which i think as i said i think that was a 
tremendous improvement over the first task did you end up doing what you said 
you'd do or how did the plan change
sf5334: we said we'd time keep i mean and we didn't so
nm5327: what about this i saw you sort of people were writing on people's hands 
was that part of your plan
sf5333: no
sm5340: no that was improvised
su: that was improvisation
sf5332: that was probably a better idea
su: we came up with that er 
sf5333: i just started tapping Claire and then i was like er oh i was like 
trying to do it on your arm and then i was like it's not working so i was like 
okay i'll just spell it out and then everyone started doing it i don't
nm5327: now has er has anybody started to think about er a model for problem 
solving a model for problem solving out of what we've done so far should there 
be a model that we follow in every task
su: plan
nm5327: okay plan
sf5333: i think it's different cause it depends on the task cause problems that 
we had in the first task we solved in a different way to like how we solved 
them in this task cause we just laughed
sm5340: yeah
nm5327: what what 
sf5330: i think you need to get all your ideas together and sort of
sf5332: knowing what you're doing and things
nm5327: so you need to that's part of the plan isn't it don't you think so what 
do i what've i been giving you to put forward to start with
sf5333: everyone needs to know what's going on cause if one of us tries to er 
sf5332: depends what the object at the end of the task is
nm5327: that's good the object and then we provide you with information can't 
we so i'm giving you a sheet with all the information and then you're planning
sm5341: there but these problems are not but they mean different things then 
you er decide on all the obstacles and how important they are and then no we 
put discuss didn't so was that was that after yeah
sm5338: discuss what has to be done
sm5341: and then i'm getting confused now er 
nm5326: er its coming great so far
sm5341: er no put forward ideas of how to do what has to be done then and that 
sort of comes back down if there's any problems in that the idea is you have to 
go all the way back round
nm5326: okay
sm5341: and it goes back up to the top cause we might just not be able to think 
of anything and then hopefully we can get a solution at the bottom
nm5326: okay great yes makes sense to me er that er with that er do we have a 
volunteer from group one 
sf5336: i'll do it 
nm5326: thanks Lucas
sf5336: you'll have to tell me if i do anything wrong or leave something right 
the first thing is to identify the task and the key points from it and the 
second one we put delegate roles and possibly a leader
nm5326: which is something that we we haven't discussed really yet hasn't 
really happened much
sf5336: but Karen thought it was good to have a leader in this sorry and then 
we put er brainstorm ideas and er make sure everybody er and then for the next 
one we put er that ensure every member is aware of the task and the role that 
they're going to play in it and er and oh prepare for the unexpected
nm5326: right difficult but
sf5336: just try and er 
nm5326: you tell me what happens of course if you?ve done these two things er 
well if you've brainstormed and you've made sure that everyone's been involved 
usually that's as much as you can do to prepare for unexpected to try and 
listen to everyone's possible
sf5336: er and then prep-, form a definite plan once you've done all of that 
just go through it again and then the last thing we put do the task and then 
review it at the end
nm5326: yeah do and review great thanks very much
sf5336: was there anything i missed out
su: no
nm5327: again i think the one thing you did much better this time was actually 
assimilate the information okay so you had things you had realised that the 
numbers were not necessarily going to be one to six and then Vince you said ah 
they're just going to be one to six aren't they
sm5340: that's what i assumed so yeah
nm5327: yeah so again that's interesting that's what we talked about in the 
first task about assuming things then but you you were accurate and that had 
come from assimilating the information
sf5333: yeah i think er after we like tried it out i think we like realised 
there's problems like you know if like we all said if it's what do we do so 
like i suppose yeah
nm5327: so and after the plan what did we do after you'd made your plan what's 
the next 
nm5327: you put your plan into action 
sf5333: do a trial run
nm5327: do a trial run and then what did you do during the trial run have you 
just come out of that with a late night at the Union there so you you actually 
did a trial which i thought was good and then you discussed what had happened 
didn't you you you reviewed didn't you i think and that's a sort of an er 
iterative process isn't it so reviewed what you did and then put something else 
into action and then you review that and you should keep going round that 
circle until you er are confident that what you're going to do is achieve your 
object look i means there's no i mean we've there's there's no er one way of 
putting down words to go through the process there's many many different 
processes of doing tasks so we are we happy with that or not or there anything 
else we should add do we need to cross anything out and after the first task 
you wanted to get rid of that do you still want to get rid of it or should we 
leave it in Claire
sf5330: er i think we should probably leave it in
nm5327: you think we should leave it in
sf5330: yeah
su: yeah
su: yeah
nm5327: you don't have to
sm5340: oh we won't then
nm5327: okay so i i think a plan in any type of task is probably a good idea 
even if it only takes thirty seconds you've got something in your head right 
and er the information as well i think er well i think it goes without saying 
you know if you if you if you go and play any game and the game can be an essay 
or an exam or something you need to know the rules there'll be a certain 
percentage of the players in an exam or a task that don't bother looking at the 
rules and you're going to beat them if you know the rules because there will be 
people that hand their essay's in late there will be people who write too few 
words okay and those people as long as you fulfil the rules that just puts you 
up up the league table or it puts you closer to achieving that task i think er 
then in fact the object is good in fact think that's another thing you're doing 
very well actually making it real especially you two in the first task that you 
said oh it's just a bit of water didn't you then you said no no it's real like 
that's good cause it gets you quite focussed on on what's going on okay we're 
almost finished what we're supposed to do now we're ahead of time now unless 
anybody's got anything else they want to say about the two tasks we've done so 
far feeling like part of a team yeah
su: yeah
sf5332: yeah 
nm5327: one person there who's who's er who thinks they're an activist how many 
activists have we got Vince where do you fit let's just whiz through
sm5340: i'm not an activist
nm5327: reflector i can't remember the other one actually that'll do so where 
would you put yourself
su: what's the last one theorist
nm5327: theorist sorry
sm5340: oh right er i'll be reflector 
nm5327: you're a reflector is Vince a reflector
sm5340: well in fact i'm just someone who stands on the side and does nothing 
but
nm5327: does he is being fair on himself
su: no
su: no he does a bit of everything
sm5340: no i can't do anything let's be honest like er yeah not
nm5327: no i don't think that's true does anybody think that's true
su: no
sm5340: come on don't be nice i don't know wherever
nm5327: i don't know i'd say what does anybody think he is is he an activist
sm5340: okay well i haven't done and reflector i haven't reflected on anything 
and i haven't come up with any theories so so nothing
sf5333: you have reflected cause you're reflecting by saying you didn't do 
anything
sm5340: in that case i suppose i'll be a reflector then
nm5327: well if that's what you think you are you happy with that are you going 
to try and change that in the third task if you feel like you're not 
contributing other people think you're contributing but you obviously
sm5340: well in that case i'll do exactly the same as i've been doing then
nm5327: okay Natalie what do you think you're contributing then
sf5332: don't know
sf5333: you always come up with good ideas
sf5332: yeah yeah yeah
sf5333: contributing ideas
nm5327: okay coming up with ideas is that who you are in real life
sf5332: er yeah i suppose so yeah i like to keep having an input and try and 
like you know come up with something even if it's not much just helping the 
team out
sf5333: i don't think about anything i just do it so go go go
nm5327: in there and see what goes on 
sf5335: i don't know
nm5327: i mean you can be more than one 
sf5335: i really don't know
sf5333: i think a reflector and a theorist cause you're coming up with things 
but she's also looking at other people's things and sort of saying like don't 
know yeah no she kind of takes her time to think about it before she actually 
says anything not like well i was just saying whatever comes into my head but 
like to me she seems to think about it a bit more
nm5327: that's good Claire what about yourself 
sf5330: er i think i'm probably a reflector [laugh] because
nm5327: you like to work out what's going on
sf5330: yeah i think so i don't know i mean i've got ideas as well but not as 
many as some people so
nm5327: and Lou what about yourself
sf5334: er probably a reflector er 
nm5327: so we've got just one activist in this group that just tackled that 
first task like let's get the equipment out and and see what it does no it's no 
it's er the thing that i think in any team if if we had six people that just 
wanted to get stuck in then your team wou-, can fall apart so you you oft-, 
often need different types of people in the team to make it succeed does 
anybody feel like they're not being allowed to contribute to the team how they 
want to no
sm5340: we could do with another bloke not to be rude but yeah
sf5333: a bit of female dominance going on
sm5340: yeah that's the thing yeah you're just all doing your like girly chat 
and shit
nm5327: we have one team member feeling left out here so anybody else and 
that's an important part of the team as well to kind of even if it's small 
things that people are feeling a bit excluded about that that to recognise that 
and try and bring them in cause i think you did that in the first task
sm5340: i don't feel excluded
nm5327: the first task so it's not you're not going to be blindfolded in 
another one alright so what you want to try and do now is try and put the 
learning points that you've done that we've hopefully done back to planning and 
time-keeping and things and i think if you do that it'll put stand you in good 
stead and then we can come out of the last task in an elated fashion rather 
than a deflated one okay
nm5326: er brainstorm your ideas i think that's probably er deciding thinking 
about every-, as much as you can but in a slightly different way but thinking 
everything that could go wrong er er ensuring every every member is involved is 
again something you haven't er er put on explicitly here so those kind of ideas 
have come out of of of er of group one's er which we haven't talked about much 
er preparing for the unexpected i just talked about that it's it's kind of hard 
to do but er er then formulating a plan so er we we've got here er and i think 
what you what er you guys have brought out very strongly into this the review 
er which is also here down on the last thing er on group one's but the the idea 
of the group trying to review and go and decide where it's got to go back to er 
if you if things haven't gone quite quite to plan i think you've brought that 
out very out very strongly with these curly arrows going back round that that's 
really good so er i'm very impressed with both of those er so so well done on 
that and in a short time has anyone got any er comments they
