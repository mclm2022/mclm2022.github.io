nm5033: well thank you for coming along this morning er i put out a er another 
question sheet on Friday this was typed in a great hurry by namex and er er she 
brought it into the lab and i checked it but i have very little budget for copy 
you see a couple of couple of embarrassing typos there but i'm sure you'll 
manage to overlook that er the idea of course is to help you i think prepare er 
in a way for the exams and also to test where you've got to in your 
understanding of some of the material that we've covered in in C-H-three-eight-
seven and i thought the the the routine we used last term went quite well 
people seem to have made quite a serious shot of er doing some of these things 
so i thought we'd er do do this this this kind of thing again er in in the 
groups that we had last time so that you all can remember each other er also i 
should indicate that today we have a guest here this is this is namex from the 
Centre of English Language Teaching and he will video part of this because 
he'll probably use 
out of the whole hour we're here about two minutes as part of a educational 
film and it's really for students overseas to get some idea of what it's like 
to come to British university and what the classes are like and a year ago he 
videoed two lectures in this pr-, in this course er and out of the two hours of 
lecturing i think he actually got fe-, five minutes of different things so that 
er er please don't be shy you know i-, almost certainly anything you say won't 
be used and if it's outstandingly good then it will be used and you'll be 
beautifully happy okay if if you sort of you slip on something don't don't 
bother it it just won't be used at all er okay if anybody's got any real 
problems with that could they er they can indicate if they like okay anyone got 
any real problems with er with being videoed maybe and er your er efforts being 
recorded for students overseas it's they're not looking for accuracy of 
chemistry by the way it's just how how teaching is done in the U-K all right 
well if we maybe the best thing is to perhaps go to the sheet that i put out on 
Friday 
and er 
sf5034: this morning 
nm5033: no it went it went out on Friday but you might have picked it up this 
morning but namex put it out on Friday 
sm5035: yesterday 
sf5034: it wasn't in the pigeonholes on Friday or yesterday 
sm5035: it was yesterday 
nm5033: was it yesterday 
sm5035: yesterday evening it was yesterday evening 
sf5036: it w-, it was in all nighter 'cause i picked on up on Friday evening 
nm5033: er ah well i'm sorry about that er 
sf5036: so it must have gone on late 
nm5033: yeah okay well never mind er you you you you have had it and some of 
you have had a go at it i believe i've been told groups have been working away 
er so er i notice that group A is here so who who who is the kind of spokesman 
for group A 
sf5037: ooh yeah namex 
nm5033: isn't this 
sm5038: er no no that's not fair 
nm5033: i'm sorry 
sm5038: er no don't that's not fair they're going to pick on me now 
ss: aah 
sm5039: as if 
nm5033: right why why why don't you share it with somebody else who else is in 
group A 
sm5040: 
sm5040: ah you s-, come on 
sm5041: can tell by the 
sf5042: i think namex should
ss: yeah 
nm5033: okay 
sf5042: 'cause at least he's looked at it 
nm5033: okay so 
sm5038: yeah 
sm5043: well namex's 
nm5033: you haven't done anything at all oh okay do you do you want to have a 
crack at what you've done i'll g-, i'll i'll g-, i'll i'll give you a here put 
one on there and er come on i'll give you some useful props okay as you go 
along do you do you want to come along on the overhead and then okay start with 
that one there er right 
if we could all simmer down a bit er yes in there's a much greater how could 
you make the following conversions and you were given a a series of good 
reactions and the idea was there might be a chemical reagent would convert A to 
B or there might be a particular type of stimulation either laser light or 
light or U-V light or gamma rays or whatever er but er if if you ha-, have a 
crack at er one or two of these i'll i'll kind of er indicate how you're ge-, 
how you're getting along okay 
sm5038: all right 
nm5033: well you there's we we seem to be slightly over the top i know let's 
let's bring that down a bit let's bring that okay all right let's E where's E-
minus then these lights are very bright actually aren't they i shall i shall i 
turn the lights down slightly 
sm5038: 
yeah 
nm5033: er er okay er anyone got any ob-, any observations on that converting E-
minus to O-H any any thoughts from anyone 
sm5044: just add water 
nm5033: sorry 
sm5044: just add water 
nm5033: yeah you you need basi-, yeah you certainly need water there er but you 
generate E-minus with pulse radiolysis of water that that's absolutely true er 
if you actually allow the electrons to react with H-two-O-two so i think the H-
two-O-two bit is right but er there there is another way of doing it as well so 
if if i could perhaps just come round here and er so if you've got H-two-O okay 
you've got the you've got the gamma ray or or the X-ray coming in and that will 
give you H-two-O-plus and E-minus so you've generated the E-minus there the 
question is how do you convert this through to O-H and as er as you rightly 
said you can use H-two-O-two because as the electron enters H-two-O-two it 
causes it to fall apart into two bits and there's the O-H radical that's the 
thing we're after the other there is another species 
that's very very good at c-, at converting one into the other any offers on 
that well known in mass spectrometry or it's it's actually N-two-O nitrous 
oxide so laughing gas in fact what what happens there is that you get this t-, 
taking place and that simply picks up the proton from the water to give you O-H 
so in a sense er you were certainly right to pick on on H-two-0-two so that th-,
that that was er th-, that was you know fine but the f-, the fullest picture 
is to ge-, is to do that you get the E-minus you get the E-minus either with 
with H-two-O-two as you said or with N-two-O and both of those routes take you 
through to to O-H-minus anyone got any problems with that okay well that's okay 
so so you you you you you were certainly i-, with H-two-O-two you were in the 
right kind of ballpark but er okay er oh i've managed to lose my sheet already 
so it's that's yours okay next er oh the oth-, the next one is going the other 
way how do you co-, how how can we possibly convert O-H back to E-minus any any 
offers on that did you have a thought on that one 
sf5045: no i didn't 
nm5033: 
you you er yeah at least yeah that was quite a tricky one er okay well i'll 
i'll give you i'll give you i'll give you the kind of the straight answer to 
that because it er sorry it's er getting in the way to get O-H through to E-
minus that's the what's the what's the way if you're doing that well oddly 
enough and you you may have to think about this quite hard if you take mole-, 
if you take molecular hydrogen if you actually put hydrogen into water er to 
atmospheric pressure or under under higher pressure what do people think O-H 
radical would do to to molecular hydrogen what does O-H radical love doing 
what's its favourite er pastime 
sm5044: oxidizing 
sf5046: 
nm5033: sorry 
sm5044: oxidizing 
nm5033: it o-, loves oxidizing so if it was going to oxidize H-two how would it 
oxidize it 
sf5047: 
nm5033: it would attract yeah absolutely right it would s-, it it would 
abstract hydrogen so if you write hy-, if you write hydrogen like that what 
will happen is you'll get H-two-O plus a hydrogen atom okay that's the hydrogen 
atom and the hydrogen atom is linked to the electron in what way what what what 
w-, how do we link hydrogen with with er hydrogen atom with electrons 
sf5048: it's a proton so 
nm5033: yeah it's a pro-, i-, it that's right basically er if you actually have 
this in base O-H-minus you will get E-minus out of that in other words E-minus 
is related to if i write it more fully E-minus plus a proton gives you a 
hydrogen atom so this is the most powerful reducing agent there is that's a 
hydrogen atom which is the 
simplest chemical er simplest atom that there is altogether and that's the 
simplest ion that there is and all three are interrelated by an acid-base 
equilibrium so there is in fact a P-K for the hydrogen atom actually measured 
the er change in the spectrum in pulse radiolysis by changing the P-H of the 
solution and you get E-minus at P-H seven and six and as you go down to at sort 
of P-H-two it's a complete loss including to the hydrogen atoms okay so that 
that that was that one there so that that was the the answer was just if you 
deluge the solution of hydrogen gas you will convert round 
sf5049: could you put that one back on top please 
nm5033: okay you want it back on right there there we are 
sf5049: cheers 
nm5033: 
yeah right while we're while we while you're furiously making notes we'll get 
another transparency out er oh the ne-, the next one you'll 
sf5045: i don't know 
nm5033: 
sf5045: what do you think 
nm5033: ba-, ba-, ba-, ba-, basically you're being you're being asked to 
convert one thing into another and in fact well the third one is i've actually 
done it there because er if you look this the third problem the third problem 
is actually how do you convert electrons to hydrogen atoms and oddly enough 
that is the answer you simply er instead of pulse radiolyse water you pulse 
radiolyse dilute acid dilute sulphuric acid dilute H-C-L dilute nitric acid 
dilute anything really providing there's water there the water generates the 
minus and the E-minus will then get protonated to give the H atom so the third 
problem we've actually solved as it were en passant okay do you have any idea 
about the ins-, methyl chloride 
sf5045: no 
nm5033: no okay right an-, any offers on w-, on the methyl chloride one 
sf5050: 
you just add radiation that would split from this wouldn't it 
nm5033: sorry the 
sf5050: just that radiation would split radical 
nm5033: yeah a-, if you can have solid methyl chloride you probably would get 
er some some some er disruption like that so if i take that off there i'd be 
what what what er namex says if w-, if we have a C-H-three-C-L and if it's that 
was a solid with a gamma ray we would get we would probably get something like 
this happening but in fact there is a a rather cleaner way of doing this er of 
splitting that up to give you C-H-three-dot ins-, in fact the other the c-, the 
thing this time is C-L-minus what what do we need to drive methyl chloride 
through to that into that process taking methyl chloride through to C-H-three C-
L-minus what do you need to add to methyl chloride to push it over to the right 
what's the what's the missing missing bit 
sf5051: an electron 
nm5033: sorry 
sf5051: an electron 
nm5033: an electron yes yes an electron if you add if you put an electron if 
you add an electron to this as the electron enters 
the methyl chloride system you're getting basically a very transient sort of 
species like this and it essentially it splits off there to give you C-H-three 
radical and C-L-minus so the conversion there was to to add add one electron to 
the system and whenever you've got er any kind of chloro organic anything with 
a C-C-L bond chloride or chlorobenzene er adding electrons always gives the C-C-
L bond tha-, that that is a a stronger exo-, er odonic or exothermic reaction 
er and you end up by sticking up this very very stable species and you're left 
behind with with with with with a C-H-three okay er so that that was er was 
methyl chloride er 
sf5050: do you think 
nm5033: any any thoughts on the next one 
sf5045: er photo induced electron transfer 
nm5033: yeah okay electron transfer do you do you want to er you want do you 
want to write it out then er you can see so we er did er did group A have a 
chance to talk together before they came not really 
sf5051: no 
nm5033: no 
sf5052: we only 
nm5033: okay 
so what we've got a conversion now which is platinum platinum-four going down 
to platinum-three right so but the question is what is the reagent that pushes 
it over er to to do that we're 
sf5045: we need one electron 
nm5033: you okay you want one electron that's basically it really if you pulse 
radiolyse you know you're right there if you pulse radiolyse aqueous platinum-
four er you generate electrons and they will reduce platinum-four to platinum-
three so you get this un-, you get this very unusual oxidation state of 
platinum and electrons er can produce all sorts of er strange species any 
offers on other strange species that electrons can produce that er what what 
unusual oxidation states can you get with electrons for example any on-, any 
offers from anyone 
sf5050: do you get a peroxide 
nm5033: sorry 
sf5050: er peroxides in you've got 
nm5033: er i'm re-, well i'm thinking about metals me-, me-, metal metal 
oxidation states any any er 
sf5050: 
iron-one 
nm5033: iron yeah iron-one yes that that that that's that's a good answer iron-
one yes because if you take iron-two and react it with electrons you c-, you 
drive it down to iron-one and you can also drive manganese down two down to 
manganese-one er and zinc-two down to zinc-one c-, cobalt-two down to cobalt-
one and silver-one you can drive down to silver-nought so the electron being 
the most powerful reducing agent in the whole of chemistry it has no problem in 
entering the metal orbitals and giving us very unusual oxidation states so 
certainly that was right that you add er you add a wo-, one electron change 
there er now the next one the next er problem is have we got some space on 
there a little bit yeah er did anyone have any thoughts about these conversions 
with with methanol we've got two methanols er er derived er reactions there how 
how well how do we convert methanol to methoxy any 
off-, any offers from anyone there 
sf5050: a hydroxyl radical 
nm5033: well ac-, well actually it's it's not a it's not a bad answer a hy-, 
hydroc-, hydroxyl radical is a very powerful species a very powerful oxyl 
species it will attract methanol but in fact O-H will pull off the hydrogen 
from the carbon you get C-H-two-O-H so to get methoxy er which is a itself a 
little bit like hydroxy it's a very very high energy species very very reactive 
so if we had some meth-, if we had some methonal in er a container how would we 
go about converting it to er er methoxy any any offers from anyone what what 
sort of thing do you need don't forget so far all the questions have been about 
reagents and 
sm5038: 
nm5033: some yeah almost yeah but what not quite you need a bit more energy 
than that so what's the next highest energy along 
sm5038: 
pulse radiolysis 
nm5033: sorry 
sm5038: radiolysis 
nm5033: radiolysis yeah if you re-, if you radiolyse so if we write down er 
methanol as a radiolytic symbol we can either use an X-ray or or a gamma ray er 
it appears the f-, the first process we get is C-H-three-O-H-plus er plus an 
electron and that then undergoes a very fast acid-base reaction to give us C-H-
three-O-H-two-plus that's just ordinary protonated methanol and you get that 
thing formed there so this this the radiolysis takes us through to er to 
methoxy and er that was thought thought to be 
sm5053: Professor could you just stand to the side slightly 
nm5033: sorry i was just standing in the standing in the way was i okay yeah so 
th-, there's the there's there's methanol going through to to methoxy radical 
er and you might have thought well that that's the end of the story but what do 
you think the methoxy might do what what what why do you think the methoxy 
might er do something i said it was 
extremely reactive so what what what what what are its possibilities 
sf5054: recombine with H at source 
nm5033: well i've said it was very much like hydroxy and hydroxy we heard 
earlier on is is extremely good at er 
sm5038: 
nm5033: taking hydrogen atoms off things so so what will what will the methoxy 
do 
sm5038: take the proton on one of the methanols 
sm5038: yeah it will take it will take a hydrogen atom ou-, out of one of the 
methanols so the ne-, the next stage is that this thing will come along it will 
attack another methanol and it will pull one of these off so you end up by 
getting C-H-three-O-H and this thing will then give you C-H-two-O-H like that 
so the primary pro-, products are E-minus and C-H-three-O and C-H-three-O turns 
around attacks another nearby methanol a neighbouring one to give that and that 
even occurs at temperatures of fifty kelvin so that even if you have er 
extremely low temperatures you will get that process occurring and you can 
monitor 
it at fifty kelvin by E-S-R spectroscopy 
sf5055: why is it taking it off the carbon more than off the o-, oxygen 
nm5033: what why is it taken off the carbon not o-, o-, not off off off the 
oxygen whoops let's push that up a bit well the s-, in fact the the C-H bond er 
is very slightly weaker than the than the O-H bond er so serodynamically er 
there's a lot going for this to go through this conversion here you get you 
actually get release of heat it's simply bond energies O-H is stronger than C-H 
er you might wonder well why do you get C-H-three-O in the first place shall i 
put a dot there to just to emphasize the cation the the main reason there is 
that er er in a gamma ray or an X-ray you've got all the energy in the world 
that you want you've released an electron from here you've left that thing 
behind or you've you've forced out an electron because of the the sheer amount 
of energy and er the deprotonation of this thing er the proton er comes off the 
most acidic point in molecule so 
you we'll get C-H-three-O and not C-H-two-O-H that's simply the acidity of 
hydrogen bonded to oxygen so here it's driven by acidity you're getting g-, in 
getting from here to here but you're getting from there down to there 'cause 
it's driven by thermodynamics because the C-H bond energy is er lower than the 
O-, the O-H bond energy so that radical reaction er releases a lot of heat 
therefore there's a driving force for it to go okay yeah er and then the the 
next question er which in fact we've answered already that's one two three four 
five nu-, number one two three four five six the seventh one we've just 
answered to convert this through to through to that you just let it react with 
methanol so it's a secondary reaction so we've really ready to finish group A 
and the last one is er actually it was a misprint there was a-, there was R so 
if you didn't a little R er chr-, chromium and the thing on the right that 
little L should be a big L but otherwise er it's fine er so any any thoughts on 
that one did you how do you get from quartet to doublet 
sf5055: 
er well it's intersystem converting 
nm5033: it's intersystem crossing that would be g-, it's so er that that is the 
actual conversion so er in fact in a sense you could say you don't actually 
need to do anything at all it just happens spontaneously but er i suppose a 
more sophisticated answer would be to say that if you st-, if you have the 
quartets a very complex p-, ground state you need to excite it with er could be 
with visible light actually 'cause chromium being a green compound all chrome 
compounds are green er it will absorb in the visible er and be promoted into a 
higher quartet state which then crosses spontaneously to d-, doublet state so i 
think the the perfect answer would be er visible light stimulation to generate 
the initial er chromium complex and th-, and then a crossover so er i need i 
need another transparency okay so er er you can you go and sit down now 'cause 
you've thanks very much indeed er very briefly saying that er the the ground 
state of the chromium complex is a quartet so if i put quartet 
there chromium there's the excited state which is a quartet as well and the 
doublet state is over here and essentially you you you put you use visible 
light to get up to there and then essentially you get intersystem crossing to 
take you over to the doublet state which is then the one which the which 
actually phosphoresces okay so that was the that was the picture that er would 
would have been as it were a a very complete answer with all of these questions 
of course er i you want to look at the time you've got you want to say well if 
there are s-, if i've got forty minutes and there's seven parts you know seven 
sixes are forty-two s-, so i've got just under six minutes five minutes to 
answer each part and you want to make sure you don't spend fifteen minutes 
answering one little bit because you know it will simply er you can get you 
might get sort of five out of six but you're not going to get eight out of six 
er so you know you want to kind of ration your time so that you don't use it er 
er unsuccessfully okay well that that well that was er question one that was 
done 
by group A what what other groups are well represented here er apart from what 
what what what have we got er this group over here 
sm5056: we're group B 
nm5033: yes and and you've got some worked answers 
sm5056: er 
nm5033: yes 
sm5056: yes some 
nm5033: yes okay do you want to come up they're not on overheads are they just 
on paper 
sm5056: all right just ordinary paper 
nm5033: up 
sm5056: 
nm5033: okay right do you want to come up oh you've got them on a okay 
sm5056: i've written it all down i just hope you can read it 
nm5033: right that's excellent 
sm5056: 
nm5033: namex do you want to come up and show them to us all 
sm5056: 
nm5033: oh oh i think 
sm5056: 
nm5033: i think er i i can't see you as as a er a shrinking violet so okay whi-,
which which which question was this 
sm5056: D 
nm5033: D 
sm5056: yeah 
nm5033: okay 
sm5056: 
nm5033: so we've got some we got some answers here and do you do you want to 
take us through them okay do you want to do you want to speak to 
sm5056: 
nm5033: there's a question there then we'll go on to then talk to your overhead 
sm5056: er well it's er it's self-explanatory of course 
nm5033: well the the first question was explain why ruthenium c-, er the 
ruthenium complex with three bipyridines two both are a better oxidant and a 
better reductant when you excite it why why is it that you've got better 
oxidizing properties and better reducing properties at the same time it seems 
almost illogical that that could be the case and so we were looking for a er a 
kind of explanation for this and we've got an answer er which says ruthenium 
excitation moves moves the well we've got various conduction band i mean the er 
the f-, the first thing to say is is that i there is some confusion here er 
this is this is a complex which is a kind of discrete molecule yeah it's it's 
not a semiconductor semiconductors tend to be er things like metal oxides metal 
sulphides er binary compounds like that which are crystals only a crystal can 
be a semiconductor you can't have the single molecule be-, be-, 
sm5057: we are talking about the T-I-O-2 i mean talk about the semi-, 
semiconductor promotes the electron 
nm5033: 
oh 
sm5057: it's the electron forms the semiconductor isn't it that's promoted 
nm5033: well the the well the question A was why why is the rithian complex a 
better oxidant and a better reductant and it's no mention of semiconductors 
okay 
sm5057: oh right yeah 
nm5033: yeah er so but i n-, i think there is some sort of er er okay you've 
got this strong oxidizing agent when it gets to ruthenium-three okay you so 
you're talking about the excitation here 
sm5057: yeah 
nm5033: er if you excite this complex you basically push an electron from the 
ruthenium on to the ligand and so er in the excited state what you've got is 
essentially if i i i i'd have to i'd remove that for the moment in the excited 
state what you've got you've got R-U-bipy where the electron has gone from here 
onto one of these ligands okay so if i write bipy-two you have taken an 
electron out of the complex so you've basically got a ruthenium-three 
there now and you've got an odd electron on one of the ligands okay so if you 
look at the excited state configuration like that clearly the ruthenium core 
has become a powerful oxidant and you can do exactly what's been written there 
but conversely the ligand has become semi reduced and this is a powerful 
reductant so you've taken a molecule where there's been a roughly equal charge 
distribution all over the place on excitation you've taken one electron from 
the centre and put it on the outside so that you have got a oxidizing core in 
the ruthenium ruthenium-three and you've got a very powerful reducing ligand 
bipy so that that would be er a kind of er microscopic explanation it looks at 
the in detail at the metal and it looks in detail at the ligand and once you've 
done that of course this can oxidize O-H-minus to oxygen this can re-, this bit 
can reduce protons down to hydrogen so that that that is one explanation but 
there is another completely different way of looking at it and er i don't know 
whether anyone's got any thoughts on a different a completely different way of 
looking at it 
any any an-, er a much more general way i mean i gave that as a particular 
complex but i-, this would do for any com-, i-, in fact if almost any molecule 
so perhaps you've got a molecule and you've got a lowest a highest occupied 
molecular orbital and a lowest unoccupied molecular orbital okay now if you 
excite it with er a light quantum you push one electron up into here and you're 
left with one behind down there and so what you've got also down here is an 
empty hole so i could write that as H-plus and i could write that as E-minus so 
it's very much like the semiconductor situation but it is a single molecule 
okay we're talking about one we're talking about one one molecule so i-, if 
that's if you could represent the excited state like this er would anyone like 
to tell me why is it awhy is it a better reductant if you promote an electron 
into a into this upper orbital any offers why is it a better reductor 
sm5057: 'cause it's got an electron and higher energy so it's 
nm5033: 
yeah yeah the electron that's absolutely right the electron is er in a th-, 
it's a it's a higher energy level it's very near the ionization level i mean 
you could imagine that somewhere at the top here off the t-, off the top is so 
called ionization level okay and if the electron had got as far as there it 
would have escaped altogether and you'd have had a free electron so it would be 
extremely powerful reducing now to get the electron to leave the molecule from 
here you've got to push it all the way from there up to here but to get it to 
go from here to there it only goes up that small distance and so you have got 
as as you say a much more pwerfully reducing species once it's excited 'cause 
the electron is much nearer the point at which you can leave the molecule so 
it's a much more powerful reducing agent okay now what about oxidizing 
properties why why is it a better oxidant any any offers from this side why is 
it a better oxidant now than it was when it started out any offers from group D 
what 
what a-, what about er someone else why why you've explained why it's a better 
reductant why can you explain why it's become a better oxidant 
sm5058: 'cause it's got a vacant hole 
nm5033: it's got ye-, it's got a vacant hole in other words if if if you were 
actually er wanting this molecule to oxidize something suppose this is this is 
the ground state here so if i just sort of just remind you that's that's the 
ground state there this is the excited state here now for this for this ground 
state to oxidize something it's got to pull an electron out of it and the 
electron will go where if this puts up an electron where's it going to go what 
orbital yes it will go in here so for this to oxidize something it must pull an 
electron out of a substrate and it will tuck into into that orbital there okay 
right but if you if this excited state was going to oxidize something where 
would the electron go now 
ss: 
nm5033: it goes in the hole so you see this na-, this excited state is now a 
powerful oxidant because it can 
put an electron into this hole with a much greater er energy advantage that put 
the electron up here if you can stuff it in there you're you're you're in 
you're in a very good er position so this charged separation you see it gives 
you added reducing power and added oxidizing power so that that is the kind of 
general answer er and for the ruthenium complex that's just one example out of 
a thousand that one could have one could have taken okay that's fine now er in 
s-, the second part of that question er what are the physical properties of er 
where's where's the er i've i've er put your answer down somewhere and 
temporarily lost it okay er okay ah yeah this is all about semiconductors isn't 
it in a way 
sm5056: 
nm5033: yeah or is it is it the ruthenium complex er maybe it's the ruthenium 
complex as well it probably applies to both er why wha-, the question was why 
what other physical properties has the ruthenium complex got that make it a 
target for so much research and the res-, the research is what what sort of 
research is it is it being used for
sf5059: renewable energy source 
nm5033: sorry 
sf5059: renewable energy source 
nm5033: renewable energy source yes it's used as a renewable energy source er 
it's er been er put in a number of target systems er one is photoelectrolytic 
cells that are driven by sunlight so you get perpetual electricity from a cell 
based on the ruthenium complex and the other one is splitting water into 
hydrogen and oxygen using the hydrogen as fuel so the big interest in this 
complex well we got er got some answers from er group D and er it's it's got a 
high quantum yield certainly the i mean the phosphorescence quantum yield which 
is the measurement of the number of excited states you've got is quite good er 
it's got a high turnover number er it's just likely to turn to dioxide in that 
way it's a ruthenium complex it er it can be used fairly exhaustively i mean 
you can use many thousands of times but ultimately it will degrade you will 
acually degrade the ligands er so it's not perfection but it's about as near as 
we've got to 
perfection er and then finally it has really got a very good absorption 
spectrum it's an orange compound and it matches the solar spectrum fairly well 
so if you can imagine the solar spectrum at earth level it's looking a little 
bit like this where this is sort of er maybe about er a thousand nanometres at 
P infrared this is a visible that the spe-, the er spectrum of the ruthenium 
complex is actually going to be very much in the visible because it's orange 
and it will be looking a little bit like in fact it looks a bit like that so 
it's n-, it's not a bad match that's the overlap region that's the bit we're 
interested in where the sunlight spectrum at earth level matches the absorption 
spectrum o-, of the ruthenium complex now the l-, the last question was a bit 
nasty er how can ruthenium complexes be er tethered to er to semicondu-, er 
semiconductor services er ano-, another typo leaped out at me er how can you 
tether them to surfaces and then it says why why should you want to but let's 
let's hear it how you can tether them to start with if you want 
to tether a complex to a polar surface what's the best thing to do to it any t-,
any suggestions after i've got say suppose you've got a a g-, a silica surface 
or an alumina surface or a titania surface and you want to get a metal complex 
to lock on to that surface and stick er really hard ruthenia bypyridium won't 
be awfully good at doing this it will just wash off but so how what what do you 
want to do to the ligand to make it bind to a to to a surface 
sf5050: 
nm5033: yeah er yeah put a polar group on it er is a suggestion that is that is 
a good suggestion actually er what we would want to do i'll pick yet another 
one of oh that's i'll do it here if your surface is down here so basically it's 
a metal oxide surface M-, i'll call it M-O you've got on the surface you've got 
O-two-minus ions all the way down and you've got M-two-plus ions say it's 
suppose it's er a binary er er i'll i'll put it as M-two-plus if you've got a 
ligand say by p-, the ruthenium complex with a ligand and if you've with if you 
put on the ligand a carboxy group or a sulphinate group or a phosphate group so 
up here put two-minus if you have 
any of these groups on the ligand periphery they will ligate strongly to the to 
the M-two-plus species that i-, you that i-, you you'll get a a strong er 
interaction between the er this er group on the surface and the metal okay like 
so you will be getting that sort of interaction so the answer is you modify the 
ligand to put on a polar group you take a hydrogen atom and bang in a carboxy 
or a sulphinate or something like that okay so that was the right answer there 
that's how you can do it now why would you want this ruthenium complex or 
something like it why would you want it on er on a semiconductor surface anyway 
what would you want to do that any offers why should why should you want to do 
it 
sf5060: if you can do it on a semiconductive surface you can get electrons into 
it easier with the semiconductor sites than using electrons from 
nm5033: yeah 
sf5060: one or the other to 
nm5033: yeah that that that's absolutely right 
sf5060: mm 
nm5033: er one of the problems with semiconductors is that they 
often don't have a very good match with the so-, with the solar spectrum they 
have a U-V absorption many of them the O-two in particular and there's not a 
lot there's really not a lot of U-V in sunlight i mean it's enough to make you 
get sunburn but there's really in energy terms only a s-, only a few per cent 
of the total solar output i-, reaching earth that's actually U-V so what would 
be nice to try and get better devices would be to get a better matching of the 
er action spectrum of your semiconductor to sunlight and what you can do is to 
coat the semiconductor with a monolayer of one of these complexes because you 
will then get the matching of the spectrum of the tethered complex to sunlight 
you get a very good match because you can use one of these ruthenium complexes 
or you can use a complex or various other ones that have been tried out and so 
y-, the reason why you want to do it is to improve the action spectrum and the 
efficiency of the semiconductor towards sunlight er and of course you need a 
monolayer because as the sun as the sunlight falls onto the ruthenium 
complex what you're hoping will happen is that it will then inject an electron 
into the conduction band of the semiconductor so you activate the semiconductor 
using light the semiconductor would normally completely disregard it wouldn't 
abs-, you know the band gap would be too big but you're able to overcome that 
by having this complex on there o-, okay a-, any have you all got the that idea 
yeah okay er right so that was a question for group D and then we had er we 
won't have the time we've still got quite a bit of time left er group B is 
group B about is group have you got any sort of consolidated answers do you 
want to come out and have a shot okay come come and just come and tell us what 
you've got it's er what er what are the products on in irradiating these 
compounds okay right so as you can er speak to it quite well prepared okay 
right what are the products you'd expect to find on radiolysis of and there it 
there are three compounds okay so if you er want to er take us through it 
sm5061: yeah er take it well yeah er i just took it to be products and then 
worked out a mechanism and then er 
how do you prove the mechanism is looking at the intermediates it's E-S-R er 
straight from the notes 
nm5033: yes okay it it was ba-, basically very much a textbook answer and 
you've got a set of products and then you've you've got a mechanism there and 
you've relied basically on on E-S-R er what what o-, what o-, i mean what other 
methods were i mean E-S-R has told us a bit about the mechanism because it has 
identified the intermediate radical but er what what other physical methods 
would you l-, use for studying glycine suppose you had some crystalline glycine 
and you went away and give it er maybe on its own or indeed er in a-, aqueous 
solution er it says aqueous glycine so suppose you've got some glycine in water 
and you gamma irradiate it or X-radiate it how do you follow the reaction what 
what what what physical techniques would you use to follow that how would we 
know we've got those things that are on the board what would be the favoured 
method 
sf5062: 
nm5033: well no i i'm really thinking of actual products we've got H-two N-H-
three C-H C-O-two and formaldehyde e-, N-M-R yeah you you would get in in the 
aqueous solution you would actually get the formaldehyde protons coming up all 
you'd get the formaldehyde er C-thirteen er what about the gases how would you 
know they were there what what what what's the favoured method for going after 
gases gas gaseous products would you say 
ss: 
nm5033: sorry 
ss: 
nm5033: you g-, well you can use G er G-O-C gas er that would be quite good or 
you can actually combine it with mass spectrometry G-C-M-S er an awful lot of 
systems which have been subject to either photolysis or radiolysis or indeed er 
microbial action if you want to look at the 
gases coming off G-C-M-S is is much the best way because these are very er 
microelectronic species hydrogen ammonia C-O-two and they they show up 
extremely well er on with with with G-C-M-S you get really quite good 
separation okay so we've got E-S-R looking at the intermediates and we reduce G-
C-M-S for looking at the products okay so that that's quite good how about 
frozen ethanol did you frozen ethanol okay do you want to do frozen ethanol 
sm5063: it must it's we assumed it would be the same as methanol 
nm5033: yeah not a bad not a bad assumption 
sm5063: er yeah got frozen methanol ethanol er er you it's it's ra-, radiolysed 
to get to this stuff and then there's various routes it takes ending up with 
hydrogen er this whatever that is thing and that which it is ethanol er to 
prove this you can find the intermediates by E-S-, E-S-R again that's how it 
would show up but with the other products i said could be done with normal 
means like or N-M-R 
nm5033: okay any any observations from anyone on that we could start just 
start with you've got er you've got the intermediates er forms you've got er 
okay er yeah you've got C-two-H-five-O here which er is er an alkoxy radical er 
and then you've got this reacting ultimate going down here we have to give er 
yeah okay you've got down here we have to give er er yes er yeah okay er er 
you've got this conversion here you've got an alcoxy through to a er this 
radical here er that's it's quite a good quite a good answer but it's not 
exactly right er i'll explain why er suppose you've got ethanol and you're 
going to pull a hydrogen atom off one of the carbons there er the way that our 
speaker had it was he pulled off this one and got C-H-two-C-H-two-O-H er in 
fact er the C-H bond strength of that C-H bond is very slightly less than the C-
H bond strength of the methyl and so a-, actually what you do get out of this 
is er when you get the the alcoxy coming down there's the there's the alcoxy 
when this attacks that it gives you C-H-three-C-H-dot-O-H and this will then of 
course what will 
that do once it's been formed well you've got you've got it's got dimerization 
here which is er quite a good answer that would dimerize and so basically that 
would go through to C-H-O-three-C-H-O-H C-H-three-C-H-O-H but you probably got 
two-thirds of the marks for that i think that's really you know quite a i mean 
you've done methanol you've got to be able to jump from one a molecule that you 
know about to one that you've not seen before but there is enough similarity to 
carry the ideas over you've got to be able to extemporize a bit in in doing 
some of these answers er yeah so in fact if you looked at the E-S-R of that and 
you do get it er you've got four protons actually which are very very close 
together so you you actually end up by getting a quintet it's like four protons 
in N-M-R four equivalent protons in N-M-R gives you a one-four-six-four-one 
quintet and you get a one-four-six-four-one quintet in the E-S-R spectrum just 
just as you would in the N-M-R spectrum for er a molecule with with four 
equivalent protons but er so going talking about 
E-S-R was the right thing er not qu-, not quite the white right not quite the 
right radicals but then the ana-, anal-, analytical methods that you mentioned 
are really absolutely the right ones okay well thank you for that that was er 
really quite reasonable and then finally crystalline D-N-A did someone have 
crystalline D-N-A do you want to come and talk about crystalline D-N-A briefly 
tell us about er what happens when you take fi-, fibrous crystalline D-N-A and 
subject it to to gamma gamma radiolysis what what are you going to get ah 
sm5061: er i wasn't quite sure what you were asking because you've got loads of 
er information from the notes 
nm5033: yes 
sm5061: so just 
nm5033: well it's not an aqueous solution it's ac-, just pure crystalline D-N-A 
so it's er if it's not an aqueous solution you don't get the indirect effect 
you must that only happens if you've got aqueous D-N-A aqueous D-N-A is 
important in st-, looking at at cells responsive cells because 
our bodies are made up of cells that contain eighty ninety per cent water and 
so the indirect effect is very important with with cells in our body if you 
took fibrous D-N-A suppose you had a cell a c-, er you had some D-N-A in an 
environment without water within a cell and you took this crystalline D-N-A and 
you you damaged it what sort of things do you get well what have you got you've 
got functional groups on purines may be irreversibly altered well that's 
certainly true er extensive that they may be lost in the D-N-A molecule yeah 
you can actually split them out and lose them you get a radical a base salt 
that that als-, also encourages they break they break the sugar-phosphate 
backbone you get single strand breaks you get double strand breaks that's 
that's that's quite a good summary er i'd like to ask one question of of of the 
whole class actually er that that that's quite reasonable if you've got D-N-A 
and you're subjecting it to gamma radiolysis er so if i try and write the D-N-A 
in shorthand guanine thymine adenine thymine guanine adenine cytosine cytosine 
thymine adenine 
guanine cytosine thymine adenine right that's so that's just one little section 
of a D-N-A molecule er and i'd like to ask the question where are where are the 
damaged sites if you've got that long string of er nuclear put together and 
you're s-, submitting it to ionizing radiation you get charge you get 
ionization occuring okay you get charged separation and you get holes and 
electrons don't you holes and electrons so where where do the where do the er 
where do the electrons tend to go out of those four bases where do the 
electrons love to go more than anywhere else 
ss: T 
nm5033: they go to T yeah the elec-, the electrons will go onto them and the 
electrons will end up on T residue so you get T-dot-minus-A T-dot-minus-G-A C-C-
T-dot-minus okay blah blah blah blah blah and the T-dot-minuses do you know 
what happens to them afterwards after after you get the electron on to the 
thymine what happens next to it any offers 
sf5064: it goes on to the phosphate 
nm5033: 
sorry it er picks up a proton picks up a proton and you end up now by getting 
essentially G-T-H with a dot A-T-H with a dot G-A-C-C-T-H with a dot blah blah 
blah blah blah okay well well that's the that's the electrons where do the 
holes go guanine guanine the holes go in the guanine so we end up by getting 
the holes so if i write H-plus here we'll end up by getting G-dot-plus T-A-T-G-
dot-plus A-C-C et cetera et cetera et cetera yeah so that that's the that's the 
story there basically the thymine has the highest electron affinity er and the 
guanine has got the lowest ionization energy so you end up by getting that okay 
now er are we about to i've lost my question sheet A B s-, is group C 
sm5063: how do you how do you prove that 
nm5033: by E-S-R 
sm5063: E-S-R 
nm5033: yeah E-S-R will show up the timing radical which has got an optic 
spectrum don't ask me to explain why i ca-, i could explain why but it will 
take me about twenty minutes er you get an optic spectrum on with T and you the 
the guanine also has got catrius E-S-R in fact what you can do you can take the 
pure nucleotides and gamma irradiate and get and get an optic spectra for all 
possible anions and cations and then match them to d-, D-N-A spectrum and you 
can and you can synthesize it from the components er by computer group C 
sf5060: er we don't have anything prepared but 
nm5033: okay do you want a quick er resume have you got a a i've got a 
transparency or did you want to speak to 
sf5060: no no i haven't got anything 
nm5033: you haven't got anything 
sf5060: i literally i found this this morning 
nm5033: you found it this morning have you got any thoughts about 
sf5060: yeah phosphorescence is rare 'cause you get er they recombine 
nm5033: you get two triplets recombining yeah 
sf5060: it reacts with oxygen 
nm5033: reacts with oxygen oxygen perturbs the excited state level yes 
sf5060: and there's a third one 
sm5065: 
sf5060: thank you done that 
nm5033: 
you get and what about the solvents anything to do with solvent 
sf5060: hydrogen extraction 
nm5033: hydrogen extraction yeah that's very good so er you should be that 
you're you're obviously quite well aware of that er how does a small amount of 
naphtholene protect solvents from attack 
sf5060: it takes the triplet state and absorbs the energy and moves it on 
delocalizes it round the 
nm5033: okay that's that seems all right so what what what what we're told is 
that if you take a triplet and if i call it R-one-R-two-C-double-bond then 
there's our triplet ketone this will normally attack a solvent R-S-A to R-one-R-
two-C-O-H-dot-S-S-H so you degrade the solvent if you put in naphtholene 
naphtholene C-ten-H-eight what happens is the triplet he migrates from there to 
there and we will now get ground 
state ketone which is completely innocuous triplet naphthalene which does not 
attack solvents at all it hasn't got an odd electron on an oxygen so it's is 
perfectly harmless it just dissipates it as heat okay 
sm5066: can you move it up a bit 
nm5033: sorry 
sm5066: can you move it up up a bit 
nm5033: oh move it up a bit sorry yeah there we are okay well we've er used up 
all our time er i think i'm due am i due to give you t-, yet another revision 
class 
ss: yes 
nm5033: yes okay well i will i will contrive to produce another sheet of 
questions and we'll we'll d-, we'll do this again but i'll i'll next time i'll 
give you a bit more notice it's mainly because i suppose namex's been off and 
i've really been doing half of his job as well as my own but he's back now 
namex is back he's fully fully recovered okay thanks very much then
