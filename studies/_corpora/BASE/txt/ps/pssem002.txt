nm5300: okay I'm not going to speak for very long here but I should just talk 
er er a bit about the the the exact aims of this morning this morning's event 
er and I think er we can er narrow it down into to three main aims so you are 
going to be working er in in groups as i say all through this term and all 
through the year and you may not know the other people in that group very well 
yet you've probably met some of them but it's er it's really er an icebreaker 
to get to know the other people in your group that's a goo-, good start for 
getting to work with them so that's one of the first important things er 
su: have you got any 
nm5300: er second er main aim then so that the first is just to get to know the 
other people secondly and that er er i think even you'd agree that's that would 
already be a good achievement second aim is then to improve your teamwork 
hopefully by the end of the morning you will have some thoughts about what you 
can do in the future to make sure the teams you are working in work better and 
thirdly and maybe the most importantly we really hope you can have a bit of fun 
this morning the sun's out again it's going to be nice and warm some of the 
activities as I told you yesterday well all the activities are outside so er 
enjoy yourselves an-, and and have a good time we've got a series of activities 
er lined up for you as i said th-, these are going to take place outside and er 
what the the format of the morning really is that you you do the activity and 
then hopefully afterwards er with the help of your group facilitator you'll 
learn something about er how you worked as a team in during that activity and 
maybe learn some lessons or maybe not but at least hopefully you'll have fun 
and get to know the other people in in your group okay er this exercise is not 
assessed er however there will be a photographic record of it that's about the 
er er the only thing we can say er and in this morning you are particularly 
lucky not just to have still photographs taken which er which er happened 
yesterday and w-, will happen to all groups but er you can see we've also got 
some er er got some er looks like a whole team of movie cameras here okay so 
we've got four groups here today i think it should be groups one two three and 
four yes 
su: 
nm5300: okay we'll check in a minute is there someone here from group one group 
two group three group four one two three four okay alright [laughter] well 
we'll see well we've definitely got group one and group two so group one's with 
me and we're going to be over in that far corner by the bar don't why i've 
chosen by the bar er group two er it's Jon Rourke here red t-shirt and you are 
going to be downstairs right so Jon's on his way to hover by his desk er group 
three assuming we've got a group three er are with Kay Sanderson er who's 
hiding behind the the flipchart and group four assuming we've got one er with 
Dave Haddleton there he is and you're going to be over in that far corner Kay's 
group just stay here ok so er Jon do you want to take group two off
nm5301: group two we can sort of meet out here 
nm5300: er group one if you just want to wander over to the far corner by the 
bar
nm5301: the first thing to do is actually find out who everybody is i've got 
some pens and i've got a bit of paper start us then 
sf5304: Hannah
nm5301: Hannah so double N 
sf5304: yes
nm5301: is that correct 
sf5304: that's right
sf5307: Christine
nm5301: Christine i apologise for my writing
sf5308: Rebecca
nm5301: Rebecca probably spelt wrong
sm5316: Stuart S-T-U
nm5301: it is R
sf5308: no that's right
nm5301: Okay S-T-U-A-R-T
nm5301: Matt
sm5317: yes
nm5301: okay good and i am i am Jon
nf5302: pay attention you guys cause you're going to have to remember all these 
names
sf5306: Laura
nf5302: Laura 
sm5312: er John
sm5313: Parul P-A-R-U-L
nf5302: P-A 
sm5313: R-U-L
sf5305: Rosani R-O-S R-O-S-A-N-I
sm5315: Paul
nm5301: so in a minute we're going to go outside and do one of these exercises 
but first thing it's important to do that's to know who everybody is so we've 
got this tennis ball and if you two want to come round here matt come round we 
could do three versus three or something couldn't we matt and stuart i've got 
the tennis ball i'm going to say a name and i'm going to throw it throw it at 
them i now remember rebecca's name [laughter] she's now got to throw it to 
somebody else
sf5308: Matt 
sm5317: Christine
sf5308: oops
sf5307: Stuart
sm5316: Hannah
sf5304: er Matt 
sm5317: Jon
nm5301: thank you er Stuart
sm5316: Rebecca 
sf5308: [laughter] that's me
sm5313: Kay
nf5302: Laura
sf5306: John
sm5312: David 
sm5314: Paul 
sm5315: Parul
sm5313: David
sm5314: Rosani
sf5305: Laura
sf5306: er Parul
sm5315: Paul
sm5316: Jon
nm5301: thank you Christine
sf5307: Rebecca
sf5308: Matt
sm5317: Hannah
sf5304: Jon
nm5301: thank you Stuart
nf5302: okay i think we should we should stop this this is going to get better 
as we go along we will have a chance er after the first activity to get to know 
each other a bit better this is just to kind of wake us up a little bit and er 
get ready for the first activity so if you sit down there's not going to be a 
whole load of briefing here er but each activity will be followed by an 
important activity and the important activity is thinking about what you did so 
i can warn you before we start there's two things going on here you're trying 
to achieve a task which are challenging and you're going to develop yourself as 
a team and your own role within the team so you are looking at three things 
getting it done working as a team and be-, being aware of your own contribution 
so after each activity i will be asking you to think along these three lines i 
think that's probably enough
nm5301: so the point is to learn how to work in teams and how learn something 
about your own the way you learn yourself er so some ground rules we need to 
start off with simply you know to establish how we are going to work for today 
one of the ones down at the bottom here you might want to be sort of thinking 
if you are going to stand there that's quite a good one maintain 
confidentiality what happens today is for you and you alone don't go round 
telling people about it unless you've got permission of the people you know 
you're telling about don't sort of say somebody did this and it was great and 
they did that and somebody was stupid because they did this just don't do that 
please maintain confidentiality about everything unless you've got permission 
from the rest of the people who are in the group anyway so the idea is we're 
going to take you're going to start to take well learn how to take 
responsibility for your own learning you are at university you are actually all 
legally adults now i think unless anybody's is seventeen no you're all eighteen 
you're all legally adults you all you can all vote there's not much you can't 
do in this country you can't drive a HGV i think that's one of the few things 
you can't do you're legally adults we're going to encourage you to take 
responsibility for your own learnings by the time you've left us with a degree 
you're fully functioning er well fully functioning adults gloss over that 
quickly you're fully functioning er learn and you know how to er educate 
yourself as well as be educated by other people so in order to er maintain a 
work one of the things you're going to have to to do is speak for yourself 
don't be bullied by other people don't be bullied by me speak for yourself but 
at the same time keep an open mind if somebody's saying something maybe you 
want to listen to that person before you sort of butt in and sort of say no 
you're wrong or i know how to do it or something like that be honest
nf5302: in other words be honest about your er successes and failures so listen 
to others it's quite a skill actually listening some of us are better at 
talking be constructive when you're making critical comments say how it could 
be better rather than what went wrong so so try to sort of talk about how you 
would improve, rather than saying i don't like that
nm5301: er maintain confidentiality i mentioned and final thing safety we're 
not doing anything particularly dangerous today but if i say stop you stop 
please you don't think about it you stop 
nf5302: now to anything you think's missing from this list is there anything 
you'd like to put on are you all happy with this happy to use this as a kind of 
code of practice er this is part i'm quite keen on er it's it's about learning 
about yourself i suppose er i think this is about as much as we need to do 
alright then we're on time so we're going to go down to the first activity 
which is down there so if you need coats or jumpers you don't need to take 
anything else with you 
nm5301: so we're going to go out and do an exercise it will not be dangerous 
sf5304: is this room going to be locked
nm5301: no it won't be locked but you can bring your bags and put them outside 
and they'll be fine just i don't know
nf5302: the only thing that needs to be said about this is that all the 
instructions you need are on the piece of paper er so you don't need to refer 
to any of us lurking unless it's something you know urgent to do with you know 
you've broken your ankle or something but otherwise you're on your own and all 
the information you need is here but we want to have some responsibility of 
telling you when things finish
su: yes and there will be strict penalties
nf5302: and the-, these are very strictly time limited as i pointed out before 
okay so whoever's going to take these instructions okay 
su: 
nf5302: okay
su: i'll read them out loud
nf5302: you're on your own you come with me
sf5306: your company is bidding to build a pipeline connecting a recently 
discovered oil field to on-shore facilities on the north east coast of Scotland 
your team has been invited to take part in the final qualifying round to select 
members of the project team final selection will be judged on the degree to 
which team working skills are displayed during this task the task is to be 
establi-, is to establish a pipeline to carry material between the recently 
commissioned positioned on one side of the room to the on-shore collection 
facilities on the other side of the room. 
su: is that the bucket 
sf5306: is that the bucket right
sm5318: the task will be completed when four mini-barrels containing black gold 
have been successfully transferred via the pipeline into the reservoir the gap 
marked with tape represents the North Sea and anything or anyone touching the 
ground in-between the tape will be swept away therefore the pipeline must 
remain suspended at all times and should have a minimum of three human 
supporters when completed
sf5306: the gap marked with tape represents the North Sea and anything t-, or 
anyone touching the ground in-between the tape will be swept away so you can't
su: right okay
sf5306: right so therefore the pipeline must be remain suspended at all times 
and should have a minimum of three human supporters when completed 
sm5318: supporters can stand on islands represented by the tiles but only one 
person can stand on an island at any one time however you are fortunate in that 
you can position these to suit your favoured route they represent the only way 
to cross the gap in safety there are various resources available to you but 
there are also some constraints 
sm5319: materials are available for constructing the pipeline lengths of high 
quality pipe and highly sophisticated connectors pipes and connectors are the 
only materials which can be used to construct the pipeline which must have no 
gaps pipes can be joined together using the special connectors the m-, mini-
barrels can be can only be transferred across the North Sea by travelling 
through the pipeline only one mini-barrel can be transferred at a time 
sf5306: in order to stimulate the hazards in the real environment simulate even 
the mini-barrels can only be handled by somebody wearing the correct safety 
gear to protect the eyes blindfolds please note whenever the blindfolds are 
worn these people will need constant supervision you have twenty-five minutes
su: jesus this is pretty difficult
sm5318: you have twenty-five minutes to deliver your oil and bring all of your 
equipment on shore but please note that there is a minimum five minute 
compulsary planning period during which time no construction may take place
sm5319: you have twenty-five minutes to deliver your oil and bring all your 
equipment on shore but please note that there is a minimum five minutes 
compulsary planning period during which time no construction may take place oh 
my god that is er 
su5322: okay let's see what we've got
su: right 
su: right 
su: okay 
su: okay 
su: what's next
[laughter] 
sm5320: so what do these barrels look like 
sm5318: where are the mini-barrels 
su: i don't know 
su: i don't know 
su: that's the bucket what's it you know that's
su: they get they get given to us when we finish 
sf5306: yeah it's going to go all over the place [laughter] 
su: and it's a maximum of three people 
su: how are we supposed to get 
su: is it a maximum is it
sf5310: was it a minimum minimum or maximum 
su: minimum
su: three people but
sm5318: these are the islands so you have to get people you have to get these 
islands across
sm5320: just grab a handful and use them as stepping stones like two or 
whatever is it there's three
sm5318: there's one person on each island 
su: yeah 
sm5318: but you can have three people in the middle 
su: so you can have three minimum
sm5318: minimum of three it's going to be more than three
su5322: yeah these islands so we connect it but you can only have three people 
holding it and we're not allowed to go in 
sf5309: and the pipe's not allowed to touch the ground then 
su5322: the pipe's not allowed to touch the ground 
su: what 
sm5319: yeah that's alright we'll just hold it er so you have to connect these 
pipes using what sorry was it
su5322: these bits 
sm5319: these
su: which are all bent 
su: but they're all bent so we so we can't even have a straight line
sm5319: you what
sf5309: kind of fiddling
sm5319: oh yeah
su: how many of these have we got 
su: six 
sm5319: six yeah 
su: ok have we got enough bits for the pipe 
su5322: zigzag but if there's six ok yeah so then we'd have like three corners 
we'd have three a person on each corner but if that's going to be trans-, if 
the ball's got to go through we've got to like have a it on a bit of a bit of a 
tilt but we could i suppose we could all like tilt if its a zigzag like if i'm 
holding like this triangle here i can just lift it up and it will go down 
sm5320: so we've got five so we can have six pipes 
sm5318: we've got four long ones and four small ones 
su5326: so you want the long one like that and then short one then long one yeah
su5325: yeah that makes sense
sm5318: if you want the long one yeah long one straight up and the short ones 
across 
sm5320: so we've got to roll a little thing down it so it's got to go downhill 
su5325: yeah so it's got to
sm5318: yeah but you can move it 
su: oh can you
su5326: yeah we've got people holding it
su5325: somebody can just sort of who's down here just hold it up and
sm5318: if you have one person in each corner then you can move it down to the 
next corner yeah
su: these are all the same yeah
su: they're not at right-angles are they
su: it's not quite a corner is it
su: who are the blindfolded people
su: they are the only people that can touch the barrels
sm5319: and what are the mini-barrels
su5322: and then is it the golf ball 
sm5319: okay well
su: isn't that gold black gold
sm5319: the mini-barrels can only be handled by someone wearing the correct 
safety gear
su5322: so that means you have to put it in the end i think and we have to like 
tip it and as it's going down you have to be guided to collect at the other end 
so we have to like hold it about half way along so you can go through but we're 
only allowed one person on each of those islands so you're going to have to go 
on one on your own and someone's going to have to guide you on it and off it
su5325: so where are the
sm5312: yeah where are the barrels
sf5306: one at this side one at the other side to collect and put it in
sf5310: yeah
su: right
sm5318: so we're going to have to have one yeah
sm5320: we should all just get in a line and just push it along 
su: unless you want to make the pipe line first
sm5320: yeah build it over here and just pass it along
sm5312: yeah and then like put the islands out
su5326: yeah get people in position then
sf5306: yeah then we can pass the pieces across
su: yeah
sf5306: i take it as soon as we get across the sea you can stand on that side 
without the islands
sm5321: so would it be a good idea if we split into two groups and we build 
half the pipe work each end
sm5313: you can't get round
sf5305: you can't
sm5321: we can go across with the islands can't we
sm5313: yeah one person sort can pick up all of them 
sm5321: is that a good idea or not
sm5313: and er we're going to have to make the islands in a zigzag pattern
su: yeah
sm5315: yeah i think that that's probably best if we did half and half idea in 
the middle
sm5314: now we've got an idea of like the zigzag of it
sf5306: are we allowed to move the islands once we've laid them down
sm5314: no
su: we're not
sm5314: no i don't think so
sf5306: well
sm5315: it doesn't say that
sm5314: what does it say i don't know
sf5306: it says that however you are fortunate you can position these to suit 
your favoured route so it doesn't say you can't change them it just says one on 
each island so you can yeah lie it down step on that one then
sf5305: lift that one up and 
su5322: see isn't that the island that we're getting to and then we're bringing 
them over here cause of course we wouldn't start on the island would we so we 
have to get over there get them and bring them back oh blimey
sm5321: so we've had about ten minutes or we could er do you reckon we could 
get a route through that we just don't know how many zigzags yet do we
sf5305: if we make
sf5306: yeah you can't well
sm5315: it's not too it's not really that much of a zigzag really cause it 
comes back
sm5321: you can make it come back on itself
sm5315: so it's just it's not it's pretty straight basically really
sm5314: it's a bit of a jump though you won't be able to get across will you
sm5315: this is yeah
su: you have to it doesn't look far but it is
sm5315: so basically we need an island there island there island there
su: we've got eight islands
su: well not if you're building it first
sm5315: suppose
sf5306: you don't need a if you're building it first
sm5315: oh i suppose yeah yeah true true
su: no you could just go straight across can't we 
sf5306: you just need one like there and one there
su: we could build them in a line i don't know
sm5315: it's probably best for someone to be holding it there there
su: yeah
su5322: all you have to do is get all you have to do is get from there to here 
that's all
sm5319: or you could go over there and get it
su5322: you're the only one that can touch them so you have to get from there 
to here but like before the ball gets here if that makes sense so we can hold 
the pipes but we can't touch what's inside there 
su5323: touch what these pipes
sm5319: no the stuff over there
su5323: oh is there something over there ah now i get it right
su5322: but we could we don't have to do them one at a time it cause says four 
so we could put them all in and we just have to like wait while she jumps
sf5311: i thought we did have to 
su5322: oh do we 
sf5311: i don't know
su5322: i think we best read it
sm5315: in the middle of the long ones or actually at the joints i don't know 
where is it
sm5313: cause if we going to be passing the barrels from the middle we're going 
to have someone to direct them okay i think we should build it first 
sf5306: so do you want to yeah i think we should build it
su: okay
su: let's build it
sm5314: well the half and half could work though cause if you joined up in the 
middle 
sf5305: well what if they don't meet in the middle
su: and we're standing there
sm5315: we're standing on the islands and it's like er cause otherwise it's 
just going to probably fall down
su: it'll be difficult to yeah
sf5306: yeah okay then so
sm5315: if we try and get half to the other side 
sm5314: hold up that means we've got to try and do the islands remember
sm5315: right but you can move it
sf5306: but it doesn't say we can't move the islands as long as say you have 
two so
su5324: it goes there's only one mini-barrel can be transferred at a time 
su5322: it does yeah it does oh damn so best quick are we allowed are they 
telling us when we've when we've cause it should've been five minutes
sm5319: oh right okay right should we construct this thing then i don't know 
yeah should we make this then
su: should we just check so we don't get told off
su5322: Dave has it been five minutes cause it
nm5303: haven't you been keeping time
su5322: i have but i'm just wondering if you were meant to be telling us when 
five minutes is up five minutes is up go go go
sm5314: can someone just one person
sf5306: always make sure that you can reach 
sf5305: the one in front of you so you throw it
sm5314: what's that should someone just take all of them and make a make a path 
across for now
sm5313: yeah
sf5306: okay then who wants to do that then
sm5313: and then we can just sort of like keep a spare island in case we need 
to change it a bit 
sm5319: who wants to go first
su: if we stand like this we could book a session
sf5306: who's good at jumping
sm5314: er go on then
sf5306: you alright
su: should we
sf5305: don't put 
sm5314: so i'll put my first one there
sf5306: well can't yeah
su5322: so we need three we need three that are just for people
su5323: have someone in the middle
su: yeah
su5322: and then we need some for us to walk on
sm5319: mm
su: yeah
su5322: do you know what i mean
su5324: well if there's three for people to stand on that'd be five for you to 
walk on
su5322: so Vince if you take two tiles one for you to stand on 
sm5319: yes
su: how are we going to chuck them right over there water along there
sm5319: no chuck them and they'll
su5322: no you need to take more you need to take if you take a lot and as you 
go
sm5319: oh crap er should i do that now
su: they're not all 
su: do you not need one 
sm5319: well er 
su5322: you need to make a route for you to walk across and that we can use 
when we walk and then also drop some for the people who are going to stand on 
them to use
su5323: but only one person can stand on an island at a time so if he's 
standing at the other end and he's trying to get across
sm5319: so how ma-, 
su5322: okay we need two separate so we need one for people one for us to walk 
across there and back and then one for the people who are just going to stand 
there and hold pipes
sm5319: yeah cause as there are going to be zigzags you've got to make it in 
the right place
su5322: yeah
sm5319: so i don't know how to judge how cause i haven't even seen it really
su5322: do you think we should set it up as a practice 
su: yeah let 
su: i think we should er 
su5322: so we can see how big it is and see how far away it is
su5323: do we have a time limit this time
su: twenty-five minutes
sm5319: twenty-five minutes yeah
su: it's probably about twenty minutes left
nm5303: it's twenty-five minutes total
sf5311: should we use the long one's
su5322: oh twenty twenty-five minutes in total so we've actually only got about 
blimey okay quick oh i can't do it
su: are we doing it in a zigzag shape or 
su5323: that's on it'll stay
su: there you go 
su5322: yeah
su: maybe this one's mm
su5323: are we going to connect that up to here
sf5311: what am i doing
su: hold on no
sm5319: you need the other end yeah
su: the other end
su5322: are they all the same length
sm5319: no 
sf5309: no
su: that one's shorter
su: strange
su5322: oo it's really tall
sf5309: that should about hold it shouldn't it
su: yeah that'll be alright
su: careful to not get drifted along
su: does that mean we lose you if you like you're out of 
sf5305: it's quite far away isn't it
sm5315: it is isn't it
sm5321: should we carry on with the building
sm5315: oh yeah yeah yeah why are we just watching him doing it 
su: no i think that bit that's probably half of it 
sf5306: when you're over there do you want to make sure that the barrels are in 
the bucket
sm5315: there's three small one's and two big one's so i think that's probably 
half of it already
sm5321: so we might as well just
sf5305: sorry sorry sorry
sm5314: yeah they're all there
sf5306: yeah cool how many 
sm5314: lots
sf5306: oh good cause i thought we might be racing against them but 
sm5314: they're golf balls though
sf5306: alright okay 
sm5315: should i start taking this lot over 
sf5306: right if they're got to if you've got to get them through surely it'll 
be a slight slant on it for them to roll down
sf5305: yeah so somebody tall has to stay here no no tall over there
sm5315: someone tall has to go over there
sf5305: over there
sf5306: so the tall person's got to go over there
sm5315: so you have to go over that's okay
sm5321: right i'll take the two
su5326: we're using initiative here and copying
su5325: if you use like bigger steps you can probably
sf5306: we could just leave them down
su: yeah we don't have to collect them up
sf5306: cause if the if the gaps are big enough for it to stretch all the way
sm5315: she stays here she's smallest
sf5306: do you want to try and join it then we might have to move the islands
sf5305: well while we're joining them together in the middle if i go and stand 
there so that i can support it while the person in the middle joins them 
together do you know what i mean
sm5315: yeah yeah 
sf5305: yeah
sm5315: okay so you shall i go in the middle
sf5306: do do we have another connector
su5323: oh no
sm5319: that'll do 
su5323: mind the North Sea i'll provide entertainment at the other end
sf5309: here we go
su: do you need another one of those thingys
su5322: do we need this many oh i suppose it's quite a long way and then maybe 
have a little one to like drop it oh no cause we won't have hang on see if you 
can hold this with three people who's going to hold this
sm5319: am i holding it as well yeah
su: yeah you too
su5322: well we'd be washed away by now
sf5309: yes we would 
su5322: they're not very er i don't think really these are top market connectors
sf5305: maybe we should just get them to hold it at the connecting point
sm5313: yeah
sf5305: woah
sm5313: woah
sf5306: we can do it so you just pass one bit at a time
sf5305: one bit a time should we send half of it through
sm5313: okay should i just sort of like
sf5306: don't drop it
sm5313: okay what am i
sf5306: right
su: you can connect it in bits don't worry about that
su: yeah you connect it in bits
sf5306: someone else has got to hold up
su5322: so
sm5319: am i making the little islands then
su5322: we-, okay one person needs to stay at the end just in case it's not 
long enough so they can feed it on and connect
sm5319: so i might as well at the end if i'm doing those island things no yes i 
don't know
su5322: so so are we going to do we can use five of them to like make a route 
for us to walk on
sm5319: yeah
su5322: and then you just need three so they've got to be this far apart so 
maybe maybe sort of like a route thing and do one for yourself to stand on and 
then we'll have to like feed the pipe and us two can go over with the pipe 
sounds really easy doesn't it
sf5306: do you need to go up another one
sm5315: er 
sm5313: i think one of them's going to have to come onto the island
sm5315: yeah yeah so if you move o-, move over move up you both move up one 
basically whilst you are carrying it that's what you've got to do 
sf5306: okay
sm5315: but do you understand no
sf5306: yeah connect this take that one from her
sm5315: need a connector haven't got a connector guys
sm5313: here
sm5315: got to go back
sm5313: hold on a sec-, 
sm5315: go back
sf5306: no no just take one off that end
sm5319: er how how much further shall i oh is it three at a time no it's not
su: try and make it sort of zig-zagish shape
sm5319: just copy them then zigzagish 
sm5319: probably not
sm5312: wait a sec-, have you got it
sm5315: yeah you've moved it away now can you
sm5321: let's push this forward
sm5315: i still need to move round a little bit more
sm5321: which way do you want us to go
sm5315: that way
sm5315: come on
sm5321: just do it roughly and just as long as the balls don't fall out should 
i do the blindfold bit
sm5315: alright okay this is the best as it's going to be 
sf5306: right
sm5315: okay give it a go
sm5321: right
sf5306: you've got to hold right
sm5321: i'm directing now
sf5306: we need to hold that part up a bit more
sf5305: can i pull it a bit this way
sf5306: i think we're going to have to like twist it
sm5315: yeah yeah that would be a lot easier if you pulled it that way pulled 
it that way
sf5305: can you yeah but i don't want to 
sm5315: a bit more
sf5306: it doesn't say you can't put it under the tape put it under the tape
sm5313: can i do that
sf5306: you can now
su: guys you need to direct him
sm5315: alright okay er 
sf5306: right you'll have to direct him 
sm5315: can you hold it here
sf5306: you're all going to have to move up one and you're going have to can 
you rest it in the bucket
sf5305: no it's not long enough i need to it
sm5313: can you twist it 
sf5305: oh
sm5313: yeah okay that's fine 
sm5319: do you want a zigzag yeah
su5322: well no not isn't this just for us to walk on and then we're going to 
put three down for us to er 
sm5319: oh yeah yeah good point
sf5311: just do a walking path 
su5322: so imagine it's like just for us to walk
sm5319: so do you want five
sf5309: just five yeah five
sf5311: we're not going to get it
sf5309: i think you need to 
sm5319: yeah i think it's going to need to be spread out more
sf5309: yeah
sf5311: yeah definitely
su5322: you're going to have to do this with a blindfold on jumping from these 
woo
su: don't think i 
sm5319: okay do you reckon you could handle that gap
su5322: oh no bigger than that otherwise we're never going to get that's four 
of them already
su: bigger gaps
sm5319: let's be perfectly honest you're not going to be able to make it if 
it's like properly wide out alright you want it about there so you er hang on 
so you want to try and get from here to there
su5322: no not that far a little bit closer
sm5319: oh there
su: that's quite good
sm5314: i've got to put the blindfold on
sf5305: can you give me a little bit more
sm5315: it's coming out a little bit here
sm5317: okay
sf5308: i think right we should have
sm5317: one of you is holding and you is blindfold you're going to be in the 
sea you're going to be in the sea so i'll be this side so you need to be 
further towards there
su: okay have you got two can you walk on two
su: yeah i can walk on two
su: i've got some more over here
sm5317: so she's going to be roughly a bit closer than where she is now and 
then we can pass the pipe across and start with 
su: do you want some more tiles
su: er hang on
sf5310: so
su5325: we might not need that short bit
sf5310: no i don't think we do do we
su5325: no
sm5318: so
su5325: right now we're standing here
sf5310: so where's the barrels
su5325: right the barrels are in that bucket
sf5310: are they can we use that
su5325: that bucket over there
sf5310: so someone needs to get some
su5325: how many yeah four
sf5310: er deliver your oil
su: how many barrels do we have to get across
su5325: four 
su: Charles can you support that end if he goes with him
su: we could pass an island along
su5325: hang on Laura
sf5306: yeah
su5325: can you pass that one along
sf5306: sure
su5325: that's probably quite an 
sf5306: no it won't
su5325: oh no we can't 
sf5306: it won't reach
sm5319: are you are you alright
su5322: we nearly got washed away
nm5303: that's your last chance next time a person's going to be swept away
su: can you reach this
su: hang on
sm5319: or you can just put them down and step on them and pick them up again
su5322: like this 
su5323: yeah and it's easier
sf5309: who's going over to hold it now
su: okay you need to you know tell that 
sm5319: oh dear this is
su5323: pick one up and pass it along
su5322: yeah
sf5306: yeah one at a time so don't put any more in until we say
sm5315: er okay
sf5306: oh 
sf5305: oh no
sf5306: er where did it go
sf5305: it's not gone it's not come out it's
sf5306: wait a minute don't put another one in
sf5305: yeah it did next
sf5306: wait wait wait wait cause it's it's broken okay go on
su5325: ready
sm5319: go on jump
su5322: okay well i'm go-, i'm going to give you this now Vince cause i need to 
go
sm5319: okay go right go on
su5322: okay
su: this is quite fun
su: you're bending it
su: you alright thre how you doing
su: there you go
sf5309: oh got it
su: look it's gold dust
sf5309: oh true 
su: are you ready for this
sm5319: we've got the pipe back together 
sm5319: have we got any more bits
su5322: i thought we were oh how are we going to get back
sm5319: i don't know you don't need to get back do you
su5323: do we need to get back it could be a suicide mission we could stay here 
forever we don't mind as long as we get the gold across
su5322: yeah but yeah but you've got to tip it and you've got to be at the 
other end to handle it or do we need to can it not just roll down the hill it's 
quite valuable stuff
su5323: so you're going to have to hold it in one of the bends of the pipe
sm5319: what leave it in yeah
su5322: yeah you're going to have you're going to have to wait for us
su5323: so do i have to go back and forth and take it out
su5322: right i reckon we should get going
sm5319: how is she going to get past
su5323: i have to go back and forth and get them out
su5322: well we need that pipe
su: no look
sm5319: no no here they're working their's they're working their's in a bucket 
so still no-one's touching it are they
su: they're putting there's in a bucket
sf5311: they're putting it up let's just drop it
sm5319: yeah let's drop it in our bucket then
sm5321: ready
sm5314: yeah
sm5315: 
sf5306: don't twist
sf5305: don't twist it too much
su: it's still here
sm5313: it isn't here yet
sf5305: right
sf5306: okay next how many do you have to get in
sm5314: all of them i think
su5322: have you got it Claire don't let it go in
sf5309: okay yeah got it
su: it'll be fine
su5322: you should be able to do it get it out is that going to reach
sm5319: yeah yeah
su5324: we could even put the do you reckon we could put the
su: yes
su: yeah okay right
su: just don't touch it it's dangerous
su: oh no
sm5319: that was
sf5309: oh my god
sm5321: got it
sm5314: ready
su: go
sm5315: see it
sm5314: see its lucky work i got that accidentally can i take my blindfold off 
now
sm5315: don't know just wait until it gets there
sf5306: oh oops
sf5305: it's gone back
sf5306: not actually is it there yet
sm5313: no we-, it's so it somewh-, yeah okay
sf5305: right yeah it's in
sm5313: i was like
sf5306: okay right
sf5305: now do we have to take the pipe back
sf5306: i don't know
nf5302: you've now come up to your twenty-five minutes
su: right
sm5315: did we do it
nf5302: well i think you did we will go back in after this and discuss it could 
you actually dismantle your
su: that was alright
sm5314: right now now we'll see
su: its not really water
nf5302: you completed the task well done
sf5306: okay yes
sm5318: got it we got three 
su: huh we need another one
sf5306: we need four
su: we need four
sf5306: yes
su5325: lack of group communication
sf5306: yeah
sm5318: we have to bring everything er which one's our er we have to bring 
everything back again
sf5306: yeah
sf5310: did we get it done
sm5318: right we have to bring everything back again
su5325: take it off yeah
su: so do you want to collect the last one or do we need them all in a pile
su: no we can just do it one at a time
su5322: how are we doing are they in the bucket
su: we've got one
sm5319: we've got one
su5322: oh we are good at this aren't we 
su: how many have we got
su: two
su: only two
su: yeah this is the third
sf5311: i'll shimmy back and then
sm5319: or you could stand on that and then just chuck it over
sf5311: could do yeah
sm5319: well we dropped it on the floor
su: oh no
su: did you
su5324: we've got four in here 
sf5309: we've got four
su5324: yeah
sm5319: basically should we just throw the pipes back
sf5311: should we yeah undo the pipes and just throw them chuck them back
sf5309: okay
su5324: oh are we undoing them
sf5309: put the bucket down
su: just like feed it along so
sf5309: hang on
su5322: do either of you go if you go down are you splitting it up
su5324: yeah
sm5319: sort of javelin throw it
sf5311: have you got it 
su5324: you got it
sf5309: yeah this big one might come undone
su5324: i've got it i've got it don't worry no i don't
su5322: one of those kind of you know that Persil advert where they're all like 
they were really pleased with the result then he had been told
sf5309: we didn't really need it though did we
su5323: if i reach out and out it there grab out and move it
su5322: la la la oh i can't touch it i haven't got my blindfold on can i have 
another one please la la la that's quite a good island
sm5319: what's the time quarter to twelve 
sm5319: yeah i know i know yeah i know what you mean actually they're blatantly 
they're just laughing at us but
su5322: look at that team over er er 
sm5319: admittedly we did look a bit stupid when the pipe broke and our ball 
fell off
su5324: and their pipes looked perfect did you see their pipe it looked perfect 
like all properly positioned and everything
su5323: really
nm5303: how long's the time who's the timekeeper
sm5319: yeah how long was it
su5322: oh we took far too long well no actually no bang on 
nm5303: bang on
su5322: exactly half an hour to do the whole lot
sm5319: we were allowed twenty-five minutes 
nm5303: seeing as i told you you've got twenty-five minutes bang on 
su5322: oh no shame
sm5319: no don't you mean half an hour including the five minutes of planning 
it yeah that's right
sm5313: okay already there
nf5302: ok it was just to get your first thoughts down before you started to 
share them so in terms of this activity er what's your overall feeling about 
how well you did how do how do you rate yourself after this first activity 
su: we completed the task
sf5305: we completed the task 
sf5306: yeah but i think it was quite close 
sm5315: it was close
sf5305: yeah it was close
sf5306: so we could have done better
su: time management
sm5315: i think we took a bit of time to actually do action while we talked a 
little bit too much maybe instead of actually doing it 
sf5306: yeah that's what i put down yeah
nf5302: so in terms of your own feelings about it you know er h-, did you enjoy 
it er what was what were your own personal feelings about doing it 
su: pleased yeah 
su5322: we did it but i i felt a bit rubbish in front of the other group oh 
yeah and we were like
sm5319: yeah you felt felt a bit outdone by them
su5322: yeah i i felt like like if we'd been out on our own i would have been 
really pleased with us but
su: yeah
sm5319: should i write jealous of other team
nm5303: so you so you think in all it's a bit of a competition
sm5319: well yeah it was kind of
su5322: the other guy was going are you finding this constructive we were like 
oh yeah he was taking it seriously
sm5319: and you were going oh no can't fall into the sea you're going to get 
swept away er 
nm5303: so we've got a bit of a mixture there positive and negative feelings
su: i think pleased is a good word
su: yeah
sm5319: yeah not amazingly happy but alright
su: challenging
nf5302: when you first saw what you had to do er what did you feel
sf5305: oh my god
sf5306: aft-, after after talking about it with each other it was became 
clearer and that so
nf5302: yeah yeah what what was the first thing that happened aft-, after you'd 
read it through then what what happened next
sm5314: just decided on er started thinking about how to make the pipeline 
didn't we
sf5306: yeah some people like picked up on different parts of what like the 
whole thing
su: the group like all together
sm5313: i think we each just pr-, you know pretty much took our own roles and 
then we decided who was going to be where and
nf5302: how did that happen
sf5305: i think it just sort of happened nobody
sm5313: i think people just started with what they would be better at
sm5315: just decided what they wanted to do
sf5306: some people did allocate some other people like
su: yeah
sm5315: i think Laura you took a little bit of charge not in a bad way i'm just 
saying that you you were probably like if there was a leader you'd probably 
like 
su5324: we planned it
su: and we er were more conscious of the time so
su5324: yeah and we took more like concern over the rules we kept looking back 
at the rules this time to make sure we followed them
su: yeah
su5322: er i think everyone was a lot more involved like different people were 
taking more active roles this time like you and Davina were like doing more 
active stuff which was really good like just a bit different
nf5302: er when i was i didn't come close up to your discussions but when i saw 
you from a distance i did see that the four the six of you were facing inwards 
and you appeared to be kind of listening to each other so i was impressed by 
that i thought for your first shot you you kind of started to act as a team you 
didn't fragment immediately so th-, that was that was quite impressive er in 
terms of the next activity er is there anything you've learnt from this one 
that you think you might like to roll into the next one
sm5314: time management should be a bit better
sf5306: yeah definitely
nf5302: tell me a bit more about this time management
sm5314: well we didn't realise we didn't know there was an exact time limit 
well 
sf5306: until the end
sm5314: we knew there was an exact time limit but we didn't know what it was 
then we didn't then we found out at the end what it was so then we were just 
thought ah we take about a few minutes yeah
sf5305: to just read this
sf5306: we weren't aware the time limit mattered
nf5302: so if that that was at the bottom of the list wasn't it so what does 
that kind of suggest to you
sm5314: it means next time as soon as we get the paper we're going to start 
timing
sm5315: check the time limit
nf5302: so i act-, actually had timed you as well so i stopped you but i mean 
it's getting right to the bottom isn't it and making sure that you all know it 
before you 
su: yeah
nf5302: before you dash off we did notice that nobody was in fact timing you 
although you had twenty-five minutes so you kind of relying on the outside 
though it might er so what you'd like to improve is your time management just 
just run me through how apart from knowing what the time is how would you do 
time management
sf5306: maybe like call it out
su: give warnings
sm5315: i could say oh we've got ten minutes to go so you've got to like back 
the group up
sf5306: five minutes or depending however much time we're given
nf5302: going onto the second question which is really about your-, yourself as 
a team as if forgetting about the task which i think you did very well actually 
what kind of how do you think you gel as a team
sm5313: we only just met about like 
su: that's what makes it better actually
su: yeah
sf5305: it was good that everybody listened to each other and like er nobody 
like started dominating like you should go over there and you should go o-, 
sf5306: everybody made suggestions
sf5305: yeah
nf5302: that's good so in terms of general ideas that you might get about how 
teams work ignoring you six but just thinking in general what lear-, have you 
learnt about teams from this activity if anything
sm5315: i think communication's probably the most important bit
sf5305: yeah you need to talk to each other
sf5306: yeah it's a lot easier to solve a problem when you can like bounce 
ideas off each other than just stand there and try and think it out
sm5315: cause if we actually did it like should we chuck the islands in and 
just like try to make the pipe straight away we probably would've just 
completely messed it up
sf5306: yeah or broken one of the rules or something
nf5302: so it's quite important that members of the team kind of take a pause 
and think about what everybody has to say before they start actually doing it i 
noticed actually that some of you were rather keen to get touching the pipes 
you know
sm5315: i was i was straight in there
nf5302: that's cool that works well too er 
sm5313: we were looking for the gold first
sm5315: yeah we were like that was that was the main thing that was just like 
that was er 
nf5302: in terms of the whole er morning cause you've got another couple of 
exercises er because you already work well as a group i did i thought that you 
were quite impressive as a group it might be worth trying different roles 
within the group so just have a think about what your role was in this group 
the the last ex-, activity what er it's something that we it's not on this list 
but just think about your own role you know how you contributed to it all all 
happening and maybe make a couple of notes to yourself about what you 
personally contributed you know give yourself a gold star for this or a kind of 
trying hard or somethi-, some aspect of teamwork that you'd like to improve and 
maybe just make a a quick note of it on somewhere on here okay i won't ask you 
to tell me what it is but just think about the things that you contributed 
personally
sm5319: ok so what could we have done better
sf5309: i thought we could have had better equipment that actually stayed 
together and didn't fall apart 
su: yeah
sm5319: and that
nm5303: could have been provided with better equipment
sf5309: yeah
su5322: but the other team did it with it
su: i don't care
sm5319: i think i don't think we actually connected it like fully in cause they 
were quite stiff so
su5322: yeah we needed to be like twisted in yeah
sm5319: so should i write connect equipment better
su5322: yeah and i said that we could have like maybe drawn a diagram like 
cause we were all there and then we were like oh should we just put it together 
and see like we didn't actually like i don't know
su: we were sort of stuck
su5322: yeah we we were just like you know yeah and like when Davina was like 
trying to get and we kind of lost it it was like er it just seemed a bit if 
we'd had a plan a visual thing we probably could have in that first five 
minutes could have done it a bit better
sm5319: so draw a diagram anything else no
nm5303: are you happy with that you started off saying you should have had 
better equipment but Vince has written down should have put the equipment 
together better so which is it
sf5309: i don't know
nm5303: so you are happy with th-, the fact or not
su5324: i actually think their equipment was a bit different from our's the 
other team's cause their pipes fitted together perfectly and they weren't like 
too big like our pipes we were like trying to hold them one side there one side 
here where as their's was kind of perfectly fitted like together and they had 
better equipment i think
su: through no fault of our own
su: i think we should have ignored the other team
sm5319: blame blame the tools
su5322: ignore th-, the other people
su5323: so if there was gold across the sea you'd have thought it would be 
something slightly more hi-tech you know computers involved
nm5303: have you ever heard that saying a bad workman blames his tools and 
you're sitting here going we had the wrong tools no i thought i mean if you 
think about how you planned it you were told you needed five minutes to plan 
and you and you spent longer than five minutes you almost didn't you were 
desperate wasn't you right five minutes is up let's do it and everybody carried 
on planning which was quite quite good so the reaction is easiest is pleased 
you've got no negative things though people were saying negative things
sm5319: we dropped the ball in the river
nm5303: pardon
sm5319: we dropped a ball in the sea
nm5303: dropped a ball in the sea
