nm5361: er now last time we went through some question not very successfully 
and there were two reasons for the unsuccess one is that not many people had 
tried the questions and the other was that i was using overheads that nobody 
could read because they were too small and with luck this time i've expanded 
them in size enough to be readable right er and i said that this time i'd do 
the two-thousand-two paper last year's paper and i suggested some selected 
questions one four and six in the email which you may or may have not got right 
er so let's have a go the first question who has tried which questions who 
tried question one who tried question four and who tried question six right so 
one four and some watchers of the performance it's not a very valuable 
experience better than nothing maybe right er now question one is the 
irrigation question how are we doing with it
of5362: 
nm5361: just carry on shall i
of5362: yes just carry on 
nm5361: question one is an irrigation question and irrigation's rather a 
plotting sort of subject in which you multiply coefficients together to get 
totals and in the question you were given a table with some data in which time 
is split up into three thirty day groups in a ninety day growing season and you 
were given the expected rate for the evapotranspiration of the reference crop 
in millimetres per day this is the sort of property of the location the climate 
the dryness of the air the temperature and er a crop coefficient which relates 
to this particular crop to the reference crop when the coefficient is less than 
one this crop is evapotranspiring less than reference crop and if its greater 
than one more er and a root depth in meters and a rooting factor which is a 
fraction of the volume of the soil that the roots has access to the water right 
and as most of the water is held in little pockets which are a fraction of a 
millimetre in diameter it takes an awful lot of root like many kilometres of 
root to fill a cubic meter soil and reach most of the water in it so therefore 
the crop can't reach all the water now that has various implications one of 
them is that quite of lot of the water that's stored there is not available to 
the crop i suppose one of the main concerns here a bit more information was 
given in the question it said that the soil had particular characteristics and 
the ones that will obviously interest us are how much water is stored in the 
soil er which is the difference between the field capacity and the rooting 
point and that's per meter depth of soil but unfortunately the roots are not 
exactly one meter deep deep so we've got to correct for that and the roots 
can't reach all the soil so we've got to correct for that and then separately 
and er quite a separate sort of calculation is infiltration rate of eight 
millimetres per hour [coughs] excuse me er and we are told that there's a board 
irrigation efficiency of fifty percent so there's fifty percent losses and 
fifty percent going where we want it into the soil and it suggests that the 
fifty percent that didn't go into the soil when we wanted either went too deep 
into the soil or overflowed the furrows at the bottom of the field and we need 
that figure for one of the calculations er so that's the question or part of 
the question lets now look at the answer we'll carry on with the question for 
the moment after calculating a variety of things er so the crops total water 
needs per nineteen acre growing cycle the fraction of this to come from 
irrigation the maximum of water available in millimetres to the crop which 
varies from s-, s-, different stages to growing cycle of crop because of roots 
have different depths the maximum of whole days between watering in one of the 
three periods and the maximum irrigation flow necessary to water the plot and 
in a way the last one is the easiest so did people do the last one or back to 
that set of questions
su: i didn't think it was the easiest
nm5361: er you've got this plot and you've got a stream going towards it and 
the flow rate of stream is going to be equal the rate at which you apply water 
to the soil the rate at which you apply water to an area of soil is 
proportional to 
su: size 
nm5361: size the area of the soil yes an to some coefficient of how fast you 
can apply it in millimetres per hour [coughs] and we're talking eight 
millimetres per hour on previous slide was the rate with which you applied so 
in theory all you need to do is you say well we need a stream a flow to water 
this field which is equal to the size of the field in square meters multiplied 
by er the rate at which we can push water into the ground in millimetres per 
hour because one millimetre this will be in litres one millimetre applied to 
one square meter is a litre er unfortunately how much water are we actually 
pushing into the soil well er when we push water into the soil er where's it 
going some of its going too deep and some of its overflowing so there's a bit 
of argument about what efficiency factor we ought to use here and there's a 
sort of a choice whether we use point five or point seven five point five is 
the overall efficiency er but that relates to the water that goes to the right 
place in the soil if we take the water that goes to the right place and the 
wrong place in the soil its three quarters of the water leaving a quarter to 
overflow at the bottom er er so there are some questions about that and i am 
realizing that simple answer i am proposing is not the one i've numerically got 
here er er so at its simplest we've got the area of the soil multiplied by 
eight millimetres per hour is going to give us the rate at which we supply 
water to it but as usually when we supply water to it a quarter of its going to 
overflow to the bottom of the field we ought to correct for that by dividing by 
point seven five to take into account the water that's flowing of the bottom of 
the furrow as well as the water that's percolating into the soil because the 
water we supply is going has got to do both those jobs so that's the easiest 
bit really er now what i've done as sort of standard solution if you'd like to 
first of all layout the different formulae that are involved in these theorist 
questions to be answered such as the evapotranspiration of this particular crop 
will be that of the size of crop times as correction factor K crop coefficient 
that's the definition of the crop coefficient that the water required will be 
the evapotranspiration of this particular crop minus what is provided by 
rainfall that the irrigation water will be the water that we try to apply 
divided by the efficiency with which we apply it the lower of the efficiency 
the more water we have to apply separate question the water available in the 
soil is going to be the er the wilting point from the field capacity both 
expressed in millimetres per metre corrected for th-, that part of soil we are 
interested in well the answer is corrected for depth where the roots reach to 
because we are only interested in the soil that the roots are in [coughs] and 
also this rooting factor which is the fraction of that soil that the roots are 
reaching so the water available in the soil to the plant is going to be the 
difference between the maximum that the soil holds after it's just been watered 
and then drained minus the amount of water left in the soil at the point where 
sta-, poi-, plant starts wilting multiplied by those two factors B and F er 
right now therefore we've got a sort of systemic calculation to do which is 
best probably done in tabular form well i've done it in tabular form in which 
for each period we have the given rainfall we have er the standard crop 
evapotranspiration we have the various factors which are variable in the season 
[coughs] from those we can derive the evapotranspiration of this particular 
crop that's supposed to be starting C-R if the layout was correct er so s-, s-, 
so where's this figure two point four come from the evapotranspiration of this 
particular crop 
sf5363: 
nm5361: its evapotranspiration of the standard crop multiplied by the 
correction factor K which goes from the standard crop to this particular crop 
why's it done that way well because one can develop records for a standard crop 
maybe by doing experiments er there are various sort of tray and basin 
experiments in which you grow tall grass in a tray and weigh it until so from a 
particular climate one can predict with some accuracy what the standard er 
evapotranspiration is likely to be for the standard crop and why its different 
for our particular cropping basically because does it or does it not cover the 
ground
sf5367: so do you have to see if everything else is completely the same or just 
the climate and the soil
nm5361: yes yes er its its not a property of the soil it's the property of the 
climate and the er well just for climate really er we need temperature and so 
forth and then that's corrected for this particular crop because this 
particular crop may not be covering all the ground er so let's give it a big 
sticker in each case er so this is what the crop requires and that's what the 
rainfall provided so how much do we need to provide for irrigation in that 
context none er the rainfall is provided more than the crop required on the 
other hand in the later period the crop required nine point six the rainfall 
provided only four leaving a deficit of five point six so the irrigation the 
water to be sup-, supplied to the crop by irrigation is going to be what the 
crop requires minus what the rainfall has provided assuming and that's a fairly 
big assumption that the rainfall is nice and even because an enormous storm 
followed by ten days dry doesn't work too well which we'll come back to later 
in the question so we've got this column here what does the crop require this 
column here how much of that has got to come from irrigation this column here 
which is divided by the irrigation efficiency so to provide the crop with a 
certain amount of water then you divide by the efficiency of irrigation to get 
the larger quantity that you've got to supply er and what's the water available 
in the soil the water available is [coughs] going to be what do you think field 
capacity minus the wilting point multiplied by those two factors of crop root 
depth and root intensity er field depth er we'll leave the channel flow in fact 
we've already done the channel flow so just running through what's the crop's 
total water needs its going to be the sum of its water needs in each of the 
three these are for thirty days and the figures are given per day so you've got 
to multiply it by thirty er so we've got crop water needs will be thirty times 
the two point four is required then the nine point six is required then the 
seven there giving you five-hundred-seventy millilitres [coughs] if we then er 
take the factor of this which comes from irrigation which is these figures here 
water required for irrigation five point six and five that makes ten point six 
times thirty days er gives three-hundred-eighteen so fifty-six percent of the 
water that the crop requires has come from irrigation the other forty-four 
percent comes from rainfall have i lost anyone yet well put it this way have i 
lost anybody who tried the question
sf5363: 
nm5361: right er alright so we've got how much crop lo-, lo-, how much water 
the crop requires and how much of that needs to come from irrigation because 
there wasn't enough rainfall right now here we go well we've already calculated 
these they were put in the table the maximum water available in millimetres to 
the crops from storage in the soil was going to be the difference between the 
soil being full of water and the soil being minimum amount of water multiplied 
by the fraction of the crop that the roots can reach multiplied by the depth 
that the roots can reach and that's equivalent to a certain amount of the water 
and because the crop roots are getting deeper as we go on here and they're the 
penetration of the root here is increasing therefore this figure is increasing 
over the three growing seasons or three growing sectors mm mm maximum interval 
between watering well what's happening between watering the plant is using 
water stored in the soil right [coughs] so if we know how much it needs per day 
and we know how much water is stored in the soil and divide one by the other we 
should get how many days it'll last before it will need watering yeah
sf5363: did you mean watering by rainfall as well as irrigation
nm5361: no i meant irrigation so therefore we've got to have the deficit of 
quantity per day so if we go back to this table i hope i've done it
sf5363: taking into account
nm5361: sorry
sf5363: didn't you want us to take into account the rainfall
nm5361: well i have yes so if we take this figure here because we are taking 
period B for this part of the question if we take this sticker here after 
allowing for the rainfall we still need five point six millimetres per day and 
the soil to which the roots have got access is capable of storing er thirty-six 
millimetres so how often do we need to what's the maximum period of irrigation 
its going to be how much how many millimetres you've got available to the plant 
divided by the net requirement of the plant other than rainfall all under this 
nice bu-, but unfortunately untrue assumption of uniform rainfall evenly spread 
rainfall so er and now we're there we've did it because we did the last one 
just now yeah the last one the maximum irrigation flow is going to be we've got 
two hectares i think which is twenty-thousand square meters er and we've got 
eight millimetres per hour so that's going to be twenty-thousand times eight 
which is one-hundred-sixty-thousand which becomes one-hundred-sixty-thousand 
cubic meters if you put it into cubic meters instead of metres and then you've 
got to push that up because we've got to allow for the water that's overflowing 
at the bottom of the furrow and for every litre applied to the field a quarter 
of a litre goes every litre you apply to the field a third of a litre goes off 
the far end if the efficiency is effectively seventy-five percent so we 
multiply it by one and a third and that's a refinement
sf5364: are we including the fifty percent because of the furrow 
nm5361: right now i am putting water on the field [coughs] some of it isn't 
going into the field at all its overflowing the far end of that which goes into 
the field some of it goes to a place where the plant gets it and some of it 
goes too deep yeah and in the data given in the question its suggested first of 
all that fifty percent of the water went to where the plant could get it and 
fifty percent didn't the overall efficiency is fifty percent and then it says 
of that which is wasted if you like half of it went off the far end of the 
furrow and half of it percolated too deep now all the percolation water is 
covered by the eight millimetres an hour both that which goes to a useful place 
and that which goes too deep er so the extra you know the few can take eight 
millimetres per hour multiplied by theory so if no water was flowing off the 
far end that's the rate at which you would have to supply water to the field 
but because some is going off the far end as well it suggests that of a quarter 
of all the water applied is going off the far end so if at least three quarters 
is is going into the field and if three quarters takes eight millimetres times 
field area then the total water you supply will be four over three times eight 
millimetres times field area okay not rocket science really sort of 
coefficients multiplied together and added up irrigation is not the most exotic 
subject that was question one [coughs] any questions about well it wasn't all 
of question one because there's a part B and a part C but i'm not sure i'm 
going to go through that
sm5368: 
nm5361: sorry
sm5368: 
nm5361: mm
sm5368: sorry i'm okay cheers
nm5361: right er well there was some questions then about er when to use 
sf5366: when you
nm5361: drip irrigation and so forth
sf5366: when you're marking do you expect both as five marks as in five points 
or do you 
nm5361: is that a good answer a medium answer or a poor answer is it yes i mean 
where there's five points if there really are exactly five marks like that 
sometimes if there's ten points you could make you could say there are two 
points two parts sorry two points per mark
sf5366: i'm just looking down at half these you've got five marks and half 
nm5361: i see both er if it's an essay as you know it's an essay type reply is 
marked er according to its perceived quality that's absolutely outstanding 
that's jolly good that's barely adequate that's all rubbish or you know that 
sort of scale on the other hand the opposite extreme is there's mathematical 
questions where right answers take full marks er we are somewhere in between 
the two at the moment it says discuss and so forth its more er the essay scale 
of marking the central limit theorem unfortunately then comes into play and if 
you are not careful everybody gets more or less the same mark and if you break 
down questions there's large number of bits and then assess them by various 
sort of means er so i think actually you have to be more generous in marking a 
bit than you do the whole somehow so three fairly good bits is a very good 
whole that that sort of er trade off
su: would we be expected to know how many metres squared is in a hectare
nm5361: yes but i have mentioned it several times 
su: and its in the data book
nm5361: and its in the data book er would you like square miles this will push 
me a bit or acres forty-eight-four-o square yards to an acre which is a 
sf5367: isn't is a 
nm5361: furlong by a er a furlong by a something a furlong by a chain if you go 
back to antique units okay any i i'm not going to go through the rest of 
question one which is er more discursive unless you want me to
sf5365: i i was just on question C and the end bit
nm5361: yes
sf5365: and the end bit it says er during period A and period B i wasn't quite 
sure what the difference was between them in what you were supposed to say you 
know or is it the same problem with both of them
nm5361: now i'll desperately try and find the right piece of paper question C 
sf5366: 
nm5361: question one part A question answer one answer one question one
sm5368: isn't it period A isn't it just 
sm5369: can i just say its not in the data book in case anyone er they decided 
not to add it
nm5361: alright okay what area would you use for measuring area land area
su: metres
sm5368: square kilometres
nm5361: square kilometres yes do you know how many hectares in a square 
kilometre out of interest a hectare is one-hundred meters by one-hundred meters 
a square kilometre is a thousand meters by a thousand meters
sf5365: i didn't know that
nm5361: its easier that might make it slightly memorable
sf5365: 
nm5361: no no no it's a hundred by a hundred i'm still looking for the rest of 
the questions answer answer answer question question page three question page 
one question page two not the one i think you did an overhead of questions 
answer one pages-, page five answer one page four question i am holding an 
overhead with the rest of the question on so have you got it in front of you
sf5365: yeah oh the question
nm5361: yes thank you right so we've done all of this calc-, comment on micro 
theory of irrigation by significantly increasing efficiency of water 
application and why its unlikely to be used why is it unlikely to be used
sf5365: because its too expensive
nm5361: right it's a low valued crop er and its not and in fact the conditions 
are fairly favorable to furrow irrigation in the first place its not very 
difficult for favorable conditions for furrowing okay minimum rainfall per wet 
day is ten millimetres per day the actual rainfall may range as high as a 
hundred millimetres in a day on wet days this is spaced randomly rather than 
uniformly this is briefly what effects this what effects this variability is 
likely to have on the amount applied and the timing of irrigation now in a 
sense they are alternatives to each other because if you can vary when you 
irrigate and you wait and see when the rain comes does then you are adjust when 
you irrigate to the condition of the soil on the other hand just suppose you 
could measure the rain effectively [coughs] and quickly you have the competence 
to quickly do a calculation and say so much rain has fallen right and you 
maintain some sort of model of how much water is left in soil such that you 
know when the soil will be reaching its wilting point er now everybody does 
that to some extent if it rains heavily today its more than about ten 
millimetre or certainly more than twenty millimetres you will then excuse me 
more rainfall you will be able to tell how much percolated how much ran off but 
you will then effectively regard the soil as being the equivalent of just 
irrigated so you count your irrigation timing from then on the other hand we 
calculated our irrigation timing on the assumption of uniform rainfall so we 
now are switching into a different mode in which we've got rainfall the soil is 
saturated it doesn't rain at all in which case we've got to calculate when next 
to irrigate on the basis that all the crop's water requirement is going to come 
out of the soil which will be a shorter period then the one we've been 
calculating here we are assuming that some of it is provided by this steady 
even rain i stop there er i could go on a bit
sf5366: is it also saying that in period A we weren't going to do any 
irrigation but if itsuneven
nm5361: no if its uneven enough we will have to do some irrigation
sf5366: yeah but use more water than before
nm5361: what happens is you know if you have er uniformly spread rain and 
there's enough rain that's fine actually we've got a i haven't got the figures 
there but we've got a fairly large margin in the period of days haven't if i 
could find the er 
sm5368: its seven to two point four
nm5361: so we only need two point four and we've got seven so we can stand some 
irregularity because the soil itself is a buffer er the water carrying capacity 
of the soil itself is a buffer but even so if it rains fairly heavily if that 
rainfall of seven millimitres was seventy millimetres a day a large part of 
which would run off because the soil can't accept sev-, seventy millimetres in 
less than about ten hours alright so if would be losing rain water in run off 
it comes down very intensely so first of all the amount of rain that we put 
into our calculation has gone down because we haven't been able to capture it 
all in percolation er and secondly if it really was that much rain only some of 
which we got followed by a long period without any more rain because we've used 
up ten days rain in one day so the seven millimetres a day we've had seventy 
millimetres that's equivalent to no more rain for nine days nine days maybe too 
long for the crop and it may wilt so even in the first period though in this 
case there is such a margin we only need two point four and we're getting seven 
[coughs] that i think we probably wouldn't have to worry about irrigation in 
the first period the second period we've got irrigation and any intensity of 
rain more intense than the soil can accept is going to mean that some of that 
rain is wasted and has therefore got to be replaced by extra irrigation at any 
rate so that the volume of irrigation water is going to increase due to the 
irregularity of the rain mm and in addition to that the actual timing er at the 
worst if you were going to irrigate in a airly regular cycle you know i can get 
the equipment on Monday i can give it to another farmer on Tuesday you then 
have to calculate your irrigation cycle on the assumption that it hasn't rained 
at all you know if you know that its quite often not going to rain at all for 
several days or so even though there's going be a enough water on average then 
you er have to calculate your irrigation cycle and your quantities or your 
quantities your standing by quantities on the basis that it han't rained okay 
so we'll leave answer one having said that and look at question four which is 
always a supply question er so we are comparing in this problem two different 
forms of water supply a form of question you might have noticed that i've used 
before right so we have er a site lets call it swamp where one can pr-, put 
shallow wells if you want why are shallow wells near a swamp
sf5366: because the water's 
nm5361: because if you like the landscape is doing that there is swamp and the 
water extends out here and so you put the shallow well le-, reaches down to the 
water whereas if you go up the hill it's got to be a deep well er well it isn't 
quite as simple as that because water there will be maybe some water gradient 
the aqua rises a bit but even so most shallow wells are close to standing water 
open water or we have way up here in the hills some springs I-E spring for 
which we could bring a pipe down to the village so those are the two options mm 
what's obvious i mean what are the obvious merits and demerits of the two 
options what's the obvious merit of the pipe system
sf5364: you can use gravity to get the water down so you don't need a pump
nm5361: so you don't need a pump to walk mm [coughs] and whether it brings it 
to the door or whether it brings it to the stand pipe somewhere near your door 
right its er its attractive because it brings it closer its more convenient so 
the spring water is more convenient mm and it may be cleaner although that 
depends upon the conditions around the stream itself and whether it's been 
adequately protected right what's the advantages of the wells
sf5365: its less less complicated
nm5361: they are less complicated at least they are probably within the 
capability of the community to build themselves so springs might be laid pipes 
might be [coughs] know what i mean er they are also probably not limited in the 
water they can supply or not very limited in the water they can supply whereas 
we know that the spring has has er its given in the question a given flow 
capacity right which if its inadequate or at certain times of a year in-, it is 
inadequate or in the future when the population has grown will be inadequate is 
is an argument if you like against the spring also the spring is all your eggs 
in one basket if you get it wrong er you've got no water at all the pipe breaks 
or something like that so the very general characteristic is 
sf5365: can you also say that about the fact that they're ten miles away
nm5361: yes taking taking resources away who owns that spring have you got 
access to it have you got access to all the land that lies between here and 
there er can you get to it for maintenance purposes and so on and this says 
that two-hundred metres is quite high we'll come to that in a moment one of the 
implications of it being so high now its conveniently high in the sense the 
higher the spring smaller the pipe to give premier serving quality quantity of 
water over irrigating distance by ten kilometres er but if you have a spring up 
there and you have a pipe and you have a flow valve or something at the bottom 
and close the bottom what pressure will you get in the pipe at the bottom when 
there's no flow
sm5369: so it's two-hundred metres 
nm5361: its two-hundred metres right twenty bars quite heavy stuff right er 
which you probably wouldn't want when its flowing you don't get that because 
much of the head is used up in overcoming the friction in the pipe in fact the 
flow adjusts itself the rate at which oh i've leant on something well i think 
i've leant on something and we're still in darkness ah answer one is stronger 
than three on the scale er okay er so we've got two rival options er i did find 
local conditions other than those already described which would especially 
favour one or other of the options mm er which will be the ground conditions 
the ground for the swamp and ease therefore for drilling or making shallow 
wells the hardness of the rock between here and there because you've got to dig 
all that up to put your pipe in into it the varied conditions that we were 
talking about about whether you know you've got easy or difficult political 
access to the spring and to the line between the spring and the houses and so 
on mm so i can think of a number of particular features we could help find the 
the spring s-, solution or help the the well solution the shallow well solution 
mm identifying local conditions but still note that question it says it does-, 
doesn't ask you whether one is overall better than the other it says what local 
conditions favor one or favor the other which is not quite the same question i 
say this because there's a great temptation in examination to splurge out the 
pros and cons of the alternatives which in fact comes later with that 
particular question is not about the relative merits of the two its about the 
conditions that particularly favor one or particularly favor the other okay i'm 
losing control of paper at a good rate the question asks in the case of 
pipeline based option to sketch it and label its key parts and very roughly 
estimate its size and the number of key components other than the pipe itself 
which of course is a separate calculation and there's something about the 
spring flow okay what components should we put in our diagram springs
sf5364: something to protect the springs do you need spring boxes 
nm5361: so we need some protection around the spring and almost certainly we'll 
need some sort of valve to control entry into the pipeline and probably we will 
require some provision for local use its unlikely that that spring isn't used 
by anybody living up here and therefore we've got to allow people access to the 
water in that spring who live near it as well as the people who live ten 
kilometres away [coughs] and then a little problem arises whoever is upstream 
always has priority has power over whoever is downstream we mean this in 
irrigation we mean this in water supply and therefore you try to put in an 
arrangement whereby those who are upstream can't commandeer all the water some 
sort of flow limitation like there's two pipes coming out of the spring box one 
which goes down the valley and the other which pours for local and it pours for 
local use at rate which you've agreed beforehand rather than local use equals 
take all the water you need whenever you need it and then cut off the pipeline 
mm this is also true when you get pipelines with intermediate users its quite 
tricky to have an arrangement with a intermediate user whereby the intermediate 
user is prevented from taking all the water they wanted to or just leaving it 
run for example so we've got various provisions up here er including access and 
then we have the pipeline itself and i've already mentioned a requirement on 
that pipeline or something implied its something about the pipeline it would be 
advisable namely
sm5369: you've got to put something on the pipeline to protect it from 
shockwaves
nm5361: yes i suppose so perhaps you don't put a valve on the bottom that can 
be closed too fast which would create shock waves over ten kilometres actually 
that's quite long isn't it [coughs] and the time taken for a shockwave to go up 
and back over twenty kilometres will be many seconds
sf5365: you need an air valve
nm5361: you need a what
sf5365: an air valve
nm5361: you need that yes right i said that if you simply bring a pipeline down 
here look you close the bottom of the pipeline slowly in order not to create 
water however maybe er you'll then get a high pressure here which unless you've 
bought and expensive pipe will burst the pipe so therefore you'll want to put 
in break pressure or break pressure tanks if you like you reduce the pressure 
to zero so you have a flow valve and a small tank right and the water squirms 
past the flow valve like in a toilet system and er expect that it's kept 
constant all the time right but only when you draw water out will more water 
come in so from that tank onwards the water pressure as it leaves that tank is 
atmospheric then it builds up as it goes downhill and if it builds up too much 
you put another one in so its advisable if you've got a a very high very large 
height difference as you have here to put in some break pressure tanks one or 
two 
sf5366: are we assuming that to protect the spring are we assuming that the 
spring like has some storage capacity 
nm5361: right let me come to storage alright now there's two places in this 
system where we can put storage these are that we can put storage here or 
storage up the top from the point of view of minimizing the pipe size where's 
the best place to put the storage er 
sm5368: the bottom
nm5361: er why do we want storage because we've got erratic flow or erratic 
consumption 
sm5368: top 
nm5361: so we'd like to have even consumption so we would like for minimizing 
the pipe to have a constant flow down that pipe even though there's a long 
constant demand here Richard argued for storage at the bottom [coughs] excuse 
me er now storage at the top has a use but we get round it by having storage at 
bottom anyway but what's the primary purpose of storage at the top
sf5363: 
nm5361: it will be to sort of pick up overnight water when nobody's drawing 
anything and the water can be accumulated and feeded down during the daytime 
but that means you're feeding it down at a higher rate during daytime which 
means a bigger pipe and more expense and you can achieve exactly the same end 
at the bottom so at bottom you could have storage because people are drawing 
water unevenly and you get information that during the peak hour they are 
drawing water six times as fast they are drawing six hours water in one hour or 
at least they're drawing a quarter of their day supply in one hour so during 
that one hour the flow rate out of the taps is six times the mean flow rate 
coming down the pipe if we're clever enough we keep flow rate down the pipe 
constant so we now need to provide five hours storage at the bottom if we're 
going to have that condition of steady flow in from the pipe and yet the flow 
out to the users is going to be six hours worth of water in one hour that's the 
figures in the question so we'd like five hour storage at the bottom er but 
we've then got a separate issue about overnight when nobody's drawing any water 
at all or maybe for eight hours they're not drawing any water at all er and if 
we could accumulate the flow of the spring during that time it would be 
beneficial particularly beneficial at times in the year when spring flow is low 
so if we've got a supply constraint at certain times of the year we really 
don't want to waste the water that will flow out of the spring during the night 
flow out and and overflow the spring box mm so we'd like to remove it from the 
spring box take it somewhere and we'd like to store it so we probably need 
about ten hours storage from the point of view of u-, using the spring all the 
spring water at times when the spring flow is rather low and we'd like about 
five hours storage from the point of view of balancing out the uneven demand 
during the daytime so we'll have to choose the larger figure now you can do 
your own calculations on them but still roughly in that order five hours and 
ten hours why else might you want to put storage in
sf5366: 
nm5361: sorry settling okay so you might want to store to settle stuff out 
where would you like to put that storage if you had it
sf5366: could you put it at the beginning so it stops all the rubbish going 
into the er 
nm5361: yes right so you don't really want the pipe sedimenting up or if you do 
the you've got to make some separate arrangement for flushing it through 
getting a large flow through the pipe at certain times to wash out the silt 
from accumulating er you can stop the silt from getting into the pipe because 
its settled out in the tanker at the top that will be attractive so may be 
depending on the spring it may be attractive to have some sort of sedimentation 
chamber up at the top [coughs] not much use at bottom another storage argument
su: the pipe could the pipe could er need maintaining
nm5361: the pipe could need maintaining so while its being maintained there's 
no water coming down mm in that case you want the buffer storage at the bottom 
the pipe's out of action when no water is coming down er it doesn't help you 
very much to have it all accumulating at the top of there because you've got no 
means of getting it down to the people who want to use it so you might perhaps 
choose twenty-four hour storage to give yourself twenty-four hours to repair 
things if they go wrong the farmer half way up shoves his hoe through the pipe 
so as far as the pipeline is concerned we've got the pipe itself we will need 
to bury it or or if you can't bury it the rock's too hard then you've got to 
make some other provision but that's not usually very satisfactory [coughs] 
we've got protection around the spring er we've got er some sort of control at 
the top end er we've got provision for local users at top end if there's a big 
descent and two-hundred meters is quite big we will want to put in break 
pressure tanks within the pipe and lastly we want to consider storage at the 
top end or the bottom end er at the least to minimize the cost of the pipe er 
or to er reduce queuing time for people at the bottom so they can have a nice 
flow rate rather than having to queue until enough water's come down the pipe 
right so you reduce queuing time by having storage at the bottom you reduce 
pipe size by having storage at the bottom you reduce sediment by having a 
storage sedimentation tank at the top er you would like to capture the night 
flow which you could do at the top but is easier to do at the bottom and you 
might want to put in a day's storage for maintenance purposes
sf5366: how did you get the give hours stored 
nm5361: five hours stored because it says that they use where's the question er 
twenty-five percent of their volume demand in one hour didn't it i can't 
remember the question now er 
sf5366: 
nm5361: twenty five percent of water consumption occurs between eight am eight 
am and am its there
sf5366: yeah
nm5361: alright so it's saying that if we've got an arrangement whereby water 
is coming down the pipe steadily hours we want to use it at six times that rate 
in one hour which means that by the start of that hour there should be five 
hours of water stored up somewhere to supplement the one hour that's going to 
come the one hours' worth that's going to come down in one hour mm well note 
well i think that we've gone through that really already on the what favors 
each of the two solutions favoring the shallow wells will be high well flows 
will be sharp queuing times er there's very low water consumption been given in 
this question which suggests that somewhere there's a very severe constraint 
upon water consumption in the community and the constraint is at the moment 
presumable the either the flow rate in the shallow wells or the time it takes 
to carry the water up from the shallow wells or the willingness you are to 
carry the water up in which any improvements to transport would be helpful the 
obvious [coughs] vulnerability of the village is to construct some wells 
themselves rather than bringing in outsiders and a high population growth rate 
because the spring its dry season capacity is pretty near the village demand at 
the moment so the large population growth rate will push it to the point which 
the spring cannot provide the village with all of its water in the drier season 
er you also need a site for a number of wells because you've got fifteen-
hundred people being fed from a single well there will be a tremendous queuing 
problem and then on the other side what would favor going for the pipeline 
solution well that its easy to construct the pipe fairly even slope along its 
length has various advantages er but this is business of permission and routes 
to directly approach that on the spring's water but its a bigger undertaking 
its less incremental the pipe is quite expensive and would certainly have to be 
bought from outside and maybe installed under some leadership from outside its 
not something you'd do very often you can incrementally dig another shallow 
well but er rolling a ten kilometre pipe is a is a major undertaking and 
therefore its rather unlikely that a community has done it before and therefore 
will have the skills in-house to do it without bringing people from outside 
[coughs] er now there is this problem that the spring is not very strong in the 
dry season er going for a spring solution will be more acceptable if you could 
reduce demands during the dry season or one way of reducing de-, demand is to 
take certain water uses and shift them away from the village to another source 
of water and laundry is the most obvious example and people in fact quite often 
do do laundry by going from a village to a pond or a lake or swamp something 
like that er or a river and doing the laundry there rather than carrying water 
to the house so if you can subtract laundry water from the demand you're 
probably going to cut it down by a third to a half in which case the spring is 
now capable of tolerating a considerable expansion in population okay well 
these are my lists and er whoever's markings this is quite open to other 
people's lists this isn't like these are the five right answers to come back to 
your question and there are no others and in fact usually marking is quite an 
interesting process a learning process for whoever's doing the marking well it 
must be interesting oh i'd never thought of that any questions on that question 
then very rapidly we'll look at the last one i mentioned number six er it 
starts off describe two methods by which you can maintain a high efficiency of 
a turbine er when the head and the mechanical load are varying the torque is 
varying [coughs] well the most obvious one is to vary the flow right so if you 
move lose the flow towards a more sensible figure you will get a higher 
efficiency right for any particular speed and head and so forth there will be a 
best efficiency point flow for that type of turbine so if you can move the flow 
towards that er then we'd improve our efficiency so flow controls on turbines 
which take different forms and it was suggested er illustrate your explanation 
by referring to an impulse type of turbine its rather easier to discuss impulse 
turbines than reaction turbines in an impulse turbine controlling the flow 
equals controlling nozzles and jets and so forth with spear valves or such like 
[coughs] whereas controlling flow in a reaction turbine is a question of moving 
lots of of er circumferential veins or changing the blade angle of a Kaplan 
type propeller turbine right er so one of the things we can do is to vary the 
flow another thing we can do is to get the turbine to run at a different speed 
by changing the gearing now er it doesn't say in the question that the a 
requirement for constant speed comes later on we can quickly explore whether 
such a machine which requires a constant speed compromises the maintenance of 
high efficiency over a range of heads and loads and the answer is if if you're 
free to let it run at the speed that er you can adjust the flow to get it to 
its best efficiency point that gives you degree of freedom that you haven't got 
if somebody says that it must run at fifteen-hundred R-P-M so generally 
speaking er if you insist on specifying the speed and the head er you can 
change the flow in order to halt it at that condition but you will no longer be 
at a best efficiency point er so a requirement for constant speed does 
compromise the maintenance of a high efficiency over a range of heads and loads 
now it goes on to then narr-, close in on small turbines or run of the river 
schemes first of all it says in a run of the river scheme why are the 
efficiency objectives not very important answer
sf5365: because its not mm
nm5361: now there's various ways of thinking about efficiency but one way of 
thinking about efficiency will be how much water have you used to get a certain 
output 
su: you're not 
nm5361: yes i mean you're not running down stored water which is costly or at 
least if you run it down now you haven't got it tomorrow in the case of the run 
of river scheme either the water's in the river or the flow's in the river or 
its not but if it is in the river if you don't push it through your turbine 
then it'll carry on on over the weir down the river [coughs] because we've got 
no storage in the sense we're not very interested in how much water we use and 
hence we're not very interested in efficiency which is going to be our means of 
calculating how much water we need to use how are the stations as the output 
electrical frequency micro-hydro normally kept constant well we discussed 
earlier methods of of speed control of controlling the flow such that you get 
the speed you want ie the constant speed you want but how else could you do it 
two other method and if we're not interested in the efficiency they're both 
inefficient methods how can we get the speed we want without modifying the flow
sm5369: constrict the change the path of the pipe
nm5361: mm tricky while you're running it lets imagine its overspeeding in 
other words the load is light people have turned off a lot of lights the 
electric load is small right
sf5365: do you have any way of converting it into heat 
nm5361: yes 
sm5368: change the gear meters or 
nm5361: okay but then you have got online variable speed gearing which is very 
expensive and not very efficient [coughs] well the two techniques one could 
commonly use on is to put some sort of break on maybe a water break on if it's 
over speeding and the second one is to increase the load artificially by having 
a dummy load which you add into the real load and that the electronic load 
controllers which consists of a dummy electrical load ie a set of electrical 
heaters sitting in the water connected through to an electronic circuit which 
is measuring the frequency of the heads and speed er every time the frequency 
goes down speed goes down it turns some of this dummy load off then every time 
the other way round it overspeeds er it turns extra dummy load on er quite a 
cheap arrangement very inefficient you're creating extra dummy load but then 
we're not interested in efficiency in this context 
su: don't they sometime plant in resevoirs
nm5361: er no is the simple answer to that one
su: they do 
nm5361: [coughs] why they don't is because you require another piece of 
equipment and secondly we are not worried about water in in in this run of the 
river situation alright where there is no storage there's no dam there's just a 
small diversion structure and then a contour canal power canal right so even in 
that particular context which is the usual context for micro-hydro because in 
micro-hydro you can't afford to build a dam and it's not economic in that 
context it doesn't then matter if you go for inefficiency er if there's a light 
load the river's still going to carry on flowing so whether you take more water 
from the river and then turn it into electricity and then throw away the 
electricity er or just let it go down the river makes no difference to the 
river but it makes a difference to you because by that technique you can slow 
it down you can get speed control er and then the issue of the flow exceedance 
curve which we've discussed a number of times and which we don't have time to 
go through now but you're fairly happy that from a flow exceedance curve you 
can see where er you might put a turbine's flow rating if you put the turbine's 
flow rating high then you'll get more power in the year but it will be for a 
smaller fraction of the year and if you put it very low you'll get a highly 
secure supply which is available all the year but only with a few watts so 
that's the trade off you're concerned with and you can do that trade off by 
looking at a a a flow exceedance curve but my watch has gone beep beep so its 
five o'clock and we're going to stop
