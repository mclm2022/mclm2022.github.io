sf5346: a container of highly toxic liquid has contaminated the marked area in 
front of you if the liquid is not transferred to a safe container within thirty 
minutes then it will explode and contaminate the population of an entire city 
sf5348: the lives of thousands of people are in your hands inside the area you 
will find two containers one unsafe container holds the toxi-, toxic liquid the 
other safe container is available for decontamination you must not enter the 
contaminated area or the space above it or you will be removed for 
hospitalisation you must find a way to safely transfer the toxic liquid from 
the unsafe container into the safe container using only the materials provided 
to you for your group this includes four short pieces of rope seven feet long 
one long rope and a bicycle inner tube 
sf5346: it is vital that nothing or nobody touches the tape or the ground 
within it at any time during the operation the safe container may be moved 
anywhere in or outside the taped area
sf5348: the unsafe container must stay inside the area and not be moved more 
than one foot from it's centre you may only use the equipment that you have 
been given you have thirty minutes to complete the task before the liquid 
explodes
sf5346: you may only use the equipment you have been given you have thirty 
minutes to complete the task
sf5350: what's the time
sf5359: just gone twenty past
sf5346: er twenty past
sm5356: right er what's the stuff we got out there
sf5348: get that 
sm5353: okay 
sm5354: anyone got an idea
sm5353: well let's go and see what we've got shall we that's a good idea
su: yeah have a look
sf5348: so basically it's got to go from that bucket to that bucket
nm5343: that you can't take the off that square so it's got to remain on this 
part
sf5348: okay
sm5353: so we've got a bicycle tyre
sm5354: that's going to be useful
sf5348: four short pieces of rope
sm5353: an uninflated bicycle tyre
sf5348: is that the blue one
sm5353: two pieces three pieces of rope here
sf5348: four four short ones and one one long one that's seven feet long which 
is quite long really
sf5344: mm well if we tied them to the er if it made a big cross and then we 
all held the end and like we walked over it and then somehow picked up the 
handle and er 
sm5354: cause you've got to try and get the handle of the bucket we need to 
move with the rope so the id-, how are we going to thread it from this range
sf5348: mm
sm5354: is somebody got half an hour genuinely er does somebody want to have a 
look how long we've got roughly
sf5348: it's twenty past now nearly so 
sm5353: i mean even if we thread the loop of the bucket how do we how do we pour
sm5354: if we had two people either side pulling it right just supporting it in 
the air then you could loop a rope around it from another side and if you pull 
that rope it will tilt
sf5348: and tip tip it yeah
sm5354: but i don't know much of it you'd be able to pour p-, pour before like 
the rope doesn't grip the bucket anymore and then some of it's still going to 
be in that container
sf5348: yeah yeah
sf5344: well if we blew up the bicycle tube and we threw that around it so it 
landed over it then when we're pouring it
sf5348: with the with the rope attached in case we get it wrong so we can pull 
it back again 
sm5354: but we won't be able to blow it up cause you can't blow them up in your 
mouth
sf5348: but that's sort of like a strap rather than a rope 
sf5347: yeah so maybe that's for the tilting thing
sm5354: that would be quite good because it's rubber as well so it would grip 
the bucket
sf5347: yeah
sm5353: yeah so if you we could get something to pick the bucket up this could 
tip it but we need to try and thread the loop 
sf5348: if we attach two two short pieces of rope to either side of that to to 
reach out
sm5354: yeah we have to get the long rope but it's getting the long rope 
through the bucket so that two people can hold the bucket while everyone else 
pours it that's going to be the hard bit plus we've got to move the little 
bucket a bit closer so we don't 
sm5353: if we if we can if we can lift the lid up lift the handle up it might 
stay up then you can try and throw a rope through it tie a knot in the end of 
the rope and throw it
sm5354: throw a rope through it but then not only have you got to throw the 
rope through it you've got to get it out the other side of the barrier as well
sm5353: yeah no i think that'd be if you could if you stand er the handle up 
and throw it from this side it would you'd probably be able to throw it over 
the other side if you had a couple of goes you could pull it back and it try 
again i'd try that
sm5354: yeah
sf5346: if you had say like three bits of rope around it like one there and one 
there they'd go under the lip and you could lift it up like that
sm5355: why've we got a huge piece of rope though
su: yeah
sm5356: or just one piece of rope that goes back er back
sf5346: yeah one yeah
sm5356: but we might drop it but we can bring it right to the edge can't we are 
can it not move off there
sm5355: we have
sf5346: no no that the middle one can't move off the squares but that other one 
can move as much as you want it to
su: why have we got an inner tube
su: no i don't know
sm5356: i thin-, it might just even be there to make us think that
sf5350: we could improvise that thing the er long rope
sf5360: yeah yeah that would fit the bucket wouldn't it
sm5355: no if you get it over the bucket and then pull it like that you can 
tighten it 
sm5356: yeah that's what we talking about with the rope yeah
sf5346: yeah yeah
sm5352: how far does it stretch
sf5346: using those ropes to pull it tight around the sides
su: the short ropes
sf5346: the short ropes yeah
sm5356: should we should we grab the other bucket
sm5355: no you
sf5346: we can practice on the other bucket yeah
sm5356: grab one i'll just grab it
su: hang on 
sf5360: you can't go inside
sm5356: i'll get it 
sf5350: you can't put you can't go anywhere over the top either
sm5355: you can't go inside
sf5360: and you can't touch the barrier
sf5346: no people can't go over the top
sm5354: if we use the long rope somebody stays here somebody walks round so 
it's round the bucket and then we can pull the handle up just by pulling the 
rope up
sm5353: yeah
su: so we have to throw it across underneath the barrier
sf5348: shall i put this sort of put that down there so
sm5354: and then yeah well that's true if you if you be careful cause if you 
want to go under a one of these you're not allowed to put your hands round it 
otherwise we won't be able to use you anymore in the team so
su: you have to throw it
sm5353: yeah
sf5348: okay how many people do we actually need to do to carry out 
sm5354: i'd imagine that we need all of us 
sf5348: could we sacrifice someone to to sort of
sm5354: run in and pour it you
sf5348: no just to thread it through and then if like the rest of us sort of
nm5343: i think you'd be dead before you got to the middle
sf5348: oh okay
sf5347: maybe if you leave that on the end of it when it's sort of it will be 
easier to throw under across
sm5354: oh yeah 'cause yeah but will that fit through the bucket handle
sf5347: you can take it off when it's over there
sm5353: how how are we picking up the the bucket handle
sm5354: if somebody ho-, holds this end of the rope here i'll take the other 
end round there and then we should be able to lift the handle up
sm5353: oh yeah okay
sm5354: that's the plan
su: oh i see yeah oh no we've lost the instructions we all know what we're 
doing right
sm5353: oh no
sf5348: if you if you come more this way so you're sort of in line with the yeah
sm5353: yeah squarer
sm5354: that's if we can get it in that gap that's the one okay
su: back a bit
sm5353: pull it a bit tighter yeah
sm5354: let's get the rope tight yeah
sm5353: there we go
sm5354: it's not going to stay if we hit it with the rope though
sm5353: no
sm5356: yeah if we put another rope on the end we can
sm5352: yeah if you just put another one here on the end
sf5346: yeah that one there and that'll like
su: that's a really good idea
su: is it pretty secure
sf5360: but it's going to be quite heavy as well cause it's got loads of water 
in it
sm5355: right cause of we if we do that it tips like that
su: yeah it's well secure actually i think
sf5346: is it pretty secure
sm5356: yeah especially of you've got another rope on each end
sf5360: it's not very er the water's quite low level so
sf5346: yeah if we had an-, another rope there that weren't being pulled they 
could control it and keep it flat
sm5356: actually i'm just thinking you've got to be careful you don't pull it 
out like that
sf5346: yeah they they'd have to
sm5352: we could probably put one here and then pull it round the other way 
underneath
sm5355: yeah but you'd have to get it over get it over the er bucket
sf5346: bucket yeah
sm5352: oh yeah
sm5355: yeah if you tie it tie it onto there
sf5350: if you tie one to here and tie one to there and then someone on this 
side that you know they go over tie one there and tie one there
sm5355: whoever's on this side has to pull it very very tight
sf5350: so if you pull that it's going to tip this way is it
su: yeah yeah it would yeah
su: okay
sm5356: should we try it
su: so should we tie these on there
sm5355: so if we we try manoeuvring the bucket first sort of in there
su: go on then
su: we have to sort of
sm5352: yeah but don't we need to tie another bit on
sm5355: no if we try manoeuvring the bucket first before we do something else
sm5352: oh right
sf5346: this is the difficult bit that's why we need another bit of rope so 
someone can pull it
sf5359: to pull that bit out
sf5346: yeah see if that makes
sm5355: i have no idea what the long bit of rope's for
su: no
sm5355: if you then pull that out
sf5346: pull that out
sm5355: then let go and we
su: pull it tight
sm5355: cause it goes up pretty quickly and then it moves around
sf5346: so if you can pull that side like that you can
sf5359: but you don't want to spill any
sm5356: or pull it the use the other rope yeah cause actually i think i know why
sm5352: yeah 
sm5355: yeah but if you have the other long rope on we have to get the other 
long rope underneath so you can sort of filter it
sm5356: shall we get the
sm5355: now if you get
sf5359: we could tie that rope on that yeah she's there's there's that we could 
tie it on there
sm5355: yeah if you tie that tie it to the other side and have one person 
holding that very lightly
sf5346: yeah the side one's held lightly just to keep it from flipping
sf5359: just to make sure it doesn't yeah
sm5355: so once so if we take it off again and try and get it over the top
sf5346: yeah
sm5355: so we need someone on that someone else
sf5346: should we move the bucket out a bit so we get like the full width
su: yeah 
sm5352: yeah spread out
su: okay
sm5355: we've got that that's now open so we get two of us to pull it tight
sf5346: pull it
su: let this go slack
sm5356: not that central
sm5355: now you have to tip it
sm5356: one of you pull
sf5360: can my person not pull down 
su: well i thought we should swap
sm5352: yeah i i throw this to you or whatever and then like you pull it
sm5356: yeah that's genius yeah
su: and then it goes 
sf5359: no but we can do no we can do that before before we er pull it over
sm5352: can you just pull your side now pull the one you've got now and then 
i'll pull it over
sm5355: no that m-, hang on
sm5356: or we just use the long rope and attach that 
sm5355: no no no no no that's not working so what you have to what we have to 
do if you're holding that side
sf5360: can one person not pull up and one person pull down 
su: you're holding that side
sm5352: you can use the long rope to get the other one underneath
su: yeah
sm5355: so if we but once we get it over the top then someone
sf5360: could you not push down can't we do it
sm5352: well yeah we could throw one over and use the long rope to get that 
like underneath
sm5355: if we throw if we throw it over we're going to run the risk of it 
getting trapped in the middle
sm5356: no it can it's always attached to the others though
sm5355: if we get get him walk-, if you can get you walking around 
sm5352: oh whatever John
sf5360: there must be a use for the long rope
sm5355: so if you yeah
su: i don't know
sm5355: unless of course unless of course you know you just have the
sf5346: somebody held the long rope and tied it on one of these sides yeah 
sm5355: if you go on that side then you can
sf5346: then there's enough room to walk around the outside to take the rope to 
the other side and then flip it
sf5350: yeah okay
sf5346: do you reckon that would work
sf5350: if you tie that long rope to the end of that 
sf5346: just one other side
sf5350: and what happens once we've put the the water in the in the safe one do 
you just leave it
su: that's it
su: yeah we're done
sf5350: okay
sm5355: tie it to that one cause we've got these two are er 
sm5353: is this short piece of rope going to go all the way across
sm5354: no 
sm5353: no
sm5354: i reckon that's got to be the short piece of rope's only seven feet 
long and that's got to be twelve
sm5353: if you can tie an end in that tie quite a think end sort of like a knot 
in that end so we should got something to throw it
sm5354: see if we can rescue our notes as well 
sm5353: fish them out
sf5348: if i just tie like a really big knot
sm5353: yeah just as big a clump of a knot as you can i don't do knots i was 
never in the Boy Scouts
sf5348: i'll suddenly learn just keep going like this until 
sf5347: so what are you going to do with that
sm5353: throw it through the loop of the bucket and then we can pick up the 
bucket
sf5348: you could start making the 
sm5354: actually 
sf5344: is that going to
sf5347: couldn't you throw that through the loop of the bucket
sm5353: i'd no it'd be i think it'd be too big because if you hit if you hit 
the thing it's going to knock it over
sf5348: and it'd it'd knock it over and each time you get it wrong
sm5353: but if we can tie the bicycle strap to one of there
sm5354: if if we need more long rope we can tie these one's together
sf5348: yeah tie two of those together and and tie the double length of those 
to the inner tube just to make the
sm5353: to this yeah
sf5344: i reckon we need four of those to make a big cross so that we can all 
hold an end wouldn't that be better than just two
su: oh
su: yeah and then you can lift it up
su: are they long enough to reach
sm5353: i don't i don't know if two are long enough together to to reach are 
they
sm5354: i don't know if you're going to be able to two of them probably is long 
enough they're seven foot each aren't they
sf5344: but then make one that way and then that way
sf5348: no this is the this is the seven foot one
sm5354: that's never seven foot these little uns are seven foot that's got to 
be seven metres
sf5348: oh is it seven metres
sm5353: yeah it doesn't say how long the long rope is just the short one's are 
seven feet and you've got a long one
sm5354: well we'll just a-, see if two is really no two isn't long enough to so 
you can't really make the cross
sm5353: two's not going to do it and we need two the bucket then two to be able 
to reach the bucket
sm5354: it's going to be getting it through the handle though
sm5353: yeah just 
sf5348: am i still sorry am i still meant to be doing this i was sort of like 
listening
sm5355: now we have to get the
su: we have to keep this 
sm5355: you have to go underneath if you go if you step o-, if you bring the 
rope round and you step over it so you come round
sf5360: you can't touch the floor though
su: it needs to
su: why does it have to go underneath
sf5350: why does it c-, cause
sm5355: so then you can pull it from underneath and tip it that way
su: yeah
sf5360: it might work you never know be optimistic about it
sm5356: yeah i think it will yeah cause it'll pull that rope round yeah
sm5352: yeah that'll work
sf5346: if you do that and then
sm5352: 
sm5356: how how's
sm5356: that's really stable actually
sf5359: yeah but you'll have to er it has to tip like right to get everything 
out so it has to tip that far
sf5346: tip all the way out
sm5352: if you could just loosen your rope a bit
su: yeah i let loosen my rope and it should be okay
sf5358: it might but it may fall out
sm5356: it might fall out but it doesn't matter that much really
sf5359: see if this will do it i think
sf5350: are you sure entire city here
su: that's really good actually
su: yeah
sf5350: wooo
su: let's practice it again
su: right okay
sm5356: have we got anything heavy we can put in it just to
sf5346: yeah to make it heavy
sm5352: put like a shoe in it or something
su: how are you going to lift the bucket up
sm5353: well if we can get through there
su: through the 
sm5353: it depends how heavy what's in in there is
sm5354: yeah well i mean it's what no more than half full
sf5348: what time is it it's we've got about twenty minutes left so
sm5353: if you can pull this tight enough it wi-, it will do this pick the 
bucket up dan-, hanging in the middle
sm5354: so we've got to like try something
sf5348: is that alright
sf5344: so yet that end has got to go out the other side
sm5353: it's got to go through there
sm5354: the weight of the rope is we're never going to able to throw it through 
there
su: we're never going to get it out the other side
sm5354: and out the other side
sf5348: 
sm5354: but having said that it's quite a big knot so if you got it through we 
could probably put it in like with like rubber tube or some sort of 
sm5353: yeah means it could work let's see rope this way we need the slack to 
get through there anybody got a good aim to throw through there
sm5354: i'll have a go if you want
sf5348: i'm impressed if you do it i really will
sm5353: if we were American and we played baseball we'd be much better at this
su: and what if that drops into the liquid
sm5353: er i don't know does that mean it's contaminated can we still touch it
nm5343: you've got all the information you needed on that bit of paper
su: i don't think you can touch it
sm5353: we've got to give it a go anyway
sm5354: yeah
sm5353: unless anybody else has got any ideas of getting that through
sm5354: does it actually say is it like if any of the so if we spill some 
outside the square do we fail
sm5353: yeah
sf5347: well it's toxic so i assume so cause 
sm5354: so therefore if this rope falls in there and then we drag it back out 
again we're going to have failed cause we'll have dragged some of it to 
somewhere on the square
sm5353: yeah okay you get you get points for trying if you've got an idea come 
on
sm5354: so so not only have i got to put it through there i've got to do it 
first time without it dropping in oh right anyone else want a go
sf5348: i don't it doesn't 
su: there must be an easier way of doing it though
su: i i think there's a there's
su: i think somehow we've got to lower something
sf5348: if we you know what who was saying about the four four points
su: yeah
sf5348: and sort of
su: these these four ropes
sm5353: but to get four points you need to do what we've done you need to do 
what we're going to do twice to get and somehow get it through the loop handle
sm5354: there's not going to be enough rope to do two points i don't think
sm5353: is there two short pieces
sm5354: and then still reach the bucket to do any kind of pouring cause we're 
allowed to move it outside that squarey bit
sf5348: no
sm5353: we've about quarter of an hour left as well
sf5344: difficulty is picking it up isn't it
sm5353: i think you could pick it up if you had a piece of rope through it
sf5348: do you have to pour it if you just put that bucket into that bucket
sm5353: no i think that's cheating
sf5348: but then that's to say it's it's all contained within a safe container
sm5354: that is the best idea i've heard yet you don't have to pour it do you
sf5348: because it's only like putting
sf5347: the safe container may not be moved anywhere in or outside the taped 
area the inside 
sf5344: toxic waste sort of in a safe 
sm5354: no no that would work
sf5344: it can't be moved out it can't be moved out of that blue square
sm5354: we can move the little bucket as much as we like
sf5344: oh so you're going to move the little bucket onto that blue
sm5354: yeah
sm5353: when it says you must you must find a way to simply transfer the toxic 
liquid from the unsafe container to the safe container does that mean
sm5354: yeah but then if like in reality if you had like a dodgy drum and you 
put it inside like a really well made drum it would be good enough wouldn't it 
because if the dodgy drum wasn't working the big drum would protect the people 
around it so that i reckon that in my opinion that's good enough
su: yeah
sm5354: and that's going to be so much easier to do if we try and pour it 
realistically we're going to spill some
sm5353: but we we've still got to try and get through the pick up the bucket
su: yeah
sm5354: yeah think about that right what we're going to have to do though
sf5347: could you sort of wrap the rope around it if you went round that
sf5348: sort of like a lasso kind of
sf5347: yeah if you sort of you know how if you like went round and sort of 
tied it like that in and if it was tight enough could you pick it up or
sf5348: yeah if someone held either side really taut and lifted that up
sm5354: underneath the bucket right 
sm5353: what
sm5354: right if if we throw it round like like she had it you put it right 
round the lip of the bucket and then two people stand opposite it and just pull 
really hard it would be strong enough under the lip to hold the bucket in the 
air
sf5348: like what you did before but with a loop round the bucket so you sort 
of went round in more than one loop tie it to lift it up
sm5353: yeah oh i see
sm5354: right and then if we tie three of these blue ones together for the 
other people they can use them to push that bucket into like the middle of it 
sf5348: the middle
sm5354: while we've got ours lifted up and then we'll just lower ours into it 
and then we'll be finished
sf5348: yes yes yes that sounds good
sm5354: okay we'll use the strong rope in case
sf5348: strong rope for the one the liquid yeah
sm5354: cause we don't really know how heavy that is
sf5348: should i go round one end then
sm5353: do you want me to tie that one onto those two cause 
sm5354: go round you have to like take it underneath these though if you just 
go like that then you'll be alright don't try not to get in there
sm5353: i don't know about these knots with the weight of these knots
sm5355: well see if can actually get the shoe out
su: yeah
su: oh
su: oh 
su: oh a bit more
su: bit more
su: yes
su: oh it's dodgy
sm5356: it'll be easier with the water i think
sf5346: yeah the shoe makes a sudden movement
sm5355: first we have to get this bucket back in
sf5346: yeah
sm5352: or we could have just left it like that
su: right don't touch the tape
sm5355: you have to go round
su: to walk around
sm5352: oh yeah
sf5350: and this has to be about a foot away does it from there
sf5346: er 
sf5350: cause that can't be more than a
su: that c-, can't move a foot away
su: yeah
sm5355: oh crap
su: you alright
su: hang on 
sm5355: we're going to if you put it down maybe we can move it later
su: ah okay
sf5360: it's got to be in front of the bucket though
su: put it over this side over this side
nm5342: John you are in quarantine you're well in well inside the area there 
you're 
sm5356: pass me the rope
sf5346: oh the hand oh right i see
nm5342: right that's you out
sm5356: put it down just there the other side because 
sf5360: that's the way
sf5359: yeah cause we're going to tip it that way aren't we so that it needs to 
go next to it there
sm5356: yeah so you want to 
sf5350: this is going to drop
sf5360: so can the rope 
sm5355: no hang on this isn't going to work
sm5356: sure it is
sf5346: how are we going to get 
sm5355: unfortunately i can't go any further closer in in order to put it down 
i have to go closer in
sm5356: have you not got can you not even hold it on the end like that
sf5360: we can move that buck-, thing a foot away
sm5355: i am holding it at the end
sm5356: if i can go back there 
sf5346: will it will it can we get it to reach the floor using these ropes
sm5352: can't you go underneath it
sf5346: because then you have to put your hand over
sm5352: oh yeah yeah
sm5356: i'd say it's about to fall off so we want to put it down
sf5350: it is yeah i think so
sm5355: if you drop it from now
sf5350: right there okay
sm5355: just low-, just
sf5359: don't let it touch the tape
sm5355: there we go
su: okay we can use the stretch
su: right this is
sm5355: can we
sf5360: we need to get cause we're not going to
sm5355: we need to get the bucket in closer
sf5360: yeah
sm5356: yeah er 
su: or the buck-, 
sf5346: we're going to have to use longer ropes now
sm5356: let go of your rope just let go
su: no i can't cause i can't let it touch the ground
sm5356: can't it can't it touch the ground
su: no
sm5356: oh that ruins my plan
sf5360: can we not move the mini-bucket this way slightly
su: can't move a foot
su: yeah
sf5360: how big's a foot
sf5346: we shouldn't move anything until we're sure mind because
sm5356: well we can can we get the
sf5346: we've got to got to make sure this device works first before we move 
anything
sm5356: if you take that rope round the other side
sf5360: this
sm5356: there's no need for it yeah no need for that rope there
sm5354: okay we're going to have to do another one of these with that other 
little red bucket just to move it into the middle
sf5347: yeah
sm5354: cause i don't reckon pulling it's probably going to fall over and then 
we're screwed
sf5347: no yeah
sf5344: it's got to go over that bucket
sf5348: oh i'm sorry
su: oh so do we need all of the blue one's tied together 
sm5354: that's all you can have now let's see if it's going to work
sf5348: oh no i could go round ag-, another couple of times with it
sm5354: why is it right at the bottom
sf5348: cause we've gone
sm5354: it's ever so not it's not very heavy
sf5348: i'll go and i'll try and get k-, keep that tight i'll go
sm5353: you need to 
sm5354: but we're going to need to have it near the top
sm5353: cause otherwise it's going to tip and it's just not going to work
sm5354: yeah
sf5348: how do we get the lip
sm5354: loosen it and then lift it er 
sm5353: un-, unloosen it come back a bit and then 
sm5354: no don't you still have to be round on that side but just loosen it as 
in don't pull tight and try and lift it 
sm5353: just start from the bottom
sm5354: yeah i know
sf5348: what go back round to the the right side
sm5353: yeah try and sort of flick it or something
sm5354: i'll try if i can my ropes underneath it so if i can keep my rope and 
go underneath and bring it back up we'll alright right 
sf5348: this is the one same position that we were just like er 
sm5354: yeah i know but oh okay we have to start again and keep it tight around 
the top from the start
sm5353: the top yeah yeah come back all the way round then
sf5348: okay okay
sm5354: anyway does somebody want to have a go with doing the little bucket then
su: yeah
sm5353: yeah
su: cause we haven't got masses of time
sm5354: if you tie using this at the end of one of yours it's easier to play 
around with 
sf5348: okay lift this up now
sm5354: okay
sf5348: and and you keep that really tight and i'll come round
sm5354: i'll keep it i'm not going to pull really hard cause we're going to 
pull it over but if you come round
sf5348: yeah
sm5354: we need a third person
sf5348: yeah someone get that
sm5353: to do what
sm5354: to just like be a thrower while everyone keeps it high
sf5348: can you sort of manage to rescue that
sf5348: okay you be the thrower and we'll we'll
sm5354: you'll need three of you to do it we'll wait until this one's sorted 
and two people can hold this one tight okay take get ready to take it i'll 
sf5348: sure there's a the obvious way of doing it but
sm5354: sorry
sf5348: no no generally how you
sm5354: oh right when we've finished and they go well what you can really do
sf5348: follow me
sm5353: the easy way to do it
sm5354: i should go round because my rope's above yours so it's less likely to 
fall down no i haven't got enough rope to do it okay
sm5353: what
sm5354: don't worry keep going
sf5348: yeah okay
sm5353: keep going
sm5356: so if you take this off and do the blue rope for the moment
sm5352: you could just tie the two blue ropes together i think
sf5350: so we're taking that blue rope
su: yeah
sf5360: we need to be doing er 
su: er 
su: is it going to work
sm5356: hopefully we'll just be able to walk around with the long rope
sm5355: so if we take the blue one off
su: i'm taking the blue one off and we're tying the the white one
su: tie the white bit on where the blue was oh right okay
sm5355: yeah tie the white one on we might have to tie two blue ropes together
sf5359: yeah and get a longer rope
su: but which side
su: will a triangle be able to pull tight
sm5355: if you make a tri-, if we we're doing it with a square if we make a 
triangle that'll be alright 
sm5356: er but we've got to fit across the thing we won't be able to do it in 
the corners cause we can hardly reach it as can hardly reach it as it is so
su: should we see if that makes a difference using the white one if it's any 
easier to use
sm5352: can't you use the little bit of blue rope no its not going to work
su: yeah we'll have to we can
sf5346: one of these bits is not too is too short we can use the other blue rope
su: yeah
su: okay
sf5360: i don't understand how we're going to be tipping oh move that right
sm5356: er we're going to move this first right 
sf5346: okay
sf5360: practice with the thingy one first
sf5350: right we're going to get this one closer
sf5359: let this come
su: oh 
sm5355: ah no we're going to have to tie two blue ropes together
sm5356: can you move forwards no it's alright
nm5342: Lucas you're in quarantine
sm5356: no i'm not
nm5342: out two minutes out
sm5355: tie that blue rope to that one
sm5352: it's like the danger zone here
su: why
nm5342: cause cause we're worried about being in danger of your life alright
sm5355: is that alright see if you can pick this bucket up now
sm5352: do you want to just open it out a bit 
su: yeah pull it pull it out
su: pull it your way 
su: okay tie in
su: right so where are going now we're going to have to get closer
sm5355: er put it next to that bucket so move it over here
su: oh
su: interesting
sm5355: hang on we if we just can take it outside again
sm5352: yeah you can just drag it out you want to put the thing round it
su: try and tie 
su: 
sm5352: do you want to just drag it
sm5356: just thinking about the tilting thing
su: hang on a minute
sm5352: i mean we're not going to be able to do you want to just drag it get it 
by the handle and pull it up like
su: yeah
su: can't let it touch the floor
sm5352: if we get the whole thing round it
su: wow okay we can move that bucket
su: right if we if we untie the middle two and then we put that inner tube in 
and then it could sort of go round that bucket and move it
su: yeah good idea
sm5354: yeah but how's that going to be any more efficient at not knocking it 
over than a bit of rope
su: because we could have the rope on this side and pull and it would pull it 
all along wouldn't it
sm5354: it would probably pull it over wouldn't it
su: put there try it put your
sf5348: hang on we can get that we can bring that bucket out can't we 
sm5353: yeah
sf5348: so if we right put the inner tube and and like lasso that bucket bring 
it out and tie thread the thread the handle through it
sm5354: and then take turns trying to throw to land it
sf5348: then we can lower it in 
sm5354: lower it in
sf5348: lower it if we bring it out thread the the rope through the handle
su: yeah
sm5354: yeah go for it get it out we've only five minutes just flick it just 
flick
su: put the
sm5353: just pull this way just
sf5348: get this bucket out are you sure we're allowed
su: yeah 
sf5348: yeah i'm sure where did the instructions go
sm5353: we're allowed to do that
sm5354: hang on wait
su: wait 
su: wHY
sm5354: okay cause it does it say you're allowed to move it anywhere within the 
area 
su: i'm sure it says in the blue zone
su: yeah within the area you're not allowed to take it out of the area
su: right
sf5348: the safe container may be moved anywhere in or outside the taped area
sm5353: yeah okay here we go
sm5354: oh right do do it once more so you don't get cause it's not worth losing
sm5353: i think it's outside anyway
su: are we allowed it out the area
sm5353: there we go
sm5354: right okay
sm5353: so what's this this crazy idea
sm5354: they're going to lower it in like this
su: lower it where we want it
sm5353: oh right okay i'll go with that 
sm5354: but our rope's slipped down to the bottom in all that rigmarole so now 
we don't stand
sm5353: rigmarole
sm5354: yeah that's like er 
sm5353: you've made that word up
su: oh damn it
su: no that's okay
su: right cause i've got this end
sm5354: yeah
su: oh yeah
sm5354: look there you go just have have have more of that before you throw it 
please
sf5348: no no if you lower it over the
sm5354: no you don't want to lower it over you they won't be able to get it low 
enough will they they'll just be dropping it in go round
sf5348: okay yeah
sm5354: okay
nm5343: mm mm
sm5354: see how serious
sm5353: that was allowed she was out
sm5354: right go on then let's see 
su: we can put that
sm5354: you need to lift yours up higher so that it slides down towards you 
that'll do
su: yeah yeah yeah
sm5353: oh look at that
su: ah
sm5354: that's brilliant
sm5353: now we've got to pick up the other one
sm5354: that's all we've got to do
su: right should i just pull this rope through yeah so let go your end
su: yeah
su: as long as it doesn't the er 
sm5354: can we get ours pulled up by turning it
sm5353: no it's not it's not going to corkscrew up is it it's just going to stay
sm5354: cause we're not going to get it round the now with that one there are we
su: we need to get the lid back down the er handle
su: oh yeah just get
su: how are we going to lift this bucket up
sf5348: go around again just with it higher cause we've got enough rope so
sm5354: okay then
sm5353: the handle do you want to get the handle down on the other one first
su: yeah
sm5353: i'll throw this through if i had more rope
su: no there's not enough rope to do that
su: is that ought to be over or underneath
su: just go round the side it'll probably be quicker
su: i don't know
sm5354: go literally over me i've made a gap between the buckets
su: is that
sm5354: so that should be alright somebody can you help her because we need to 
keep the rope taut
sf5348: yeah can you i'll if you can go round with it
sm5353: we'll get this we're going to need to walk round with it walk round and 
knock that kind of and stretch the rope across so were not knock the handle down
su: has that got to go round here as well
su: yeah
sm5353: right right right round that the whole way
su: i'll just get it at the last minute when it's starting to come out i don't 
sm5353: is that under their rope
sm5354: i'm keeping your rope high up
sf5348: sorry 
sf5344: he can pick it up again
sm5354: take your rope underneath it and you can get it back up
su: right
sm5355: okay now
su: right
su: now we have to get the strong er 
su: do you want to try and walk that round
su: okay if we
sf5360: can you not put it down 
sm5356: no i was thinking you just tie this here right there and
sm5355: if i come this way
su: oh yeah use the other side of the the rope
sm5356: then we've got this rope's so long
su: oh yeah
su: yeah
sm5356: okay i'm just pull it
su: woo
su: wow
su: yay
sm5355: alright now we have it ins-, now we have back in there
sf5346: so which side should we put it on like behind the bucket over say where 
you were
sm5355: yeah so then we tip it away from the
sf5346: we we're going to tip it that way so i'm to go by there
sm5355: so we're probably going to go round the circle
su: okay right
sm5355: and you two have to keep tight otherwise it's going to fall over again
su: yeah
su: i've got to keep
su: where are we putting it
su: this side of it
sf5346: well we can we can swap around whichever side you put it as long as 
it's like next to it square
su: oops
su: alright could you 
su: oh
nm5342: right you're in quarantine for two minutes mate
sf5359: is this out or in
su: the handle's out
nm5342: you've got to go to hospital
sm5352: that's the right attitude
su: oh are you can you get that up
sm5354: oh man
su: go round again
su: yeah
sm5354: oh if you just put them above them we can just walk round if you put it 
above why do we need it below th-, the tape people why do we need it below the 
tape cause i'm just walking round and it's really easy anyone else see the flaw 
if you just swing your thing round then you can walk round with it above it and 
we won't have to worry about that 
sm5353: pull pull this a bit tighter pull the rope tighter
sm5354: that's it right go swing your thing round and do it over right then we 
need the blue rope
sf5348: i see how to get it yeah
sm5354: to support this so it doesn't tilt over now well they haven't said that 
if we just lift it might pour it straight in there what do you reckon the 
chances are
su: yeah
sf5348: it's hardly going to fit in with all the er the rope wrapped round it 
is it
sm5354: the blue rope's got to go across to support it
sf5344: no it's not is it i think you should try pouring it
sf5348: we could try i think if we go round a couple more times and then try 
pouring it
sm5354: yeah but if we just pull like this do you reckon it's going to pour 
straight in
su: no no
sm5354: what do you reckon
sm5353: cause that bucket's the same height so if you tip it it's just going to 
pour down the side isn't it
su: especially if the handle maybe if the handle was er 
su: i don't think that's going to work
sm5354: it's going to fit mostly in the bucket maybe he'll just like give us 
the benefit of the doubt even with the rope round it
sm5353: if you if you can get the bottom of the bucket in it'll fall in anyway
sm5354: yeah
sm5353: so but you just need to pick it up
sm5354: okay then okay we need the blue rope going across that way so when we 
lift it doesn't tilt
su: okay
sm5352: has it gone
sm5355: put it around
su: other way
su: turn
sm5352: you've got to lower your side a bit
sm5355: okay we have to get this thing in
su: yeah
sm5355: before we do anything let's get this thing in okay where are we going 
to put it
su: okay Stuart
su: no sort of more that way so it's next to it like that
su: closer
sf5360: no shouldn't it be there cause you're going tip it that way aren't you 
being over there
sf5350: er John do you want to pull that side a bit more pu-, pull your si-, 
that's it
sf5346: which ever side is we're going to adjust it
su: yeah
su: right should we put it by there
sm5356: we put it we might have to do it under the barriers
su: which side
sf5360: i think it should there cause you're not going to tip that there aren't 
you
sf5350: Charles' side Charles' side yeah
sf5359: hang on if Charles there so we need it there
sm5355: yeah we're going to have we 
sf5359: so then we we put it that side of it near to Charles Charles' side
sm5355: yeah if we put it put it this of the bucket
sf5346: i can't this this side's not long enough to do it we'll have to put it 
there and then move around 
sm5352: yeah i 
su: oh yeah alright
sf5346: yeah no it won't go
sm5352: keep it in that corner just keep it in that corner
su: that's it so there
sf5359: yeah and then we can all sort of change ends
su: go round
sm5355: right you have to the bl-, you have to pull your one so it comes open
sm5352: and you've got to pull yours as well
su: there we go
su: that's it
su: wahey
sm5355: we're going to have to we're going to have to go round
su: we've got five minutes
su: yeah we'll have to be opposite where we are now
su: er 
su: i don't want to do this
su: no
sm5355: the whole start
sf5360: right
sm5356: okay
sm5355: someone has to hold that bit
nm5342: check you're back in yeah
su: you can't reach it can you
su: there's a bit of a problem here
su: this bit's longer it's longer by here
sf5359: oh i have responsibility
sf5346: this bit of rope's not long enough to move it over and then tip it
sf5346: yeah okay we'll tie it on this side
sf5350: how long we got left
sf5346: five minutes
sm5353: probably won't be long enough to do it then
sf5348: i was going to go round again
sf5347: it's not that long
sm5354: we need to be on opposite sides the blue rope's got to go across
sf5347: are you just going to go over the top with the blue though
sm5354: the blue rope no stay that side now we're alright oh it's going outside 
the area 
su: better
sm5354: right the blue rope has got to go from here to where Rebecca's standing 
so that when we need lift it it doesn't tilt that way do you see what i mean 
sf5348: so that the the meeting of the ropes is on the other side 
sm5354: it doesn't have to go round it it just has to like hold it tight
sf5348: because here look if we pull that it's just lifting up one side so we 
need your sort of knot in a way to be on the other side of the bucket
sm5354: we need just to support it like hold 
sm5353: okay so jus-, just straight across
sm5354: yeah i reckon it'll be alright
sm5353: yeah
sm5354: and we haven't got time to like
sm5353: so you like jus-, just
nm5342: two minutes
sm5354: two okay let's just go for it
sm5353: carry it straight round over the top bit
su: yeah 
su: are you doing it oh i see
sm5353: oh we need that underneath though don't we
su: they're not long enough
sm5354: just underneath the lip you'll get grip okay it's going to drop because 
our rope's gone underneath it now but let's try ready
sf5348: one two three
su: aahh
sm5354: okay so our rope's slipping
su: it's slipped 
su: as as ours is lifting up all the rope's going
sm5353: it's spinning it's coming out
sm5354: yeah but it's not all going to do that it's going to do it one more 
time so if you just go for lifting again and then it'll grip
sm5353: yeah
sm5354: yeah kind of come more towards me
su: okay
sm5355: so we going to really screw it to the bucket
sm5352: let it
su: i'm scared
su: i know it's like it's real
su: it is real
su: okay
sm5355: now we have to drop this down you have to get it over we're going to go 
go round middle bucket now get it over we're going to have to go this way
su: you have to go that way a little
sm5355: we have to to go that way you have to go out
su: okay
sm5355: we can get it down we have to get it down now
su: right 
sf5346: you have to let go of that that one a little bit
su: jus-, just let go like that yeah i mean basically
su: okay 
su: right is it under
sf5360: no it's not under
su: no no 
sm5355: down a down a little bit
su: that side needs to be
su: oh my god
su: take your hand out
su: oh no no
su: all this
su: be careful 
sf5360: where the white rope is it's not quite under
sm5352: yeah okay hold on just a little bit
sf5358: okay that's
su: ah its really heavy no it's going to tip that way
su: hold on
su: we have to get it right
sm5356: pull harder and you'll get it
su: try and pull harder on your side
su: there you go
su: okay
su: right
sf5346: oh that's so not great
su: oh
sf5346: move it over that way a bit left there there that's good
sm5352: and just pull tight
su: it's not tipping
sm5356: yeah that's not going to work 
sf5360: er yeah you need to go this way more if you can otherwise it's not 
going to
su: no go that way go
su: no no
sf5360: no that way
sm5355: no it does it has to go closer to the rope otherwise it's not going to 
tip you have to go closer to this white rope
sf5346: that that white rope's going to have to be moved
sm5355: so we're going to have drop this we're going to drop it down again
sf5346: yeah
sm5356: sorry i just i didn't think about that
su: right 
su: okay
sf5360: we've got a minute
su: double quick time
su: a minute
sm5356: do you want to do it
su: cross-over
sm5354: okay
sf5348: one two three
sm5353: we need this one tight
sm5354: no it's going to lift up completely
sm5353: we need this one underneath oh it 
sm5354: if you go more round
su: me
sm5354: yeah right look we'll lift get our rope out just put our rope like 
theirs and see what we can do
su: okay
su: don't pull 
sm5354: ours is right underneath it
sm5353: how did that happen the rope's got a mind of it's own
su: oh
sm5354: okay right get yours your rope that side of the bucket 
sm5353: that side of the bucket
sm5354: yeah and we'll just pull like this 
su: ah ah handle er why don't we this
su: why don't we go just we'll go on
su: do you want to let go of yours and put it through and do it again
sm5353: yeah
sm5354: okay right i'm 
su: 
sm5354: how much
sm5353: wow thirty seconds
su: thirty seconds
su: we can do it we can do it
sm5353: somebody run in come on
su: sacrifice someone
su: right 
su: right
sm5355: we have to get it so it's next to wh-, where the blue rope can actually 
hit it
sm5352: or do you want that under a bit
su: it's cause of the weight
su: no no no
sf5360: away now
sm5355: just try take the white rope and 
sm5352: just bring it down a bit lower
sm5355: now okay go back right right back over this side
sm5352: you have to tip it what what lift it up a bit higher
sf5360: can you move it that way otherwise it's not going to go in when you tip 
it no no no come back to the same shape and then go walk this way closer that's 
it sort of 
sf5346: it's too heavy oh oh no no no it's going to slip it's slipping it's 
slipping put it back down that side of it
su: put it on that side
sm5355: we have to get it so the white rope is right underneath it
sm5352: or loosen it a bit
sm5355: we're going to have to take the whole thing this way so you pull 
tighter on that side than this
sf5360: we've got about thirty seconds so just try and see what happens
sf5360: we might get some in there
su: get it so the rope's underneath it underneath the lip
sm5352: right really low go on
sf5346: no no no no
sf5346: that side pull your your side a bit Charles
sm5352: er is that alright
sm5354: right we need two people with each kind of rope on each side of the 
side square on opp-, diagonally opposite sides of the square the rope over the 
bucket realistically we're not going to do it people
su: i think Coventry's dead
sm5354: just try and flick the water in ready
TIM KELLY: we're all dead
su: oh
su: try again
sm5355: it's the rope's that are the problem
sm5352: right a bit lower on your side Laura
sf5346: yeah i i can't it's the white rope that's holding it up yeah
sm5352: i'll loosen the white rope
sm5352: yeah okay
su: no it's going to go
sm5355: it's not it's not just keep pulling very very tight oh there we go
su: very tight
sf5360: alright can i just tip see what happens
su: bang
su: maybe not
sm5352: well you tipped it
sm5355: ah it was a valiant effort
nm5343: can i have one volunteer please
sm5354: yeah
nm5343: grab the end of that inner-tube let me show something put it round there
sm5354: oh no it's going to pull tight round it
nm5343: just a suggestion
su: okay
sm5354: it's cause none of us have physicists you see
su: yeah
sm5354: they'd have done it in about twelve seconds and gone oh yeah that's 
really easy it was nearly in the bucket er bonus points
sf5348: hey the team work was good
sm5353: we worked well as a team but we've got a poor team
nm5343: let me re-read something to you da da da the safe container may be 
moved er you must transfer the toxic liquid from the unsafe container to the 
safe container 
sm5354: so ours wouldn't have worked
nm5343: wouldn't have been allowed i'm afraid
sf5348: ah
sm5354: ah
nm5343: it's alright when
sm5354: so how do you pour it then even with the inner-tube to pick it up
nm5343: th-, there are many different ways of doing it we did it all last week 
and we got our thing lifted up and thought we'll just dump this bucket in here 
and then somebody said there's no hang on hang and we had our bucket literally 
hanging suspended above it and we had to put it down again
sm5354: oh right
nm5343: it's very easy to make
sm5354: but then it cause you you then if you turn it does it actually pour
nm5343: yeah we just tipped it up
sm5354: with another a bit of rope
su: with the rope
sm5354: how long did you do it in
nm5343: oh we did it in nineteen minutes thirty seconds
sm5354: ah
su: we failed
sm5353: ah well
sm5354: well we tried and yeah
su: failed
su: yeah failed
nm5342: okay s
su: let's go in and flake
nm5342: let's go back inside and er 
su: my arm's killing me
nm5343: do want to er we need to do a bit of debriefing here do you want to do 
it here in the sun or do you want to go back into the 
sm5354: here's cool
sm5353: yeah changing rooms
nm5343: right okay let's go round we're not quite in a circle you all seem to 
be opposing me but anyway er reactions start with Matt Matt
sm5354: er well we didn't really work out a fundamental idea until quite late 
into the thing which is where we went wrong cause we would have come across the 
flaws earlier if we'd have known what we were going to do er so i reckon that 
we needed to talk about it for longer rather than just like ploughing on in 
there and wrap them ropes round
nm5343: okay
sf5348: and we didn't use the inner tube
nm5343: right
sf5348: yeah
nm5343: well there's chance just pull that back a second rather than actually 
think about what you actually did and what you didn't how do you feel 
sm5354: i no not yeah a bit upset that i didn't do it
nm5343: upset one word Rebecca
sf5348: disappointed
nm5343: disappointed
sf5348: yeah 
sf5347: er i don't know i don't know
sm5353: frustrated that it was so simple and we didn't do it 
su: yeah
sm5353: if we'd just thought about it we had too many little ideas without just 
we tried too many different ideas
su: yeah
sf5346: i don't think we did that one as well as the one before in like our 
planning and everything
nm5342: 
sf5359: i thought the plan went really quickly and i felt er well that i'd 
missed out totally and i'm like i'm like what we doing what's going so
nm5342: 
sf5358: er i think that we actually with the empty bucket too long
nm5342: mm mm
su: yeah
nm5342: okay that was kind of er yeah any others
sm5352: too much 
nm5343: so you all you all feel i mean you didn't actually succeed in the thing 
s-, so you do actually feel frustrated disappointed and so on annoyed with 
yourselves
su: er 
sm5354: well we didn't work badly as a team no so if if if we'd have actually 
gone this is how you do it i reckon we'd have got it done
su: no i thought it was it went quite well together if we'd had the right idea
sm5353: if we'd have figured it o-, if we'd have figured out we would've done 
it as team we would have the communication and team work to do it we just 
didn't get the idea
su: yeah the team work side was fine yeah sort of you know everyone had a bit 
of rope at one point and all that kind of
nm5343: so what the thing you did do well is the team work
sm5353: yeah it's a team building exercise
sm5354: it sounds really stupid cause we didn't complete the task but yeah we 
milled about for half an hour but we were working as a team
nm5342: okay how about general feelings about how the team was working well
sm5356: i don't think it was that well
nm5342: it didn't 
sm5356: no
sf5350: communication was this time
sm5356: i think it was just cause it was all going wrong that
sf5346: it was more of a complicated task to do as well cause like we had to 
try and make something out all all those bits
nm5342: it was more difficult
sm5356: i didn't actually i'm not even sure it was possible
sf5360: did the other teams do it do it
nm5342: i i don't know that's not important anyway i thought you i thought it 
was a very brave and elegant attempt yeah and you were really close it could've 
worked right it could've worked yeah yeah okay it was it was more difficult 
wasn't it so that's why you may be feeling a little bit more frustrated but er 
personally i don't think the team i thought that that watching you that the 
team plan planning and everything it was it was impressive to watch actually 
but anyway any any other feelings
sm5356: no i think we did do the whole modifying changing as we went along 
thing quite well
sf5350: yeah
sf5346: yeah
nm5342: i thought it was brilliant you were reviewing all the time that's 
what's going wrong an-, and changing the plan an-, and going absolutely you 
were really really good yeah that was really positive any any other particular 
positive aspects
nm5343: you were working as a team
su: yeah
nm5343: what would you improve 
sm5353: have better ideas
su: yeah
sf5348: the planning at the beginning like sort of 
sm5353: yeah i think that's the thing 
sf5348: we sort had an idea tried it out and then adapted it as we went along 
whereas we should maybe sort of spend a good five ten minutes really thinking 
would that actually work yeah
sm5353: thinking of something that would work instead of doing lots of 
different things yeah
sf5348: and then just getting on and doing it and trying it if it doesn't work 
right what should we do next try that er 
su: sort of rather than it mess up 
sf5348: well you you sort of wrap that round that way then that might work oh 
no that doesn't work but if you come under there that might work sort of as we 
go along
nm5342: okay what about there's no more of these today but there's going to be 
some some real life things what about what what you would do better next time
sf5360: you've just got to put everything together in this one we weren't as 
good at communicating but we were good at changing it so just kind of put it 
together
nm5342: yeah so how how to ensure that you have that communication's effective 
something maybe that was coming out i think someone said it was your comments 
Karen when you you talked about your er er first talked about delegating roles 
and er er ensuring every member is aware of the task and roles where would what 
would those comments relate to i w-, don't know whether it was you i just seem 
to remember someone saying oh that was Karen
sf5350: er i just think it's it's it may have been more efficient if if you 
have a leader somebody who says right you do this you do that someone who's 
delegated as a leader and is er 
sf5346: someone who can say all the ideas can be put to them and they can put 
them back out to the group again
nm5342: right okay so do you did leaders naturally emerge among this group has 
anyone anyone observed people who are naturally leading who take
su: Charles
su: Charles is quite a natural leader
sf5350: Charles this time i got more of a feeling of Charles being a natural 
leader
nm5342: er any any other people feel that they were taking charge any any one 
want to make any comments it's interesting to observe what you've allowed to do 
all the time is leaders and er co-ordinators perhaps to emerge but not 
explicitly delegate it you've so listen the the delegating role this could 
could be really important do you think it's always important
sf5346: i think it's important that everyone knows you know what it is that 
they have to do specifically
sf5359: i think and also i think it's important that everybody thinks that 
they're a valuable member cause if they don't if they don't have a role then 
they might think oh i'm not doing anything i may as well just not bother and
nm5342: right
sf5359: cause i think it's good to make sure everyone feels part of the team
nm5342: yes that's that's really true er John do you have any observations 
about leaders co-ordinators what was was going on there
sm5352: not really no not the best
nm5342: any comments Lucas comments on who was emerging as 
nm5342: anyone else cause i was sitting watching right so i get a different 
view and i don't think it was only Charles there were but it's not really my 
role to
nm5343: do you didn't notice any sort of people taking different roles in that 
team as you were going along or
sm5353: 
su: i thought er Hannah was quite quiet er 
sm5354: but helpful though she did know the stuff
sf5348: helpful yeah really helpful
sm5353: i think we all did something i mean we all it's not like all
sm5354: you're sort of a doing man you strike me as like you know 
sf5348: yeah
sm5354: you get in there and like let's do an idea kind of thing which is good
sm5353: it's it's my fault that we didn't think about it let's get the stuff 
and do something
sm5354: but i i 
sf5348: i mean we all had a role
sm5354: yeah
sf5348: er we were always none none of us were ever i mean i i've done stuff 
where you know you get people that sort of just stand there and and don't want 
to we all we all did something
sm5354: when i i've worked for like two years and we did team building then and 
i find that when i mean i noticed i was doing it then is i quite like you do 
this and then you do that and i don't really mean to be like that
sf5348: yeah
sm5354: so if i i see i'm doing it yeah
su: but it's better to have a leader sometimes isn't it
sm5354: but i did notice i was doing it
su: yeah we had a leader Matt
sm5354: thanks
sf5348: well if we're not happy with it we'll just tell you
sm5354: yes that's but that's what you need in a team isn't it cause if you 
just follow it blindly
sf5348: yeah i mean it would be worse if we were all like having different 
ideas and all arguing about it we all sort we all did agree
sm5354: yeah so at least we agree on an idea and try it and it doesn't work 
then you can go you know
sm5353: yeah if you're all doing your separate thing follow somebody's idea 
sf5348: yeah
sm5353: even if it's the wrong idea to a certain extent you need to give them a 
chance
sf5348: and i think we all we all had an in-, we all i didn't feel that i 
couldn't say what i thought er 
sm5354: no
sf5348: i don't know what any-, about anyone else it wasn't like we had to do 
what you said even though you were sort of leading in a way it wasn't too 
controlling
sm5354: yeah i thought Christine was quite good at like risking herself by 
rescuing the rope and things when they were they were almost in the area but 
yeah so you need a bit of a daredevil so anyway
nm5343: well the sort of the sort of roles that you people adopt in teams is 
something we'll come back to later and you'll find we will give you a 
questionnaire to fill in of your own for yourself you do it yourself privately 
look at it and it'll tell you what sort of person you probably are in a team
sm5354: yeah
nm5343: whether you know whether you are somebody who tries things or somebody 
who sits back and sort of looks at things ah maybe that's a better way or there 
are clearly well psychiatrists i guess they are psychologists educationalists 
have identified clear types of personalities the way people behave in teams 
you'll have a chance to find out how that relates to yourselves and it can be 
quite a shock to some people so it doesn't all of sudden you do this sort of 
questionnaire and all of a sudden you think this says that that i'm always 
taking the lead and i'm always very quiet and everybody's saying no you're not 
you're always
nm5342: er any other comments on on that i genuinely it was really really good 
to watch and it was a really elegant solution and i wish it had worked but it 
was great and your planning and review and everything was just was was 
exemplary very good very good indeed
sf5350: i think we were a lot more comfortable with each other this well i felt 
more comfortable with everybody this time
nm5342: yeah yeah that's good that's great
nm5343: okay er what we i mean there is anything else anyone wants before i 
move on is there anything else you want to say about that last exercise
su: can i ask what what you thought of it how you thought we worked
nm5343: how i thought you worked 
su: yeah
nm5343: ah okay i thought er i mean i've one of the reasons we do this is 
because you don't know each other and i it always strikes me is how five people 
like yourselves you just don't know each are very polite to each other and then 
and you you know i don't think any of you were biting your tongue and sort of 
thinking well this isn't going to work but didn't say it or not but i can 
assure you that five people who'd known each other they'd have been swearing no 
you can't bloody do it like that don't be stupid it's your stupid idea tensions 
er yeah tensions come to the fore very much more when people don't know each 
other so so whenever i do this sort of thing i am always struck by difference 
between i mean we did this ourselves last week and we the people who did it had 
known each other for in some cases ten years it was very fraught very well we 
did it but it was very very fraught
su: so we've got to be rude to each other no swearing
sf5347: oh yeah that's a good idea
nm5343: maybe maybe that's more about openly expressing 
sf5348: yeah
nm5343: being honest that really does require a good er you you need to be very 
good friends to be able to shout at them like some of the shouting that went on 
and not get offended by it
sm5354: yeah
nm5343: er so what did i think i think you did very well 
su: even though we failed
sm5353: we wiped out the West Midlands
nm5343: the West Midlands you did very well because you were looking i mean 
even even towards the even as we went along you were sort of saying but we're 
working well as a team you're already thinking that way as you're doing the 
thing rather than sort of just concentrating on moving the bucket you know the 
content of one bucket to the other bucket you were still you were already 
thinking about how about how you were working together and that's more 
important than actually getting the contents of a bucket
sf5360: i think it would be easier for him to tell us what he thought watching 
us
sf5360: yeah he doesn't seem to be wanting to tell us though ask him
su: i know what he'd say
nm5342: er we're going to have a sort of bringing the whole group together in 
about ten minutes er at that at that stage what we'd like to do is from each 
group is t-, to feedback three key points you've already you've already 
identified here er er a sort of plan er and what we'd like to do is for is for 
you to sort of er pull ou-, pull out th-, the three most important bits of that 
for your particular group now again would you rather do this in your separate 
fours or would you like to do it as an eight now to finish off the day 
separately together
sf5346: we may as well do it all together
su: yeah
nm5342: okay okay alright let's do this all together which is probably good 
because then you can look at the two the two that you put er which i think it's 
difficult for me to put side by side but er an-, and and maybe just talk 
together and pull out three of the things that that out of all the things 
you've identified this particular group be really important in the future ten 
minutes have a chat about these discuss what you think the most three important 
things are and then decide whose going to come and stand at the front of the 
group and present your conclusions in whatever manner you see fitting to to the 
whole group so you've got ten minutes to have a chat decide who's going to 
present and prepare your presentation in whatever form you fancy okay
nm5343: the first exercise this is the first second and third just put them up 
here er what went well 
su: team work
nm5343: team work
su: yeah communication
sm5354: nothing really 
su: we failed
nm5343: so team work went well 
sf5346: well we always keep going on about communication so i reckon that's one 
of them
su: yeah
sf5346: that's pretty important
sm5356: that's pretty vague
sf5359: planning
sf5346: it is vague yeah so we'll have to like get like a idea and a er 
sf5359: yeah planning is a good one
sf5350: it's just as important to be clear of what's to be done as well
su: yeah
sf5350: i think like you said earlier highlighting key issues and just
sf5360: and recapping it so we all know what we're doing sort of thing
sf5350: pardon
sf5360: er recapping type of thing so we all know
sf5350: yeah
sf5346: quite simple but yeah the reviewing and things
su: yeah
sf5360: planning communication and reviewing
sf5350: yeah
sf5346: planning communication and reviewing
sf5360: that's great isn't it
su: it's as simple as that
sm5356: is that what you're putting in just stand up and say that
sf5346: no we i suppose we can explain
su: got to explain
sf5346: let me just write them and decide what we're going to say about each 
one is it
nm5343: er what've we improved
su: planning
su: planning
nm5343: okay
nm5343: planning er and what would you say that the key learning points 
su: well we did the names so that 
su: er 
sm5354: we didn't use all the things so i reckon we can take from this that we 
do need to pretty much use everything or at least the key item which could be 
different 
su: yeah so
sm5353: yeah people cause people give i think they you're provided you need 
aren't you they they've done this before they would have seen if it was 
possible and they would have used those things to do it so using all of them's 
probably a good start
su: yeah making use of
sm5354: unless they might have but you've so in actual fact we didn't learn 
anything 
nm5343: so what did you learn
sf5348: er how to do it better next time
sf5344: i reckon if we did it again though we'd just do the same because we you 
know we didn't have an idea of we just didn't think about
sm5354: i think that we learned that we need to think about what we're going to 
do so we can find what the like you know what the flaws were in our plan before 
we start rather than getting half way through like wasting fifteen minutes 
cause our first plan it turned out that it just spills the liquid everywhere
sm5353: yeah so
nm5343: so 
sm5354: we learned that we need to plan better
nm5343: what you learnt is that er how do what's the best way your team work 
was good your planning needed improving so what you learnt was that well 
effectively you learnt those is that the best thing to say that you learnt
su: yeah
nm5343: you learnt those two things there that's you've
sm5354: that we c-, we can work well together if we have like the
su: have the right idea yeah
sm5354: yeah then we'd have got it sorted i reckon
su: yeah
nm5343: okay right
sm5354: fingers crossed anyway in no doubt we'll be back in here going ah well 
we should've really done this
sf5348: but we worked well
sm5354: by the end of it we'll be bickering and this is the way i'm doing it
nm5343: yeah 
sf5360: i think it's quite important to er delegate roles within the group
su: yeah
sf5360: and possib-, possibly a leader
sf5350: or a co-ordinator as somebody'd say
sf5360: er communication you need to make sure you listen to everyone's views 
and people speak up
su: yeah
sf5346: in the planning deciding the the obstacles and the key points is 
important as well 
su: yeah
sm5356: this is going to make a great video
sf5360: so what's the other one planning communicating and reviewing
sf5346: yeah
su: reviewing as well
su: where are we going wrong
sf5346: yeah it's important not to just to review at the end though but 
throughout the whole thing 
su: yeah
su: that's a good one
nm5342: we're about to find out from you er what you think about er your 
improving team team work er I so in a minute i'm just going to er c-, call you 
up and er er er get your three key l-, learning points and well i had loads of 
fun and watching you lot stumbling around with those blindfolds this morning 
was just er it was just brilliant and er er on that point er we we will i think 
get to see an edited version of the video at some time in the future but it's 
got to be properly edited and everything so it'll be a while but we'll let you 
know when we've got that back an-, and i'm sure that'll be er hot property er 
and er th-, there's been a lot of photos taken this morning by our chief 
photographer Andrew over there and er if he'll tell you just about how you can 
g-, you can get hold of them
sm5357: basically when you have to include the photographs and by this time 
tomorrow one person in each group will have in their pigeon hole a copy of all 
the photographs that have been taken okay and er all you have to do is pick one 
in your group and we will blow that up to A-four colour and get it back to your 
teams all the instructions 
nm5342: so yeah we'll hopefully those hot off the press by this time tomorrow 
okay so to finish off we've said enough this morning the most important 
comments are probably from you guys so er what's let's start with er group's 
well group one the fused group one and two my lot do you want to come and tell 
us about your er three key learning points
su: have you got a pen
nm5342: and you need a pen 
su: yeah
nm5342: er what an outrageous request
sf5346: er okay our three main points were planning communication and reviewing 
okay er within planning we thought the most important things to do were to 
delegate roles and make sure you had a leader or co-ordinators within your 
group to make sure that er everyone's point gets put across everyone can tell 
it to the leader and they can report back what they think also er you have to 
make sure you identify all the obstacles that could be possibly be put in your 
way and the key points of the instructions that are given to you and er under 
communication it's important to make sure that all those key points and 
obstacles worked out in the planning that everybody in the group understands 
them and er any plan that you put together based on those also that everybody 
within the group can put forward their ideas and communicate them to everyone 
else in the group so that everyone's aware of what's going on and reviewing er 
we decided it's not just what you do at the end it's like a constant process 
and you can keep changing your plan according to any problems that you meet 
that you didn't expect er that's our team work ideas
nm5342: well thankyou very much Laura okay who else excellent thank you very 
much has anyone got any comments or questions for group one and two great i 
think it was really clear that's why you don't have any questions and i agree 
with everything you said i think okay er group have we got a group two
su: yeah
nm5342: okay group two
sf5348: this is our learning spider that we've worked out and i'm going to talk 
about the planning which is the first thing we learnt we did the the exercise 
with bucket first and basically at the end of that we realised that our plan 
was rubbish because totally failed and we 
su: shhhh
sf5348: er and that was because we hadn't er thought of enough ideas to start 
with and thought oh let's try this let's try this and we went in and did it and 
then sort of adapted the plan as we went along without really thinking and we 
all decided at the end that we sh-, should have stopped and realised that this 
wasn't going to work but we didn't we tried to follow through with it so it 
didn't work
sm5354: yeah er in the second one we thought wow we've got ten minutes to plan 
so we tried to make a really good plan and then
su: it was a good plan
sm5354: but that fell down cause we got given numbers that we had no plan for 
er so we realised then that planning isn't just like you can't always get it 
right first time you have to have a bit of experience from situations to be 
able to plan for them properly so er we took from that that we would like we'd 
all have our own personal thoughts and then share them then you'd get other 
people's ideas rather than just one person's so your planning could be more er 
complete
sf5348: and then the third one we won so we 
su: that's all i'll say about that cause
sm5353: second point was er learning communication and we just sort of learning 
to er it's obviously pointless planning if you don't tell everybody else what 
you're planning so er communication's just basically that and understanding 
people from all round the country that you've never seen before with all the 
regional accents that you haven't got a clue what they're saying
sf5344: we learnt as we got to know each other as we got to know each other we 
worked better together
sf5347: if a plan's not working then say so
sm5353: don't be afraid to say that this plan's terrible
sf5347: that's why the first one kept on going wrong cause it just carried on 
doing something that was just completely wrong
sm5353: carried on with a terrible plan
sf5348: cause noone said this isn't going to work this is a rubbish idea let's 
start again
sf5347: by the end we we all polluted the whole UK
su: yeah
sm5353: wiped out the West Midlands
sf5348: yeah so that's our learning spider
nm5342: okay any questions or comments so different er sort of a-, approach to 
the thing but i think a lot er they were all co-, common themes weren't there 
that's great er okay group do we have a group three
su: yeah
nm5342: yeah we do excellent group three is it in there somewhere
nm5342: here's one i made earlier
sf5351: er er okay start with the okay er make sure everyone understands 
everyone completing the task so for er the first task we did the pipe 
sf5345: pipe line
sf5351: the pipe line where you couldn't go into the sea without islands er for 
that one we it er mainly assigned roles according to different traits so we had 
someone at the end who was tall so they could hold it up so the balls could 
roll down so the task changed er no the roles changed depending on the task so 
not everyone was always the leader so allocated to people on the task
su: er 
sf5345: er it's like our third task was the bucket with the water thing which 
didn't really work out but er we've learnt from that that if it isn't working 
then you know you shouldn't get all frustrated and agitated and get all 
aggressive and all that you should just er keep on going you know keep keep the 
enthusiasm going and try new things
sf5351: yeah don't be afraid to
sf5345: afraid to change your plan because oh no the first plan didn't work oh 
we can't change it you shouldn't do that you should just go with the flow and 
like maybe try something else
sf5351: and the third one is be aware of time cause on the first plan it didn't 
tell you the time that it until right at the end and we'd like already wasted 
like ten minutes of our time trying to read the sheet and it was like oh right 
so we've only got fifteen minutes to do it then so be aware of it but don't 
feel too pressured cause on the last one we didn't want to change it because it 
was like oh no the time's running out but maybe if we hadn't been so pressured 
by it we could've actually done it in time changed it and completed the task 
but we didn't and that's it
nm5342: brilliant so team four
sf5349: er our first point was fully understand the task and the rules er cause 
i think it saves time er it also saves you from breaking the rules which you 
know gets you disqualified and er and also it helps to get you involved in the 
task and so you know what you're doing and er particularly when you're doing 
the bucket and trying to pick the bucket and that you didn't know that you 
couldn't take it and put away from the centre or something like that and we had 
it managed to pick it up took it up and they said no stop and we finally read 
the rules so er also make a plan er so you can consider all possibilities er 
plan for the unexpected as well er with the blindfold one we didn't think well 
we probably should have done but we didn't think that everyone else would clap 
and so when you got taken away everyone else was clapping and we didn't have 
any idea where to go er you've also got to be flexible as well with your plan 
cause you don't know what's going to happen and also time management's quite 
important so you can work to the deadline and that's it
nm5342: thank you right any any questions or comments on any of those well time 
for me to step back finished in time for lunch er quickly er only final comment 
i can make is if all of you take the points you just mentioned and really do 
transfer them into the next challenge the next experience that comes along your 
way in a group
