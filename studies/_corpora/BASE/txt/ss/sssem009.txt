nm5477: we're gonna seek to sort of integrate well pull all together the module 
basically and also to make evidence of all modules that you've been involved 
with in essence what we are gonna do as part of a production simulation 
exercise which is base-, which is software based and based on computers next 
door which when w-, when it comes to making decisions about how we are gonna 
run a business we go next door and use the simulation package but in essence 
what we've really got the tools that you've now become con-, conversant with 
and for the rest of these seminar sessions you'll be using er in isolation 
we're gonna seek to use them all together with the end aim of running a 
business profitably running a manufacturing business as effectively and as 
profitably as we both ca-, as we all can do as we men-, as Morag mentioned 
earlier what we are really striving to do is satisfy the four requirements 
right product right place right time right cost and the tools that we're gonna 
utilise or we hope to utilise in order to satisfy those four aims and 
objectives are in are ensconced in the production simulation exercise we are 
gonna make decisions regarding capacity what capacity we have and how we use it 
we are gonna make decisions about inventory and in inventory with the things 
like raw materials sub-assemblies work in progress and finished goods and are 
we gonna be making decisions with your inventory levels your inventory strategy 
and how you utilise that inventory and also your delivery performance are you 
going to satisfy customers all of the time or are you gonna fall victim to the 
cost trade off and only satisfy the more profitable end of our business so w-, 
we are really gonna be looking at using those three tools to satisfy the four 
primary objectives that we talked about in the class okay the simulation 
background we are gonna be making or you are gonna be making in syndicates of i 
guess of four we're gonna be making aerials locomotive aerials okay and 
basically there's the simulation background working in groups of four 
syndicates of four the you're gonna be running a business it's gonna be your 
company and you run it as you see fit okay the decisions you make will be your 
decisions rightly or wrongly the consequences of those decisions the 
effectiveness of those decisions the results of those decisions will be your 
business's okay now really in each trading period for this manufacturing 
business you're gonna be concerned with making four key decisions the 
quantities to manufacture the volumes to produce in terms of inventory and raw 
materials what you're gonna buy and when you're gonna buy it your resource 
allocation how many people you're going to utilise how many shifts you're going 
to utilise what percentage of the factory you're gonna utilise really your all 
your four key resources how you're going to allocate them and where you're 
going to allocate them and the costs involved with doing that and also at later 
levels when we start to trade to trade prof-, profitably you're gonna have the 
opportunity to do some money management to invest in to shift money around 
various accounts all this based on software next door the game will be split 
into two levels or the simulation will be split in two levels the first level 
is really to lead you into the game so the decisions you make are not too 
catastrophic the decisions you make don't have a major major impact on your 
later effectiveness to run the business we appreciate you're gonna be learning 
as you're going through the game however later levels increase we're gonna play 
two levels the first level what you sa-, your decisions what you say you're 
gonna make you actually make what you say you're gonna purchase you actually 
receive quite obviously in the real world that is not always the case if you 
schedule to manufacture one hundred things happen you have scrap rates reject 
rates test requirements so you have to allow for that sort of an occurrence in 
your inventory planning in your production planning some later levels increase 
some general information general information about the business and i guess 
you've all got the er within the manual you've got or if not we can give you a 
a broad outline of the various costs et cetera associated with running this 
business there is some general some general business information you have you 
have procured each syndicate has purchased a business okay that business cost 
you three-hundred-eighteen-thousand pounds for the company so you've spent 
three-hundred-eighteen-thousand pounds to gain this business and in this 
business you've got the good will the hardware the software the plant the 
machinery the lease hold et cetera et cetera you've arranged and agreed an 
overdraft of five-hundred-thousand pounds with with a lender typically a bank 
quite obviously do not exceed that overdraft except with the permission of 
myself or Kostas okay I will tell you now if you need to exceed that overdraft 
you're not running your business well okay the software will actually tell you 
if you are going overdrawn it will flash red lights at you and tell you that 
things are not as they should be each of the four syndicates are not directly 
competing with each other so for argu-, arguments sake if we have syndicates 
one two three and four the actions of syndicate four do not impact on the 
actions or the results of syndicate one vice versa they're not linked however 
that is not to say that we cannot compare and contrast the various results of 
each syndicate in actual fact we do that so we will compare the the 
effectiveness and efficiency and if you like the skill of how you run run you-, 
this business okay but the results are not linked at all okay so you're not 
directly competing with each other but we can but we can compare contrast and 
the results of each group each syndicate each company any orders that you miss 
so for argument's sake if you've failed to satisfy a given customer those 
orders are gone forever they are not carried over to subsequent weeks following 
weeks more than that quite obviously if you miss an order to a customer the 
cost to you is not simply the cost of that missed order so if you've miss an 
order for one-hundred-thousand pounds for argument's sake the actual cost is 
not the hundred-thousand that you've missed because there's obviously an add-on 
and bolt-on opportunity cost of the chances of that customer every calling back 
to you so in the simulation we actually penalise you for missing an order so 
every time you miss an order you will see penalty costs occur those penalty 
costs are twelve percent of the value of the order okay so if you miss an order 
for one-hundred-thousand pounds you will be penalised twelve-thousand pounds 
and that cr-, and that money will be taken from your account your trading 
accounts okay credit on a single transfer is instantaneous basically when you 
decide to buy something or pay somebody or sell something that transfer is 
instantaneous as soon as you say yes, i'm gonna purchase it or yes i'm gonna 
sell it tran-, the transfer is instantaneous material you procure and agree to 
buy arrives on a Monday morning so it can be used in that week's manufacturing 
so if you if you buy a previous week to arrive in the coming week you can use 
it as soon as it arrives it arrives on a Monday and you can use it as of Monday 
we're not getting involved with things like goods on goods inspection 
acclimatization or anything like that what you produce that week during that 
week that week is available for collection for your customers on the Saturday 
so what you produce that week can be sold that week okay what we are gonna get 
you to do at the end of the end of th-, the module the end of on Friday 
afternoon Friday morning stroke afternoon we're going to get you to give a 
presentation the aims and objectives of that presentation is to give you the 
opportunity to reflect on what you did well what you did badly what you've 
learnt from the exercise and really if you were to run the exercise again what 
would you do differently because in essence that's what learning is all about 
isn't it so we give a presentation at the end what i want you to do in the 
short term Kostas is gonna pass around some financial details about the 
business we ultimately will ask you fill in a decision sheet okay and that 
decision sheet will contain the following information we are gonna ask you to 
break into syndicates and call you-, and give yourselves a company name as all 
companies need to do in order to pr-, protect your financial dealings you need 
a password i'll as-, i'll ask one if i only ask one thing of you the one thing 
i will ask is don't forget your password make it a password every member of the 
group can remember because if we cannot get in we cannot retrieve the 
information so you need to have a password the team can remember don't forget 
it the financial transactions don't worry too much about those in the early 
days you haven't got any money to transfer around you've borrowed money you 
have a negative overdraft you-, you've got no money to sort of transfer across 
so tha-, that first part is not an issue to you the first two or three weeks 
the orders you're gonna place the aerial consists of three constituent parts 
the aerial assembly the finished product consists of three constituent parts it 
consists of a main body a central aerial and accessories nuts and bolts and 
washers et cetera you need to place orders for those you need to de-, describe 
also to decide what you're gonna produce and when you're gonna produce it days 
you can produce five-thousand maximum on days so you can assemble five-thousand 
so if you have five-thousand accessories in stock five-thousand aerials and 
five-thousand main bodies you legitimately can manufacture five-thousand on 
days if you want to produce extra or alternatively you wanna work nights only 
you can manu-, manufacture three five-hundred maximum capacity on nights is 
three five-hundred evenings we have a capacity of two-hundred-fifty per evening 
shift and you can work five evening shifts so you can produce a maximum of a 
thousand two fifty on an evening shift Saturday morning shifts we have a 
capacity of six-hundred okay when you bought the business you not only bought 
the good will of the business you actually bought some stock you actually 
bought some inventory so in stock you have already from starting in week one 
eleven-thousand units of main bodies thirteen-thousand units of aerials and 
twelve-thousand units of accessories finished stock you have four-thousand 
units so that's the working stock you've got so quite obviously if the demand 
of the first week of your trading is below four-thousand you can satisfy it 
with your stock no penalties if the demand for the first week of trading 
happens to be four-thousand-one units you will suffer the penalty of one unit 
'cause you haven't got it you haven't manufactured anything what we are gonna 
do in the short term folks Kostas and i wi-, will between the four groups 
Kostas and i will be floating around asking answering any questions you may 
have and i'm sure you'll have one or two questions about the various costs and 
trade-offs et cetera the first thing i'm gonna ask you to do within the next 
twenty minutes is i'm gonna split you into your teams i want you to select the 
team name okay the trading name as i'm fully aware that you tend to sit by your 
friends and colleagues and like-minded people i'm gonna try and get to to sort 
of break the ice a little bit as it's the second session of the day so i'm 
gonna split the teams for you i'm gonna i'll do that quite randomly i'm gonna 
na-, label you off into teams one to four team one can go to that bench there, 
team two to that bench team three to that bench and team four to this bench so 
if you go around the room team one team two team three team four team one team 
two team three team four you team one two three Alex team four team one team 
two team three team four okay can i invite you to get into your various 
syndicates then folks decide what your team's name is gonna be when you've 
decided on your team name have a bri-, have a brief discussion about your 
objectives aims and strategy okay er and set yourself a target for team name 
within ten minutes so you have ten minutes to decide on your team name and then 
a further tenor fifteen minutes at most to discuss your general strategy okay 
can i just have your attention for two minutes guys what i'm asking what i'm 
asking you to des-, er to decide your your organisation er your business 
objectives and strategy do you all understand the difference between the 
strategy and objectives
su: yeah i do put very very simply the strategy is the strategy is what you 
want to achieve what you want to do or the objective is what you want to do 
what you want to achieve the strategy is how you're gonna do it okay and also 
what measures up what you'll use to monitor your performance how are you gonna 
measure yourselves against what you want to do how are you gonna measure 
yourselves against your strategy are you doing it are y-, are you achieving or 
are you likely to achieve your aims and objectives how are you gonna measure it 
okay so if you are for argum-, just as a just as an example if your aim if your 
aim your objectives er or your strategy whatever is to satisfy customers one-
hundred percent of the time all of the time how are you gonna measure your 
performance against that well quite obviously the number of overdue orders is a 
good measure in this instance penalty costs would be a good measure okay if 
your aim objectives or strategy is to minimise costs of the product quite 
obviously monitoring the unit cost on a week by week basis is a good measure of 
that performance okay so can you all come up with at least one but preferably 
two aims and objectives and a strategy that you're gonna utilise to achieve 
those aims and objectives okay in the next ten minutes okay guys the four 
company names the four companies in competition this week are Air Dynamic 
Incorporated very very innovative a name [laughter] What You Ask Is What You 
Get Arial tech and Sagapo and i take that Sagapo means something in Greece 
Kostas
su: yes
nm5478: yes [laughter] nothing better 
nm5477: nothing 
ss: [laughter] 
nm5477: okay what we're gonna ask you for now within the next five to ten 
minutes say what your strategy is what your objectives are and how you're gonna 
measure those objectives okay we will help you along the way to decide if you 
have any problems 
sm5479: what is our mission 
su: actually er 
su: yeah that's a good decision 
su: how 
su: how 
su: how can get the efficiency tests on 
su: 
su: er 
su: it's common sense i m-, i mean 
su: we're gonna see this 
su: strat-, 
su: so it's something er 
nm5477: are you looking to con-, control you're your uti-, res-, your your 
resource utilisation 
su: yeah, yeah 
nm5477: the software will tell you the unit cost of your products which is 
indicative of the u-, your resource utilisation if the unit cost is sixty 
seventy eighty pounds the full resources haven't been as used well as if your 
unit cost is below forty the product sells for forty-five pounds obviously 
you're looking at a unit cost of ideally below forty so utilisation resource 
utilisation may be bet-, a a good measure may be unit cost average unit cost 
sale 
su: unit average unit cost or unit unit unit 
su: unit cost 
su: these subjects because i don't understand it 
su: 
su: i find it rather complex 
su: the cost 
su: look at the cost of the 
sm5479: increase market share to increase market share what are we going to do 
sm5479: customer satisfaction 
su: increase the market share 
su: to to to increase don't don't don't 
su: we are going to increase er we are going to increase er 
su: not that long now 
su: because it was a 
su: so by customer satisfaction 
su: delivering performance 
su: delivering performance 
su: i mean delivering how we are going to measure delivery performance er 
su: delivery performance 
sf5488: mm 
sm5479: see i get hundred orders and they are gonna be seven-, seventy orders 
have been fulfilled 
su: 
su: er delivery performance is seventy 
su: we get we get order of course we are going to win at least 
one-hundred 
sm5479: What we call so the lead performance takes care of the time and time 
and the quality also time and quality of the materials er 
sm5481: so you're penalised so if you don't deliver you're penalised if you 
don't if you don't deliver on time that's a lot a lot harder so how do you 
measure 
su: which are delivered from 
sm5480: one is the lead performance and the other one is the cost of the cost 
for miss-, missed orders 
su: 
sf5488: i i don't think that's a measure because i think that its our 
responsibility we have to we have to deliver on time we have to del but 
su: that's not i mean that's not something we can measure because we have to do 
it 
sm5479: no you're we have to 
sm5479: you're doing it but something that should w-, you should monitor see 
you're doing some work there should be some some kind of monitor which says yes 
you're going on the right path 
su: we can keep on producing this when something if a customer is satisfied 
they want to place more orders a market to er yeah ok yeah yes so er for the 
second er 
sm5482: quarterly 
sm5483: maximise manpower 
sf5489: resources 
su: mm 
su: resources 
sm5479: all resources is manpower really 
su: yeah everything 
su: about resources 
nm5477: do you have your aims objectives and strategy ready 
ss: yeah 
nm5477: super we're all set Kostas 
nm5478: if you are if your are going to to share with us your strategy 
objectives and the measurements of success starting with with who's this 
ss: Aerial Tech 
nm5478: is this any old thing 
ss: 
nm5478: we have two Aerial one is Inc and the other is Tech that's okay so 
starting from er your objectives what you what your what your targets on this 
game 
sm5479: increase customer satisfaction 
su: capacity 
nm5478: customer satisfaction 
su: 
nm5478: yes 
su: minimise er minimise production cost 
nm5478: er 
su: minimise production cost 
nm5478: minimise production cost
sm5480: okay how are we gonna achieve this 
sm5482: the first one is to increase customer satisfaction profitably. 
sf5489: in the first objective 
nm5478: the first objective is increase satisfaction profitably 
ss: yeah 
nm5478: pro-, alright so how do you achieve this through objectives 
sm5482: The strategy we're going to follow is maximum delivery 
nm5478: delivery yeah 
sm5482: second er strategy provide quality goods 
nm5478: 
su: provide quality goods 
nm5477: provide quality goods yeah 
nm5478: quality goods yeah 
sm5482: easily delivery date 
nm5478: delivery 
su: date
nm5478: delivery date okay 
su: we should we should er offer a refunding orders guarantee in case 
nm5478: complaints too guarantee complaints too okay er this er you may as well 
er 
nm5477: the unit costs are measured there 
nm5478: okay 
sm5482: and er increase in sales performance with demand or 
nm5478: sales performance 
nm5477: how do you quantify how are you going to quantify making a penalty cost 
you need to quantify sales performance sales performance is a subjective thing 
isn't it so how are you gonna quantify it
sm5482: the perspective of the also 
nm5478: okay so you took the monitoring or measuring and maybe penalty costs or 
overdue orders 
su: yeah could be 
su: yeah 
nm5477: or missed orders 
sm5482: alright 
nm5478: other 
ss: 
nm5478: you haven't finished sorry 
su: 
sm5482: strategies each strategy is going to er 
nm5478: that's okay it's alright 
nm5477: that's fine we are just going to put some points here so on the way 
that you play the game or the method of the game 
su: okay 
nm5478: on on on the book on the e play the game on the mid of the e of the 
game we're gonna see if you change any of these okay you are just gonna have an 
indication of what was the beginning and what it takes er okay
nm5477: you see it's it's there will inevitably be a conflict of interests in 
it's it's very very difficult almost impossible to have two objectives or two 
strategies that you say we are going to satisfy customers one-hundred percent 
of the time all of the time but we are not going to carry an inventory they are 
not compatible you know yeah so we sh-, all we want all we want to do is to 
enable you guys to reflect back in a couple of days' time and say put it in 
perspective and say okay our initial aims and objectives were probably a bit 
ambitious or we were overlooking and we didn't go back two days in hindsight 
and if you like contextualise it or put it in context that's useful to you okay
nm5478: so er second team 
sm5479: yeah our objective is to increase profitably 
nm5478: alright
su: and the second objective is to increase market share understanding is that 
what we are going to borrow is effective inventory management second objective 
is to effective utilisation of resources
nm5478: er management of resources 
sm5479: yeah 
su: 
nm5478: okay 
sm5479: the third objective is we are
su: customer satisfaction sorry start again is customer satisfaction 
sf5488: 
nm5478: okay 
sm5479: and our missions of performance is monitoring inventory and ratio 
nm5478: inventory 
su: and ratio 
nm5478: okay you you gonna receive only a chance er in the course of of 
inventory every week that you're gonna have so you can measure this in money
nm5477: the software will tell you the cost of your inventory so you can 
monitor that 
su: and we are monitoring er average unit cost 
nm5478: okay again the software eve-, even if you don't calculate it the s-, 
the computer gonna tell you
sm5479: okay the third a mission of performance delivery performance by measure 
of delivery performance if the use-, if we are not meeting the quality at the 
correct time we are going to be penalised so er that will be the punishment 
nm5478: alright let's say that er you want to measure this in units of not 
delivering goods or in money
sf5488: money 
sm5480: in person days
nm5478: sorry
sm5481: in person days
nm5478: okay right let's go to er why
sm5484: the first objective is to be a profitable company 
nm5478: yes 
sm5484: second objective is satisfy customer needs 
nm5478: hmm yeah 
sm5484: yeah sater-, is right quality
sm5484: right quality 
nm5478: yeah 
sm5484: right delivery 
nm5478: yeah 
sm5484: right cost [laughter] 
nm5478: how about the right time [laughter] is it alright 
su: delivery 
nm5478: how about right time 
sm5484: it's both to arrive or not to arrive 
nm5478: because delivery can be the right time or the right 
sm5484: it's both 
nm5478: alright how do you measure this 
sm5484: measurements the fastest net profit cash flow and er the cost of 
penalties for missed orders in in units and money 
nm5478: in units and money okay alright you are gonna see the er how how many 
orders you miss and then this translates to penalties to to money in notes okay 
and the er 
sm5484: or money [laughter] 
sf5490: The objectives are increased profit and satisfy the customers with our 
time deliveries and er the strategy is er the first one is the minimising er 
inventory because of the cost of the er inventory and er second one is er our 
preferences to to viewers in because is cheaper 
nm5478: yeah 
sf5490: And the third one is increasing er the sale mm the size productions 
nm5478: alright 
sf5490: yes all the time all the time i think we er we should check the cash 
flow 
nm5478: yes 
su: and er measure our er quality of inventory costs 
nm5478: mm 
su: that's it 
nm5478: that's it alright very nice so everybody wants to make money this week 
er okay hopefully all of the teams gonna make money usually one team make-, 
money two things makes less money and one team [laughter] okay but this is 
hopeful this is er this is usually hopefully this time all the teams is gonna 
be on the best case of making money er i want to to give you the attention in 
some of your objectives and strategy that are not compatible be careful when 
you say minimise the inventory and satisfy customers minimise inventory is a 
very nice er target
sf5490: dream
nm5478: but you have to take which level which level you you minimise your 
inventory alright if you min-, if you use it a lot then you don't have enough 
stock to deliver 
su: on time 
nm5478: units on time okay and then er about this er producing basis don't take 
it for granted because for many of you it's not er possible to sat-, to satisfy 
th-, the-, the units the demands er with only five-thousand units sometimes it 
is possible sometimes it's not er cash flow cash flow is very important is the 
most important thing in the company a company can run with losses but cannot 
run with no cash if you get er in ma-, a lot of times negative in your cash 
flow and in this case your negative maybe below of the five-thousand pounds 
that you have in loan then the company belongs to the bank that gave the money 
and you take holidays [laughter] okay so try t-, to figure out how not to 
exceed these limits but the the er objectives and the strategy to success on 
this game are there the right points are there the question is how you're gonna 
to make this reality on the game and how you're gonna make on the end money 
profits okay 
nm5477: okay guys decision making quite obviously you're faced with the 
decisions that we pointed out earlier you have a green decision sheet in front 
of you that looks something like that okay as you can see from the decision 
sheet we're currently trading in week thirteen so you have bought the business 
at the end of week twelve okay what information you have to help you make the 
decision well quite obviously we are not a made-to-order organisation we have 
to build the inventory in the anticipation of selling it so we are a made-to-
stock organisation if you haven't got it in stock you cannot sell it okay i'm 
going to go through all the decisions you need to make and the starting status 
so okay what information do you have to help you make your first decision what 
do you have in order to make if you like to make your first your first forecast 
you have last year's a past issue of last year's demand last year's sales 
history which is attached a-, as an as an appendices to the to the first page 
and also you have this year's first twelve weeks demand okay so you have a 
historic profile of past demand and if you remember when we talked about 
forecasting and we spoke about forecasting being one of two er particularly er 
objective or quantif-, quantifiable forecasting we talked about objective 
forecasting and the extrapolating or casting forward past histories of demand 
and even be what's called a moving average or aggregating the past demand or 
following the trend or er er trend analysis both techniques or both systems 
might be of use it's for you to decide which is most appropriate or if in fact 
objective forecasting is at all appropriate it may be that you deem that the 
demand is so sporadic so unpredictable that an intuitive er subjective approach 
to forecasting may be better it's for you to decide what i will ask of you is 
in by a quarter to five is that gonna be long enough
ss: yeah
nm5477: yeah within twenty-five minutes can i ask you to have the first 
decision made okay the first decision made for four-forty-five with those 
filled in forget the first two you've got no money to invest you can't you 
can't do anything with the with the the financial transactions the only 
decisions here that really concern me you need to decide how many main bodies 
you're going to order how many aerials er aerials you're going to order how 
many accessories you're going to order, accessories have a two week lead time 
aerials and main bodies have got a one week lead time you need to decide what 
you are gonna produce and when you're gonna produce it maximum five-thousand on 
days three-thousand-five-hundred at night or having differing costs and that's 
your opening inventory status so for four-forty-five twenty-five minutes to go 
can i ask you to fill in the front sheet of the green forms you have the first 
decision sheet we'll then we'll then take you next door and we'll key in that 
data into simulation and we'll see how well or otherwise you did in your 
decision okay go
sm5484: we should be able to meet that demand you'll be too late if we start 
planning in week seventeen for week eighteen when we expect a peak so what i'm 
saying we need enough build up any but for now so as far as we are concerned 
probably the demands from right here in this range keeping with this trend [mm] 
and that's it as far as this week is concerned [mm] probably less slowly we 
will increase the production rate and probably just three weeks before this 
peak here we will start planning for this
su: you're saying you're saying that we should maintain this just to be 
su: yeah yeah yeah 
sm5485: mm 
nm5477: okay guys are we about ready for decision week thirteen nearly nearly 
that's how you stand at the moment so if you click here to enter your team name 
your password not to be forgotten okay we're not playing for a floppy so it 
just goes straight into the hard drive okay you click on bank there and it just 
asks you to transfer what you wanna transfer where to and so on to get you er 
at the moment and then the production schedule er okay what are you gonna 
produce
su: 
nm5477: okay commit that to the schedule you'll be given an opportunity to 
check it make sure that's what you want to do okay please check this 
information is correct 
su: hmm 
nm5477: once you're happy with that continue okay now once you click on yes to 
commit the chan-, the changes and roll the week forward that will immediately 
roll you forward into into into trading week fourteen scroll that up and down 
see your results or we can print off or print the results okay you need to do 
there there's a set of your results okay what your inventory costs were the 
level of accessories et cetera your inventory status your finished stock 
records when we get to play level two we'll be getting scrap rates et cetera 
they'll be in there but if they are not there they are not appropriate 
sm5487: is this part of the simulation 
nm5477: it within level two yeah we don't introduce that yet 
sm5484: we have enough to sell three-thousand 
sm5485: the idea is to comply with 
sm5486: 
sm5484: extra 
sm5485: yeah so this is three-thousand is gonna come now to we are gonna put it 
off five-hundred this one that's er okay how many almost six-thousand 
sm5486: okay 
sm5484: how much the maximum capacity so what i'm saying is we can only accept 
an inventory level maintain under a value of ten-thousand 
sm5485: you're saying you're saying that we should maintain this er same level 
just just to er meet this week from next week before the stock er build up 
sm5484: yeah yeah 
sm5485: yeah you can see that because over here and then we gonna be around 
that the same level we do week fourteen and seven we are at a low level so that 
there's no idea for a start and the er build up is gonna be less if you see 
only for this period because after this peak we alw we are gonna be changed 
with something like that
sm5484: and again 
sm5486: from two-thousand to t-, eight-thousand pound so you can see the cost 
sm5485: the cost of one 
sm5485: yeah yeah 
sm5486: so can we remedy this situation 
sm5484: we are gonna have this kind of fluctuation that's only as far as sales 
is concerned i can only 
sm5485: very small percentage very small 
sm5486: but if you don't 
sm5485: the cost the cost of meeting orders that are higher 
sm5486: 
sm5485: i totally agree totally agree 
sm5484: we have to fill green so first then there are two things we have to do 
forecast if i estimate that i'm going to sell three-thousand this week then 
i'll be left with one-thousand then this week my plan should be to manufacture 
four-thousand okay these two things so sale as three thousand 
sm5485: let's see how much of it we have because by by week fourteen this main 
body is gonna be a finished product 
sm5485: for example by by week eleven-thousand in one week 
su: no two week 
sm5484: we need to decide how much we need to sell how much we need to produce 
consequently how much we already have four-hundred i have a stock of one-
thousand if i'm feeling that is not sufficient i can always produce for the 
sake of stocking see ideally 
sm5485: yes but er just clarify because i just can't see the point but just 
can't see where enters your model 
sm5484: week fourteen so depending on eleven-thousand under a value of one-
thousand i'm saying inventory of raw materials 
sm5485: yeah but the point i'm trying to make is why you sum 
sm5484: you can actually produce nine-thousand in one week you have the 
capacity to produce nine-thousand but you don't have the materials what i'm 
saying is that the cost of inventory yeah so value is forty-five multiplied by 
some quantity i'll three five-hundred into forty-five it's only seven-hundred-
seventy-seven whereas in day shift night it's twenty-one-thousand
su: probably
sm5484: no problem so er will be con so the end of the day we take nine-
thousand the order we don't know we estimating ten-thousand let's see 
sm5481: so minus sixty-five that's for week fifteen i'd say that's six-thousand 
exactly so week fifteen 
su: so this week how much would we be able 
su: planning to go 
sm5481: six-thousand-five-hundred that was what i took us roughly 
sm5479: so how ready 
sm5487: so i think fifteen-hundred should be buffer stock enough isn't it 
su: how accurate is the previous forecast 
nm5477: sorry 
su: how accurate is the previous forecast
nm5477: that's for you to tell me 
su: if we produce five 
nm5478: when you want to print you're gonna press this button okay once once 
once [laughter] 
sm5479: produce this week another two-thousand can we sell it 
nm5478: yeah yeah what you produce this week you can sell this week so if you 
have enough stock of two-thousand and you decide to produce two-thousand and if 
the demand is six-thousand you have satisfied it 
sf5490: okay
nm5477: click on the order form 
sf5490: yeah 
nm5477: and make your decisions on what you're gonna order you have t-, you 
must put a value in each cell 
sf5490: okay 
su: can i tear 
nm5478: er so if you you say that you gonna produce here say enough the same 
five-hundred amount do you know how much you say again here that you gonna 
produce ten-thousand for longer periods not only for one week er 
su: but we have ten -thousand 
sm5481: no three-thousand is gonna be the value of that accessories er in week 
fourteen if we produce if we produce three five-hundred and all of them were 
sold no if we produce another five-hundred 
sm5487: we are planning to produce six-thousand-five-hundred no 
su: yeah 
sm5479: no we're not planning not planning 
su: this week's this week's demand is six-thousand 
su: six-thousand add a five-hundred buffer
su: okay then that would be our 
su: no you're not listen 
su: necessities after week fourteen will be three thousand if we produce six-
thousand-five-hundred yeah 
sm5481: so if keep that stock of five-hundred so week fifteen yeah we produce 
two six-hundred yeah got this two five-hundred buffer 
sm5479: but now but now we're not making a stock of four-thousand 
sm5481: ah here we are 
sm5479: no no we have four-hundred but demand six-thousand we are going to lose 
two thousand pounds yeah 
su: yeah 
sm5481: yeah yeah 
sm5479: yeah 
su: but i'm just talking about this 
su: producing something within the next week 
su: no 
sm5479: can we produce this week another two-thousand actually 
nm5477: yeah yeah what you what you produce this week you can sell this week so 
if you have a buffer stock of two-thousand and decide to produce two-thousand 
if the demand is six-thousand you have satisfied it 
sm5479: okay 
nm5477: but you must have the raw materials to allow you to do that 
sm5479: yeah yeah okay 
sm5487: so in that case we are out of we should keep a the we don't have 
sufficient stock for the next week for the finished stock okay how can we under 
if we want to meet that it's four-hundred plus two-thousand plus another four-
thousand-five-hundred 
sm5479: okay but even if we go over six-thousand we're left with 
su: 
sm5479: we can buy we can buy 
sm5479: so next week next week it will come so when we are next week it will 
come so i can order this week what did you say four-thousand safety stock 
sm5487: no if you want to have it is four-thousand you see this week this week 
we are predicting six-thousand-five-hundred in demand 
su: okay 
sm5487: to make it up another two-thousand-five-hundred this week apart from 
that 
su: two thousand-five-hundred not six-thousand-five-hundred 
sm5479: it's okay when you s-, say six-thousand 
su: yeah 
sm5479: so i've got to make two-thousand this week another four-thousand 
sm5487: four-thousand to make up the er buffer stock 
su: okay 
su: so total average is six-thousand 
su: i know we have one 
sm5481: what is our total stock of finished goods 
sf5488: four-thousand-hundred er four-thousand-hundred er four-thousand-hundred 
su: 
sm5479: so we ought to pro-, plan it next week we have a closing stock of er 
how much running stock how much running stock every 
su: four-hundred 
su: four-thousand 
sm5479: okay four-thousand is the closing stock 
su: we're keeping that at the bottom 
sm5479: okay then er what is what will be the 
sm5481: six-thousand-five-hundred 
su: six-thousand-five-hundred 
sm5481: it's about six-thousand from last week 
su: it's so easy 
sm5479: so it is it is decreased from er 
sm5481: yeah so it's a round up so you don't know so er 
su: mm 
su: 
sm5481: so just keep a buffer 
su: 
su: maximum of maximum of 
su: so are we producing er 
sm5487: four-thousand-five-hundred is our demand 
su: yeah 
su: so we are producing another four-thousand-five-hundred 
sm5487: to make up the buffer stock okay 
sm5479: how much stock we are gonna be 
sm5487: we are producing what six-thousand-four-hundred six-thousand-four-
hundred we are producing 
su: three five-hundred at the end of this week Yeah 
sm5487: so by the next two week if you want to produce another four-thousand 
you need stock up stock up stock up 
su: yeah 
sm5487: and then for two weeks 
su: see 
su: mm 
su: yeah yeah 
sm5481: so if we have four-thousand-one-hundred in stock here 
sm5479: so what is what we what we week sixteen 
sm5481: for that year 
sm5479: for that sixteen week 
su: so that could be the week er sixteen 
sf5488: but we have to put together 
su: yeah yeah count those on 
su: so we are going with this 
su: yeah 
sm5479: because see the the unit cost for these accessories is one pound one 
pound when you going to 
su: you can easily manage it not a great amount but we can build that no' we 
can manage this er the little big demand 
sm5479: no one thing here 
su: no 
su: no 
sm5481: we have to order those parts in the er f-, 
sm5487: so the difference 
sm5481: so we're producing six other thousand this week yeah 
sm5487: yeah 
sm5481: so our opening 
su: for the or closing stock 
su: okay er 
su: so what what is predicted one for the next week 
su: have we got that 
su: yeah 
su: i'd say it's about two thousand 
su: two-thousand two-thousand er 
sm5479: five-hundred 
sm5479: two five-hundred two two-hundred two two-hundred because we predicted 
as two thousand five and a half 
su: that we can't do [laughter] 
su: sure we can think about the two-hundred 
su: 
sm5481: we keep four-hundred-five-hundred buffer stock in case 
su: okay 
sm5487: if its two thousand five yeah then you need how much we need here 
su: we'd need another four or five hundred 
su: another four hundred yeah 
su: 
su: how much does it cost us for each order 
sm5481: it costs us fifty quid for each order 
su: yeah 
su: 
sm5487: er another four-hundred plus can we have stock of another four-thousand 
sm5481: you wanna keep a stock of four-hundred all the time 
sm5487: yeah
