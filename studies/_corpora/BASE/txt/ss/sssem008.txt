nm5464: Claire er and er Jenny er and Emma er okay er cheers er and with that 
remark i'm just going to have a little word with you before we get started this 
is you know this let me explain what this is about is we will have a kind of 
record for the department of the seminar which will be interesting for us but 
they're making a C-D-rom for the benefit of overseas students who may not er 
may not be used to actually working with seminars and er and they'll only use 
are likely to use er but they're doing a number of them across the university 
alright and they'll probably only use just a few snippets er and the thing that 
i would say is we'll just do our normal seminar okay and just completely ignore 
it er you can't completely ignore it but er we will operate as normal and not 
actually worry about it at all and er and it will be beneficial to over-, to 
overseas students who might want to see what we do at Warwick and to see what 
what they're letting themselves in for [laughter] okay er do you want to say 
something Tim
om5465: yeah well i think namex explained everything there er the only thing i 
would like to do assuming that you have no questions is to just ask for your 
permission er to record you and and ask at this point as well that if anybody 
isn't happy about being filmed could you just let me know now er i'll try and 
avoid filming you or i certainly will cut you out in the editing process er has 
anyone any problems or are you all happy [laughter] silence is content er yeah 
er okay i'll take that that everybody's happy thank you very much okay you can 
go ahead
nm5464: okay er so i can just 
om5465: go ahead just ignore me we may have to change the tape or something 
like that er but i'll try not to make any noise
nm5464: the first right hi hello everybody er and first of all er you've got 
the handout for next term and you know that we'll be carrying on as normal er 
hiya er come on in Beverley er over there
sf5467: am i okay here
nm5464: yeah sure yeah and er we're ignoring them we don't know why they're 
here and what they're doing but we're ignoring them er and you've got the 
handout for next term er unfortunately i won't be i won't be taking the seminar 
but er but er Becky Alfred will be will be taking the seminar she's very good 
and she's er a PhD student she's taught the course before and she's doing 
research into er art therapy with er with women who've had breast cancer 
surgery so she's looking very much about the kind of holistic side of medicine 
and what and and how mind influences emotions influence health so er i'm sure 
i'm sure you'll find her very good i will be doing as i said some lectures and 
i'll be back in term three to do to do revision er you it's not a deliberate 
mistake weeks you see that what we're do in the week weeks after we come back 
is that we're looking at specific topics around the social causes of ill health 
i meant in the se-, the last part of the term we look at we look at 
alternatives in practice but there is a mistake in that the handout for week 
twelve should not be the politics of health food and health it should be 
coronary heart disease so we're going to have to give you a supplementary 
handout on that everything else is is correct though okay er but before i mean 
i'm not going to do a formal evaluation hi Jane
sf5468: hi
nm5464: i'm not going to do a formal evaluation but i just want you to know er 
i mean how i mean can we just go round and see how how have you found it this 
term er has it been okay what have you got out of the course 
sm5466: good
nm5464: in what kinds of ways
sm5466: informative er 
nm5464: okay er Helen how have you found it
sf5469: we've covered quite a lot we've covered quite a lot of what we did last 
year so
nm5464: in what kinds of things
sf5469: well all of this term really 
nm5464: right
sf5469: we've gone over lots of things
nm5464: okay er just anybody else er anybody else er wha-, in terms of anything 
you want to say about the content er anybody
sf5473: i found the seminars useful rather than someone standing there i find 
it more beneficial to do it the way we do it er and 
nm5464: right
sf5474: and the handouts are really helpful it can prepare us when we get back
nm5464: pardon
sf5474: you can refer to it when you get back
nm5464: right er yeah i've only just learned how to do these PowerPoint 
[laughter] er it's a shame i couldn't start er but these are really useful
sm5466: they're readable now
nm5464: they're becoming readable as well
sm5466: the size increases slowly as we progress
nm5464: right so you're finding the seminars useful er 
su: yeah
nm5464: and a chance for discussion you know we're quite a big group but in 
small group discussions you find there's enough space 
su: yeah
nm5464: okay and i'm beginning to remember some of the names anybody else wants 
to add about the course so far we're half way through and so on is it all clear 
are you clear where we're going
sm5466: there was one thing i wanted to say was you know the class discussion 
points
nm5464: yeah
sm5466: now i took them as being like seminar discussion points
nm5464: yes
sm5466: so obviously cause obviously we've varied that
nm5464: right they are they are often the issues that we'll be looking at in 
the seminars but er i do and also they're the key issues around the topic so if 
you're doing an an essay and some of you owe me essays don't you after today i 
want either an essay or an excuse from you please so er but if you're doing 
essay it will be useful but i have actually i have and and if you read around 
those for the seminars that will be very good but often in the seminars i like 
to kind of if you like take it a bit bit further particularly using the 
handouts but is that a problem or
sm5466: it has been once or twice
nm5464: once or twice is sort of
sm5466: yeah but not in general
nm5464: okay okay any other issues before we kick off okay right unemployment 
and health er as you as you as you know what we're trying to say in the lecture 
was that it's a contro-, there's a controversial issue about what what if any 
link there is between unemployment and ill health and if there is one what's 
the nature of it and what the policy implications are so what i'd like us to do 
today is to kin-, try and work out those kinds of issues right when i divide 
you up into groups hopefully if possible using some of these have you all got 
these gree-, these overheads which have got some tables on as well
sf5474: i wasn't in one of the lectures so can i have a copy
nm5464: okay i will i have got a spare right so if you can draw on your reading 
but also if possible on the table as well in order in terms of your discussion 
and if you remember one of the debates was er what does er what does what does 
er what what is the rela-, what is the relation is unemployment a cause of ill 
health or is it that people are unemployed are more likely to people who are 
who have ill health are more likely to be unemployed is there a ca-, ca-, 
causation effect that unemployment causes ill health or is there a selection 
effect that er that unhealthy people become unemployed so what i want you to do 
first of all is to look at some of the evidence for that and if i think you'll 
find the the key tables to look at are the table by Morris er the table by abou-
, about Barkley about Barkley and Erringen and the longitudinal study of 
mortality so you've got those three tables in your hand now and you might know 
it you might know people who've been unemployed or been employed yourself or 
what so think out what extent is selection and an-, or is it causation how much 
is the ill health effects of unemployment a process of selection that is 
unhealthy beco-, people become ill and have more chance to die or how much is 
it causation unemployment actually causes ill health right so that's the first 
question i want to look at er when i divide you into groups second question is 
if to the extent that there is a causal relationship what is its nature is it 
due to the fact that the Jehovah thesis that people feel this terrible loss of 
a job it's not the money but it's the the experience of not being in a job 
dislocated from society and so on er or is it actually is the un-, is the ill 
health associated with unemployment is it due to lifestyle is it people have 
enough to live on but they're choosing bu-, but they're but they have an 
unhealthy lifestyle or is it the fact that there are material aspects of 
unemployment poverty er that are linked to other forms of disadvantage that 
aren't just associated with unemployed people so if you could think about have 
you all got those questions so those kind of thi-, you might want to if you've 
finished those are complicated questions but if you then want to go on to about 
the policy implications of what that would be really good as well okay now when 
you're looking at the second one i think you'll find that some of the other 
tables are quite useful with obviously the table about Jehovah's approach which 
i call Dirkheimian because Dirkheim was the person who thought that everybody 
needed a job that a job gave people status and position in society whereas if 
you look at the the the Friar model which is about poverty it's more of a 
Marxian notion about material disadvantage and linked to other forms of 
disadvantage in society so what's the evidence for these these these approaches 
and when you've sorted out whether it's selection or causation when you've 
sorted out this issue about is it people have enough money but they choose the 
wrong lifestyles when you've sorted out er what it is whether it's the loss of 
a job or the actual material circumstances of unemployment think about some 
perhaps some of the policy implications okay and let's divide how many have we 
got the numbers are a bit down this week because it's the Christmas week but 
there are or other reasons as well i don't know but two four four five do you 
want a group of four and a group of six is that about is that okay or is that 
would you like groups of three which would be best one group
su: split it down the middle
nm5464: pardon 
su: straight it down the middle
nm5464: split it down the middle into two groups okay
sm5466: five and four five and five no six
nm5464: two four six two four five so yeah so split down into a group of six 
and a group of five and then shift the furniture around and er everyone clear 
on their brief i'll give you about fifteen minutes or so and then we'll open it 
up for discussion and please don't feel restricted to this evidence on the on 
the handout but it might be if you can in terms of those answers if you can 
refer once a number of occasions to this evidence it would be really good okay 
good luck see you in about fifteen minutes any more questions
sf5475: if you do the tendency is to rather than to go out and try and find 
another job to go out and perhaps you haven't you know this whole thinking 
where you start sit at home start smoking more you know start taking life not 
very seriously and watching telly you know i i must get another job
sf5471: yeah i guess also its depending on what job you've got to determine i 
think if you're a teacher or something like that you know you're investing in 
your children's education and that's your priority
sm5466: and then and job security is less than you so obviously you know you 
don't always think whether you're living with people who are obviously in the 
same you may be working but you're you're never that secure yeah i know yeah 
yeah job security in a way that work is you never feel that your job is never 
that but you've got a job
sf5470: yeah and security
sm5466: you talk
sf5474: so that's saying that it probably causes and not section
sf5470: and that moves in to
sf5469: if you come from a really industrial background there's more chance of 
you being unemployed because you know an accident at work or something else 
sm5466: psychological and physical well if you consider then on the other hand 
had an emergency within the same society can reduce your social standing in 
that society because you no longer conform to which you should be working so 
when you're not working you feel socially excluded
sf5470: yeah okay
sm5466: yeah
sf5470: yeah
sm5466: yeah the thing about the economy just like i've said before about you 
know and belonging and not belonging to society like you're saying even amongst 
certain areas where you have people who are working which may be renowned for 
that some people are working and some people are not working so you have this 
up an down the social integration even within in a small area so that could 
cause lot's of sorts of social problems 
sf5474: basically it's both isn't it but i think you're right when you said its 
more psychological 
sm5466: yeah
sf5474: yeah
sm5466: more physical 
su: selection
su: so we're talking like we're talking disability here
sf5471: you know you can you kind of don't i mean a couple of days each week 
and i have something else every single day just goes into a blur each week i 
can't cope most of the time
sf5475: you were saying this morning about sitting in front of the television 
and smoking instead of sleeping you know i do that all of the time but you're 
probably not like cause i get used to having the attitude of actually not 
getting up in the morning at all just standing there whereas you've got some 
sort of i'm going to work i'm going to do this you have got some kind of 
structure you know you know when it's quiet and you're lying in the morning 
there you say what am i going to do today i'm so bored and everything's a bit 
pants and then you you know even though you know and even though you may not 
like going to work you know at least you've got something well i do go to work 
but it's really not bad once you get there and you have not just whole you know 
this every day organized life you've got different people to talk to and you 
know so once you get there it's not that bad and you actually feel quite good 
at the end of the day whereas if i stay in bed all day if i stay in bed all day 
what use am i so you do start to get in this really like it's like in the 
morning yeah yeah and it's just mind of matter you know
sf5476: it's boring boring telly all day long
sf5475: but remember when you used to take days off school when you weren't 
really all that ill and then about midday you start to think ah i wish i was at 
school with my mates so i'd have something to do and you just end up vegetating 
in your pyjamas all day for the second part of we're just on the second part 
not the first one the second part house calls
sf5471: no yeah it's like tomorrow yeah and consulting it's not are job to do 
that it's about how to keep up with that that's one of the most stressful jobs 
is working on the exchange stock exchange
sf5475: Willy Wonkers
[laughter] 
sf5475: quite true but yeah it does get you know he's only a first year 
graduate from sorry first year graduate from here and you you know never had a 
home in his life and then goes to London and he has this you know stock 
exchange what the hell am i going to do it's like work can make you ill even if 
it's a very good job cause
sf5471: making baskets
sf5474: i wake up and sit there and have time to go 
sm5466: people in this society that is the main reason or one of the main 
reasons why we work to give our families what they require to live every day 
it's the same the same London yeah sorry if you can't remember you're not 
informing yeah that's right you're not informing 
sm5466: saying as lifestyle and then its you psychological welbeing it's a 
complex situation yeah you can throw away yes
nm5464: should i give you a couple of more minutes another four minutes okay 
i'll be back in four minutes
sf5475: on the contract you signed away your rights to have a thirty-seven hour 
week you really don't have to work more than that so
sf5476: on another job
sf5475: yeah
sf5471: yeah
sf5476: you're still paid the same wage when you do that twenty hours extra but 
you're fired when you don't do it
sf5471: my dad's always in through the weekends have you seen that advert its 
for Red Bull or something and it's stimulating and there's a guy and he er goes 
out of a nice house and then he goes into work at about three in the morning or 
something like that this time falls asleep on his head and the boss comes in and
su: that's really good
sf5471: it's seen as a good thing talk about your wages because helps talk 
about your wages
nm5464: are we mostly finished are we alright okay er from here so the the 
first question that you're looking in the extent to which that unemployment was 
actually the result of ill health or a cause of of ill health how did you get 
on with that question what did you decide anyone in this group to start with
su: i thought it was a bit of both i couldn't really come to any sort of i 
don't think anybody was on one side or the other 
nm5464: right what evidence did you bring on that might be what about look at 
the selection factor what other evidence is there unemployed people that ill 
health families could become the highlight of unemployment
sf5471: well we used examples of people if you're ill say you're a teacher and 
you're constantly ill than you're obviously putting that child's education you 
know in danger and if they're looking at like kicking someone off cause they've 
got too many teacher they always have that than you're name's going to come up 
first because you have been in to the point where you're seen as unreliable 
because you know despite the sort of sick thing
nm5464: is there a lot of stress amongst teachers or
sf5471: i'd say there was 
nm5464: right so that's a good so let's follow that example through because 
that's actually a good one that's a white collar job which cause there's a lot 
of stress in teaching so so people so you think i might be increasing as well 
with vulnerability to the unemployment
sf5471: yeah yeah cause obviously if you've got a teacher who turns up every 
single day as in teaching five days a week and there's another teacher who is 
off a couple of days who might have like a really bad asthma attack might be 
three strikes on a Sunday night not until a Tuesday and that happens sort of 
every other week or whatever than their name's their going to be they're going 
to have a black mark next to their name and their going to be brought up when 
it comes to
nm5464: so is it is it possible though the people are more likely to be 
selective in a in a recession or when they are more people unemployed not 
necessarily what about if the economy is buoyant and or that they're short 
staffed do you think it's less likely that these people would be unemployed 
what would you think about here Sandy you're nodding
sf5470: i think that if we sort of came to that conclusion that yes if er i-, i-
, if you're ill or you're more sick more stressed or what have you than maybe 
you're going to be the first to either not to get promotion or be first to go 
when things happen
nm5464: so i'm going to quickly push what we might if you're at best teacher to 
maybe might choose to to opt for disability or or is it possible to hear people 
say that they've had enough that they've Melanie your nodding 
sf5472: mm no i was just trying i was going to say before that companies tend 
to see you as a liability don't they if you they're paying you more money for 
you being sick than actually turning up to work and they're more likely to want 
to get rid of you
nm5464: or encourage you to get on take a retirement or something
sf5472: yeah
nm5464: but who does it affect most do you think that it affect is more likely 
to affect people at the top of the scale or the or the does ill health more 
affect people unemployment ill health more affect people at the bottom of the 
social scale
sf5475: i think it's more likely that they people who are working past 
background can can become more fatalistic quickly like say say you're middle 
class and you become ill the you're general outlook on things is i want to get 
better and get back to work and working class is is there's a lot more tendency 
to get a lot out of work i'm going to get benefits i'm going to start smoking 
and i'm going to start watching daytime television more and more and than 
you're bringing it on yourself even if the original cause isn't you know you 
may let it be known but i think workers find it hard to get out of that rut and 
you know having sick people being there
nm5464: so you're saying there could be some cultural more than as well as 
structural what do you what do you think about that upon that
sf5470: i was just thinking about the topic before there was something in the 
paper last night in about Birmingham City Council
nm5464: yeah
sf5470: and their high sick rates particularly in social services that well any 
sort group of people with people jobs in housing and they started sending 
people out to visit people who were sick but it's only into departments like 
the housing the manual workers whereas presumably someone with a sort of 
principle office task isn't quite so likely to take a home visit
nm5464: i think this is rather isn't it actually if you have a middle class 
occupation you can carry on as or you're more likely to be able to carry on as 
without being made redundant you're less likely to habit if you're middle class 
where as if you're low on the social scale you're more at risk of unemployment 
anyway and perhaps it is a physical ill health that makes it hard for you to do 
your job but you also may be subjected to surveillance is what you're saying 
but so there is enough there is but well when if you're retired it's not 
necessarily bad for your health i mean if you're doing a stressful job it may 
have what affect do you know any retired teachers
ss: mm yes
nm5464: and how are they finding their they find that their worse off their 
health is worse now as well
sf5475: they're seem to be much better
nm5464: so alright so it can have a goo-, so retirement for ill health needn't 
necessarily perhaps er 
sf5471: yeah i think also within within illness itself there might be sort of 
distinctions because middle class people you could say are more likely to be 
sufferers you could say of something like M-E which isn't as highly recognized 
as say an early stroke or you know someone something which is seen much more as 
a working class disease and so there might be there might be sort of selection 
within that you know
nm5464: mm mm yeah okay so we're going okay Dale yeah
sm5466: i was going to say that if you're looking at the middle class working 
class i think that the thing that you have to consider the fact that if you 
look at working class and a person is ill and the tenant is like okay yeah i'll 
go on sick for a couple of weeks or whatever and hang it out as long as i can 
that he's only got to fall back on where as in a middle class job there's 
generally you've got company pensions so therefore if you go to the the 
grounded area of the scale you've got middle class working class man right he's 
been knocked out of he's got nothing other than state handouts whereas the 
working class man has got pensions et cetera yeah it's it's all in place 
there's a big difference between the two so therefore i would argue that the 
working class man would wish to get back in the groove as soon as possible to 
maintain their material you know their standing you know
nm5464: on the whole there appears to be evidence you saw didn't in those 
statistics about what unemployment and what appears to low there's a huge 
number of people who have taken early retirement you know or gone off sick far 
after they get to fifty and what they're saying is is quite true is that the 
middle class and you you often may go retire early at sixty especially if if 
you're a kind of chair of ground travel or something and can take a nice 
handshake wouldn't you than that's okay but if you're working class is actually 
you lose a lot of income and many instances you have been forced early 
retirement so there's a lot what we start to talk about there is a lot of 
complexity isn't there around these kind of issues but there is that's the 
selection factor what about causation is there evidence that unemployment has a 
direct cau-, causal effect on ill health on mortality and it what did you found 
there
sf5475: you could look at the amount of industrial accident accidents that 
there were it's not necessarily people being careless it's actually the company 
that puts a can in-, place inserts regulations and things so in that case 
unemployment sorry being employed is definitely hazardous to your health
nm5464: right so the danger that you're saying unemployment is hazardous to 
your health is if we ignore the whole effect of work hazard but is there is 
there is there is there actually evidence that actually being unemployed are 
you familiar with this i gave you or from what you know or maybe you've known 
people who are unemployed as well so you can bring in both experiential and a 
kind of social science evidence here but actually unemployment has a is a 
causal link to early mortality amongst people that are at retirement age Sandy 
your nodding
sf5470: is it Morris
nm5464: which what are you looking at
sf5470: the Morris 
nm5464: the Morris study what does that tell you anything that's the possible 
employment of mortality of men age forty to fifty-nine that table on on here
sf5470: that's quite a significant statistic really i'm appalled 
nm5464: yeah so talk us through t
sf5470: i was going to go off in another direction and say that what one of the 
things we discussed was that it actually it started before the unemployment it 
was this insecurity in of of you know when you still have a job that that's 
when things
nm5464: so that's not when you've just become unemployed what kinds of effects 
does it have on people
sf5470: psychological to begin with the stress and everything that works with 
physical
nm5464: what do people worry about when before that am i being redundant or 
what kinds of things do people worry about 
sf5471: finances is one of the big ones
nm5464: yes anything else
sf5471: its respect if you're living in a certain neighbourhood and you lose 
your job and then you have downsize in house downsize your car your children 
have to stop going to private school
nm5464: so there's about fears about social status as well as
sf5471: yeah like a lot of people wouldn't tell their spouses when you know the 
risk of being unemployed being unemployed
nm5464: there is a lot of evidence that actually ill health affects start 
before before redundancy and actually affect how you how you you
sm5466: job security
nm5464: yeah but is that objective because often what they ask you what would 
you rate your health as fair bad or good your mental health as fair bad are 
good how you know ju-, just on the basis of that evidence would you say that's 
acceptable amount in terms of people's health status that kind of objective 
evidence is that objective evidence that is a real indication of health do you 
think 
sm5466: no it can vary from day to day i think
nm5464: pardon
sm5466: it varies
nm5464: but what kinds of things would you take as evidence of poor mental 
health for example what kinds of things
sf5471: sleeping 
nm5464: right yeah th-, that's always when i'm feeling stressed is when i can 
wake up in the middle of the night worrying about what how i haven't marked 
your essays what are we going to do when i come into seminar so sleep so sleep 
disturbance anything else
sf5475: about dying
nm5464: dying that can actually be stress yeah what else what else about dying 
symptoms around fear gastric disturbance and things like that there is a lot of 
evidence that particularly impacts around peoples mental health the other thing 
i was trying to get at was that if you rate there is a lot of evidence as 
suggested in the lecture but if you rate yourself it's not an objective measure 
in terms of a psychiatrist decides your mentally healthy or fairly healthy or 
poor but if you rate accor-, according to how you rate yourself people who rate 
themselves as having poor mental health they have a much higher risk of 
subsequent mortality within five years so this is what partly the argument is 
there's quite a correspondence between the two in fact that even though it's 
subjective so what is it so so people are worried before hand what about later 
mortality what's the evidence later of mortality and the risk of unemployment
sm5466: well the government themselves in saving lives they state that people 
who work endure better physical mental health than those that don't work the 
unemployed increase the risk of illness and of premature death a middle aged 
man who loses his job is twice as likely to die in the next five years as a man 
who remained in employ
nm5464: yup is that surprising or shocking
sm5466: not really
nm5464: what about is this is this surprising this how if we look at the if we 
look at the facts have a look again at this Morris how much can you say that 
some of that might be due to a selection effect of sickness and how much of 
that is an independent look at that table and see if if anyone can tell me 
whether how much of that excess mortality excess of dying associated with 
unemployment how much of that linked of sickness or how much of that is likely 
to be directly caused by unemployment Sandy started to talk but you chickened 
out didn't you
sf5470: i did
nm5464: so i won't pick on you again but here's a key table it's a group of men 
who between age forty to fifty-nine and it traces them through and sees how 
many you know according to their employment experience how many are alive or 
dead after a certain period and also tries to check how many of them are sick 
or or not so what would you take from that table would anyone be brave enough to
sm5466: well they argue to argue that those who are unemployed have got more 
chance at dying through cancer or a coronary heart disease than those who do 
work
nm5464: right that's the first thing that you can conclude from there's a 
higher risk there's a higher risk if you're unemployed that after a certain 
period five years or so of dying from un-, er if you're unemployed than if 
you're in employment everyone agree with that yeah anything else to add to it 
though from the table
sm5466: well don't you think the sample size is 
nm5464: well the sample size is interesting right we'll come back to that but 
what but is it different groups higher risks and why and what you're concluding 
from that who has the highest risks amongst the unemployed and who has
sf5474: its particularly the retired
nm5464: yeah they have so people who retire early have a higher rate of death 
than most people who are actually unemployed
sm5466: even if they don't have illness
nm5464: even if they're not even if they're not if they didn't retire because 
of illness but what about illness what does that do if you have illness and 
unemployment together
sm5466: the highest risk
nm5464: yeah so what does that tell you about selection and causation is the 
sort of the central issue 
sm5466: it brings it all 
nm5464: which is what
sm5466: well it does i think that they going on that they have to you have to 
stand up back up the selection
nm5464: yes
sm5466: because you're not going to walk into a job if you don't if there's 
someone physically fit next to you i think you said in the lecture a few years 
ago if you wore glasses you were less likely to not get a job as someone who 
didn't
nm5464: yeah what this study is often used to is to is to s-, suggest is that 
there is an independent sickness and selection there is a direct cause and 
relationship between unemployment and mortality because athough if you're sick 
you have a much higher rate a risk of of dying even if you are well and 
unemployed or retired then you are you have a higher rate of mortality if you 
are at one point seven percent forty-seven percent higher chance of dying early 
er if you're unemployed and well and eighty-six percent chance if you're 
retired so there is something causal about unemployment and and actually 
regardless of whether people e-, even healthy unemployed people won't die 
earlier than as a result of unemployment so what is it about unemployment that 
is such risk of health even if people are well when they become unemployed did 
you look at this what did you what did what did you think what theor-, there 
are these different theorums aren't there what did you conclude what is it 
about anyone experienced unemployment i know that a number of people have 
experienced unemployment and all of its effects what it was about or what is it 
about unemployment that actually damages your health
sf5471: i'd say it was number of things
nm5464: okay let's try and learn okay Jennifer what things
sf5471: er it's like stigma of in terms of respect
nm5464: alright yeah
sf5471: er 
nm5464: status and what kind of voice
sf5472: social status
sm5466: material social
nm5464: sorry status what do you meant by status
sf5472: because it changes if your'e from being a working person being able to 
afford things and you know to maintain a lifestyle
nm5464: so it's money as well money and ability to buy things buy a lifestyle 
okay but status is something different how people value it
sf5471: esteem
su: about yourself yeah
nm5464: so it's your own esteem about how you perceive people higher with more 
money do you think someone unemployed has a higher has a lower status in 
society than someone
sf5472: even if you didn't feel like you did you would be made to feel like you 
ahd
nm5464: right what would you be made how would you be made to feel 
sf5472: because of stigma
nm5464: right yeah who how how would the stigma operate where would you get 
this where does it come through from whom and where what the government thinks 
like everyone should be in work and have a job whether you're a single parent 
disabled too wealthy to work that kind of thing do you think that adds to the 
stigma of unemployment
sm5466: underclass do
nm5464: pardon
sm5466: underclass
nm5464: the notion of the underclass
sm5466: yeah
nm5464: yeah but they're the underclass is the people who's blamed for their 
unemployment where else does it come through sources of stigma
sm5466: material differences
nm5464: the family family and colleagues yes family neighbours
sf5475: and society in general really
nm5464: yeah
sf5472: media
nm5464: the media yeah that's what i was just thinking do you see the media 
often
sf5471: yeah
nm5464: has stories which mind these things Amanda your nodding what did you 
has anyone seen stories in the media that newspapers or T-V that or how 
unemployed people are betrayed
sm5466: well go back to the Thatcher years where there's a single parents
nm5464: right yeah
sm5466: that's one of the main problems
nm5464: anything that people lose i mean what do people lose as a i mean they 
lose money but what do they lose as a result of of unemployment i mean that 
actually
sm5466: status class status
sf5471: access to employment
nm5464: pardon
sf5471: access to employment i'd say in that if you went for a job five years 
after you've lost your past one maybe through health maybe due to a number of 
reasons if they said to you when did you last have your when did you last have 
a job you said five years ago why did you give up this job what reason and then 
said why didn't you go out and find another one if you said i couldn't be 
bothered er i needed time off to recover or whatever that's it's going to put a 
certain stigma on you again as being lazy again even though you may have needed 
that time off to raise a child or whatever
nm5464: okay the other thing i wanted to get at is this Jehovas anyone looked 
at the Jehovas idea of what it is about God
sf5470: but i think 
nm5464: right she argues there's lots of jobs things about jobs the give you a 
reason to get up in the morning or being a student you know or being a lecturer 
as well as money and that once you lose that sense of identity that you have a 
purpose that you have do something also the experience of time there are weeks 
and weekends the timing structure and so on but which do you think here is more 
important i mean how would things work through to ill health how would these 
kind of psychological feelings around esteem or status or worries about money 
how does that work through to why people get heart disease and cancer how would 
why is it that there is and and more suicide why is that there is these kinds 
of things around that lead to these kinds of things
sf5470: causes physical
nm5464: right
sm5466: well we thought that they were linked anyway you know you couldn't 
discard one without the other it's certainly linked 
nm5464: okay but what is it about money how does the money worry about money 
how would that
sm5466: you know i mean you just can't achieve the material things that 
nm5464: right
sm5466: that you strive for or wished around you know just general things you 
know things and you're feeling naked out of work not belonging out of anomy if 
you do find it Durkheimian thoughts 
nm5464: that's right well the thing is what's interesting is that actually in 
terms lifestyle and pride healthy lifestyle as evidence that it does affect 
your ability to purchase one so but what this the thing about the unemployment 
today is that not only does it demonstrate poor things that unemployment is a 
serious health problem and a health risk but it tells us that psychological 
health and physical health are closely linked both directly because actually 
feeling bad about one's self can change er your physical state and your body 
chemistry that puts you at higher risk of heart disease cancer but also that 
when you're stressed you do things like smoke more and care less about yourself 
and your diet so it it's a kind of circular effect so that's what in terms of 
actually looking is actually they're very connected in a sense that these 
psychological aspects material aspects so that's what i'm looking for when i 
get er your essays on unemployment and mental health Morris's states on 
unemployment and mental health okay we've nearly run out of time now so thanks 
for that we we next next week next you're going to start off by looking at 
housing and health and the int-, many of the problems and issues around housing 
and health are very similar really i think er in terms of how do we sort out 
whether people who are ill end up in housing or whether without housing become 
ill how do we sort out cause and effect so many of these issues are the same 
and also what is it about ill health is it the fact that er material conditions 
that affect your health or is it the fact that er a home is important to one's 
identity and if you don't actually if you're living in poor conditions and you 
feel bad about that that that's a psychological effects or is it a combination 
of the two so and it's linked to based on people because it's actually been 
showed that you can't separate all these things unemployment unemployed people 
often live in poor housing as well so how would you separate how the effects of 
unemployment from other social indicators so many of these issues are are the 
same really which is why Friar argues that they're all a part of really ma-, 
material disadvantage okay so er that's that's why i want you to sort of do 
some reading and thinking about next time and thanks for all your work this 
term and have a nice Christmas does anybody owe me any essays give me some 
either an essay do you owe me any essays or giving me excuses about essays
sm5466: you can have both from me
nm5464: don't press me okay have a nice Christmas okay i won't see you after 
New Years after Christmas but er but i'll give you're essays back and we can 
have an individual tutorial and if you've got any criticisms that you didn't 
want to give on the camera
