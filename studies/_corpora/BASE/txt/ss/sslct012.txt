nm1148: er [0.3] [1.2] can we start er [1.4] first of all er there's [0.3] the 
number of people here today is not as as high as it probably should be because 
i think er on the programme i-, it was actually recorded as no lecture today [0.
6] but i've asked i asked er the faculty office to inform students that there 
was actually a lecture today but obviously [0.7] er that ha-, message hasn't 
got through luckily some people just came along anyway [0.4] so that's good 
news for me [0.6] er i also [0.4] might like to apologize 'cause of my voice 
i've just i'm just recovering from a cold [0.5] and it's gone down to my chest 
and affected my voice so i'm a bit squeaky [0.3] ironic because i'm being taped 
today [0.5] er [0.2] by the university [0.2] so they can advertise these 
lectures [0.4] well no illustrate the lecturing [0.6] er lectures to foreign 
students before they come here so as get an idea of the kind of [0.6] er [0.3] 
language and er [0.3] lectures they'll be getting [1.5] er i'm taking over from 
namex and namex who's who have covered the lectures up until now [0.7] in 
environment and 
sustainability [0.5] they've been looking at the strategic [0.2] level [0.6] 
looking at strategic aspects [0.4] around [0.6] land [0.2] er [0.8] housing 
development transport [1.0] now we we call it strategic but in fact there's as 
you probably gather by some of the stuff that namex and namex have been talking 
about [0.4] there's quite a lot of local things [0.3] in their lectures as well 
about local green transport plans and the like [1.3] and i think that's a a 
sort of thing that i would [0.3] emphasize vis-Ã -vis the exam when it comes [0.
5] er [0.4] is that there is quite a bit of overlap between strategic aspects 
and the local aspects although there is a a formal division in the lecture 
programme [0.5] there's a fair amount of crossover [0.3] and in that sense [0.
4] when it comes to exams d-, doing questions you can use material [0.6] from 
one [0.3] block [0.6] alongside [0.2] the other block so there's no necessary 
divide [0.3] which again [0.3] reflects sustainable development sustainable 
development [0.5] which is [0.3] attempts to be holistic [0.5] to integrate and 
deal with all these things together as much as 
possible [0.2] it fits [0.4] the kind of concepts of sustainability [1.4] 
however [0.5] er [1.2] the next few weeks will be taken up with [0.2] what we 
call local aspects local dimensions of sustainable development [0.2] looking at 
U-K [0.2] experience [0.7] er [0.3] i will be covering [0.7] er [0.5] material 
[1.4] related to [0.6] local authority [0.4] what local authorities are doing 
in relationship to [0.6] sustainable development [0.8] er [1.3] i will be [0.2] 
looking at [0.5] the local economy looking at local economic development [0.2] 
and sustainable development what is a green economy [0.3] if you like [1.1] er 
namex will be covering aspects of urban design looking at sustain-, sustainable 
urban design [0.7] and finally the last sess-, session we'll do at the end of 
term [0.6] will be me talking about the concept [0.2] of the ecological city [0.
9] an ecological city is really [0.3] an attempt to put together [0.6] all the 
different aspects that you've been covering in this course [0.7] as they apply 
to [0.3] cities in general [0.5] so in that sense it kind of goes back 
strategic again [0.6] it starts strategic goes local and then comes 
back out [1.6] so today's session [0.5] er and what i'll do is i'll probably 
speak for about forty minutes [0.2] take a break [0.3] and then finish off [0.
3] after a coffee [0.8] is i'm going to talk about [0.2] er l-, the local [0.5] 
er environment [0.7] the [0.2] role of local government [1.2] and also look at 
the interaction [0.5] with the community [0.5] particularly through [0.7] the 
idea and processes of Local Agenda [0.2] Twenty-one [0.6] which is the [0.6] 
mechanism o-, [0.2] i guess [0.6] where local authorities are trying to engage 
[0.3] with local communities [3.0] [1.7] i've given out a handout which kind of 
[0.9] gives the main [0.3] points or the main headings that i will re-, be 
referring to you can annotate my [0.3] note [1.5] or write your own notes to 
add to them [0.9] there's a fair amount of [0.3] literature in the reading list 
that you can use [0.4] and i've asterisked the stuff that i think is most 
relevant [1.4] there is i think t-, ab-, again er but i'll mention this now and 
i'll mention again le-, next week there's one [0.7] er journal which i find [0.
8] very relevant to the stuff that i cover [0.8] it's called er [1.3] and i 
think it's on the reading 
list actually on one of the the it's called env-, er Local Environment News [1.
3] which is in the er [0.2] Land Management Resource Centre there's copies of 
Local Environment News [0.5] in the Resource Centre [1.1] er [0.2] and [0.4] 
i've mentioned a few articles in the reading list from it but again it's worth 
having a flick through that journal [0.5] because it's it's published every 
month [0.6] it [0.2] reports [1.1] on various initiatives that are going on [0.
5] today [1.8] going on at this moment in local authorities in local 
communities in local economies [0.7] so you c-, if you skim through that 
journal you can pick up [0.3] other th-, other things apart from i'm being 
talking about [0.4] so again as a revision aid [0.4] it's probably worth having 
a look at that journal [0.5] er nearer the time when you get to the exam [4.0] 
we're all aware [0.5] as you've already [0.9] mentioned or namex has already 
mentioned with the [0.6] the rise of the environmental agenda [1.2] various 
environmental problems [1.3] have arisen and been acknowledged [1.0] in the 
media by academics [0.3] by environmental pressure 
groups and now increasingly [0.5] by the world's governments [2.3] those issues 
[1.1] like [0.5] the pollution arising from economic processes [0.5] the 
depletion of the ozone layer [1.2] overexploitation [0.2] of natural resources 
[1.3] the loss and damage to habitats and wildlife [1.8] population growth [0.
6] poverty and famine [0.3] in certain parts of the world [0.5] all those 
issues have sort of come together [0.6] and being acknowledged [0.7] they've 
led [1.5] over the last thirty years or so to a number of [1.7] major [0.6] 
international agreements conferences [1.2] er to legislation [0.2] at different 
levels European [0.2] directives [0.8] U-K national [0.8] acts of Parliament [0.
9] and again as part of the handout and again just as an aide-memoire [1.6] 
i've got a i've i've sort of [0.2] d-, constructed a broad picture [1.2] [0.9] 
of some of those [0.4] what i call pathways of environmental law [1.8] the way 
that those issues have been picked up at different levels [0.4] at the U-K 
level the European level and international level [0.9] leading to [0.4] 
conferences [1.1] action plans [0.8] strategies and acts [0.4] and directives 
[1.2] so again that's really sort of 
summarizing very briefly [1.0] the major pieces [0.5] of environmental law that 
have arisen [1.0] particularly over the last [0.2] thirty or so years [9.0] 
this is [0.9] a lot of these environmental issues have been identified at the 
global level [0.2] have been seen to be global problems [2.7] but there has 
been a push [1.4] by [0.2] national international organizations [0.7] to act 
locally [1.5] and there is a [0.5] a rationale [1.2] for local action [1.4] 
particularly [0.9] [0.6] the emphasis on local action very much came out [0.9] 
of [0.2] the Rio conference [1.5] on Agenda Twenty-one [1.6] in nineteen-ninety-
two [1.6] that conference that international conference produced [3.4] an 
action programme for sustainable development into the twenty-first century [1.
5] and the whole emphasis of the Rio [0.3] conference [1.3] was [0.8] on [0.7] 
involving [0.6] a range of stakeholders [0.7] in sustainable development in the 
actions [0.2] towards sustainable development [2.6] it also emphasized 
widespread participation as widespread as possible [0.3] to kind of [0.3] 
expand the range of people [0.9] that were working towards sustainable 
development [4.7] also the other 
thing about Rio [0.7] which again namex probably has picked up on [1.2] is that 
it defined [0.6] sustainable development [0.3] in quite broad terms [1.0] it 
defined it in socio-economic [0.3] terms [0.2] not just environmental [0.6] so 
the environmental problems [1.5] that had risen [1.1] to prominence [0.9] were 
increasingly being redefined because [0.8] it was [0.7] humans [0.2] it was us 
[1.1] human beings social social animals [0.4] who were causing [0.5] and 
influencing environmental problems [1.6] so [0.2] words coming from Rio [0.9] 
for sustainable development [0.5] improving the quality of human life [2.0] 
whilst living within the carrying capacity of supporting ecosystems [0.9] 
that's the kind of message [0.5] coming from Rio improving the quality of human 
life [0.7] whilst living within the carrying capacity [0.5] of supporting 
ecosystems [2.5] so very it's very much again de-, defined in terms of [0.5] 
human processes [0.2] quality of life issues [1.6] in relationship to 
environmental constraints [4.7] one of the key outcomes of Rio [0.2] of the Rio 
conference in ninety-two was [0.5] Agenda Twenty-one [1.6] chapter eight of 
Agenda 
Twenty-one [2.5] called on the world's governments and local communities [0.9] 
to prepare [0.7] Local Agenda Twenty-ones [1.5] for their countries and for 
local areas within them [4.4] the need [0.5] to operate at the local level [0.
8] the community level to produce these Local Agenda Twenty-ones [2.1] was 
based on a ver-, er on a number of premises [1.7] [0.8] [0.6] firstly [0.6] the 
need to tackle environmental problems at all relevant levels [1.1] in other 
words [1.9] environmental problems were being caused by actions [0.6] not just 
by [0.4] international governmental policy [0.4] but also by [1.1] businesses 
[0.4] organizations and individuals living their lives carrying out their 
businesses carrying out their functions [1.1] so in order to tackle 
environmental problems you need to address them and act at all levels wherever 
wherever [0.4] the decision making [0.8] processes [0.7] are taking place are 
causing [0.2] or influencing the quality of the environment [3.9] secondly [0.
6] another rationale for ou-, operating locally [0.4] is to build [0.4] 
consensus between all key interests [2.8] in other words to incorporate [1.2] 
all 
the major stakeholders all the groups as far as possible [0.9] in this process 
of sustainable development [2.9] and there was also an emphasis at Rio [0.5] to 
include to be socially inclusive and include those groups that are normally 
marginalized [1.2] so there's an emphasis [1.3] on involving [1.6] the poor [0.
2] the unemployed [0.4] children [2.7] ethnic groups [3.5] male and females [2.
0] within [0.3] the process [3.9] in order to do that again you need to operate 
where people [0.4] are [0.2] operating themselves [0.8] and communities are 
seen as one of the key areas where [0.8] people see are identify with local 
areas and therefore those are the areas [0.5] that are most meaningful [0.7] 
for these people [0.2] to be involved in decision making [3.3] also [0.5] apart 
from trying to involve people [0.8] there was a need [0.3] seen at the national 
international level to spread ownership to spread a sense of ownership [0.5] of 
sustainable development [0.7] down [0.3] into local communities [1.5] so the s-,
the n-, the nations of the world at Rio were signing up [0.5] some [0.2] 
reluctantly [0.7] others more enthusiastically [0.5] but there was a feeling 
that [0.6] this [0.5] 
agreement at international level needed to [0.4] permeate down [0.2] through [0.
5] the different layers [0.2] of government the different layers of society and 
economy [2.0] and finally another rationale for local [0.2] action [0.5] in 
sustainable development [1.0] is that it allows local solutions [1.8] local 
decision making [0.6] local knowledge [0.3] to be used [2.9] the u-, European 
Union [0.7] [0.2] used the word [0.4] subsidiarity [1.7] to describe this [0.2] 
that you should [0.2] devolve [0.2] power and decision making [0.4] down as far 
as [0.4] as is possible [0.4] as far as is appropriate [2.6] okay there will be 
some decisions there'll be some actions that needed to be taken internationally 
[0.9] there'll be some that need to be taken at national level [1.2] there's 
some that n-, need to be taken at regional level [1.1] but there are others 
that need to be taken at the local level so again it's that idea of trying to 
[0.8] devolve influence and power and decision making as much as possible [1.9] 
so that's the kind of [0.5] rationale [0.5] arguments why [0.5] you should have 
local [0.8] action on sustainable development [3.1] in terms of the U-K [0.4] 
[2.4] there 
have been a number of [0.2] phases since [0.7] the late eighties i guess when 
[0.5] after the brundtla-, [0.2] Brundtland Report in eighty-seven [0.4] local 
authorities and governments in the U-K started becoming aware and committed in 
various ways [0.6] to sustainable development as a concept [2.6] and in local 
authorities [1.2] there was [0.6] a significant [0.4] er commitment [0.7] 
produced [1.2] during the late eighties and early nineties [2.3] Jeremy raemaek-
, Raemaekers' article which is on the reading list [0.6] reviews [0.8] action 
that was being taken in the [1.4] late eighties and early nineties [0.4] and in 
some respects his phases he's he's divided up into different phases [1.2] his 
phases of action [0.3] er er by local authorities [1.8] are very much the ones 
that have continued so the work that was done in the early nineties has really 
continued through [0.7] into the new century [0.8] so it's worth just reviewing 
them [2.0] the first phase [0.9] of local authority action was was geared 
around [1.1] producing environmental charters and action plans [1.2] [sniff] [1.
4] 
now what happened was [0.2] after Brundtland [1.3] a-, an organization that is 
very astute an e-, environmental organization which is very astute Friends of 
the Earth [2.8] said we want local government we want government in the U-K to 
take up [0.2] take on board sustainable development [0.5] so they what the s-, 
Friends of the Earth did is they produced a model charter [0.3] you know [1.0] 
for sustainable development [1.0] it's really a kind of a a policy [0.2] 
statement or commitment [0.3] by an organization to the principles of 
sustainable development [0.8] and Friends of the Earth produced this charter [0.
3] and sent it to all the chief execs the chief executives of all local 
authorities in the U-K [0.4] and said [0.5] you should be signing up to this 
Brundtland there's been a Brundtland Report United Nations is pushing this [0.
3] the uni-, the European Union is pushing this [0.3] you need to take action 
at the local level [1.3] and so they produced this [0.6] model charter and said 
you could do this [1.0] and of course local local authority chief execs said [0.
3] oh look they've already got they've 
already done one for us [1.3] so we can use this one [0.3] so you know the ch-, 
Friends of Earth are very astute they say well if you give them [0.2] what they 
need [0.5] without them having to do much work for it they'll use it and that 
and that's what basically happened local authorities started signing up [0.6] 
producing these environmental charters [0.6] which is really [0.9] just a 
commitment [0.2] it was a broad statement of commitment [1.2] to the principles 
of sustainable development [3.1] and also [0.3] at about the same time [1.1] so 
that kind of put it on the agenda that put it on the local agenda [1.6] at the 
same time local authorities started saying well what do we do [0.7] 
environmentally [1.1] you know let's [0.2] let's [0.3] have a look [0.3] at our 
environmental practices [0.5] 'cause 'cause local authorities [0.8] who have 
been involved in environmental health waste disposal [0.4] planning and 
development [0.7] were involved in environmental [0.2] policy anyway [1.5] so 
they they started producing [0.3] kind of quick and dirty and i think that is 
the key words quick and dirty and then dirty 
quick and dirty [0.4] action plans [0.7] so they kind of they asked all the 
departments of the local authority [2.1] what are we doing what are you doing 
[0.2] that [0.9] is supporting sustainable development [0.6] so all the 
departments wrote back with what [0.2] what actions they are doing [0.5] to 
support [1.5] er environmental protection and sustainable development [0.6] and 
local authorities [0.2] often quickly produced these and said right this is our 
environment-, this is our statement of environmental action [1.1] this is what 
we are doing [0.2] and maybe even intending to do [1.2] so that that first 
phase [0.4] which was in about the late [0.2] you know [0.2] from eighty-seven 
through to [0.4] eighty-nine [0.2] very quick stuff [1.4] really put 
sustainable development on the local political agenda and also [0.9] made 
initial commitment by local authorities and also outlined what they were doing 
[0.6] in this area [3.2] second phase [1.1] was the production of State of the 
Environment Reports [1.4] SOTERs [0.2] for short [0.9] State of the Environment 
Reports and Environmental Audits [2.1] these were a [0.2] a bit more thorough 
[0.3] 
so you've got the quick and dirty stage one [0.9] once that the dust had 
settled on them they said right [1.0] er we need to [0.2] map out the state of 
our local environment [3.5] so [0.4] and it usually was planning departments 
who had access to m-, a lot of this information [0.8] produced documents which 
ranged in thickness from [0.3] so thick to so thick [0.4] or in volumes [0.5] 
which kind of mapped out the state of the local authority's environment [0.7] 
so they looked at their environmental assets their environmental problems [0.9] 
they mapped [0.4] so G-I-S started becoming used [0.2] G-I-S was used to map 
out [0.8] the various [1.9] environmental resources [0.2] operating locally the 
pr-, you know the s-, the sites of s-, scienti-, special scientific interest [1.
0] er [0.3] areas of outstanding natural beauty [0.3] nature reserves [0.9] 
that kind of thing [0.2] it was very much a mapping [0.6] exercise of the state 
of the local environment [1.3] at about the same time circa nineteen-ninety [1.
3] they also started to be a bit more thorough [0.3] about the local 
authority's [0.3] actions [1.0] 
they started undertaking environmental audits [0.4] of local authority policies 
[1.1] and practices [4.1] this is where i bring in my one of my overheads er [1.
2] yes [0.4] i've got a overhead which kind of [0.8] shows the er [1.4] what 
we're talking about here [1.7] this is a this is this is the sophisticated 
version [0.8] of what a er [1.0] environmental audit should be doing [4.4] this 
is er [1.1] like i say something that's been developed over time [1.1] the idea 
behind eco-audit is to appraise your policies and actions as an organization it 
can be a private organization like a developer [0.2] and developers have done 
these things as well [1.0] or a business like B-T or Shell [0.6] or a local 
authority [0.2] in this case [1.8] you need as part of the a start in the 
process you need to get that co-, corporate commitment [0.7] which is what 
these charters really did they sort of [0.3] put the thing on the agenda [1.6] 
you need to [0.5] er [0.4] review initial review of your environmental impacts 
of you policies and your practices [1.1] so the policies you have [1.1] the 
money you spend where you spend it [0.7] 
what impact does it have on the environment [2.8] you should and this again is 
a case of sh-, lots of shoulds in here you should produce an environmental 
policy [2.0] which kinds of maps out what you intend to do [0.7] what the 
objectives are of the council the local authority [2.4] you should specify that 
in terms of actions and targets [2.1] and then you kind of enter [0.2] you 
enter this circle this [3.8] benevolent circle of environmental care i guess 
you might call it [1.7] s-, having specified actions and targets that you are 
going to undertake as an organization [0.7] you gain corporate [0.9] management 
commitment through a a management programme to implement the policy [0.2] so 
you basically spread these targets these commitments these policies [0.4] 
throughout the organization you get them to sign up [0.6] to do things [1.4] 
like [0.9] increase recycling [0.3] locally or [0.6] to [0.3] er protect [0.9] 
all your nature reserves or to manage then improve those areas [0.6] so those 
are the kind of things you might include in there [2.1] you [0.2] undertake 
internal audits to 
check whether things are happening so you check that people are doing these 
things and that the the the the the targets are being met [1.0] you produce an 
environmental report [1.3] you [0.3] you can and you should [0.6] to be [0.3] 
er authorized un-, [0.2] through this get verification from an independent [0.
6] auditor [0.4] there's environmental auditors who can check [0.5] that [0.5] 
what you've done is correct [0.9] and you can register for [0.6] er [2.5] under 
the nati-, as a national standard that you have got the system in place and 
you're implementing it [0.5] and then you basically keep going around in 
circles [0.9] refining improving [0.5] developing new targets developing new 
policies to improve your environmental performance [1.3] that is the ideal [0.
4] kind of auditing system we're talking about [1.1] in the early days [0.6] 
local authorities [1.3] were not shall we say as [0.2] sophisticated in in this 
and they were basically just doing initial assessments [0.4] targeting and [0.
9] implementation processes [6.0] but [0.4] phase two [0.8] in the early 
nineties moved to phase three [0.9] phase three was [0.3] 
very much more using this [2.6] to produce an environmental management system 
[1.6] to try and [0.6] make this [0.2] a self-sustaining process [1.9] so they 
moved from [0.2] if you like [0.2] a partial auditing [0.2] process to a full i-
, [0.2] auditing process [1.0] and for instance namex [0.7] and i often use 
namex 'cause [0.3] for [0.6] namex Borough as an example [0.5] namex Borough 
implemented this kind of system [0.9] an environmental management system [1.4] 
for its er leisure services department [0.8] it's interesting that they haven't 
got much further than that [0.7] because it takes a lot of effort [0.5] to get 
these things up and running a lot of [0.6] political commitment and a lot of 
officer commitment [0.3] to actually run with these kind of things [0.6] to 
create a kind of e-, environmental audit [0.4] a management system [0.7] which 
is [0.2] self-sustaining [4.2] so stage three was if you like a more 
sophisticated version of the earlier [0.4] auditing process moving into [0.5] a 
management system which runs constantly [0.7] through the organization [2.8] at 
about the same time [1.5] this is sort of [0.3] ninety-two three 
four five onwards [2.2] in response to Rio [1.4] in ninety-two [0.9] local 
authorities many local authorities started developing their own Local Agenda 
Twenty-one [3.0] and you can see these two things in parallel [1.1] this kind 
of environmental audit and management system is very much looking at the local 
authority [0.7] internally it's an internal [0.3] organizational [0.2] tool [0.
7] for improving environmental [0.2] performance [1.6] Local Agenda Twenty-one 
is a more external [0.4] process [0.5] it is outside the local authority [5.7] 
it involves [2.3] engaging in [0.5] dialogue [1.6] developing [1.5] action [1.
2] programmes [0.6] with partners with the stakeholders [1.4] with community 
groups with businesses [0.2] with schools [0.5] with [0.6] other organizations 
[0.4] that are working living and operating locally [3.6] so you can see these 
two as linked [0.5] the environmental management systems [0.2] internal [0.7] 
to the organization [0.4] Local Agenda Twenty-one much more [0.2] external [1.
1] but basically [0.3] developing the same idea of trying to 
build action [0.8] programmes [0.7] policies and actions [0.3] to support 
sustainable development at the local level [2.4] there is i guess possibly a s-,
a phase five [1.1] in the la-, latter part of the er [1.4] nineteen-nineties 
[2.7] some new tools started being used more often [3.2] as part of this broad 
programme [1.1] things like sustainability appraisals were d-, being done [3.0] 
so [0.2] policies and pla-, plans and programmes [1.0] the local authority have 
like their [0.2] development plan [1.8] or their economic development strategy 
or their tourism strategy [0.7] or their housing strategy [3.9] were appraised 
[0.3] they were looked at [0.4] and checked [0.3] against sustainability 
criteria [1.8] at the same time [0.9] local authorities [0.6] started [0.2] as 
did the government started developing indicators in other words ways to measure 
[0.2] sustainable development [2.3] sometimes these were kind of technical [0.
4] you know energy efficiency [0.5] per [0.9] per housing [0.2] you you know [0.
2] in in relationship to housing units [0.7] or it could be mu-, much more er 
broad like [0.4] having fish [0.5] certain types of fish [0.4] in the river [0.
7] but that was a kind of indicator that things were getting better [0.6] that 
there were improvements in the environment [1.3] 
and also at the same time targets were being developed [0.4] so again [0.3] 
they were getting much stronger on developing targets [0.9] what are we trying 
to improve how much by how much [2.0] so [0.6] you could say that [0.2] the mid-
[0.2] nineties with [0.5] environmental management systems and local agenda [0.
8] rolled forward [0.2] into the current [0.2] century [1.0] developing some 
new tools [1.2] sustainability appraisals indicators and targets [0.3] to try 
and develop [0.2] this theme [3.8] [2.7] what i'll do is i'll just cover s-, [0.
4] in bi-, little bit more detail [0.3] some points about state of the 
environment reporting [0.3] and then we'll have a break [0.6] and come back and 
talk about Local Agenda Twenty-one [8.5] the rationale for state of the 
environment reporting [1.1] before developing an action programme [1.6] local 
authorities [0.3] need to identify it and quantify the nature [0.5] of [0.3] 
the environment or the environmental assets [1.2] and problems in an area [0.3] 
so in order to actually sta-, 
before you start taking action [0.8] in this sphere [1.0] you need to identify 
the state of the environment so that's the reason [0.4] for undertaking a state 
of the environment report [2.4] another [0.8] reason [0.2] why local 
authorities did state of the environment reports [1.3] was they saw it as an 
opportunity to start bringing in [0.6] outside partners [1.3] because in order 
to get some of this information and data [0.7] local authorities had to contact 
other organizations [3.1] and [0.6] particularly some of the environmental [0.
2] groups [0.8] Friends of the Earth [1.6] Royal Society for the Protection of 
Birds [1.2] Greenpeace [0.9] local environm-, er [0.2] wildlife trusts [1.0] 
had information that that was was plugged into this state of the environment 
report [0.9] so in that sense it also was part [0.7] of the process of going 
outside of the local authority invol-, starting starting [0.3] to involve 
people [2.3] there are numerous examples of state of the environment reports [1.
0] er [1.0] there is a [0.5] a kind of U-K [1.2] version [0.8] of state of the 
environment [1.2] it's basic-, the indicators [0.6] report done in 
nineteen-ninety-six [0.6] which kind of maps out the state of the U-K 
environment [1.6] there's there's been state of the re-, [0.3] environment 
reports done at city-wide level [0.2] LPAC [0.2] did one for London [1.2] to 
look at the state of London's environment [2.6] Hertfordshire [0.2] have got 
two a two volume [0.7] thick [0.2] state of the environment report [2.1] namex 
before it was abolished [1.8] namex just before it was abolished [2.6] produced 
a state of the environment report which was very thin [0.2] very short summary 
of it [3.2] do you want a [0.2] a handout to help you on your way [2.9] we're 
kind of er [0.5] oh we're actually only on we're only on number two 
sf1149: okay thank you [3.1] 
nm1148: [5.6] namex which which [0.2] namex Borough prides itself on its 
environmental performance and its [0.2] commitment to sustainable sustainable 
development [0.9] but they only produced a state of the environment report in 
nineteen-ninety-seven they were quite late [0.4] compared to many local 
authorities [2.2] but it's interesting the later state of the environment 
reports often include much more social [1.1] 
information s-, social data [0.7] so for instance namex's [0.2] has [0.2] 
chapters and indicators on social on the social environment [0.9] on economic 
development [0.7] and on health [2.1] so the later state of the environment 
reports started to spread out [0.2] into this [0.2] broader range of socio-
economic [0.5] information [3.7] [0.2] there are [0.3] a number of issues and 
problems [0.3] with regard to [0.8] undertaking these state of the environment 
reports [3.0] it takes time to produce them [0.3] it takes a lot of energy to 
get t-, the data together [4.5] and it takes resources [0.8] so many local 
authorities [1.0] haven't done a state of the environment report because of 
that problem [1.5] or like namex [0.9] delayed it until [0.2] late in the 
nineteen-nineties [2.8] some local authorities actually use consultants [0.6] 
to produce [0.4] state of the environment reports so they actually use 
consultants to do this job for them [8.8] so there are difficulties and issues 
around the time and resources required [1.3] there's another problem which is a 
a sen-, or ownership sustainable development is 
supposed to build a sense of ownership [0.3] you remember [2.2] and most of 
these state of the environment reports are prepared by the local authority by 
officers [1.0] a kind of technical exercise of collecting information [5.1] 
some like Humberside before it was abolished another county that was abolished 
[0.6] er [0.2] Humberside County Council used consultants to do it [1.0] but 
again there's a difficulty you're you're basically handing over the ownership 
of this process to outside [0.3] parties [2.3] in one at least one case er 
Gloucestershire [0.7] Gloucestershire County [0.2] got a [0.5] a forum of 
stakeholder groups together [1.6] an environmental forum and they [1.1] were 
the organization that produced the state of the environment report [0.3] this 
again was the [0.3] probably the best example one of the best examples [0.3] of 
trying to spread ownership and involvement [0.5] in this stage [0.7] by getting 
a range of stakeholder groups environmental groups businesses [0.3] community 
groups [0.4] to actually [0.3] put together this report helped [0.3] build [0.
5] this sense of 
ownership [1.2] but many like i say [0.8] ended up [0.3] being left on a shelf 
as a technical [0.3] exercise [3.3] another issue [0.2] was the range of issues 
that it incorporated [1.5] many of the early ones and [0.2] many of them 
generally concentrate on the physical environment [4.0] more recently as i 
mentioned [0.2] in the case of namex [1.1] they've [0.5] expanded [0.5] the 
kind of issues to look at what you might call the social [0.9] environment as 
well as the physical [0.3] natural envi-, environment [2.5] so so-, some [0.6] 
tackle [0.6] the environment in [0.7] in one way and some in oth-, in another 
[2.1] finally [0.6] questions can be raised about state of the environment 
reports [0.4] i should have brought a couple along to show you but [1.3] they 
end up often being a collection of facts [0.7] with little direction [0.7] 
they're really just a [0.2] a research [0.3] information collection exercise [0.
8] and once you've produced it you say so what almost [0.2] there is a danger 
of saying so what [4.0] certainly the best [2.0] local state of the environment 
reports were then used were then taken forward [0.9] as part of the 
environmental action programme [0.3] so they actually were [1.4] linked [0.3] 
to subsequent policies [0.6] and strategies that were being developed [1.8] 
Lancashire's er [1.1] environmental forum was a very good example of this [0.2] 
there's an environmental forum in Lancashire [0.5] and they produced a state of 
the environment report which was then quickly turned [0.4] into an action plan 
[7.8] in response to some of these issues [0.5] some local authorities are 
developing [0.2] more holistic [0.9] and more focused sustainability reports [2.
1] i mentioned Lancashire [1.7] they produced this initial acti-, er [0.3] 
state of the environment report which then influenced the policy making [0.3] 
then they did a second one they did a second green audit [1.4] which was a lot 
more focused around the policies that they were developing at the time [1.5] 
and also a lot more holistic it covered health [0.5] poverty [1.0] er [0.2] 
economic development et cetera [6.6] they also have been used again where 
they've been useful they've been used [0.9] often as a basis for then deciding 
on indicators [0.9] in 
other words [0.6] what what are the [0.2] having looked at the state of the 
environment locally what are the key things [0.6] in terms of what's going bad 
so they start l-, if you look over time some things [0.7] are water quality 
could be [0.4] in-, er be be decreasing [1.0] so they say right well that 
should be our k-, a key indicator [0.3] of environmental quality locally [0.4] 
so if they're used [0.2] in that way they can [0.2] lead on [0.3] to defining 
[1.0] a kind of indicators that [0.2] people w-, will then use to judge [1.1] 
improvements in the environment [4.0] so that is the state of the environment 
reporting i say a [0.2] a big surge of effort went in in the early nineties [0.
6] but the time and effort required to do it [0.5] led [0.2] to delays and in 
some cases led to [0.3] local authorities not bothering in to do one at all [2.
3] they some of them did lead on to i-, actions and some of them did lead in [0.
2] to Local Agenda Twenty-one processes and we'll have a look at that we'll 
just have a break [0.8] er [0.2] and then we'll have a look [0.5] at Local 
Agenda Twenty-one and the experience of local authorities in that area [0.4] so 
we'll have a break now for [1.7] five ten [1.4] ten [1.4] offers of ten [0.2] 
ten minutes [0.3] come back on the hour [0.8] probably take about half an hour 
through to finish up on Local Agenda Twenty-one [0.8] okay 
nm1148: 
thank you [0.6] er what i'll do is i'll just finish off [0.2] [0.2] this 
session [0.2] which has been looking at [0.4] local authorities [0.2] and local 
action [0.7] by [0.8] concentrating a little bit on Local Agenda Twenty-one [1.
0] er because this [0.2] is very much the [0.4] arena [0.8] where local 
authorities have put [0.4] a fair amount of action [0.4] er in the U-K [0.2] 
much more than other places we are [0.4] [0.2] in fact this is [0.2] some of my 
students here [0.5] er the post grads went to Baltimore [0.4] at er [0.2] 
Easter for a field trip it's a nice life doing a post grad isn't it [0.7] and 
er [0.6] we mentioned it we mentioned or sort of seemed to mention Local Agenda 
Twenty-one to a planner in Baltimore [0.7] and they'd just never heard of it [0.
2] so [0.2] in America Local Agenda Twenty-one [0.2] as a concept [0.8] has has 
very little [0.3] resonance [0.4] even though what they were doing in Baltimore 
[0.4] was very much what [0.2] local authorities in this country would call sus-
, er age-, Local Agenda Twenty-one [0.4] so it's strange that these concepts [0.
6] can be picked up and run with and given great prominence in one country and 
have 
very little [0.6] meaning in another [1.3] but [0.9] it has [0.3] er been a key 
issue in the U-K [0.9] it i sort of mentioned it's based on chapter twenty-
eight of Agenda Twenty-one [0.2] produced at Rio [0.9] er [0.3] i-, in that 
chapter it said [0.2] and i quote [0.2] [0.2] pardon me [0.8] er [0.4] by n-, 
[0.3] it said by nineteen-ninety-six it said by nineteen-ninety-six [0.3] most 
local authorities in each country [0.5] should have undertaken [0.4] a 
consultative process [0.5] with their populations [0.8] and achieved a 
consensus [0.4] a Local Agenda Twenty-one [0.5] for the community [0.7] so that 
was the that was the [0.2] that was the charge that was the challenge [0.5] of 
[1.1] Agenda Twenty-one from the Rio [1.6] conference [1.7] 
what's happened in the U-K [1.0] [0.8] well there's been a lot of activity [0.
4] er [1.0] this diagram which is attached as a little article [0.2] [0.4] 
which is an update on progress of Local Agenda Twenty-one [0.9] er this [1.8] 
diagram shows [0.4] that of [2.6] of last y-, [0.5] from la-, about last year 
[2.2] er [1.5] thirty-six per cent of local authorities had produced [0.8] a [0.
2] Local Agenda Twenty-one [0.2] an action [0.2] plan for sustainable 
development in their area [1.6] forty-five-point-two per cent [0.2] [0.9] were 
on target i er the target moved as all targets m-, they produced this target in 
nineteen-ninety-six [0.8] and that went by [1.4] er [0.2] and then they moved 
th-, [0.2] the goalposts and said right by two-thousand [1.0] er [0.7] all the 
local authorities should have produced a Agenda Twenty-one [1.2] in nineteen-
ninety-nine just before the deadline [1.1] forty-five- [0.3] point-two per cent 
were working towards it [0.2] [0.6] so you can see that quite a large 
percentage of local authorities [1.2] had produced or were [0.2] hoping to 
produce by two-thousand [1.2] a 
Agenda Twenty-one statement [3.5] [1.3] there were a number though with no 
commitment [0.5] no response [1.5] or [1.0] a c-, d-, definite commitment not 
to do one [0.8] [2.0] however that's [0.2] a s-, sizable minority majority i 
suppose sizable majority of [0.6] local authorities [1.0] have been working on 
it [0.4] [4.3] in terms of [0.3] oh boy [0.3] how local authorities have done 
this [1.0] er Steven Young and this again that's er er on the reference list 
Steven Young has done some research survey work looking at local authorities 
researching them [1.2] er done a [0.2] a kind of comprehensive review as as far 
as possible of the different approaches to Agenda Twenty-one [0.7] at the local 
level [1.2] and he's identified [0.2] [1.0] four basic approaches that local 
authorities have [0.2] have used [0.3] to produce [0.9] these [0.4] action 
plans these statements of sustainable development at the local level [1.0] 
firstly er a top down strategy [2.8] in which the local authority [0.2] [0.4] 
is firmly in control of the process [1.2] er maybe involves consultation [0.2] 
with er [0.5] inverted commas around consultation [2.2] involves some 
consultation with local 
community groups and local environmental groups but very much it's a local 
authority controlled [0.5] process [1.2] and as you can gather from what we 
said about [0.2] Agenda Twenty-one and Rio [0.7] that kind of process is really 
[0.2] not in line with the philosophy [0.7] of sustainable development as [0.4] 
proposed [0.2] at [0.3] the Rio conference [1.8] second approach has been [0.5] 
a limited dialogue strategy [1.4] er heavily top down from the local authority 
but with some flexibility [0.4] with some negotiation [0.4] and compromise [0.
4] from the local authority [0.8] on what's finally included or going to be 
included [0.6] in [0.3] these [0.6] local [0.6] sustainable development 
strategies [2.9] thirdly he identified a yes but strategy [1.1] this applies a 
bottom up [1.3] and relatively open process of discussion with local [0.2] 
community groups and others [2.5] but there are certain key policies certain [0.
3] key proposals [0.8] which remain non-negotiable [1.1] so in other words the 
local authority go to the local community and say right we want to produce this 
we want you to be involved [0.8] but [0.4] and this is 
the but [0.2] there are certain th-, certain things we're committed to we're 
committed to [0.3] building this road [0.6] or we're committed to [0.9] 
allocating this green field for housing development [0.3] or whatever [0.3] so 
they kind of set out the rules [0.4] before the start [1.6] at its worst form 
[0.5] it em-, it this this but [0.4] emerges during the process in other words 
they say oh we want to get your views we want you to be involved [0.6] and then 
people start get involved [0.6] going along to meetings or [0.8] making 
comments [0.3] and then suddenly the local authority turns around and says ah 
[0.2] no sorry but [1.3] so the worst kind is when they tell you halfway 
through [0.5] that this is er there is a but [1.6] but in its best form [0.2] 
and r-, reminds me of Islington when i used to work with Islington Council [0.
2] [0.5] they tell you beforehand they say [0.5] we're going to enter into 
dialogue we're going to involve people but [0.3] there are certain things we're 
not going to move on we are committed to equal opportunities [0.2] was 
Islington's but [0.6] er we are committed to [0.3] social housing [1.0] they 
had sort of [0.2] very good [0.7] right on P-C objectives [1.1] but that's [0.
2] so that's a kind of the best better form of it if they tell you before you 
start this process what the limits are what the goalposts are [0.3] at least 
the [0.2] people can say okay i accept that [0.2] or [0.8] or they won't join 
in [2.1] finally [0.4] er Steven Young [0.2] identified a bottom up strategy [0.
8] which is the ideal type [0.8] in relationship to Local Agenda Twenty-one [1.
3] it involves active engagement with a full range of interests [0.6] so you 
you are really open the gates [0.5] to bring in [0.2] the range of interests in 
your local area [3.2] you as an authority you listen [1.5] it's a listening 
process [4.8] you learn [0.2] you listen and then you learn [0.3] which is kind 
of the opposite [0.2] that what's what you're trying to do now and which i 
never do [0.4] being a lecturer an academic you never listen to people [0.7] 
you've d-, you develop the skill of talking [0.3] and telling people what to do 
[0.6] and then marking their essays on that basis [0.6] now i'm being cynical 
[0.8] er [1.4] it's [0.5] not necessarily leading the process but sharing [2.4] 
ownership with the partners in 
the process [1.9] so that's the ideal type that's [0.2] if you were doing Local 
Agenda Twenty-one as it's supposed to be done that's the kind of process you 
would [0.5] you would apply [1.2] also the local authority will be prepared to 
make radical changes to its policies and practices [1.9] as part of that 
process [0.3] so [0.3] if local p-, [0.4] stakeholders as part of this process 
of consensus building [0.3] arrive at a view that you should [1.0] you should 
build in the green belt [1.4] or that you should invest as much money as you 
can [0.7] in a [0.6] public transport initiative [0.5] then the council would 
say [0.7] yep [0.3] that's what we'll do [1.0] it's listening and responding [0.
6] again i g-, i go back to Baltimore because it's interesting [0.6] i'm the 
the post grads know about this but [0.3] Baltimore have just [0.5] produced a 
new plan for Baltimore Plan Baltimore which is a broad strategy [0.5] but 
they're actually ma-, the major part of their plan in Baltimore is to go to 
local community groups [0.6] so they've set up a whole series of community 
initiatives [0.6] to get local 
communities to come forward with ideas and proposals of what they want [0.2] 
locally [0.6] and the and the council have committed themselves [1.4] wherever 
possible to fund [0.8] those [0.6] ideas and initiatives [0.3] so it's the same 
thing [0.3] but they've never heard of Local Agenda Twenty-one in Baltimore [2.
6] the thing in the U-K [0.3] er [0.4] or or or certainly Steven Young's view 
[0.7] was that this had not been achieved in the U-K this ideal type [1.2] was 
not in evidence in the su-, in the survey that he looked at [1.2] but he did 
find evidence [0.4] that it was being developed that this kind of approach this 
open listening [0.5] responsive [1.1] non-dictatorial approach was being 
developed [0.5] so there was evidence [0.2] that things were moving that way [1.
3] [1.7] there are examples of this process [0.4] in fact there are there are 
examples at different levels and i will mention some [0.7] more strategic 
levels as well as the local level [1.2] in the U-K [0.6] this kind of [1.8] 
stakeholdering involvement has occurred at the national [1.1] the regional [0.
2] and the local level [0.9] at the r-, 
at at at the national level there is a U-K round table [0.2] on sustainable 
development [2.8] and [0.7] this round table has produced advisory reports 
which is supposed to feed in [0.2] to government policy so there has been an 
initiative at least at the national level [2.1] they produce reports on 
transport [0.5] housing capacity [0.3] energy [0.5] economic development [0.5] 
a range of reports [2.0] and [0.2] they are kind of monitoring government 
policy in that area to try and [0.2] change it to make it more sustainable [2.
9] at the regional level [0.3] i've been directly involved [0.2] with an 
organization called SERPLAN which is the regional [0.4] planning conference for 
the south-east of England [1.4] and as part of their new regional planning 
strategy [0.5] [0.5] they set up a sustainability panel [1.4] of stakeholder 
groups [2.5] including academics like me [2.6] which worked through [1.5] a 
series of initiatives [0.6] to try and make their regional strategy sustainable 
[1.0] and indeed eventually they called it a sustainable development strategy 
for the south-east [0.4] of England [2.4] ironically as you 
may or may not know that strategy then had [0.3] went through public 
consultation and er [0.4] public examination [0.5] where it got hammered [0.5] 
by the panel chair [0.7] who basically suggested that er SERPLAN's strategy was 
[0.5] well economically unsustainable i guess [0.7] er and criticized it quite 
heavily [0.6] however [0.3] the process [0.4] occurred there was this [0.6] rou-
, er round table a forum [0.5] where different interests were involved at the 
regional level [2.2] it's also occurred at county level i've mentioned 
Gloucestershire [0.2] with their regional their their county forum Lancashire 
had has got one [2.3] er [0.2] Hertfordshire [0.8] a number of other counties 
namex [0.3] the one we're in now had one [0.7] namex got abolished [0.3] a 
couple of years back as a county council but for a few years [0.3] from ninety-
four through to ninety-seven [0.6] it also had an environmental forum [0.9] 
where [1.2] these initiatives to try and make [0.2] the policies and practices 
of the council and the county [0.6] more sustainable occurred [2.0] there are 
there is an article which i think is on 
the reading list which i wrote looking at these examples [0.5] so you can look 
at more detail at what happened [0.5] when they tried to do these things [1.4] 
and finally [0.8] local level namex [0.7] namex is a good example [2.2] it 
prides itself on its [0.2] local sustainable development strategy [1.7] [sniff] 
[2.1] it [1.9] combines [0.4] corporate environmental management [0.2] doing 
those environment management systems with the council combines the internal 
stuff [0.4] with [0.4] an external programme [0.7] they divided up [0.2] their 
[0.3] Agenda Twenty-one [0.5] into three ways firstly they had a local age-, 
local authority Agenda Twenty-one [1.8] so in other words [0.2] that was 
screening the local authority so they had [0.8] environmental management 
systems [0.8] they had sustainability [1.0] reports and implications [1.0] they 
had various other initiatives [1.0] so that was the internal local authority [0.
2] Agenda Twenty-one [0.6] they had a business Agenda Twenty-one [0.6] they 
still have [0.2] in fact [1.0] i gave a talk to their business Agenda Twenty-
one meeting [0.4] er couple of months back at Green Park [1.4] which 
is engaging with business and trying to make [0.2] businesses in namex [1.0] 
more sustainable [0.6] things like green transport plans [0.2] which this 
university [0.6] is now implementing [1.4] kicking kicking and er screaming its 
way into [0.2] parking charges going up [0.4] which we all know about [0.3] and 
love [1.7] so there's a a business Agenda Twenty-one [1.2] and thirdly [0.6] 
there was a er neighbourhood [0.5] Agenda Twenty-one [1.7] which they called 
GLOBE [0.2] if you've ever seen GLOBE [1.1] Go Local on a Better Environment [0.
9] is it what it stands for go bet-, [0.2] Go Local on a Better Environment 
GLOBE [0.5] so they have about nine [0.5] GLOBE groups in namex [0.9] which are 
neighbourhood level [1.0] and in fact you are sitting in one of our [0.3] in 
one of the neighbourhoods 'cause the university has its own [0.4] GLOBE group 
[0.8] which i am a member [0.3] not a very active member of it these days [1.6] 
which i bet you don't know about do you [0.9] not many people know about this 
as they say but there is a university GLOBE group [0.2] which has made [0.7] 
undertaken some survey work on cycling and [0.4] made inputs on waste 
management and on transport [0.6] policy for the university [2.7] there's nine 
of those for different parts of namex [1.8] and [0.5] they have tried [0.2] [1.
3] the council have tried to facilitate [0.5] local [0.2] action so they've not 
[1.5] sort of [1.0] that's why it took so long to get the university g-, up and 
going because they didn't push it [0.4] but they kind of facilitated it [0.3] 
they often in particularly in the early stages of GLOBE groups they they 
obviously try and get [0.9] existing people who are active involved [0.9] and 
then they invite people to come along [0.8] but they often use consultants in 
the early parts [1.8] professional facilitators [0.9] to [0.4] to listen and 
develop [1.1] er a an action plan for the local community [2.0] 
er [0.3] two of the [0.4] the m-, two of the two or three of the m-, the early 
groups the early groups are the most active [0.2] well the most active [0.5] n-,
er Newtown [0.4] have been very active [1.0] er Battle in off the Oxford Road 
[1.0] have been active [0.9] Katesgrove [0.5] and Southcote [1.1] have been 
very active groups and Caversham as well [3.3] so there actually are these 
local neighbourhood groups and there's a there's a neighbourh-, there's a forum 
[0.2] the council [0.8] has a c-, has a forum [0.8] and that forum is is made 
up of all these [0.6] neighbourhood groups but they also have [0.2] councillors 
members the [0.2] the senior [0.3] members of the council [0.2] involved [0.3] 
senior officers from the departments of the council come along [0.5] and answer 
questions and feed information and receive [0.5] information [0.3] from the 
GLOBE groups [0.2] so they've they've been 
given quite a bit of prominence [1.0] in [0.9] in influencing the council [1.6] 
and they've fed in a number of initiatives [0.6] that the council have worked 
with [3.2] so you can see that [0.4] there are examples then of [0.2] of [0.3] 
these kind of [0.2] fora and stakeholder groups operating at different levels 
[1.8] in terms of the issues arising from them [1.1] er [3.4] we've we 
mentioned er there's been quite a bit of [0.3] of activity [0.2] [0.4] not a 
hundred per cent [0.3] but i think something like [0.4] seventy or eighty per 
cent of local authorities [0.4] have been involved [0.4] have developed these 
[1.7] the reality is that it's variable in terms of [0.3] bottom up [0.2] 
approaches [0.2] namex again i say is probably one of the better ones [2.6] but 
there are other good examples [2.4] they've used [0.7] quite a lot of 
innovation [1.8] they've used fora getting [0.4] workshops together they've 
built they've used consensus building [1.0] consensus building b-, b-, is based 
on the principle of win-win trying to negotiate win-win situations [0.7] so 
they're trying to build [0.4] an agreement and a commitment [0.7] to 
environmental policy and action which everyone can sign up to which benefits 
everyone [0.6] to try and resolve conflicts of interest [1.6] it was 
interesting er [0.3] in Lancashire for instance Lancashire [0.7] they spent a 
long time negotiating with major stakeholder groups [1.1] business and others 
[0.9] and they got to a stage where they could agree to about something like 
ninety-six per cent of the proposed actions in their plan [1.1] but there was 
there was still [0.2] er four per cent or so [0.2] of things that they couldn't 
get agreement on so they left it they kind of put it on the back burner and 
said right we're [0.3] we're not going to [0.7] er derail the process just 
because there's four per cent of issues here that people can't agree on [0.3] 
so they kind of put it on the back burner and they come back to it and they've 
come back to it [0.4] those issues to try and address them again [0.6] so there 
are ways of managing [0.2] this process of of conflict mediation [1.9] they've 
used visioning visioning has become a big thing in Agenda Twenty-one [0.8] so 
you i 
don't know [0.4] there's lots of little stories of you know [0.2] people 
getting together in village halls in in villages [0.5] and they pi-, they they 
they sort of almost wipe wipe your brain clean they say right clear your brain 
of everything [0.7] and let's [0.6] and create a vision [0.5] what do you want 
[0.2] your village or neighbourhood to be like [0.2] in twenty years' time [0.
7] so you kind of just clear it and say what way if you wa-, if you wanted an 
ideal vision of the future [0.4] what would it be [0.6] and they use that 
visioning as part of [0.3] the ob-, then the objectives well how do we get 
there [0.4] so they start working back and saying right what do we need to put 
into place to move towards that vision [4.2] they've done apprais-, village 
appraisals [0.3] they've done planning for real exercises planning for real is 
kind of er [0.2] getting community groups [0.6] into a room usually with the 
developers [0.4] and the planners [0.6] to negotiate and discuss [0.4] 
development proposals on particular schemes [0.5] so they run [0.3] again 
Islington have run planning for real [0.7] 
s-, er on on development sites on on major development areas [0.5] saying you 
know getting people together stakeholders saying what do we want to see on this 
[0.3] what's [0.3] what's viable [0.2] what's economic [0.5] what can we get on 
this [1.0] planning for real [1.1] [1.5] er [1.1] citizens' juries [0.3] and 
various other initiatives and if you look at y-, [0.2] er Steven Young's [0.3] 
report and there's a copy in the Resource Centre in Land Management [0.5] 
you'll see examples of these things [1.4] there has been difficulties in you 
know [0.2] the whole idea of Agenda Twenty-one is is to [0.2] di-, have 
dialogue in fact namex call their Agenda Twenty-one process [0.3] a dialogue 
with [0.2] the community with business [1.1] but there are difficulties in 
communicating [0.3] communicating having dialogue is not easy [2.0] there [0.2] 
there are problems because you tend to have the people that always join you 
have the green ghetto [0.4] might call it [0.2] people that are always involved 
in environmental issues [0.2] and the people that get involved in Agenda Twenty-
one [1.1] you want to try and [1.4] open up the process to 
those people who don't usually join in [0.8] i i've talked to the Agenda Twenty-
one guy at namex and he says well there's about [0.3] in each of each of these 
GLOBE groups there's probably about [0.6] maybe tops five per cent [0.4] maybe 
not [0.5] of the local population that's in that are involved in some way [1.1] 
but maybe about another thir-, about thirty per cent [0.3] have heard about it 
[0.9] obviously [0.4] not the thirty per cent in in the university here [0.6] 
but er [0.5] we're still talking about seventy per cent who haven't even heard 
about [0.4] what's happening in namex [0.3] despite that it's very proactive 
and it advertises itself and it has [0.4] puts it in the paper quite regularly 
[0.6] people just don't pick it up [3.4] er [2.1] there certainly is apathy [0.
4] people do not [0.4] want to get involved [0.7] don't want to be involved in 
this [0.7] don't care [0.2] in fact there was research done in Lancashire [0.9] 
er part of the Lancashire programme they they they actually interviewed they 
kind of [0.2] took [0.2] at random [0.3] people from the community [0.9] and [0.
3] got them into little workshops and discussed 
sustainable development [1.0] and many of them were [0.2] apathetic because 
they basically just didn't believe [0.3] they didn't have any faith [0.2] in 
local government [0.3] or big business [0.3] or the central government to do 
anything [0.6] there was apathy because they basically felt [0.5] they won't do 
anything [0.5] or it won't matter [0.5] 'cause it's all run from [0.5] 
Washington [0.8] or from global conglomerates who go on and [0.6] pollute the 
at-, pollute the atmosphere and the seas or whatever [0.5] so the-, there is 
apathy a large ap-, [0.2] element of apathy [0.2] in this br-, [0.2] in the 
communities [1.0] which which again is is just very difficult to break down [2.
1] there is social exclusion [2.2] 
sm1150: er [0.4] is with with all of them is there a problem of being a sort of 
a lack of direction as it gets more further and further away from [0.8] i mean 
er i'm wondering about the expertise of [0.5] er some of these GLOBE groups and 
now 
nm1148: yeah 
sm1150: i just thought [0.3] er if namex only put itself together
nm1148: yeah 
sm1150: er [0.3] is there do they put someone in a position who knows actually 
what's of the government's actually about or [0.4] 
nm1148: yeah well it well it well namex you know using namex as example as a 
good example namex don't want to define things they they don't want to [0.2] 
dictate [0.6] so they've allowed the local groups to define their own terms 
what this means for them [0.6] what it means for them [0.2] actually is very 
simple things like dogs' mess [0.8] you know that that [0.2] was the key 
issue [0.4] in Southcote [0.7] ward er [0.2] neighbourhood [0.6] was dogs' mess 
[0.4] that is sustainable development [0.8] you know and w-, [0.2] so if you 
look at it you think well is that [0.3] is that what sustainable development is 
about well [0.3] to them [0.3] it's important [0.2] so you can [0.2] they you 
have to work with their own definitions of what's important [0.7] also about 
direction [0.5] another problem and i don't know if i can't remember if it's on 
my list is is [0.2] local groups tend to think locally [0.4] they tend to see 
the world [0.6] in the neighbourhood [1.0] and so [0.4] namex have tried to 
introduce a transport [0.3] group [0.3] to think about strategic transport 
issues in namex [1.0] and they've had a very bad [0.6] response or a bad i'm 
sorry a very [0.7] limited [0.5] perspective from GLOBE groups [0.5] they just 
[0.3] don't see [0.9] the strategic issues [0.2] so you you you're right there 
are problems [0.4] about [0.5] well direction [0.7] vision [0.3] i suppose [0.
6] er and [0.3] and and and whether it really is about sustainable development 
or about [1.3] more mundane things i don't know it depends but you you've got 
[0.3] from namex's point of view 
they feel they got to respect [0.8] giving these people [0.8] er a their voice 
[0.3] to listen to them [2.3] er [2.8] social exclusion [0.7] many groups are 
again [0.2] apathetic because they've been excluded from decision making for 
years [1.1] and not listened to so they're not going to get involved [0.6] sh-, 
i remember when i was in Sheffield [laugh] [0.2] Sheffield did something like 
this they did a [0.3] they did a city centre plan for Sheffield back in 
actually back in well early nineties [1.0] and they wanted to e-, [0.2] engage 
with local groups who are normally marginalized so they they they [0.2] sp-, 
specified er Asian women [1.1] young unemployed [0.5] people [0.8] and a gr-, 
and various other groups that they wanted to have dialogue with and they set up 
they set up workshops [0.7] the young unemployed one [1.2] these young kids who 
were basically pissed off [0.4] about being on the dole [0.4] and getting 
nothing out of society basically smashed the place up [0.4] they just they 
smashed the they had they had er a fo-, a forum meeting or a workshop [0.7] and 
after sort of growling a bit 
because they didn't see what how this was relevant to their [0.3] needs this [0.
2] wh-, why do why do you wh-, why do you want some input on a [0.7] on a city 
centre plan when all's we need is a job [0.6] you know and and you've got to 
then got to convince people that this might lead [0.4] to a better economy and 
a better environment [0.5] but they basically smashed the place up [0.3] and it 
[0.2] fell apart [0.6] but that [0.3] you know if you're dealing it goes back 
to Baltimore [0.6] dealing with some of the areas that we were walking around 
in Baltimore must be very difficult to getting people engaged [0.6] given the 
conditions and issues that they're facing [1.8] so social exclusion [0.2] 
involvement of people [0.9] er [4.3] the [0.3] namex solution was to 
concentrate on real issues in other words [0.8] if dogs' [0.4] muck is the 
issue that people are worried about then let's deal with it [0.2] in other 
words let's build [0.3] from the bottom [0.2] you know [0.4] let's build 
awareness and and and involvement [0.5] if if [0.2] dogs' musk is the issue 
then they [0.2] they they say right well let's concentrate on it [0.6] so they 
as i say a lot of the initiatives in Southcote are are going round flagging 
dogs' muck [0.4] they have little flags they put [0.3] on the grass [0.2] 
identifying to show people how extensive this problem is [0.2] awareness 
building [0.6] so it's interesting you can start from very [0.5] mundane [0.2] 
but very important issues for people [0.9] and the hope [0.2] the hope again is 
that it then raises awareness [0.4] raises people's [0.4] er [0.9] eyes above 
the local [1.1] but it's been a problem [1.8] range of interests involved again 
er [0.2] well it goes back [0.4] it's very you know if you're if you're if 
you're a [0.2] officer [0.2] working for the council [0.5] and you want to 
facilitate a local [0.2] agenda process [1.1] you're you're likely to go to the 
people that are active [0.3] you know those are the people that have [0.4] 
shown interest in the past that are more prepared to get involved [0.9] and so 
you end up with a kind of [0.8] a list of acceptable [0.7] people [1.2] er [0.
4] so there's a danger you you therefore don't include or don't seek out [0.5] 
those groups that [0.2] that might cause trouble like unemploy-, well 
Sheffield were brave you know they kind of went right we're going to involve 
the [0.2] young unemployed of Sheffield [0.4] it failed [0.9] er [0.2] but 
certainly not many other other authorities would say ooh no way [0.6] you know 
we're not going to get into a dialogue [0.6] with er [0.4] people down this 
part of town or whatever [0.4] so it can be tricky [1.6] er [0.6] conflicts of 
interest [0.2] you know [0.4] we live in a [0.4] society with dif-, people have 
different interests and you have conflicts of interest [0.3] planning [0.5] has 
historically been about [0.7] mediating [0.3] conflicts between developers and 
residents between [0.2] environmental groups and companies [0.8] between 
neighbourhoods and other neighbourhoods or whatever [1.6] but there are some 
conflicts [0.6] like the ones in Lancashire that could not be resolved they 
negotiated they [0.4] built up consensus they had workshops [0.3] but still 
there was a a a small minority of issues or proble-, or policy [0.2] objectives 
[0.4] which were not agreed upon [3.1] so [0.2] in that sense there are some 
issues that [0.6] maybe cannot be resolved 
through consensus building [0.4] or certainly [0.3] take [0.7] er make it very 
difficult [1.5] coordination [1.2] i've just mentioned you know the tendency 
for [0.9] for local people to think local [laugh] [0.2] not think global 
[laugh] [0.9] they they g-, they think and act local [0.9] er [0.6] the thing 
about sustainable development [0.2] as Rio said is you need to take action at 
all levels [1.0] so if the people of namex [0.7] did have a problem with 
transport [0.9] then they've got to think about how that problem which level [0.
4] they need to a-, tackle it you know who do they lobby [0.3] or [0.2] argue 
for [0.3] if they want to push a transport issue they have to go to the 
regional level really nowadays [0.8] er they could go through the local 
transport plan but they need to think [0.7] you know strategically [0.5] and 
that's often a problem [0.7] also all these initiatives you know the local the 
county region and central they're not linked [1.1] the only way they are linked 
[0.7] is really [0.2] by certain individuals [0.8] who are who are members of 
each of these fora [0.9] but often they don't know the others exist [0.8] so 
you have these kind of different layers of [0.3] fora [0.7] but there's no 
linkage [0.2] SERPLAN when i was working with ser-, [0.2] SERPLAN on their 
strategy [0.8] we produced a participation strategy [0.2] and one of the key 
things wi-, within it was to try [0.4] and use [0.4] the local groups the 
county [0.2] particularly the county level [0.3] fora [0.7] to plug in as a 
kind of consultation mechanism [0.2] to [0.2] to get that feedback on the on 
the regional strategy [0.6] but it never really happened it never really worked 
it was never developed [0.4] so there's there is a fragmentation [0.6] between 
these different levels of [0.2] Agenda Twenty-one [0.3] stakeholder groups [3.
3] integration [0.4] we've talked about coordination between the levels [0.3] 
integration [1.1] the danger is and it's always been a danger in organizations 
[0.2] you give [0.3] you give a guy some [0.3] guy [0.4] the job title you're 
Agenda Twenty-one officer [0.3] there there there he is he sits there you we're 
doing the job we got a guy doing it [0.4] or a team doing it [0.5] but the 
thing about [0.3] the thing about sustainable development and Agenda Twenty-one 
is it it's got to permeate decision making [0.6] it needs to be integrated 
across [0.2] the organization [2.9] and you have problems 'cause people [0.6] 
doing their jobs [0.4] as they've always done their jobs [0.5] don't want to 
change the way they do their jobs they don't want to take on board these 
environmental [0.5] funny things [0.4] i remember i i did a project [0.2] er 
for the government [0.3] on defence estate looking at redundant defence estate 
[0.8] and [0.8] we had meetings with the mi-, Ministry of Defence who run [0.3] 
the defence estate [1.0] and [0.2] i did this paper for them [0.3] about 
environmental appraisal [1.1] and i said [0.3] you can look at the im-, [0.3] 
the defence estate in different ways and one way you can look at it [0.4] is to 
er have a sustainability or environmental appraisal of the development process 
that occurs redevelopment [0.7] and also you you have development appraisal 
financial [0.2] you know like [0.2] land mangers do [0.8] it's what la-, it's 
what surveyors do they do development appraisals [0.3] to to evaluate the 
market [0.5] viability of a development scheme [0.6] and this 
guy from the M-O-D said [0.4] i don't want to see environmental appraisal in 
the same paragraph as development appraisal that's a serious that's a serious 
appraisal that isn't that's Mickey Mouse appraisal [0.3] so that's the kind of 
attitude you can get [0.2] in an organization like the M-O-D [0.4] the Ministry 
of Defence [0.9] and in f-, in fact i was i was interviewing another guy [0.4] 
er [0.2] in one of the regions [1.1] in ninety-seven [1.6] five years after a 
report came out [0.2] in central government [0.4] encoura-, well [0.3] asking 
departments to do environmental appraisals [0.2] of their policies and 
programmes [1.0] and this guy said [0.3] oh someone's just realized we've got 
to implement this environmental appraisal stuff [0.5] and this is five years 
down the line they hadn't heard about it [0.6] so it hadn't intergra-, it 
hadn't integrated gone down to the bo-, the grass roots [0.5] so integration [0.
3] it's okay [1.0] having this commitment and policies but it's got to it's 
actually got to mean something [0.2] it's actually got to influence people's 
decision making [0.8] and often [0.4] people aren't prepared to move very 
easily 
nm1148: 
in Local [0.3] Agenda Twenty-one initiatives [2.4] or maybe [0.2] they think 
the environmental agenda is a threat [0.5] to their [0.2] economic interests 
certainly there are tensions [0.7] whether that it's a threat is another thing 
[3.0] but [0.2] the invo-, the involvement of business has not been very high 
it's been a problem [0.5] that's why namex [0.3] have their business agenda 
they said [0.2] they almost set it aside as a separate agenda [1.2] and it's 
only belatedly that namex have really started trying to get to grips with 
business [0.5] Agenda Twenty-one in namex [1.7] finally sustain the initiative 
[0.3] you know [0.2] back in Rio [0.4] they said by nineteen-ninety-six [0.9] 
we'll [0.3] local government will have had a dialogue with their communities 
and produced a s-, er agenda twent-, a Local Agenda Twenty-one nineteen-ninety-
six [0.5] so what do they do they have another conference in New York in ninety-
six and say [0.4] right we'll move the date two-thousand [0.8] we you know 
'cause nineteen-ninety-six has come and [0.3] not many people have done this so 
we we got to keep it 
going [0.3] so two-thousand now is the [0.2] is the new date you know we've 
just gone past that [0.8] what's going to keep it going again [0.3] you know 
there's a there's a danger here that [0.9] that people have sort of [0.9] done 
it [0.2] and it's gone [0.6] and the thing about sustainable development and 
about [0.2] Agenda Twenty-one is it it's supposed to keep going it's supposed 
to keep going in circles [0.9] the dialogue is supposed to keep going [0.3] the 
actions are supposed to keep greening practices [0.8] but it is difficult 
maintaining this [0.9] particularly when you have government [0.5] and local 
authority priorities go up and down you know the environment [0.6] was big in 
the ear-, [0.3] early nineties it sort of [0.5] dropped [0.7] during the mid-
nineties it's not picked up as well as it did before [0.4] you know you're 
fighting other priorities social e-, [0.2] exclusion [0.2] inclusion now [0.4] 
big agendas education [0.8] okay you can you can define education as 
sustainable 
development [0.6] but [0.4] there are [0.6] problems trying to keep [0.5] 
Agenda Twenty-one Local Agenda Twenty-one [0.3] in the environmental agenda 
keep going [0.4] luckily ev-, every so often we have an environmental disaster 
somewhere [0.2] even in Holland [0.5] where firework factories blow up [0.4] er 
and cause and people say well hey what's this going on [0.6] even in Holland [0.
5] which is supposed to have a fantastic environmental s-, [0.2] er regulation 
system [0.7] so you every so often you have a disaster which then puts it back 
on the agenda and they say oh yes we must you know we must tackle environmental 
problems [1.0] so that's what we got [0.2] we've got a [0.4] a a p-, [0.6] a 
substantial process [0.7] variable [1.5] quality [0.7] variable impacts [0.6] 
difficult to ke-, keep it going but it's still on the agenda [1.0] next week i 
think we're looking at the local economy [0.3] so very much looking at the 
business side of it [0.7] and how you might [0.2] have a green [0.2] economy 
what it might look like what vision [0.2] of a green economy [1.0] thanks very 
much
