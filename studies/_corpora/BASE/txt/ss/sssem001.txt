nm5067: okay is er everybody here 
ss: no 
nm5067: are we expecting some more 
sm5068: namex
ss: 
sm5069: namex
nm5067: is namex coming i don't think namex's 
sf5070: and namex 
nm5067: coming she's coming back at one she said 
sf5070: namex and namex
ss: 
sm5069: namex the tall one 
nm5067: okay we'll start without namex 
ss: 
nm5067: yeah yeah 
sm5069: they're going to be embarrassed i'll tell you 
nm5067: they're going to be 
sm5069: be embarrassed i'm telling you 
nm5067: why is that 
sm5069: i don't know i'm just joking 
sf5071: 
sf5072: 
yeah she's always joking 
nm5067: right er okay well i'll start because er i'm going to have to go very 
quick today because we've only got an hour and really i usually do a two hour 
session on this 
sf5070: all right yeah 
nm5067: so er i'll just explain what i'm not going to do er and then maybe i'll 
say what i'm going to do er first of all oh don't worry about these cameras 
here i'm not going to do anything to do with cameras these are here purely for 
my own project er i'm doing a project where i'm creating a C-D-ROM so 
essentially i'm a materials writer 
sf5073: c-, is it Cognis 
nm5067: it's it's not going to be called Cognis but that's one of its early 
names er so i write materials and i develop materials but i do them mostly with 
video based er electronic materials er and you're all welcome to have a go on 
my C-D-ROM when it's finally ready which it it may not be for a while er so 
today er right the cameras are here for nothing to do with the talk what i'm 
going to talk about is er using video clips er i suppose just for for English 
language teaching purposes er i'm not exactly sure of the profile of your group 
and even this course because i was only invited to give a talk er quite 
recently and er i believe it's to do with materials writing 
sf5070: yeah 
nm5067: yeah okay well er unfortunately i don't have examples of materials 
writing with me or anything like that er but what i will do is show you lots of 
clips suggest some ideas of how they might be used in the classroom and then 
let your brains do the thinking of how you might apply that kind of oral 
situation we've got today to actual materials production okay er are you er 
experienced classroom teachers or 
sf5070: yeah 
nm5067: trainee teachers 
sm5068: experienced 
sf5070: experienced 
nm5067: experienced okay so you know quite a lot about methodology and so on er 
okay that's good to know right have you used video before in your classrooms 
okay well if this is is too simple for you never mind okay er now er as i said 
i'm going to have to go very quickly because er i want to show you lots of 
clips and suggest lots of things er one thing i always think is er i mean 
people always say in in the literature it always talks about motivation and 
video being a good motivation and i think that's true but er that that only 
works up to a point i think you know if you choose your materials carefully of 
course you'll be er er perhaps choose exciting and interesting materials you'll 
probably help keep the motivation but er i think you also need to er think 
about c-, er creating tasks around any kind of clip er i know the lazy man's 
way or lazy woman's way is you know okay i've got a class today let's show them 
a video you know and maybe we'll talk about it at the end or something er 
that's probably not what i'll be doing today anyway although i will be showing 
you lots of little clips from films now just to increase the motivation 
okay er i'm sure you're all highly motivated intelligent people er you haven't 
been ground down by namex and the course yet you know er but just to increase 
it er well i'd like you to be kind of i mean play along as guinea pigs today if 
you like er to be the students i know you are students but er you know you can 
er i-, er well i'll get you to take part in the tasks that i set rather than 
simply talk about them from the theoretical point of view which would be very 
boring actually er and hopefully through the experience of doing things this 
will give you a more concrete feel of of what things are about so you may find 
yourself doing some very simple things today but tha-, that's okay you'll be 
your your er rational brain will be thinking about applications and so on er 
perhaps one more thing i'll do just to er just to make it even more exciting if 
that's possible er now do we have some chalk we do er to add to the er yes the 
excitement er we'll turn the whole w-, hour we've got an hour into a a 
competition so 
sm5069: 
is there going to be a conflict 
nm5067: there will i like conflict yeah er no there'll be no conflict you know 
sf5071: any prizes 
sm5069: i can handle conflict 
nm5067: er you'll get the well i don't know about prizes er 
ss: 
nm5067: er you might get you might get to see yourself on video er er at some 
stage in the future you know er 
sm5069: are we going to be in the video in the future materials you going to 
produce 
nm5067: you never know it's possible er 
sf5070: you're going to be 
nm5067: so could we have anyway could we have three teams and we'll just run 
things just to add to the you know the excitement and the motivation so four 
here four at the back and four here okay that's dead simple 
sf5070: all right perfect 
nm5067: er can you give me a name for your team 
sf5070: Sangbok 
nm5067: how do you spell that 
sm5074: Sang S-A-N-G 
nm5067: S-A-N 
sf5070: yeah yeah 
nm5067: G S-A-N-G-B-O-K 
nm5067: Sangbok 
sf5070: B-O-K 
nm5067: middle line 
sf5071: 
you need a pro-, er proper name one of our names 
nm5067: any name any name you want no no a name for your team you can be your 
name somebody else's name anybody's name 
sf5070: we will change 
nm5067: at the back 
sm5075: Alright 
nm5067: Alright 
ss: Alright 
nm5067: how shall we spell it let me write this over here Sangbok we'll spell 
it the American way 
sf5071: the Four Musketeers 
nm5067: okay 
sf5070: sorry we can we change our name ah can we change our name Jumping 
Bananas 
nm5067: Jumping Bananas 
sm5074: yeah 
nm5067: right right now in a-, in the course of this er session i will er award 
points okay just to add to the excitement as i said i will award points i mean 
er in the spirit of i suppose a post-modern quiz er purely and utterly 
according to my own whims and prejudice with no regard whatsoever to your 
talent or abilities okay er imaginative answers will of 
course be rewarded right let's get to look at the material let's think about 
material er right one of the beauties of video er and as i said i'm only going 
to talk about one little element which is video clips recorded off movies or T-
V okay er but one of the beauties about using video in the classroom is that er 
you can manipulate sound and image er you don't necessarily er need to use both 
together so the first thing i'd like to do is do a very standard kind of 
language exercise i'm going to play i'm going to use this as if you like a tape 
recorder i'm going to play you a little clip and i'm going to ask you to do one 
thing very simple er two things perhaps er write down any greetings you hear 
okay and then suggest a possible situation okay so write down any greetings 
suggest a possible situation i'm just going to play this bit and you're not 
going to see it okay ow electricity 
nm5067: okay give me a greeting Bananas 
sf5071: Jumping Bananas 
nm5067: Jumping Bananas greeting quick 
sf5076: morning 
nm5067: morning 
sm5074: morning 
nm5067: okay i'll give you a point for morning anything else 
sm5074: what's new 
sf5071: what's new 
nm5067: what's new okay you both teams shouted out so i'll give you er i'll 
give you a point each for that er can you suggest a situation doesn't e-, i 
mean even if you know the film it doesn't have to be the right one just a 
possible one an imaginative one 
sm5074: public toilet 
nm5067: public toilet 
sm5074: it's what he said 
sm5069: that's not very competitive 
nm5067: okay er i won't ask okay 
sf5077: aquarium 
nm5067: an aquarium i think er er we'll we'll give public toilet er three 
points for silliness we'll give er we'll give two two points for intelligence 
for aquarium 
sf5073: the Four Musketeers 
nm5067: oh you 
sf5077: we're the Four Musketeers 
nm5067: oh you're the Four Musketeers okay 
sm5074: two points 
sm5078: riverside 
nm5067: river riverside 
sm5078: or by the sea seaside 
nm5067: riverside by the sea okay i'll give that two as well okay all quite 
rational intelligent guesses 
sm5074: hot spring spring 
sf5070: hot springs 
sm5074: yeah hot spring in the mountains 
nm5067: oh okay well you've given you three points so you're all right 
sf5070: yeah yeah that's okay yeah yeah 
nm5067: yeah okay i'll show you the real situation okay 
sm5069: we're looking forward 
sm5074: exciting 
sm5069: there's lots of fish on television white fish lovely fish 
nm5067: okay we'll leave it there i mean i w-, i okay of course that was very 
simple for you er 
but you know something like greetings with beginners' class you know a nice way 
of presenting it 
ss: yeah 
nm5067: something a little bit entertaining er now i said i'd go fast and i 
will go fast er so we'll get straight onto the next clip er now it's usual 
actually i suppose you know this from general language teaching methodology 
before you do anything you might set questions and so on i mean i it's 
generally a rule i mean er but we can break the rules if we want of course er 
now rather than using this as a listening box which is probably what most 
teachers tend to do or maybe i'm being unfair to teachers er i think we can use 
it to produce er or stimulate creative thinking if you like so that's what i'll 
do here now i'll show you a clip and at the end this time i'll ask you a 
question okay 
sf5070: yeah 
nm5067: this is about five minutes long five or six minutes it's a nice little 
piece of video so enjoy the video i'll ask a question at the end just take note 
of what's happening i'll have the lights 
off for this 
nm5067: right 
sm5069: so scared 
nm5067: now er 
sm5069: what happened to the girl 
sf5071: 
nm5067: well the question is of course what happens next that's the question 
i'm going to ask you i'll give you two minutes exactly to come up with the most 
imaginative answer okay 
sm5069: we want an imaginative one okay 
nm5067: a good solution to the problem okay 
nm5067: right we've got one answer from the Four Musketeers or the Three 
Musketeers as they are now 
sm5069: can you please be quiet can you please be quiet er the Superman comes 
flying by 
nm5067: yeah 
sm5069: and gives the woman and the man er Bombay mix and they become strong 
and then they escape 
nm5067: okay er 
sm5068: one point 
nm5067: yes er what were you what were you taking last night er we'll give 
three points for that 
sm5069: thank you 
sf5073: for the silliness 
nm5067: well 
sm5069: for the imagination 
nm5067: no i mean i like the idea yeah it's an invasion by another genre isn't 
it you know er we could call it 
sm5069: don't insult my genre 
nm5067: do we have a solution anywhere else at the back you need those points 
sm5075: earthquake 
nm5067: an earthquake and what happens does the girl die i mean does 
sm5075: er the man standing falls down and yeah 
sm5079: all three fall down 
nm5067: oh 
sf5071: how sad 
nm5067: and 
sm5075: and er the end 
nm5067: keep going and the end well it started well i was you were going to get 
a lot of points for that but we're are you Alright yes they are Alright aren't 
they so we'll just give two points for that at the front 
sf5070: a U-F-O appears 
nm5067: a what a U-F-O 
sf5070: a U-F-O yeah appears 
nm5067: oh invasion by the science fiction genre now 
sf5070: and take away the the couple away 
nm5067: yeah 
sf5070: probably take all of them together and then the then that's the end 
nm5067: and that's you know Star Wars Two or something 
okay er i'll give that er er two points as well okay well done er now obviously 
i mean er we're just having a bit of fun there but i think something like that 
could lead to some er a fruitful piece of creative writing you know what 
happens next write the story yeah er use an you know a good piece of er y-, you 
know homework writing activity something like that i mean you can even get 
students of course to say what happened before this sequence so you can get 
developing er narrative skills if you like er from an exci-, exciting and 
stimulating bit of video er so story construction let's go fast because as i 
said we don't have much time er i did say that that one of the beauties of this 
is that you can manipulate sound and image so this time i mean last time you 
heard the sound but you didn't see the image this time you're going to see the 
image and not the sound okay so i'm going to play you a little bit like that er 
now what you need to do during this excerpt note down er the main characters 
er you can give them a name if you want it doesn't have to be the real name you 
know whatever name you want er and take notice of the action because at the end 
i'm going to set you a little task to do okay so characters and action who who 
are they and what do they do okay just just for memory for the task at the end 
okay you won't hear the sound this time so you'll be guessing slightly oh you 
sorry by the way you haven't seen the end of that sequence 
ss: no 
nm5067: i'll show you that first we'll sh-, we'll watch that first you'll see 
what really happened in the film some of your ideas were perhaps better 
nm5067: the U-F-O was better 
nm5067: oh but does she escape a bit of unnecessary suspense that actually er 
it's coming i think 
sf5070: is it Hitchcock 
nm5067: yeah Hitchcock i mean only Hitchcock can get away with that that kind 
of editing he just changes the scene completely you know he was a genius er y-, 
your ideas 
were a little more off the wall i don't know if they'd quite make Hollywood but 
he cheated too in a sense but great directors can cheat er yeah Hitchcock of 
course yeah right let's get back do you remember what i said note down the 
characters and the action er this time it'll be silent oh do you need a light 
okay we'll leave the light on 
sf5070: oh Braveheart 
ss: Braveheart 
sm5074: Braveheart right 
sf5070: i've never seen this 
nm5067: okay now the task i would normally ask you to do i'm not actually going 
to ask you to do it today because it it would take too long we've only got a 
short time but what i would normally ask if we had more time i'd ask each group 
to write the dialogue for the scene okay and then i would get you to come out 
here somewhere and actually act it out and perform it er and i i g-, i i would 
do that today if we had more time but we don't so i'm not going to 
ss: 
good 
nm5067: so you've escaped a little luckily er but a-, actually i think you know 
the the er constructing a dialogue and and er it's quite difficult if you 
actually sat down and and tried to do it you you know you have all the er er 
potential there you've seen kind of the narrative you don't know what they've 
said er i think it's a good activity and especially the performing in public is 
good for er er students who may be a bit reluctant to at first like yourselves 
no doubt er but we don't have time for that so er er you've escaped from this 
task okay er i'll show you it with the sound now and just just listen to what 
it actually was er 
nm5067: okay er one thing perhaps you didn't pick up on there because you 
hadn't done the activity was i think the fact that students will listen very 
much more intensely to something that they've watched before and then but 
perhaps not heard but then er done some sort of activity around their their 
interest is stimulated and then they want to hear what the 
real thing is and you get much more intense listening than you would do on a 
straight showing of of something er okay we're moving on fast er now i i mean 
another potential of this er box is that you can er show something to some 
students and not to others so you get the information gap type er situation er 
which is what i want to do now and then i'll i'll do a little activity and then 
we'll er do something afterwards okay er i need a volunteer for each team for 
this okay do you want to come out another volunteer 
sf5077: come on namex 
nm5067: and one from the back right what i'm going to do i'm going to show 
these three students an excerpt you can hear the soundtrack if you want okay 
then you'll get the chance to ask them some questions afterwards about the 
excerpt er now you three must not say a word i'll tell you the rules in a few 
minutes you just watch and remember okay and then they'll ask you some 
questions at the end 
it's not on wheels this one unfortunately can you see are you sure right no 
cheating no cheating okay you can't see a reflection in your your glasses can 
you 
sm5069: namex we count on you okay 
nm5067: no you can come round here and watch properly okay right now you 
mustn't say a word just watch and take it in you can listen to the soundtrack i 
might watch too remind me what it is 
sm5069: your facial expression 
nm5067: okay thank you guinea pigs er now 
sm5069: it was more interesting to look at their faces 
nm5067: i'm sure it is yeah now what i want you to do now don't say anything 
don't talk to he he's on the other team don't talk to him er now what we're 
going to do is er a qui-, a quick game of twenty questions you'll get some 
points up here now these people can only answer yes or no so you must ask yes-
no questions so you can't ask a question like what happened okay if if you ask 
that 
i'll knock a point off but you could ask a question like are there any people 
in the excerpt for example er and they can answer yes or no of course er a-, so 
we won't have twenty questions we'll have er about five questions okay and then 
i'll ask you to work out what happened question from the first team question 
sf5076: is it horror film 
sf5077: no 
nm5067: question 
sm5069: is it proper for for children under eighteen under er sixteen years old 
sm5080: yes 
sf5070: can all each of us can answer 
nm5067: oh yeah yeah if you want to say no you can say no i mean he said yeah 
okay at the back 
sm5078: how many people were in 
sm5075: no no no no 
nm5067: point off we'll knock a point off that becomes one 
ss: ah 
sm5080: what did he say 
nm5067: he didn't ask a yes-no question you see did he okay another question 
here at the front 
sm5074: er is it for secondary 
school children 
sf5070: i think yes 
sf5070: could be yes could be no yeah could be yes could be no 
nm5067: here 
sm5069: is it at home 
sf5077: yes 
sf5070: yes 
sm5080: yeah 
sf5081: does it happen indoors 
sm5080: yes 
sf5070: yes 
nm5067: another question it's indoors anybody can ask questions yeah 
sm5069: are there any animals involved 
sf5077: no 
sm5080: no 
sf5070: yeah er no no 
nm5067: a question at the back 
sm5075: is there anyone doing exercise 
sf5077: yeah sort of 
sm5080: exercise 
sf5070: yes yes yes 
ss: 
nm5067: one more question each team and then i'm going to ask you to tell me 
what happened one more question from the front 
sf5076: are they children the actors 
sf5070: no 
sm5080: no 
sf5077: no 
sf5071: are they sort of playing a game or competing between each other 
sf5077: no 
sf5070: no 
sm5075: is there anyone taking a shower 
sf5077: no 
sf5070: no 
nm5067: okay let's stop there now normally i'd give you a few more but as were 
pressed for time now each team i'll give you thirty seconds and i want each 
team to tell me what happened in this clip 
sm5069: how can we know 
nm5067: well from your questions you see they've given you lots of information 
you know they're not children there there are some people it's that use your 
imagination if not 
nm5067: 
okay i'm going to have to ask you 'cause i said we were very pressed for time 
today at the front can we have an answer can everyone listen 
sf5076: they are doing some exercise indoor but they are doing it in a weird 
way rather than a normal way and like including painful way funny way or 
nm5067: okay so some people are doing some sort of strange 
sf5076: yeah 
nm5067: i'm going to give that three points i think that's quite a good one 
three points for the Jumping Bananas right now here what do you think they're 
doing at the back next yes let's take them at the back 
sm5075: yeah a man swimming and met a girl and er kiss and er 
nm5067: i think well give them four points 
sm5069: a couple is moving furniture 
nm5067: a couple are moving furniture 
sm5069: yeah 
sf5071: i mean very heavy furniture 
struggling with it 
nm5067: like in Laurel and Hardy or something okay i'm going to give that three 
points too er okay now i'll show you what really happened thank you very much 
ladies and gentlemen you'll see what really happened 
sf5077: at the front i'm not saying anything 
sf5070: at the front just wait till you see it 
nm5067: okay er 
sm5069: excuse me where are the animals involved 
nm5067: no he said there weren't any animals 
sf5070: Trainspotting 
nm5067: well i mean i thought your answers were pretty good considering er the 
difficulty of that i mean what of course you have been doing is n-, you haven't 
been watching a man diving into a toilet searching for drugs you've been 
practising question forms and obviously if you were doing introducing question 
forms or practising them with students then to have a stimulating piece of 
video i-, is probably more interesting than opening 
a b-, a grammar book okay er of course normally we we would we would have ve 
gone on much longer with the yes-no question forms er right were moving on oh 
gosh were running out of time i want to show you at least two more clips er now 
one thing i do with students sometimes er very simply is er just choose 
something from a fairly recent Hollywood movie some popular movie that i think 
maybe the students have watched or maybe they'll know somebody in there er and 
then ask them some questions on it i mean just general knowledge make a little 
quiz i mean we're doing a macro quiz if you like er but a a micro quiz a quiz 
on purely on the excerpt so that's what i'm going to do with you just very 
quickly so i'll play you an excerpt from a film watch it carefully try and 
notice everything that happens and then i'll ask you some questions both 
general and specific afterwards okay 
nm5067: hang on i'll just stop it there for the moment now er we'll stop there 
for the moment a chance 
to gain a few extra points i'm going to ask er two or three questions er and er 
i'll do it team by team okay first team er can you name one of the actors 
sm5069: Brad Pitt 
nm5067: Brad Pitt okay a point for Jumping Bananas for two points can you name 
one of the other two actors 
sf5077: yeah i forgot his name oh my God 
sm5075: Morgan Freeman 
nm5067: Morgan Freeman we'll pass it over the back two points for the 
Musketeers 
ss: no 
nm5067: er Alright er does anyone know the other actor the psychopath 
sm5069: Gwyneth Paltrow well the her head the box Gwyneth Gwyneth 
nm5067: we'll er i'll i'll ask that in a minute okay shout out this for for one 
point whoever shouts first wins the title of the film 
sm5069: Seven 
sm5068: Seven 
sm5080: Seven 
nm5067: Seven i think they got it first at the front one point for Jumping 
Bananas er now another point to what shout it out to what religious phenomena 
does Seven refer 
sm5068: 
the seven crimes in the Bible 
sm5069: seven 
sm5069: it's the 
nm5067: seven crimes in the Bible i want the exact phrase

sf5071: the what 
sm5069: how many days the 
sm5075: the seven seal the seventh seal

nm5067: nobody know nobody know 
ss: 
sf5071: of er John 
ss: 
sm5069: the world was made in seven days 
nm5067: maybe but er that's not what the the the film the title refers to i'll 
tell you no points for that then the seven deadly sins 
ss: oh 
nm5067: okay the seven deadly sins now for a point each can you name me any of 
the seven deadly sins shout them out

nm5067: okay now i'm going to show you one more clip but we we don't have time 
to do the activity that i want you to do around it this this will be the last 
clip i'll show you this next clip what i uysually do is another information gap 
activity where i get some people to watch it silently this time and then do a 
kind of party game that er in er here in in England 
we call it Chinese whispers i don't know why but we call it Chinese whispers 
you know it when you whisper you whisper something in someone's ear and they 
whisper it er and the idea is that again there's another information gap but 
also the students will be speaking in English of course to their the person 
next to them and so on and then the person at the end will say what happened 
okay now we don't have time for that unfortunately er but it's a fun game it 
also gets a lot of speaking practice er but i'll show you the clip anyway good 
one for students of language i think this next clip one of my favourites 
nm5067: okay er i-, i mean it is a good activity especially if you watch it 
without the sound you don't know what's happening and you get some very 
interesting answers from students look we're running out of time so what i'll 
do is i'll give you er just a handout which just will remind you of some of the 
things
