feeling alright about the presentations you probably haven't done anything yet 
have you [laughter] 
su: 
nf5395: right er who's the Latin America group
su: 
nf5395: do you want another book or not just got another book if if you can't 
face it you don't have to have it
sf5397: well i think we better have it better to have it than not it doesn't 
mean we have to 
nf5395: no absolutely right you don't have to read it
sf5402: er for the India er group have you got any books 
nf5395: oh yes i've got some more books for India yeah er 
sf5402: have you given any books we'd like
nf5395: yeah i i have given books
sf5397: it doesn't have your name in it this one i'm afraid 
nf5395: hang on just got to write that one down namex er the India group Eva 
and Nina er i've given er i've given i think i've given one book and about 
three articles but i've got some more i've got two more books er those two this 
is historical but this one goes up to nineteen-ninety er and then i've also got 
this is really interesting it's er it was written by a woman who was subjected 
to domestic violence and she set up a kind of er a movement and subsequently 
became a lawyer a lawyer in Bombay so er it's really you know it's about her 
experiences er and this is really interesting it's by er and it's called why do 
i not call myself a feminist er and she gives all the reasons you know what the 
problems with western feminism are for for er activists in India er and then 
this this er there are some replies in the letter section of the same journal 
er you know taking up a different position so there's a reply by and various 
other people so i copied that so who would like do you want those and who wants 
to be responsible for them i'm going to make responsible for them because she's 
in in up my department ok Eva so right so you're responsible for these four 
things okay do not write in them do not turn the pages down do not lose them
sf5396: you're scaring me [laughter] 
nf5395: yeah i know i'm trying to scare you oh i just er photocopied a few a 
couple of things from this this was Sunday's Independent on Sunday er and i 
photocopied the front page which was about climate change the climate change 
conference er which basically failed to achieve its er i don't know how you're 
how you're gonna pass that over oh Lord and this is er an article from the 
London Review of Books about the World Trade Organisation conference er any 
that one you have to read that you have to read it down the page it's very big 
it's you know A three and so you have to read two pages of columns down you 
have to keep flicking between one page and the next now these are course 
reading forms so er i'll give them out today can you please fill them in and 
bring them back next week and don't forget because these are really important 
to us i mean er first of all we have to actually present them to our examiners 
but secondly they're just really important in helping us to improve the course 
each year so please please you know regard them as really serious feedback 
because we take notice of them er and i and i would please bring them back next 
week but i would like somebody to take responsibility for chivvying and urging 
your colleagues to remember to bring them back so who would be willing to do 
that come on who's willing to do that you'll get extra special credit for doing 
that [laughter] thank you Kathleen i didn't say what sort of credit 
su: my exercise for the day 
nf5395: yes right er so we're doing gender and globalisation today and er i 
suggest that we have two groups this time so is that ok er maybe some latecomer 
will arrive in which case we'll set up another group er so let's go straight 
into the into the group discussion and er well are you happy to have a group 
here and a group there ok so but please move round because er you can't talk in 
straight lines 
sf5397: the weakening of the state and the breaking down of the barriers 
between nation states that division disappears 
sf5396: but what i mean is is that 
sf5397: ok so but but the result of distinguishing between these two levels in 
the end 
sf5399: 
sf5397: what there ceases to be such a division 
sf5399: yes 
sf5396: yeah ok that's fair enough but er there's less of a nation state but 
the thing is that's something else that's interesting is that er that the 
theory is that but in practice it's more of an international sort of 
development rather than global as such it's about communication between nation 
states it's not actually you know nation states still do a certain amount of 
talking 
sf5397: yes but it was thought to it was going to 
sf5396: the theory behind it 
sf5397: yeah the theory behind it is some kind of global government group 
sf5396: yeah
sf5399: when some one country do this it's affect the other countries because 
if you decide that nation nation nation state nation nation state is only one 
countries when this last last world war second world war was it changed 
globalisation 
sf5396: did anyone ever say specifically when it they never do do they 
sf5397: it is a nineteen-eighties trend isn't it but er 
sf5396: product of er globalisation 
sf5397: yeah it's a without without without the internet without the global 
network i don't know if it's 
sf5396: transportation
sf5397: that's it
sf5396: we wouldn't be able to fly to Australia
sf5399: 
sf5397: exactly and information the thing is i mean like transport of food 
actually i have never seen it how does all that food come does it just come on 
planes with just fruit i don't know like lorries
sf5396: 
sf5397: yes but they are but i think still they are travelling i mean like 
cheap package tourism started during the sixties yeah i mean they're sort of 
drawn into the consumer er pressure 
sf5403: and yeah the western countries have also have to implement the 
structure for them as well and it means that cutback of the social spendings 
and everything
sf5402: er yeah as far as the women are concerned 
su: 
sf5402: er yeah they do create jobs and they do give more independence on the 
other hand it's basically ok here is er ok this bit 
sf5401: 
sf5402: no in different parts of the world 
su: what are you looking at 
sf5402: and women were taken as as er very elastic labour like that you could 
hire and fire as you want yeah as you want yeah but also in their domestic 
environments because it means they do get paid but on the other hand the values 
still have to be regarded as patriarchic yes that's right a lot of er 
organisations were created by woman or women and these women were very much 
involved in those organisations plus the job plus their roles inside inside the 
house but the point is that men if they get that paid jobs isn't as highly 
valued as a public one 
sf5401: is it their choice 
sf5402: stay home or do both right
sf5400: it has been said that in terms of benefits particularly into financial 
benefits there aren't any because they're paid so low
sf5402: yeah
sf5400: and that's that's the whole thing with globalisation is that the impact 
on the so called is that it's post colonialism i can't describe it in any other 
way because all they do is to partake for them that the globalisation has been 
they call it of the markets and it is because it allows them to go in and 
exploit the workers' means so for instance Marks and Spencer's Marks and 
Spencer's renowned itself on being British and always because everything they 
made was made in Britain the textiles came from Britain they've now gone into 
the third world because they found that they could not compete with the cost of 
wages 
sf5402: 
sf5403: 
sf5402: 
sf5400: yeah in particular whose values and norms are being taken on in the 
process of globalisation there certainly isn't and and the impact of that is 
that now you got er the environment is being destroyed 
sf5400: actually it's quite interesting because McDonald's opened in Barbados 
and they lost in a few months literally Barbados three months because Barbados 
wouldn't support it 
sf5400: they don't eat fast foods like er you won't have what's the chicken 
people 
su: Kentucky
sf5400: Kentucky they're there and they they work because it's chicken but they 
have what they call er i'm trying to remember the name of the company it's a 
based company it's actually going round the world and it does one it's very 
similar to KFC but it's kind of Caribbean style er and they have chicken 
products and that's another one and and like McDonald's has er not McDonald's 
KFC has its own competition with it the Caribbean and but McDonald's because 
they said they didn't want it like that to begin with but then that's part and 
parts of the whole evils of multinationals they feel that they can go into 
anywhere it's very focussed it's it's they call it the because it is it is 
renowned the to be the one of the most forward looking countries in terms of 
and that's that whole ban thing you know they said er at the summit what they 
were looking at is that the stipulations because of course you borrow money 
under certain conditions and the conditions were that you cut down on education 
cut down on welfare cut down on health and at the time who was the prime 
minister he said what he said health education and welfare is the main stand of 
that economy once we do that but it shows that it can work if you're determined 
enough to do it and if you've got the people behind you it will work because 
Barbados a second example now from the Caribbean Trinidad Islands and Tobago 
Trinidad and Tobago had oil went into and now it's it's just totally been 
because of the stipulations they put on it 
sf5403: 
sf5402: it has it has the best of both though it's taken on a lot 
sf5403: you know it's just not so good 
sf5402: what you were saying coming back to that happened a lot especially in 
eastern European countries when they were forced to well not forced to but when 
their economies were liberalised er well a lot of their 
sf5400: look at our system and i mean you know we're talking about a first 
world country 
su: yes
sf5400: mm so if you equate that to them popular ones in saying this is the way 
to move for countries er that are dependent where the people are dependent on 
state welfare then think oh well this is the model to follow because the west 
says it's so 
sf5402: and the thing is like 
sf5400: 
sf5402: and the thing is as soon 
sf5400: it's unfair yeah
sf5402: who suffers the most i mean definitely and like they give the example 
of India 
sf5400: one of these articles actually said in poor countries you have poor men 
but you have poor women 
sf5396: in various articles that er that actually it just that's just 
increasing women's burden because they still largely have domestic 
responsibilities as well as others 
sf5397: yeah i suppose they take it for granted 
sf5396: but then they they do suggest that er you know again as we said they're 
not secure
sf5397: they're not secure
sf5398: no
sf5396: but then also it's it's er because men are being er expected to change 
their perception of who the responsibility lies with in the domestic situation 
so women may be being given equal opportunities in the sort of public sphere if 
you like but er they're still being considered responsible for the domestic as 
as well so it's actually just it's rather reallocation of the roles 
sf5397: it's just an extra thing
sf5396: what they have to do argues that that er that that actually it's still 
a process of exploitation and it's still in a sense a gender divide er because 
it's based on the assumption that women's time can extend 
sf5397: yes without any it's yes yes 
sf5396: we're definitely responsible for as much or as little as we you know 
what we're paying i think that's the idea but does that lead into question 
three or or am i just ahead of myself 
sf5397: no just for question two isn't it i would i would again i'd like to 
redefine what what er structural adjustment programmes are what are they 
sf5399: it's talk about 
sf5397: but by the world bank and the International 
sf5399: er 
sf5397: Monetary Fund are they something imposed it's something imposed from 
the west on the 
sf5399: you give informations 
sf5396: it's about isn't it isn't it about the er what what er the stake holder 
systems and er er taking away its own limited help for er health care nutrition 
sf5397: yes
sf5396: childcare er they may be limited but progress must have been made it's 
now being taken away
sf5397: yes
sf5396: i think there's some examples in i think in Latin America where they're 
saying that in fact the situation was getting better and it wasn't 
sf5404: i i wouldn't blame I-M-F it is the government these countries that fail 
it's not IMF
sf5396: no no but er 
sf5404: no it's not redevelopment it's grasped by a few persons a few 
privileged persons there was no development of the country so you you can't 
blame the westerner's monetary organisations or the west
sf5396: yeah
sf5397: but who but who impo-, who imposes these programmes the the local 
government
sf5404: no it's just they have to make reforms because the economy was too 
planned but they have to make reforms anyway but it's their own responsibility
sf5397: hm 
sf5399: this is all similar similar between er United Nations and NGO to 
discussing about the how to how to improve improve the women life 
sf5396: but they do make an er effort to come inline with a with a global 
position which is why they're dominated but if they hope to get on in the 
global market then they're sort of being forced to make certain structural 
changes that they can't cope with 
sf5404: but it's not
sf5396: it's not the same 
sf5404: but it's not just it's just they can't go on with such a debt it's not 
because of western western imperialism or anything it's just they can't go on 
but it isn't economically it's not possible 
sf5396: but this is the whole point of the drop the debt campaign isn't it it's 
that the campaigners in the west who will say don't when they're still being 
held up for owing the west huge amounts of money that the westerners still you 
know
sf5397: and the west 
sf5396: so if we drop the debt it would at least that would alleviate a huge 
problem in a lot of countries 
sf5404: yeah but i'm not sure if in these countries they can not at current 
times i mean the governments are not that good solving problems i mean drop the 
debt it's not going to be a miracle everything is going to be alright
sf5396: what are you going to make to improve the situation i mean it may not 
be alright over night but it would actually i think you know improve we 
couldn't make it worse could we take away the debt surely 
sf5404: i think we do have to pay for the mistakes of other countries 
sf5396: oh oh [laughter] 
sf5397: so what are their mistakes that we that you're talking about corruption
sf5404: yes
sf5397: yeah
sf5404: yeah they had resources they had money and they didn't use it in a 
proper way so 
sf5397: you mean after independence
sf5404: er well Latin America is not a question of independence 
sf5396: 
sf5399: because in these countries they receive the er idea from the west to 
improve their country country so but it's different 'cause in in the west er 
the policy makers make for their people but in the in the third world countries 
it's different idea is different and and it has er the different resource er 
different people different everythings so they can't use the same idea to 
improve their countries so maybe it's mis-, yeah it's mistake er in only their 
own countries but because they get receive they get the the idea from the west 
to improve their countries
sf5396: exactly with this idea we're going to a global market excuse me but but 
it's very dominated by very few countries you know so but it's kind of it's in 
a situation where it's more than independent countries you know it's more i 
mean in a political sense than in a geographical sense er you know of of being 
kind of being kind of forced to adopt if they're going to get on in any way 
even if it's not part of their you know their traditional you know makeup do 
you know what i mean am i making sense 
sf5397: yes no yes i know what you mean
sf5399: because in Thailand in the case of Thailand yeah the government is has 
a caution yeah many many caution from er the politician or the er the officials 
in the government but first of all most of all they get the idea from the west 
and try to improve their by by form the policies or something like that try to 
because of this in the rural area there they try to use er the budget to 
improve infrastructure or something like that but the people er the rural 
peoples they don't know how to use it but is it is important for them to to use 
it because they are already poor they have no education so this when when when 
the government er build a building or er building the roads er some so er then 
and er it's only only the building cost nobody come and used it
sf5396: right ok
sf5399: they spend less less money to to to pay 
sf5398: 
sf5399: yeah yeah 
nf5395: how are you doing on the questions 
sf5396: er we haven't got on to question four yet 
nf5395: right what another what five ten minutes 
su: hm
nf5395: right
sf5400: one of the big debates you know this feminism stuff doesn't apply to us 
because our needs are different we want to be put on this agenda we want for 
more women to start being part of the process you know of doing research 
because of globalisation technically economically and politically it's put the 
third world in a strait jacket 
sf5402: yeah yeah yeah i think he's what the er 
sf5401: what does strait jacket mean
sf5400: (giving a silent strait jacket impression)
[laughter] 
sf5402: have you seen silence of the lambs
sf5401: is it a means of control something like that 
sf5400: yes
sf5402: yes yes a jail restricted 
sf5402: okay we need to do er this one why have we ten
sf5400: this looks very sensible as the consequences of structural adjustments 
have become institutionalised in the global development process and in times of 
crisis have now become embedded
sf5400: in their daily lives 
sf5400: so they've gone from they've gone from a point of of living the way 
they lived to to crisis of that kind of crisis every now and again is what a 
permanent crisis is
sf5402: it's embedded yeah but we need to know er what can women's groups 
develop i mean what can effectively be done 
sf5400: well what they've actually said is that what they need to do is to er 
group together as women they need to identify as they have to the task the need 
to set up er movements as we would call them here in the west to counteract 
this but then the 
sf5402: what are they going to say
sf5403: 
sf5402: yeah 
sf5400: that's right
sf5403: because of feminism 
sf5402: but even beyond that even in even in er even 
sf5400: 
sf5402: yeah 'cause if the if the if the elite go yeah 
sf5401: 
sf5403: 
sf5402: the problem is it's the women who need to be heard the most are the 
ones least likely to actually be able to get their voices out 
sf5401: 
sf5403: 
sf5402: yeah directly yeah 
sf5403: 
sf5402: yeah but how often does that yeah 
sf5403: 
sf5402: yeah
sf5403: 
sf5402: yeah
sf5401: talk to the men in the country the government the government 
sf5403: 
sf5402: i don't think i don't think it gets into any individual level a broader 
economic level 
sf5400: i think she's right though
sf5402: yeah yeah i mean the men are 
sf5400: because because what they do is when they implement these policies or 
they want policies to be implemented what they do is they speak to the men even 
if it's not the men who deal with that particular issue
sf5402: yeah yeah 
sf5400: and so what women can't what what effectively they do is they and i 
think they've said it in those one of the ways is to just not do it you know 
when there have been programmes on or projects and it's not going to benefit 
them it's just not to do them and that's one of them then what they have to 
take aboard is that they need to decide for themselves what they need to do one 
of the reasons of coming forward is that they have to take on board the 
responsibilities of determining their lives and once they do they make their 
for them what's essential and then i mean there are a lot of things women can 
do i mean i know union organisation in the old fashioned sense is dying but 
it's a way of having force and it's a way of exerting power and maybe third 
world people need to reunionise or unionise themselves in order to perform some 
force out to get more wages because if they were to decide to pull out of the 
wage market they would need an employee at a higher salary which they would 
have to do or they would have to pay more to the women but when women are 
fragmented and continue to be paid the pityings then 
sf5402: that's it yeah but it's very how plausible is it how
sf5400: it takes time like most things but it does actually work because of 
domestic violence and of all these things
sf5402: yes yeah
sf5400: you know if women decided that you know we're gonna men first er women 
had to kill their husband the women's movement came behind and women 
technically the law women cannot a man but a woman can a man you know and the 
women's movement er in the sixties were quite harsh in Britain and usually 
violence ended up in a man dying because 
sf5402: 
sf5400: well but something that will work it will take time it will take 
organising but it's a way 
sf5403: strategy from the grass roots 
sf5400: yes yes
sf5403: 
sf5400: yes yes and but it's at grass root level where they were it's the
sf5402: it has to be at the grass roots level 
sf5400: they're communianising because if you looked at Britain in the forties 
and fifties for better working conditions that's what they did in Britain so 
productions came to standstill and they had to listen to the people because 
then they had a representative so representing the force of the people and 
maybe that's a way women will have to structure themselves in terms of moving 
forward because that's the only thing they have but it's quite powerful
sf5402: it's a very powerful thing 
sf5400: but i don't think they've actually realised that they do have that 
power and that they can exert that power
sf5402: that's what i mean it's very difficult to convince them that they do 
have that power 
sf5400: yeah
sf5402: because if you've been if you've been 
sf5400: it's educated 
sf5402: yeah
sf5400: educated mostly
sf5402: and if you've been like yeah your whole life it's very difficult to get 
out of that trap to actually think independently 
sf5400: but then
sf5402: it's very difficult
sf5403: 
sf5400: education and educating women the fact that they don't have to put up 
with this kind of behaviour 
sf5402: and it is very important that it is grass roots because if you get if 
you do get the elites going back and actually even trying to these women it 
comes out very differently 
sf5400: it's a different language as well isn't it it's a whole different 
language because if you if you look at the er if you look at the language 
that's used in a university and the language that's used on community level 
it's completely different so if you don't use the same language as they use 
they don't take any notice and it's a resentment because they 
sf5402: and i had to travel to the islands the backward people usually and i 
was in a programme with the health department and i was supposed to talk to 
these people about what i was majoring in but but then i had nothing to say 
because i realised say this is what the WHO wants you to do didn't have any 
effect at all
sf5403: 
sf5402: but anything that has become effective was when people say from the UK 
were actually staying on the island for a longer period of time and then do 
something otherwise it doesn't work 
sf5403: 
sf5402: well i am but i am as far removed from them
sf5400: 
sf5403: language 
sf5400: because i think language is a big boundary you know people speak words 
and if people don't understand even the meaning of a word then they're gonna be 
switched off because that word could be the whole er 
sf5401: a key word to make a point
sf5400: yes yes exactly
sf5402: yeah yeah
sf5403: but actually or i think it was in the international organisations i 
think they have i mean they haven't hired local people to work for them and 
like you know
sf5402: this is what i mean when they do in the mornings you'll find you'll 
find that in governmental jobs and all the high jobs are men but is actually 
the only international organisation who have but it's mostly local women who 
are employed local community people like educated locals right but the things 
is that's their way of employing the local people they've all employed local 
women but these local women usually are as far removed from them as any
sf5400: 
sf5402: yeah it's it's 
sf5401: 
sf5402: it's like you said to me you're a new er elite role model it's you know 
what i mean and how
sf5403: how could they that
sf5402: most of us educated we go back 
sf5400: you see they have programmes in the Caribbean for instance er we call 
them popular theatre programmes and when you have projects to do you use 
popular theatre to do it you go into the communities because popular theatre 
speaks a language that crosses boundaries it crosses gender it crosses racial 
boundaries so you go in because what it allows you to do and in the Caribbean 
what we have what we call er we do skids and things what it allows you to do it 
allows you to go in you become a facilitator as opposed to er a tutor a 
lecturer or whatever you facilitate something predominantly what we do is you 
you teach the people the skills to do whatever it is they want to do so by the 
time we finish with the programme and we got out of them in a week what nobody 
else had been able to do now we didn't ask any specific questions we just 
facilitated the and gave them the tools in which to themselves to express what 
it is they wanted to say it was at a particular hospital the hospital staff 
came back and said similar things would have to
nf5395: what is globalisation then does anybody know what globalisation is 
sf5396: we said we said a process on several levels but er the sort of the 
political er level of globalisation we talked about er deregulation 
mobilisation er and the sort of er economics we talked about the free market 
and er globalisation economically er which was something we said that 
globalisation is rooted in nations of capitalism er as well that's quite 
important and in terms of political set up it's also rooted in nations of 
democracy there's a perception that all states would be democratic er 
globalisation is sort of an element of it as well as perhaps a consequence of 
it is er mass media and mass communication networks and er the improvement in 
rapid transportation all across the world that those are the kind of key areas 
we looked at 
nf5395: and what else any
sf5402: well basically that but we also said this er basically breaking down of 
any national or state boundaries where you get very much a blurring of what 
belongs where even politically and economically both as well 
sf5396: what what we were saying that that that may be the theory that that 
globalisation's theory is to break down these barriers but that the reality in 
practice it's not so much a global system as a kind of international system if 
you like i mean the nation state hasn't actually deteriorated 
sf5402: no not at all
sf5396: i mean it does still exist i mean there may be theoretically i think 
yeah you're right that that's what globalisation is aimed at 
sf5402: but but the idea that a person that people from very different parts of 
the world can be employed in one single company that's that's i mean 
practically broken down a barrier that's literally broken down so
nf5395: yeah can you give us some other examples of how i mean it's right that 
that er much of it is is internationalised er but there are examples of where 
er national boundaries are breaking down so can you think of other examples of 
that i mean you know why has this idea of globalisation arisen er what what 
other examples can you see 
sf5397: well within Europe 
nf5395: yes yeah 
sf5397: the workers can can move freely
nf5395: right yeah what what
sf5397: no it's just
nf5395: did you did you think of other examples of where some why has why has 
the idea of globalisation arisen now do you think because in many ways it's 
something that's been happening for a long time not not just recently but why 
is globalisation such such a popular concept now 
sf5400: and movements of capital and er economic movements where er 
particularly from multinationals where profit is the key to everything they do 
so obviously the cheaper the labour they'd get the more profit they can make 
and globalisation is a legal way if you like of being able to do that is to 
transport labour er from one part of the world to another er but in the true 
sense globalisation doesn't happen because then that that money if you like the 
investment doesn't stay in the country in which it goes or where the 
development is actually taking place so you will always have inequalities er 
even though the the point of or the whole point of globalisation should be for 
a fairer for a freer world but it's freer for whom and fairer for whom because 
it's not really fair and it's not free 
nf5395: yeah so i one of the reasons that that globalisation is a er an 
important concept currently is because of the way er er companies are able to 
move across national boundaries and there's no state control or at least state 
control of of er er industry has broken down to a great extent 
sf5397: so it's economic interdependence actually
nf5395: yeah yeah which as you'll recognise has has been going on for a long 
time you know er since colonial times er but it's intensified in particular 
ways in recent years and the other i suppose the other really big example is er 
the fact that rich and poor aren't so clearly separated between geographical 
areas now so that there are er sort of important examples of where 
industrialisation has begun so 
sf5396: 
nf5395: ey 
su: other culture
nf5395: yeah but i mean in 
su: areas of the world
nf5395: yeah areas of the world 
sf5397: as in in south east Asia 
nf5395: yeah i mean that you know that's a key one where where er it's no 
longer the case that it's the west that's that's industrialised er and the 
third world that is agra-, agrarian er so particularly in south east Asia but 
also in other areas and in other smaller areas in different parts of the world 
that kind of clearcut polarisation between rich and poor is changing er so 
that's another reason that er you know the old theories don't really work any 
more because they were based on that kind of polarisation er so there is 
greater change now it's it's not it's not something that's particularly 
different from what's been happening since colonial times but but there are 
more changes and globalisation is trying to take the term globalisation is 
trying to take account of those those changes which don't really fit into 
modernisation theory and interdependency theory so very well ok what are the 
effects of globalisation then in different areas of the world 
sf5400: in the in the developing world it's it's had a great effect on women in 
particular because it means that their role as individual people has expanded 
er from the caretaker of their home er from domestic work from agricultural 
work into low pay employment so instead of just having the family and the 
fields to look after they now have the onus of going on jobs and also in terms 
of migration for men and that has an impact then on production and reproduction 
er 
sf5402: well one advantage that's been cited is that it does give women more 
independence well er for instance just being just getting money for instance 
from these NGOs that operate there but that's the only advantage 'cause like 
you said then they they have their job but they all but it's having earning 
money doesn't mean that the job they're doing in the domestic domestic sphere 
like at home doesn't so it doesn't decrease at all and their role as i mean 
it's still a patriarchal family so her role doesn't increase either it doesn't 
so it's the idea of stretching her time stretching women's time 
sf5396: we were also saying that that women's employment is still very insecure 
there's no kind of stability to it whatsoever er and that it would help if 
there was a a sort of reappropriation of roles within the domestic area but 
there isn't 
sf5402: no there isn't yeah
sf5396: it's not women coming into the workforce a little bit and men starting 
to take some of the domestic responsibility 
sf5402: the idea that the man is still the breadwinner still lingers on 
although she although the women are now earning as well
sf5396: so that the the exploitation is now rooted in in this idea that women's 
time and resources is endlessly expandable
sf5402: yeah infinite time yeah
nf5395: yeah what other effects what about this group what did you 
sf5403: actually i was thinking about the first world women as well because you 
know now big companies have moved you know to use cheap labour in the in the 
third world countries right so women in the first world also lose their jobs at 
the same time so you know it doesn't mean that women in the first world will 
gain benefit from globalisation yeah because they have something to lose as well
nf5395: right and that's an example of that kind of change when it doesn't 
easily fit into the old theories er so that you're getting you know increasing 
pockets of poverty in rich countries and certain areas of growing er richness 
in so called poor countries so yeah
sf5401: and i also feel that er globalisation has has has opened Africa the 
countries in Africa put gender on the agenda national agendas
nf5395: yeah yeah
sf5401: cause er from Namibia er in ninety-five when the country was made aware 
through globalisation of the Beijing conference and it is the first time in 
since Namibia's independence that it can really participate on gender issues 
nationally and after that five years after that Namibia started a gender 
ministry for the first time so i feel globalisation in a way forced African 
countries' men who were in authority to recognise that gender can also be 
discussed in this country and it obviously affects any woman's activities in 
the country from agricultural level to economic level and things so 
globalisation is then a positive thing but what happens after that now the 
ministry's established gender is on the agenda it's how it is going further on 
it is the question now but just to make it present recognised in the country in 
the first place globalisation has done a tremendous effect on this
nf5395: that's that's a really interesting idea actually isn't it because it's 
it's kind of it's legitimising these certain kinds of issues which i'm sure 
have always been there er but have not been recognised 
sf5401: there's too much pressure from the outside from the first world 
countries on the third world countries to recognise the value of women's work 
in third world countries 
sf5396: but i think one of the interesting things about that as well is that in 
improving the situation for women because women are often responsible and 
things like in developing countries but er sustenance and those of agriculture 
so it's actually you know in addressing their concerns you're you're improving 
the situation of the society at large you know for er sort of the families as 
well as er you know the men and so it's i think that's starting to be 
recognised er you know it's not just about making the situation better for 
women but it will actually have wider you know widespread effects 
nf5395: yeah but i i think Kathleen's point is really important because there's 
a tendency to focus all on the negative aspects and how effective globalisation 
and increasing integration across the world er just spreads all the bad things 
about er the global economy but Kathleen's example shows that actually it can 
be used by other forces it can it can we can use it the way we want er the fact 
that that you know transport and communication is easier can be used by by the 
women's movement er so yes it's a it's it's really important to kind of have 
that that idea that it can be a positive force as well because that's the only 
way we'll make it a positive force yes what other effects does globalisation 
have in other parts of the world what did this group discuss
sf5397: we talked about er er about the effects er on the families er but er 
from what from what from what we i've read er it varies a lot and so er the 
patriarchal structures you're talking about i think in some cases er things are 
things are changing a little er 
nf5395: yeah can you give an example for that do you remember any 
sf5397: well there it was the article on on Chile it it they said they found it 
very difficult to generalise because because er it varied so much from family 
to family and that er er during the working months women women who are earning 
and sometimes they earn actually more than than the men in their jobs and er 
yeah in some in some cases er the men were you know changing changing their 
roles at home and others they didn't at all so it's and again in the winter 
months they reverted back to traditional roles but still it shows a change yeah
nf5395: yeah and again that's that's interesting because it shows that the 
effects of globalisation aren't even they aren't even you know so you can't you 
can't just assume that because an effect's in one place is like this to be the 
same somewhere else there are there are very uneven er impacts in different 
places of the world and different locations and that's why er that's why the 
idea the concept of globalisation is often linked with the concept of local the 
local or that horrible word localisation er because you in other words you need 
to look at the specific location and examine what the effects are there within 
that particular context er because because er there can be such great 
differences in the effects er so it's important to remember that it's you know 
uneven in its impact
sf5402: 
nf5395: yeah sorry sorry was going to say something 
sf5402: i was going to say er with mm especially in eastern Europe i read 
something about that er with political liberalisation and economic 
liberalisation state welfare was cut back a lot and usually it's the women who 
suffer the consequences when state welfare's cut back so that's er 
sf5403: i feel again it happens everywhere like in Thailand like in in nineteen-
ninety-seven we have that financial crisis and then the world bank and IMF came 
to help us they said they help us by giving us some loans but under the 
conditions that we have to cut back of the social spendings especially those 
related to health care and education so women er basically affected yeah the 
most by the cutbacks yeah 
nf5395: yeah has anybody read anything about er why women are affected why is 
it why are women particularly affected by the by structural adjustment schemes
sf5396: for for example when we were talking about cutback on certain social 
spendings so there's a reduction in education services for example and they 
were saying that it tends to be er a reduction in women's education in women's 
adult literacy in you know it's the er it's the girls who then stay at home and 
they're considered not to you know need the education as much as the boys do 
because there's still this kind of patriarchal structure so they're actually 
losing out on education more er or if you know food subsidies are reduced 
whatever what we've talked before about sort of er the patriarchal situations 
within the family you known it tends to be the women who who lose out more who
sf5397: and childcare childcare reduced 
sf5396: yeah because the area of cutbacks tends to be more in the social and 
domestic sphere which is obviously where women are sort of you know primarily 
are at the moment 
nf5395: right yeah so i mean you know when the when the state is drawing back 
from er services of various kinds it's almost always the women who're taking up 
the difference in in the family so if er if if there are educational cutbacks 
er cutbacks in health spending it's women who are who are having to do those in 
unpaid time so what was in in the paid economy has moved over to the unpaid 
economy so that's why structural adjustment programmes are particularly bad for 
women because it's it's actually and of course there's no recognition of this 
by the world bank or the IMF er but when they introduce those kinds of 
programmes they they're actually er i mean the idea is to improve the economy 
but they're improving the economy by using women's unpaid labour er in in areas 
where it used to be paid where where those kinds of services were paid for er 
so it's you can actually see a very direct link
sf5400: there's also some places where er it has added poverty that's already 
been there and that people are in fact poorer because of globalisation than 
perhaps they were before er and i mean one 
nf5395: you mean structural difference 
sf5400: sort of yes yeah
nf5395: yeah yeah 
sf5400: er i mean because for instance in the Caribbean you look at places like 
Jamaica and compare that to Barbados Barbados who wouldn't take IMF loans and 
Jamaica that did and the whole economy structure has are are completely 
different and because Barbados was not prepared to lose the welfare it gave or 
to reduce its education or health because they saw that as prime factors for 
any nation that was looking to develop they had to have good education they had 
to have good welfare and they had to have er good health infrastructure and so 
for them that was key to their economic development and they would not er 
adjust those and at the time the Barbados prime minister said well if those are 
the conditions under which we get a loan we'll not have the loan er and so they 
rejected it and they rejected their loan a couple of years after someone like 
Trinidad and Tobago and Trinidad and Tobago is now sunk into poverty because of 
the rates that they have to pay back on that loan and their education system is 
well it hasn't demolished it they still have got education but they that was 
because they decided that they would maintain that at the cost of other things 
so for some places it hasn't really had the impact that maybe it was meant to 
have 
nf5395: that's a really interesting comparison 
sf5400: very unique i think i think that kind of is very difficult to 
sf5402: yeah but as we said it it takes the will of the people the people have 
to be behind politicians in order to push that through because er Barbados the 
whole of Barbados was up in arms about it lose our education they've gotta be 
kidding er and so it was it made life easier because he knew that he could 
reject it because the people were behind him and so it is and we talked about 
that in terms of mobilisation of women mobilising themselves and how at a grass 
roots level they could do that but they needed to have confidence and perhaps 
some form of education in which they could have the confidence to actually say 
well hold on a minute you know we've just been used as cheap labour and as er 
and and look at the whole implications of that but because the they look at the 
financial aspects and because that's what's portrayed with capitalism i guess 
it's a false ideology er what what it can bring forth 
nf5395: well did did any other er did you discuss er what women should might do 
to tackle some of the negative effects negative effects of structural 
adjustment programmes it's called
sf5400: it's quite an old concept but we thought it might be useful for grass 
roots women to actually go back to that because with
nf5395: it's an old concept in the west i'm not sure it is in other places 
sf5400: that's right and that's that's what i was going to say for for the west 
it is an old concept but for er underdeveloped or developing countries it would 
be a new but it would be a force that they could use but it would mean that 
they would have to er mobilise themselves and have a form of action in order to 
do that but they say strength is in or power is in strength and if you can get 
the people to actually condense themselves and to organise in that kind of 
movement then that could be one way where they could actually start demanding 
more for their labour er and get clearer boundaries as to what because this 
thing they talk a lot about this flexibility but i mean flexibility begins 
begins with its insecurities and for both men and women 
nf5395: ok did anybody read of any examples 
sf5396: we were saying we noticed that most of the stuff we looked at was quite 
pessimistic that er that it sort of charted er the action as being sort of 
female activism as as being generally quite specific and and localised as as in 
saying therefore not necessarily having any major impact on sort of structural 
adjustment programmes on a sort of national level because they were having sort 
of whilst you know you can't i don't want to say that any kind of programmes 
isn't worthwhile because it is and in these local contexts it's got to be seen 
as a positive thing that they're doing something and that their voice is being 
heard but it's not actually effective you know on a greater scale er and also 
there's an an example in the article we were talking about er the return to 
fundamentalism in some places that as a sort of backlash against er this sort 
of notion of of modernisation and globalisation there's there's this kind of 
we'll we'll refer back to to sort of kind of traditionalist fundamentalist 
ideas which aren't you know either way this isn't improving the situation for 
for anyone but not not for women certainly so er it's all a bit depressing 
really isn't it 
nf5395: ok we talked a lot about er structural and economic aspects of 
globalisation but what about the cultural argument how far does cultural 
globalisation spread do you think we're all becoming one culture
sf5396: Americanisation i think
nf5395: yeah to an extent 
sf5396: in lots of ways 
nf5395: what do you think about that
su: what
sf5396: Americanisation i mean you know there's McDonald's in Moscow it's gotta 
be bad you know and i think that's the thing that it's not necessarily er in 
the same way that economically er you know interdependence is kind of er a 
rather friendly term because what it actually means is that there is but a few 
leading world powers and lots of countries that are really heavily dependent 
economically but i think there's a a worry that you know culturally that could 
start to happen as well it's like some cultural ideas could dominate when they 
shouldn't you know
sf5402: i think there is an idea that there is one particular way that we 
should strive to be like it's cool to wear a jeans and drink Coca Cola kind of 
thing i think that's actually penetrated a lot of cultures other cultures 
nf5395: yes and the examples you've just quoted are very significant because 
they you know they're mass produced commodities aren't they 
sf5402: yeah it's it's 
nf5395: so there's a there's a kind of strong cultural drive towards er 
encouraging people to have to have the desire to buy those things 
sf5402: yeah it's i think we were saying that globalisation plays a lot on 
people's greed that's why it's very difficult to cut cut it because she was 
saying can you actually hold it hold it back and you were saying that you know 
it's i can't see it happening in our lifetime because it plays so much on greed 
'cause it's the idea that you know if they have it why shouldn't we have it so 
it's 
sf5400: there was an interesting thing there with this Miss World competition 
coming up though it might seem not relevant but it was because they were 
talking about culture and cultural boundaries and they were saying that now for 
Miss India there were specific this debate it was on radio four was really 
looking at India and Indian women and how they have actually now er if you like 
modelled the typical western woman that they would like to see on the stage for 
Miss World and so the poor the fat people who have er cultural who who are 
dressed in cultural dress who speak with any kind of dialect is not going to be 
looked at for the Miss World competition because they go out to win and they 
were saying that India has won six time five times in the last six years or the 
last six times and because for now they have decided if they're entering it and 
they said rather than now pick a woman a Miss India woman it will be all these 
factors of the west are taken into consideration so cultural norms as India 
sees them are no longer valid for a Miss World Miss Universe er competition and 
i think that shows the ways in which talking about culture cultures are 
emerging because they see this as the as what is expected what will win
sf5402: with with that Miss World thing i think there's er a whole section of 
these cultures who're actually fighting fighting it a lot because what you said 
about Miss World when Miss World came back back to India after winning the 
competition there was a great uproar when she came at the airport and stuff 
because she'd actually worn a swimming suit on stage and they were saying you 
shouldn't have done that 'cause that's not part of us so so there's a lot of 
fighting about it as well fighting 
nf5395: yeah that's right i think that's true er and also i mean i think you 
now the example you've showed is very significant because it's a particular 
model of woman who that is being exported isn't it and it's not the one that 
any of us would want to to export you know er you know it's
sf5400: that's the whole point and i think taking back this point about er 
McDonald's in Moscow i mean i was just saying to these McDonald's lost in three 
months in Barbados literally they built it it was like forced they didn't 
Barbados did not want it McDonald's decided
nf5395: how wonderful that really cheers me up
sf5400: it was there for three months and they actually said they had ten 
customers in three months and it was pulled down people up Barbados is just if 
we want it we'll get it if we don't we won't don't come in here without our 
permission 'cause
sf5396: when it opened in Moscow is that basically the price of a Big Mac for a 
lot of people was a week's wages but they would spend it because there was this 
kind of you know this idea of you know this is something i don't know luxurious 
almost and something exciting and new look we must you know this this notion of 
of really having to buy into this kind of western culture is is is really you 
know powerful
sf5403: i think that might be a result of the international technology as well 
i mean internet and mass media you know they keep pushing this subject ahead 
yeah so that is i think that is part of the globalisation as well i mean 
globalisation of international communication and technology you know even the 
people in in Africa or you know in in Burma or in Cambodia they have access to 
the internet now so you know this kind of information does fly into the into 
your country you know 
nf5395: right but the question is can it come back the other way you know i 
mean it is two ways it is possible to resist it er 
sf5396: but er you know maybe the American culture they could be informed more 
by er sort of other cultures coming the other direction because i think at the 
moment it's a bit of a sort of token and stick er effort you know so i don't 
know Madonna wears a sari you know it's sort of not enough it's i think you 
know it'd be really nice to be informed rather than having just certain 
stereotypical or taking on of other peoples' cultures 
sf5402: the thing is what you said about the sari what you'll find in the 
fashion world now sari's become a big thing but it's in such a western way 
you'll find women in India actually wearing their saris like they're done on 
the stage as it is in London which doesn't it's completely beside the point so 
it's
nf5395: so what do you think about the globalisation of culture then do you 
think it
sf5400: i think it's a sign of because i think we're losing so much by a lot of 
cultures are 
nf5395: but you think it's really happening
sf5404: human rights is kind of an effect of globalisation and that's a very 
positive thing 
nf5395: hm yes that's true 
sf5404: and the women rights also is you know 
nf5395: yeah yeah 
sf5396: i i think also er you know it doesn't have to mean er assimilation that 
that sort of that we're talking about cultural globalisation doesn't have to 
mean that we will all become the same but but 
sf5402: but the problem is yeah 
sf5396: but do you think that's the way it's happening in the world
sf5402: i think the problem is when you actually get down to an individual 
level you'll find that i mean i'm just talking about the i mean you'll find 
that every almost every single person wants to actually look like a western 
person so but i think on an individual level that's how it really works i mean 
it's it's a lot of try really hard to look American it's very i think
nf5395: and the danger i think is what what someone said earlier that that in 
order to resist that people will retreat into things like you know er well for 
instance fundamentalist Hinduism which is happening in India er and what what 
people who are trying to resist it in India who are who are not going in that 
direction and don't agree with that direction are saying is that you know let 
us go our way it's not just a choice between er er kind of American global 
culture er and fundamentalist Hinduism but that there are alternatives we can 
take what we want from from any culture but maintain our own without retreating 
into this very er 
sf5396: i think it'd be nice if we could use our positive points and sort of 
celebrate difference and learn about each other's cultures you know i think 
there would be potential for that to happen and i think you know that'd be nice 
because what worries me about er with globalisation people started talking 
about this sense of losing their identity and that worries me as well because 
that could so easily just sort of tip over into notions you know sort of really 
racist notions of er and that you know if people feel too strongly they have to 
protect their own identity that's when you're gonna get a conflict and i you 
know that's what i think that the feel that their identity is is jeopardised 
but you know
sf5400: what i'm saying people don't want to be pointed at because they're 
different you you want to fit in and so you conform and there is this whole 
sense i know you say that it but but i mean racism is built around the notion 
of assimilation that you should assimilate that you should look the same that 
it's accepted you know that if you want to be accepted you conform you conform 
to the norms and values of a particular culture which is western culture er 
because anything else is really not acceptable and so while it's nice as you 
say that maybe if people were to celebrate other cultures and actually look at 
cultures in positive ways what you can learn take the good from whichever ones 
you like but in in real terms that doesn't happen because there's an expected 
way that you're expected there's an expected expectation of you and 
particularly when you're a child and you're growing up and you don't want to be 
different and so the notion of west will always be influential because of grown 
colonialisation and er what has happened in slavery et cetera et cetera i mean 
in fact African people have in across the African diaspora there is this notion 
go back to our roots which was very heavily influential in the eighties you 
know hence movement became really big on the agenda because it was about 
identification people wanted to be identified for their for themselves as part 
of being part of a a melting pot if you like 
sf5402: i think what you said about people don't want to be pointed at as 
different when you find now i think er a Muslim woman wearing the full veil you 
it's like when you see it it's like oh horror god fundamental what's her 
husband done to her so it's that it is isn't it i mean you don't even myself 
being a Muslim and even when i see it a Muslim woman with a complete veil like 
face covered and stuff i don't think her cul-, well i mean her culture in that 
bit you think that she must be so fundamental and her husband must be so 
fundamental that she's forced into that veil i mean you don't think it might be 
her choice actually to 'cause it is her it is her religion it is her culture 
and there is a lot of pointing at if you do find a woman dressed in
nf5395: yeah and you know very er rigid use of what of what liberation means er 
and the the example that comes to mind is actually it's you know in Iran when 
er when the the Shah er actually forced women to take the veil off you know 
well and he was doing that because of he he was aligned with er west the 
western powers and trying to push westernisation and trying to change to 
actually you know bring about western culture er part of that was as he saw it 
and as the west saw it liberating women but what an extraordinary way to 
liberate women to rip off their clothing you know it's not it's a very one 
dimensional view of what liberation means could i ask you because Japan has 
industrialised er and do you think how far do you think er western culture has 
also been absorbed with the industrialisation or not
sf5398: yes er Japan is er not so completely with west er in some way yes we 
have traditional but er i think Japan is er peculiar specific er country 
because westernisation and the er Japan alteration of Japan is integration 
integration so we for example clothes er we ordinary we wear clothes just like 
the clothes but er the wedding ceremony er or er the graduation ceremony we 
wear the Japanese traditional kimono and er for example the the religion is er 
we you have many gods and er Christian and Bhuddist Shintuism Shintuism is a 
traditional Japanese it's a very very er i think it's a strange country for er 
for foreigners but we we are we are so accustomed to integration westernisation 
tradition really 
nf5395: i think Japan is such a wonderful example because you have fully 
followed capitalism advanced capitalism in Japan and but it's still very 
Japanese i mean you haven't lost Japanese culture it's very integrated er 
you've taken aspects of other cultures that you like but it's it's still very 
Japanese
sf5402: yes things like the economy 
nf5395: yeah
sf5402: it's it's strictly it's very Japanese and that's 
sf5398: economy but er the well as far as the women's as far as for women i 
think it's er behind of industrialised countries we still patriarchy insist in 
Japan and er still women's er expected to play role of mother yes it's very 
strict 
sf5396: they are here too and so they are in America it's you know i think i 
thinks that's a a common perception i've i've sort of certainly realised like 
er this term with meeting more and more sort of international students who said 
oh you know er it must be so much better for you here and i'm like well you 
know in in sort of some ways there may be sort of certain you know i mean maybe 
the economic situation and things like that that i you know i can't argue 
although you know we got it just as bad but you know i said well you know 
patriarchy isn't you know we're still talking about it i mean it's not as 
though it's been eradicated so and i think er people i've spoken to were 
actually quite surprised by that because they'd come here thinking they would 
see these empowered happy women all over the place who were all like you know 
no problems at all er they were kind of a bit surprised with that as in you 
know how it is so i think it's quite you know it's interesting 
nf5395: yeah i agree with there it's a mistake to think that er gender and 
power relations don't exist here
sf5402: it's been an assumption though i think that it doesn't
nf5395: that it does it's an assumption that it does you mean 
sf5402: no that it doesn't like when you get away from the west i think there's 
a big assumption that everyone all the women here must be very empowered and 
very powerful 
nf5395: and why why do you think that is why do people outside the west think 
women are you know liberated here when we know it's not true 
sf5396: male PR
nf5395: well it is but i mean i mean it goes back to our first week you know 
looking at gender and imperialism because the west used to and still does use 
that whole idea of gender relations to maintain its power so so i mean people 
think that oh well obviously women in the west must be really free because 
they're criticising us for it but it's not true
sf5401: i think it's er when structural adjustment programmes when they come to 
Africa they're more perceptive welcomed by women than by men because i in the 
in the programmes that you see in southern Africa it is mostly based on 
agriculture how to improve land and how to how to er through development so 
that you don't deteriorate land so much and have different forms of cultivation 
and blah blah blah teaching women but in order to do this programme you need to 
take the women out of the house to show her how to do these things and that 
causes family breakdowns men become aggressive you're never here the house is 
not clean the house it's not cooked the children you know what i mean so i 
think structural adjustment programmes in southern Africa i can speak of is is 
not so much well accepted by men than by women
nf5395: really
sf5401: yeah and er the the problem with women and structural problems also is 
they've got a very high expectation er of the result they've been promised if 
we come in we'll do this to you if you do the programme this way in which you 
haven't done it in the past this and this will be the result if it is not 
achieved women become very what's the English word
su: disheartened 
sf5401: yeah dismayed disillusioned ach you people come in from the west and 
you told me it won't be like this you're nothing else but the imperialists and 
you know what i mean so when you come into a country that has not experienced 
structural adjustment programmes before you must be very careful and honest you 
know what i mean be honest with the people and say look we can try but if it 
doesn't work it will not work so it depends on you don't come in there if it 
will work and just give us a chance because this is how they come in through 
NGOs in in Namibia especially and women they are scared of their men and women 
they are scared of authority even the government and state so anything that 
fails will just make them not participate any more so it takes a while again to 
uplift the women's movements again mobilise women's activities you know what i 
mean so sometimes the expectations of the women are too high it's like 
everything will be fixed within a week and it's not like that they must be 
honest and say these things will take time the next five years your own 
daughter will maybe have a better standard or something of something so but 
that's not what's really happening so it is also how you come in with a policy 
and not just say the policy is there the money is there now give your feedback 
it's also the approach to the grass root level which i feel is important
nf5395: but are you saying Kathleen that you think structural adjustment 
programmes are beneficial
sf5401: i would say they're beneficial if there's clarity and what do you say 
transparency in the process but there is
nf5395: why do you think they're beneficial
sf5401: because it does help i mean there's an example i work in there's an NGO 
coming in through er say Oxfam UK Oxfam Canada and they would go to rural area 
but they will first approach the ministry they love working through the 
government first and then er women are the ones collecting the water in Namibia 
in the rural areas so they would target the ministry of water first and er say 
er we've got this new pipe system pumping system they can pump ten litres of 
water in a minute so we'll go out into the regions and er install them and show 
the locals how it worked and then the women don't have to go so far fetch they 
walk like five kilometres to fetch the water now they will go into the regions 
these consultants and they would install their pump and they'll show the men of 
the community how it is worked and then the men would go off into towns and go 
and work and then the women are the ones who operate these pumps within three 
months the pumps are broken and the consultant is gone the programme was just 
for three months 
nf5395: right but i mean
sf5403: that's not a restructuring programme
nf5395: you're talking about development projects i mean i was er 
sf5401: okay
nf5395: i was asking about structural adjustment programmes which are trying to 
er restructure the economy so that you know they're trying to er stop 
government spending er liberalise the economy and improve basically improve 
capitalism improve profits that's what that's what it's trying to do increase 
profits er very sound economy er i mean actually very similar to what er 
president Reagan did in the US and what er prime minister Thatcher did in in 
the UK they're i mean actually they're structural adjustment programmes too 
they're just not called that but it's it was all about restructuring the 
economy getting rid of industry that needed subsidy everything had to be self 
financing er so it i mean it had been happening all over the world i mean even 
here people complained a lot about the effects of it er so i mean the the 
question is whether it has been beneficial in in third world countries and i 
mean sometimes it is and for some people for some groups it can be very 
beneficial
sf5401: she said that the er the social welfare was a lot cut back in Namibia 
it's now increasing they increased the maintenance for illegitimate children 
and for women's work equal payment in the workforce you know things like that 
so it's not really that down it's an improvement i would say when it comes to 
adjustment
nf5395: so the state's actually yeah 
sf5401: yeah 
nf5395: given services 
sf5397: but does that mean that structural programmes are 
sf5401: yeah they are but er two years a year after independence they came in 
strongly but now they're not so much any more 'cause some fail and some don't 
and some women don't want and something it's so you know but there's the the 
state itself has given more to welfare now they increased they spend more on 
and now with the war in the central Africa Namibia has sent troops there and 
this government they spend a lot of money on defence and the women are the 
first to speak up no why do you spend money on defence why don't you spend it 
on we-, or on er education on so that that movement of women's movement 
uprising in the country to speak against what they also need and what is 
necessary is stronger now than it was before 
sf5403: and it's a part of the globalisation 
sf5401: i would say so 
nf5395: so er do you feel that you know what globalisation is now [laughter] 
nf5395: not really well and you know again it's one of those concepts that 
people disagree on er although it's it's defined as increasing integration of 
the of the world economy er lots of people disagree about how that happens why 
it's happening and what its manifestations are and and they disagree about 
whether it's beneficial or or detrimental overall you know largely depending on 
on what their view of capitalist industrialisation is because really that's 
that's the root of globalisation and then there're all these other questions 
about whether how for that impact on culture too so it is a complex question 
but er i mean i think it's interesting because it's it's a very current concept 
and it's linked to the debt crisis and attempts to deal with the debt crisis in 
all parts of the world not just in the third world er ok would you like some 
notes of mine on gender and globalisation er who didn't get a a course 
evaluation form would you like to take one of those can you bring it next week 
please and also if you want to take if you want this list just a couple of 
things bring that back next week please and that is a review form and that's 
just a couple of handouts ok and have you have you all arranged to meet for 
next week you're all organised for next week your presentations
