nm1128: as always er you know if you want to discuss the essays with me come 
along [0.2] you know any time or certainly i'll be in my room during [0.2] s-, 
so-called [0.4] surgery hours [0.4] [laugh] [1.4] right let's get this thing 
moving [6.0] i'm dealing with the economics of er [0.6] free trade [1.2] areas 
[0.9] which some of you have done i mean i'll be doing it a little bit more 
depth than we did on my other course [0.6] but there's obviously quite a bit of 
overlap on this particular topic [0.5] so i'm looking for you to [0.4] do the 
lecture rather than me [0.9] er [1.6] so here's the handout [5.6] i assume 
you've got all 
sm1129: 
nm1128: yes [laughter] [0.4] we're doing a little bit more [laughter] i i said 
you're doing the lecture [laughter] [3.0] but some people haven't [0.8] had the 
privilege of er [1.0] doing the E-U in developing countries so [1.6] what i'm 
dealing with is that today we'll deal with the the economics [0.7] of [0.3] 
customs union and free trade agreements [1.1] and in next week [0.4] we'll deal 
with article twenty-four [0.4] which is the W-T-O [0.6] er [0.3] article the 
general agreement 
on tariffs and trade article [0.7] er which covers authorizes [0.6] er free 
trade areas and customs union [0.4] because of course [0.6] they [0.2] 
fundamentally break article one [0.5] er the principle of non-discrimination i 
mean the whole purpose of a free trade area or a customs union [0.6] is to 
discriminate [0.2] in favour of the partner countries [0.3] and therefore 
against the world [0.5] er so which is entirely against the whole [0.5] essence 
[0.5] of the GAT [0.2] the [0.2] er agreements and the W-T-O [0.5] so article 
twenty-four permits [0.4] this major break [0.6] er from the principle of non-
discrimination [0.5] but i'll deal with that next week [0.6] er 'cause it's a 
topic which [0.6] er has come to the fore [1.2] particularly given the 
proliferation of [0.7] er these [0.2] preferential trade agreements as Bhagwati 
[0.2] prefers to call them [0.9] er [1.5] i mean at the moment i think there's 
about a hundred-and-six [1.0] preferential trade agreements have been notified 
[0.7] to the W-T-O [0.4] and not all agreements are notified [0.8] er so [0.2] 
there's something in n-, [0.2] in excess [0.6] of a hundred-and-six 
preferential trade 
agreements [0.7] er and the p-, [0.7] as i say the previous [0.2] past [0.9] 
ten years or less [1.1] have seen a proliferation of these agreements [0.3] er 
i mean everybody's signing agreements as if there was no tomorrow [0.6] er [0.
4] which is entirely contrary to all that we were saying [0.5] about the 
Uruguay round [0.4] and the move towards [0.3] a rules based system for 
international trade [0.5] and the principle of non-discrimination that 
underpins [0.4] all of the [0.2] new [0.4] er international economic order [1.
8] so one of the questions really i mean one of the fundamental questions which 
people are asking themselves today is why [0.3] you know why in a world in 
which on the one hand [0.4] we strengthened [0.5] the general agreement on 
tariffs and trade [0.5] and we have the general agreement on trade and services 
[0.5] and trade related intellectual property rights agreements trade related 
investment measures [0.6] er [0.3] and so on [0.4] i-, particularly the 
strengthening of the di-, the [0.4] er dispute settlement [0.4] process [0.6] 
all of that you know we we emphasized [0.4] really was to underpin the [0.3] 
spectacular growth of world trade that we've seen [0.7] er so why at this time 
of all times [0.5] do we see this [0.3] huge increase [0.4] in the number of 
preferential trade agreements [0.5] which is fundamentally based on 
mercantilist philosophy isn't it [0.2] i mean the view that [0.5] you know we 
sign up agreements between ourselves [0.4] er and keep out the rest of the 
world you know [0.5] we sort of concentrate the gains from trade [0.5] er 
between us at the expense of or [0.2] partly at the expense of the rest of the 
world [0.5] so why that's one of the big questions that we'll [0.2] continue to 
come [0.4] to to come back to [1.2] er [1.0] i don't think anybody knows the 
answer to that one [0.5] er but we can at least speculate on it [1.7] and of 
course as Bhagwati puts it as well [0.2] are they are they obstacles [0.7] to 
the development of a [0.2] non-discriminatory [0.2] free trade world [0.8] or 
are they simply stepping stones [1.1] which might be the apologist case if you 
like [0.5] for customs unions and free trade agreement [1.8] stepping stones in 
the sense that [0.6] er [0.4] you first of all [0.7] er [0.7] free up trade 
between 
the partner countries [0.7] and maybe deepen relations between you [0.9] er and 
having adjusted to that [0.3] you can then go on [0.4] to [0.4] er free trade 
[0.5] on a [0.2] worldwide basis [0.9] and particularly perhaps for developing 
countries [0.6] er that might be very attractive [0.2] rather than go suddenly 
for broke [0.6] you know suddenly [0.7] when your barriers to trade as we've [0.
2] discussed in the past have been very high [0.4] very high tariff and non-
tariff barriers [0.7] er [0.3] and you [0.7] you know rapidly take them away 
over a short period of time expose yourself to world trade [0.5] that's a 
pretty frightening thought [0.5] er for for any country [0.6] so maybe a 
regional free trade agreement [0.3] particularly with [0.4] an industrialized 
country a large industrialized country like United States [0.6] or a regional 
grouping like the E-U [0.6] that might be a sort of stepping stone [0.3] so you 
free trade first of all with the [0.2] the big [0.3] industrialized market [0.
5] and you adjust to that [0.5] and then you go in to [0.4] er liberalized 
trade [0.5] on a on a worldwide basis [0.2] and that's the sort of 
optimistic view if you like [0.6] of [0.3] er the role of free trade agreements 
[0.9] er [0.4] in which case they're stepping stones [1.1] to er [0.7] er final 
free trade [1.1] or are they obstacles in the way that i indicated at the 
beginning they might be [0.4] 'cause fundamentally [0.2] they're discriminatory 
[0.7] and the more agreements you have [0.4] the more discrimination we have in 
the world [0.7] and therefore [0.8] we're running quite contrary [0.9] to the 
fundamental principle [0.6] of the W-T-O [0.3] principle of non-discrimination 
[1.0] so [0.2] that's the big debate and we [0.6] there's no answers to that 
one [0.5] you just have to [0.9] really [0.8] make up your own minds [2.7] so 
first of all let's go through with the basic economics of it i say my apologies 
to those who've done this before but it's such an important topic [0.4] it 
comes up in all sorts of areas [1.3] er so what i'm going to do [0.6] is er put 
up the diagrams [0.5] and then get those of you particularly well anyone [0.3] 
but particularly those of you who've done E-U and developing countries course 
[0.5] er to then explain the diagrams to me [0.6] rather than me do 
it [1.6] so let's see if we [0.8] when we get this thing focused in this 
ghastly room that we have [17.0] least it's not as bad as the Palmer building 
is it where you've got the [0.3] the screen up one end and people are sitting 
up the other end i mean that is really [0.4] truly awful [1.6] okay [2.8] well 
the starting point [0.5] on the analysis of [1.5] er preferential trade 
agreements [1.4] really was by [0.7] put up by Jacob Viner [1.5] er [1.3] who 
[0.2] pointed out [0.4] that [0.6] er [1.2] preferential trade agreements on 
the one hand [0.4] freed up trade between the partner countries and therefore 
the theory of comparative advantage can work [0.6] okay [0.5] but of course it 
was only partial liberalization [1.1] er it discriminated against the countries 
[0.9] and so [0.3] it was er Viner [1.6] who [3.0] coined the terms [0.3] trade 
creation [1.2] and [0.3] the next diagram that we'll do trade diversion [2.8] 
er have we got [0.3] a spare handout [2.4] oh you do right [1.0] [1.3] 
sm1130: 
nm1128: [3.1] okay so trade creation then this is comparative advantage working 
[0.5] mm [1.0] but of course only between [0.2] the member countries [1.0] mm 
[2.1] er [1.8] this diagram here [1.1] er this is [0.2] a [0.5] 
preferential trade agreement [0.6] between [0.3] a developing country [0.8] 
right [0.2] which is er [0.4] labelled L-B-C here [1.6] and [0.3] the European 
Union [0.3] E-U [2.8] er [0.4] and we're looking to see what happens in the 
developing country here [2.1] er the the argument's a general one [0.2] but er 
[0.4] purposes of [0.3] our interest let's look at the developing country [0.2] 
side of the equation [1.0] er [0.7] now in this case here [0.7] the European 
Union [0.9] is the cheapest source of supply [0.8] er [0.6] of the imported 
goods [0.7] okay the rest of the world [0.6] the dearer source of supply 
somewhere up here so we can forget about them [0.8] okay [1.2] so we're simply 
we're importing [0.2] from the E-U [0.7] er which is the cheapest source of 
supply [0.8] prior to the preferential trade agreement [0.9] there is the [0.2] 
tariff [0.7] tariff [0.5] is the distance between [1.0] P-star-E-U [0.3] and P-
E-U here [0.6] okay [1.0] so that's the [0.5] that's the height of the tariff 
[2.9] er [0.4] and prior to the preferential trade agreement [0.4] we're 
importing [0.2] M-O [0.8] from [0.8] the E-U [1.6] tariffs then disappear [1.5] 
okay [0.8] and [0.3] er [1.4] we then [0.8] er [2.4] expand our imports from 
the E-U [0.6] upto M-F-T-A [0.9] imports under the [0.5] free trade 
agreement [2.1] mm [3.5] okay [1.3] first of all first question for you [0.8] 
er [1.9] how do consumers gain [0.3] from this [2.7] in the di-, in terms of 
the diagram [0.6] what can you show has been the gain in welfare to consumers 
[0.4] from signing the free trade agreement [0.6] yeah [0.6] 
sm1131: can provide them choice [0.9] [0.7] not very good price [0.3] 
nm1128: right 
sm1131: goods [0.5] [0.5] 
nm1128: right 
sm1131: [0.8] his prices [0.8] and a wider choice of foreign goods [0.9] 
nm1128: okay so they pay a lower price [0.7] er than before [0.2] mm [0.7] and 
they've got a wider choice of goods [0.6] there's something else purely 
analytical terms 
sm1132: C-N-D [0.5] 
nm1128: sorry 
sm1132: C-N-D 
sm1133: [0.6] 
nm1128: okay [1.1] so they pay a a lower price [0.2] for the previous level of 
imports [0.4] M-F-T-A [0.4] er sorry M M-O [0.2] right [0.8] but then also what 
happens because the price falls [0.5] what else happens [1.1] 
sm1132: consume more 
nm1128: they they consume more that's right [0.4] and there's the wider choice 
which you said [0.3] we'll come back to that one later on [0.6] we're just 
dealing with a particular product just now so [0.5] they gain in two respects 
[0.4] they gain [0.4] that [0.3] the previous level of imports they can buy 
cheaper than before [0.3] mm [0.5] and then 
because the goods are cheaper [0.8] they move down their demand curve [0.5] 
okay [1.0] er consuming even more [0.6] mm [0.8] so the gain in the consumer 
surplus [1.7] is this [0.3] area in here [1.4] someone just define for me what 
do we mean by [0.2] the gain in the consumer surplus [1.2] it's a technical 
term in economics what does it mean [3.2] 
sm1134: does it [0.2] mean how much [0.2] work consumer's doing to pay [1.2] er 
[0.2] difference of [0.4] how much [0.5] 
nm1128: that's right [0.4] that's right exactly that's a [0.3] that's a very 
good definition of it [0.3] okay [0.3] so the consumer surplus [0.5] er is [0.
4] er [0.3] i mean let's [0.6] er [0.4] well let's take a price [0.6] er [4.9] 
er well someone describe to me in terms of the diagram what it means [0.5] if 
it's under what you mean maybe i'll leave it to you [3.4] it's the difference 
between what people will be willing to pay and what they actually have to pay 
[1.4] 
sm1135: [0.3] 
nm1128: sorry 
sm1135: the price that they're willing to pay s-, [0.2] that should be the 
price P-E-star [0.5] and the that actually pays P-E-U 
sm1134: P-E-U 
sm1135: [0.4] 
nm1128: right [0.6] right [0.3] right okay [1.1] 
yes about right so [0.3] so the consumer surplus then [0.3] is the increase in 
the area under the demand curve [0.5] okay [1.0] so [0.3] er [0.2] that's what 
i-, if you take any particular level of imports imports M-O [0.2] okay [0.7] er 
they'd be willing to pay [0.3] as you said [0.2] P- [0.2] E-U-star [0.8] but 
they actually only have to pay that [0.5] okay [0.6] so they gain that about 
here [0.4] right [0.5] and similarly all the way down the demand curve [0.2] 
it's only the very last unit [0.6] that's consumed [0.3] all right [0.7] at 
which the price they have to pay [0.4] is just equal [0.5] at the margin is 
just equal [0.2] to the price [0.4] er that they'd be willing to pay [0.7] for 
all the intramarginal units [0.6] they'd be willing to pay a higher price [0.4] 
but they don't have to [0.6] okay they just have to pay [0.5] price P-E-U okay 
[0.4] so the area under a demand curve is the consumer surplus [0.5] mm [0.9] 
and what we're measuring here is the increase in the consumer surplus [0.5] as 
a consequence [0.4] of [0.4] er [0.3] the abolition of a tariff [1.6] area A-B-
C-D [1.1] okay [0.9] we then divide that up [0.3] okay [0.7] er [0.3] i think 
it [0.2] pretty well speaks for itself [2.3] the loss of tariff revenue of 
course is by the government [0.3] in the developing country [0.2] mm [0.6] i er 
[0.2] going back to what we were talking about this morning [0.3] if Morocco [0.
5] er signs a free trade agreement or so in-, er indeed it has signed a free 
trade agreement with the E-U [0.8] then [0.3] one major impact [0.3] on on on 
Morocco [0.7] is that previously [0.3] i think something like twenty per cent 
[0.5] of government revenues in Morocco came from import duties [0.4] most of 
those were from the E-U about three-quarters of its imports [0.4] come from the 
E-U [0.7] well [0.7] once the agreement's fully in place [0.4] that source [0.
7] of government revenue will disappear [0.4] mm [0.9] er it's a very important 
element [0.4] it's a er a c-, a a very important cost [0.7] to [0.2] 
particularly to developing countries and signing [1.0] free trade agreement 
with industrialized countries [0.4] so that loss of government revenue [0.4] is 
the [0.4] is the size of the tariff [1.0] P-star [1.0] against P [0.2] okay so 
that's the height of the tariff [0.3] multiplied by [0.2] the previous level of 
imports [0.9] M-O [0.6] 
mm [0.6] so [0.3] that's the tariff [0.3] it used to be [0.2] applied to 
imports from the E-U [0.6] that's now disappeared [0.7] so [1.5] the difference 
between those two prices multiplied by [0.4] the previous level of imports [0.
4] I-E in the area A-B [0.6] is [0.3] the loss of tariff revenue [0.7] by [0.7] 
er Morocco [0.5] or where it happened to be [5.1] so that element under the 
demand curve [0.8] the increase in the consumer surplus A-B-C-D [0.4] is made 
up of two components [0.6] mm [0.8] the first one's a pure transfer [1.2] mm [0.
5] it's a transfer [0.5] from the government [0.2] of Morocco [0.7] to the 
consumers in Moroco [0.8] mm [1.6] so [0.2] one just cancels out the other [0.
8] all right [0.6] net [0.5] er there's no welfare gain [0.7] in that sense [0.
9] all right there's a gain in consumer surplus [1.4] but that chunk of the 
consumer surplus in here [0.6] is just [0.2] a decrease in government revenues 
[0.5] and that's transferred to consumers [0.8] through the lower price [0.4] 
that they pay for the previous level of imports [0.5] one balances out the 
other exactly [0.6] er [0.4] zero change in terms of welfare [0.9] unless you 
like to say that well [0.7] it's better off if [0.5] er consumers gain [0.5] er 
[0.2] than 
if governments get their revenues but [0.4] as economists we're we're very 
neutral in all those things all right [0.5] er so we don't make value 
judgements [0.5] as to whether governments should consume [0.4] or whether 
private individuals or firms should consume [1.0] point of view of the economy 
[0.7] that's simply a a transfer [1.0] er [1.1] no welfare effect at all [0.8] 
so [0.3] the net welfare effect then [0.5] is [0.3] that the two tri-, the is 
the is the triangle here [0.7] plus this whatever that shape is [0.4] i've 
forgotten my methematics somebody tell me [laughter] er [0.3] D in there [0.5] 
er [0.7] it's those two areas C-plus-D [0.3] is the net [0.2] welfare gain [0.
5] okay so cons-, the gain and the consumer surplus [1.4] minus this transfer 
element A-B [0.6] so we're left with [0.3] this area in here [1.1] so that's 
the welfare gain [1.8] unambiguously a welfare gain [0.6] to [0.2] the 
developing country [1.6] from the [0.4] er [0.6] abolition of the tariffs the 
free trade agreement [0.9] and that's what Viner called [0.6] trade creation [1.
2] mm [3.0] the consumers [0.6] er [0.7] are able to [0.8] purchase [0.3] er [0.
2] a higher level of imports [0.7] at [0.5] a lower price [4.7] let's 
look a little bit further now [0.4] er i've sketched in here [0.5] not terribly 
well but i hope it's clear [0.7] what's going on behind the scenes here [0.6] 
because this is the demand for imports and the demand for imports [0.5] is a 
residual demand [0.7] mm [0.9] it's the difference between [0.3] domestic 
demand [0.3] and domestic supply [0.8] okay [0.2] that's imports [0.9] mm [0.8] 
'cause we assume that the good is produced [1.2] within Morocco [0.8] within 
the developing country [0.5] er as well as imported from the E-U [0.9] we'll 
come back to that assumption later [0.4] but [0.5] that's the basic assumption 
[0.4] it's the same product [0.5] produced within the [0.2] er Morocco [0.8] 
and also imported [0.8] so imports are the difference then between domestic 
demand [0.9] all right the demand in the developing country [0.3] and supply in 
the developing country [1.4] mm [1.3] so let's look now at this [0.3] what lies 
behind this trade creation gain [2.5] what are its two components then [1.9] 
imports rise [0.2] for two reasons [0.5] what are they there's rise in imports 
in M-O [0.4] M-F-T-A [0.5] it's for two reasons [0.9] what are they [0.6] 
sm1132: [0.2] [cough] [0.5] the [0.3] position of tariffs [0.4] which creates 
obviously a lower price and er [0.7] greater consumption [0.4] 
nm1128: right [0.5] 
okay [0.2] so that's the movement down the demand curve here [0.5] okay so the 
lower price [0.2] we demand more of something [0.2] if it's cheaper [0.2] we 
buy more of it [0.8] right that's one component [0.4] and the second component 
[1.8] of the rise in imports [4.3] how about the left hand side [1.4] 
sm1135: 
nm1128: right okay specifically what's happening [0.2] the the tariffs taken 
away [0.3] so [1.6] competition [0.5] 
sm1132: will destroy the er [1.1] unproductive er [0.2] enterprise 
nm1128: or the less efficient one 
sm1132: or the less efficient 
nm1128: the less efficient ones that's right [0.3] okay [0.3] so we move back 
down [0.2] the supply curve [0.3] in the developing country [0.3] okay [0.4] so 
we take away the tariff protection [0.5] okay [0.9] the the marginal producers 
then [0.5] the ones that could only survive [0.9] under tariff protection [0.6] 
now simply go under [0.7] yeah 
sm1136: i have just one question er [0.5] [1.1] [0.7] [0.8] 
nm1128: o-, 
sm1136: [0.5] [1.8] [0.7] 
nm1128: yes i mean you're you're right [0.4] but [0.4] but y-, you're sort of 
[0.2] jumping the gun as it were you're so you're moving ahead in the in the 
analysis that is indeed the fear [0.2] okay [0.4] that we we've 
talked about the infant industry arguments the reasons for protection [0.5] so 
maybe you shouldn't be signing just yet [0.3] that's right [0.2] that's right 
[0.4] that's right maybe [0.5] you know [0.8] i mean i i showed a pretty steep 
curve here [0.4] all right [0.3] which indicated [0.4] that [0.5] they were 
indeed vulnerable [0.3] right i deliberately drew that supply curve quite 
steeply [0.5] for precisely the reasons you've given [0.3] okay [0.5] but 
there's an awful lot of firms [0.7] that need the tariff protection [0.9] 
because we're dealing with a developing country [0.7] er they're still learning 
by doing [0.4] er [0.3] things i'll be going onto in a moment on on economies 
of scale and production [0.4] you know [0.2] they they just entered the 
manufacturing sector fairly recently [0.3] they're still feeling their way 
they're still learning skills [0.6] and they're still [0.2] moving down their 
long run average cost curve and so forth [0.5] er [0.6] and is suddenly bang 
the protection's taken away [0.3] and [0.2] they go [0.2] straight down the 
supply curve here [0.3] right [0.3] yeah [0.6] but we'll come onto that in a a 
moment that's a good point [0.7] er [0.3] so [1.4] er [0.3] i've got a 
situation here then where [0.4] er the increase in imports is due to two forces 
[0.6] the first one is the movement down the demand curve for the product in 
the developing country [0.8] something's cheaper you buy more of it [0.9] the 
second element [0.6] is [0.4] that the [0.2] doing away with the tariff 
protection [0.5] does away with the less efficient producers [0.7] mm [0.8] 
they may be infant industries [0.5] too bad the infant never grows up all right 
[0.4] er [0.9] er [0.4] and that's the second reason then why imports rise [0.
7] mm [3.6] er [2.7] right let's explore that a little bit further now [1.3] er 
[1.0] given that theory [1.9] suppose you had [0.6] er let's go back to last 
term now [0.5] okay [0.6] where we talked about [0.5] the possibilities of a 
free trade agreement [0.7] er [1.1] well certainly er on on the other course i 
talked about [0.5] er [0.4] a free trade agreement between the E-U [0.6] and 
say sub-Saharan African countries [0.4] mm [1.3] er so we're talking here about 
countries [0.2] particularly [0.5] er low levels of income low levels of 
industrialization [0.2] and the 
rest [2.4] given the analysis that we've got there [1.2] do you think the trade 
creation [0.2] i i'm lost to the fact that the E-U as i say is [0.2] [cough] [0.
4] er [0.6] you know planning to sign free trade agreements with [0.2] various 
regional groupings of these countries [0.6] er no later than two-thousand-and-
eight [0.5] mm [0.2] two-thousand-and six two-thousand-and-eight [1.3] er [0.7] 
given then a free trade agreement between the E-U [0.2] and sub-Saharan African 
countries [1.2] do you think the trade creation effects would be large or small 
[6.5] 
sm1135: 
nm1128: right [0.6] 
sm1135: 
nm1128: so it i-, w-, so so trade creation would be [0.5] large or small [1.5] 
sm1135: large [1.6] 
sm1132: small 
nm1128: ah [0.5] [laugh] right [laughter] [0.2] you're saying small [laughter] 
[0.4] 
sm1132: 'cause i think [0.3] what they were saying that that result [0.6] 
result packed in in [0.5] small trade creation [0.3] 
nm1128: because [0.6] 
sm1132: well because the sort of fact you got a less developed country er 
nm1128: mm 
sm1132: which [0.4] is [0.3] 
sm1136: [1.3] 
sm1132: products [0.2] will [0.5] what was [0.6] manufacturing [0.2] er 
everything else from the whole production [0.5] will not be able to compete er 
[0.5] against the E-U [2.3] 
E-U of their countries producers [0.2] 
nm1128: well if if it couldn't compete against it okay [0.6] all right [0.9] 
then [0.2] following what we've just said just now 
sm1132: right yeah 
nm1128: [0.4] okay there's going to be a big surge in imports 
sm1132: mm 
nm1128: that's going to wipe out the local industry [0.6] okay 
sm1132: but then again we did mention earlier first term [0.6] that er [1.1] 
it's not just that tariffs 
nm1128: well all that yes 
sm1132: not sure whether they're er [0.2] will be removed or not 
nm1128: it will oh yes i mean because [0.2] all all the non-tariff barriers 
will be reduced as well as the tariffs or at least most of the non-tariff 
barriers [0.4] all the import quotas import licensing [0.5] everything else has 
to go in a free trade agreement i mean it is [0.3] free trade [0.3] all right 
[0.5] right we can [0.5] i mean we can't actually look at the details you have 
to [0.9] say well it's not quite as simple as that but [0.4] let's just keep it 
at that for the moment [0.2] because that's more or less what it is [0.5] but 
what i'm getting at here though is [0.2] say we're talking about Chad or Mali 
[0.3] right [0.4] some very very poor countries [0.7] er you know 
sm1136: yeah sorry 
nm1128: the industry that they've got 
sm1136: this is this is what i thought er 
nm1128: right [0.3] 
sm1136: what it is about [0.3] is [0.4] whether the [1.4] what the E-U c-, 
could export [0.2] whether it is suitable [0.3] for the er [0.5] er [0.3] 
African mark-, er market [0.4] for Mali for example [0.3] i mean the Mali [0.2] 
er consumer [0.8] does he really want er [0.6] a car or does he really want 
nm1128: well he probably wants it [laughter] 
sm1136: well he wants a car yeah he wants a car but can he pay for it 
nm1128: yes [0.2] yes 
sm1136: so that that's that's what i was going to [0.3] 
nm1128: right [0.2] 
sm1136: yeah [0.3] 
nm1128: okay 
sm1136: so 
nm1128: and in terms of local production then what's what's what sort of [0.7] 
goods are going to be produced [0.7] you know manufactured goods right 
sm1132: [0.6] 
nm1128: right [0.6] so a lot 
of the local industry will be producing for the domestic market [0.2] okay [0.
5] and [0.3] these goods will be pretty basic consumer goods right 
fundamentally selling in terms of price [0.3] okay they're cheap [0.5] they use 
local materials local labour [0.5] er [0.4] but not exactly state of the art [0.
4] they're not beautifully designed coloured [0.3] whatever [0.2] right [0.6] 
but [0.2] they're basic essentials of life [0.3] in that country [1.3] er [0.7] 
they're [0.4] you might call them non-tradeable goods [0.4] a lot of them [0.5] 
mm [0.8] er they are purely produced for the domestic market [0.9] they might 
have a regional market but that's [0.3] tha-, that's another story [0.2] all 
right [0.3] they're certainly not goods [0.3] that compete [0.3] with the sort 
of goods which you'd import from the E-U [0.5] what sort of goods are you going 
importing from the E-U [0.6] if you're Chad Mali [1.3] et cetera [1.1] Uganda 
[2.0] what what sort of goods are you going to be importing from the E-U [1.6] 
capital goods investment goods [0.2] intermediate products okay [0.9] not 
produced in the local economy on the whole [0.4] that's the key point [0.3] 
okay [0.5] so the key word i'm 
getting round to then [0.5] is that [0.2] one of the important aspects of the 
trade creation effect [0.7] is the degree of substitutability [1.2] between [0.
6] domestic production [0.7] and imported goods [0.7] okay [1.2] in other words 
my supply curve that i've got here [1.0] okay [1.5] er [2.3] and i've drawn 
that quite steeply [0.8] indicating that the degree of substitutability [0.3] 
is quite small [1.3] mm [1.0] most of the goods you import from the E-U [0.6] 
are not produced in the domestic economy [1.3] so if you like the trade 
displacing effect on domestic production [0.5] is also going to be [0.3] quite 
small [1.1] now it depends on the economy [0.5] right i've talked about Chad or 
Mali [0.5] if we're talking about Cote d'Ivoire [0.5] er Zimbabwe [0.5] Kenya 
[0.9] er [0.2] well [1.3] there's going to be a greater degree [0.4] of [0.4] 
er overlap [0.4] if you like [0.6] between [0.9] some domestic production 
anyway [0.8] and [0.3] imports from the E-U [0.4] mm [0.8] so if er the price 
of [0.3] of goods fall [0.5] imported from the E-U [0.7] er [0.5] then [0.2] 
that's going to [0.5] squeeze out [0.4] er less efficient [0.4] less desirable 
goods [0.3] produced by some [0.4] or er d-, domestic producers [0.5] in er in 
the country [0.3] they could only 
survive [0.5] behind high tariff protection [0.4] but you still got a lot of 
other production [0.6] which is simply doesn't compete [0.6] er with imports 
from the E-U [3.5] that's important because this theory was developed by Viner 
[0.8] in the context particularly of explaining [0.5] er the common market [0.
4] all right we're going back now to the nineteen-fifties [0.6] mm [0.5] if 
you're [0.4] talking about a free trade agreement a customs union [0.8] i'll 
give you the difference between those later on [0.9] er [0.4] between [0.4] 
industrialized countries in Europe between France and Germany and Italy [0.4] 
right [0.8] then the degree of substitutability [0.9] between imports and 
domestic production is going to be very high [0.3] mm [1.0] so the trade 
creation effect on that side is potentially very powerful [0.6] mm [0.8] er but 
going to be going to be a wide range of goods which are [0.3] produced for the 
domestic economy [0.3] which you could just as well import from France or 
Germany or Italy [0.2] mm [1.0] and so [0.5] er the trade creation effect would 
be very powerful [0.7] er [0.2] in an industrialized country but between an 
industrialized and a developing country [0.3] we would expect it to be very 
much less [2.2] but when you come to look at the empirical estimation [0.4] of 
[0.5] er the effects [0.3] when you when you read the literature [0.3] on on 
this such as it is [1.8] er you will see no discussion at all or very little 
discussion [0.5] about this particular point [1.8] er nobody asked that 
question [0.9] about [0.7] er [0.6] is the degree of substitutability between 
imports and domestic production [0.2] high or low [0.9] in particular what 
value does it have what is the elasticity of substitution [0.8] absolutely no 
one knows [0.3] mm [0.3] if anybody finds a reference which tells you what [0.
2] that figure is [0.3] even for one [0.3] one developing country [0.5] i'd be 
very grateful [0.6] mm seriously grateful because [0.6] part of my job is to 
try and [0.2] measure these blasted things all right [0.4] i've never found [0.
5] a source [0.3] which is actually [0.4] empirically measured the elasticity 
of substitution [0.6] for imports from an industrialized country [0.2] and 
domestic production [1.8] everybody just assumes a number [1.4] most of the of 
the 
literature on that is for industrialized countries [0.3] not for developing 
countries and it's a very important difference [1.0] the other element is the 
extent to which the decrease in price for the increased comsumption [0.3] all 
right [0.6] er and er that [1.3] well again is an empirical [0.5] fact i mean 
[0.3] it just depends if we're talking again about very poor countries [0.3] mm 
[0.4] with very low levels of income [0.9] er [0.6] again the sort of comsumer 
goods which the E-U produces [0.4] are not going to have a very big market 
there [0.3] the the the rich elite [0.4] will be able to buy their Mercedes or 
whatever [0.6] er but er [0.2] they probably buy them anyway whether the tariff 
was there or not [0.5] and indeed because they're rich elites they're probably 
not paying their tariff anyway [0.3] they're finding some way round it [0.6] so 
er [0.3] i don't think we need worry about that side of things [0.6] what it 
will do however [0.3] is make investment goods and intermediate goods [0.3] 
cheaper [1.2] mm [0.2] than they were before [1.0] mm [3.2] what effect do you 
think that would have on 
the economy [1.7] 
sm1136: 
nm1128: well [0.2] certainly the short term effect will be a rise in imports [0.
2] we've just shown that [0.3] 
sm1136: yes 
nm1128: okay [1.0] we haven't looked at the export side of this yet [0.3] that 
might also rise it depends what went before 
sm1136: 
nm1128: but but but but but let's but let's leave the balance of trade aside 
for the moment we're still quite a way from looking at that [0.5] let's just 
look solely at the effect [0.4] of [0.2] doing away with the tariff [0.6] and 
moving [0.4] down the demand curve [0.5] and this case the demand for 
investment goods and intermediate products [0.9] what effect's that going to 
have on the economy [1.2] 
sm1135: [0.2] 
nm1128: sorry i'm not i [0.2] i don't want to look at the export side at the 
moment okay i'm just looking at [0.4] you know [0.6] if if if investment goods 
and intermediate goods are cheaper [0.6] what effect's it going to have [0.7] 
sf1137: well it should somehow get an increased investment in the country [1.2] 
nm1128: that's it [0.3] that's that's what we're looking for [0.2] okay [0.6] 
so investment goods intermediate 
goods that you need in production [0.3] all right [0.5] both those factors you 
can buy capital goods cheaper [0.5] and the costs of production are lower [0.3] 
all right [0.4] than they were before [0.4] and given the height of the tariffs 
and non-tariff barriers [0.5] okay [0.5] er that er e-, existed before [0.4] er 
[0.6] that fall is going to be quite substantial [1.0] er so that could be a 
powerful boost [0.3] to investment in the economy [0.9] remember one of the 
puzzles in many developing countries is that [0.6] we have [0.3] a basis for 
saving and investment [1.1] which very often doesn't occur [0.4] we can look at 
countries with similar income distributions and similar levels of per capita 
income [0.5] but widely different saving and investment rates [0.7] all right 
[0.3] and we're always puzzled why [0.4] and one of the reasons for that [0.5] 
is the price of capital [0.4] okay [0.6] if the price of capital falls [0.9] in 
terms of interest rates but also in terms of price of capital goods [0.4] 
intermediate goods need in production [0.5] then that could stimulate a a rise 
in production [1.0] and [0.2] just to briefly [0.3] deal with 
your point [0.5] er [0.6] the balance of payments might deteriorate [0.3] okay 
[0.2] as we import these goods [0.4] then production rises [0.5] all right [0.
3] and production [0.2] both of exports [0.5] and of import substitutes [0.5] 
to the extent that they exist [0.8] er [0.4] could then [0.4] move the balance 
of payments the other way [0.9] mm [0.7] so it's a [0.2] it's an empirical 
question [0.5] 
sm1136: [0.9] 
nm1128: yes i mean the-, there's a problem of financing it all [0.4] that's 
right which we haven't discussed here we've just said imports rise [0.6] the 
you know what you're saying to me is where does the foreign exchange come to 
buy it all right [laughter] and we just call that oh that's an adjustment 
problem you know [laughter] er [0.2] but of course it's more than that you're 
absolutely right [0.5] er [0.2] so [0.2] if this is going to work in a 
developing country and it's a very [0.2] very useful point [0.6] er [0.2] 
probably with the the developing country needs aid [0.7] all right [0.7] er [0.
3] the government will need aid [0.3] because its [0.4] i-, its revenues have 
fallen [0.5] 
quite substantially [0.5] okay [0.4] and it needs to change its structure of 
taxation [0.5] from heavy dependence on import duties [0.4] towards indirect 
taxes value added tax or something like that [0.6] that's going to take time 
expertise [0.5] et cetera [0.3] right so they'll need [0.4] aid and technical 
assistance [0.3] to bridge them over that [0.5] particular adjustment problem 
[0.8] 
also we've got a rise in imports with nothing happening on the export side [0.
3] s-, in the in the short term [0.3] which may be several years [0.8] er [0.5] 
that's got to be paid for [0.4] or alternatively there's a balance of payments 
crisis [0.3] currency devalued you get inflation [0.3] all sorts of nasty 
effects could arise [0.3] so again [0.9] we're saying that you need financial 
assistance [0.4] foreign exchange needs to come in [0.6] in order to [0.4] 
enable a country to buy these investment goods [0.5] and er and these 
intermediate goods [0.3] er [0.4] then its production can expand [0.6] er [0.4] 
as production expands [0.5] er and tradeable goods supply of tradeable goods 
rises [0.7] so you don't need the aid [1.2] that's the theory [3.1] okay well 
we can squeeze quite a bit out of that diagram [0.5] er [0.3] and it is 
important that you understand the mechanics okay [0.3] too often [0.6] i think 
the the the textbooks simply [0.2] throw that up [0.4] there's A B C and D 
that's the consumer surplus you know blah blah blah on to the next thing 
on to trade diversion [0.2] mm [0.5] think of what's going on [0.6] because if 
you if you think of what's going on [0.4] behind the scenes here [0.6] then you 
can say [0.8] is the trade creation effect going to be large [0.2] or going to 
be small [0.9] and [0.3] what are the adjustment problems for the country [0.4] 
in terms of the government revenues [0.5] and in terms of [0.4] dealing with 
the rise in imports [0.6] whenever we just said [0.5] exports haven't increased 
[2.8] any [0.2] questions on that before we go on to the next one and trade 
diversion [2.2] er happy [2.1] okay [0.2] right [0.5] well [0.7] that's the 
welfare gain [0.2] okay [1.2] er remember in this view of things [0.3] the fact 
that you wipe out a bit of local industry [0.7] er certainly means they're 
inefficient producers [0.3] all right [0.3] er which you know [0.3] er 
shouldn't be there in the first place because they're only there under 
protection [0.5] they go away [0.5] that releases resources [0.4] which can be 
more productively used in the rest of the economy [0.5] all right that's the 
assumption behind it [0.5] but they may 
just be infants that are ready to grow up [0.7] 
sm1135: can we add [0.3] [0.6] 
nm1128: no [0.5] because [0.7] that's just going to effect that distance up 
here [0.7] okay [0.9] er if what you're saying is [0.2] i mean i haven't 
actually marked that in because we got enough rubbish on this diagram [0.4] 
that's the [0.2] tariff inclusive price if there was such a price for the rest 
of the world in fact we're not importing from the rest of the world at all [0.
6] so [0.3] er i'm not [0.3] i'm not concerned with that [0.2] no [0.8] er [0.
5] but you're ju-, you're w-, what you're saying is that [0.5] er instead of 
being up here the rest of the world [0.3] tariff inclusive price would be up 
here somewhere [0.4] just above that [0.7] but that's irrelevant to the 
argument [0.2] that doesn't affect the magnitude [0.5] of our [0.5] squares and 
triangles and rectangles and [0.2] things underneath [0.5] mm [0.5] 
sm1135: 
nm1128: see 
sm1135: [1.0] 
nm1128: i think [0.8] what it wa-, what's con-, confusing you here is [0.2] on 
this simple diagram [0.7] er we import [0.7] only from the E-U [0.8] we're not 
importing anything from the rest of the world [0.9] okay [0.3] i mean i 
think what you're thinking in [0.2] the back of your mind is in reality we 
import from both [0.7] right [0.7] er but to simplify the analysis [0.6] 
because the E-U is the cheapest source of supply in the world [0.3] we only 
import from the from the E-U [0.6] there's no imports from the rest of the 
world [0.6] so we don't need complicate the picture but [0.7] that er i see 
your point [0.2] yes in reality we do it [4.5] okay [1.2] let's look at the 
other side of things 
nm1128: okay 
nm1128: now [0.5] er again [0.3] let's go through the mechanics of this [0.5] 
mm [1.3] er [1.7] whoops [3.1] this thing [2.1] it's [1.4] difficult when it's 
this close to the screen [6.6] can read that [0.6] okay in this case it's the 
reverse situation to the one we had before [0.8] so [0.4] here the E-U is not 
the cheapest source of supply in the rest of the world [0.7] on the contrary [0.
3] the tariff inclusive price [0.3] P-E-U [0.3] one-plus-T [0.7] er is higher 
[0.5] than the price for the rest of the world the rest of the world now is the 
cheapest the U-S Japan [0.5] et cetera [0.4] are a cheaper source of supply [0.
7] mm [1.3] er [0.4] so [0.5] er [1.7] at that tariff inclusive price for the 
rest of the 
world [1.1] Morocco [0.2] is importing [0.2] M-zero [0.8] mm [1.7] er [1.4] now 
that the tariff is taken away [1.4] from imports from the E-U [0.3] but not 
from the rest of the world [1.4] mm [1.4] the picture totally reverses [0.6] 
okay [1.6] because the rest of the world has to pay a tariff [0.7] but the E-U 
doesn't [0.9] okay [1.8] we now import [0.4] we switch [0.7] our sources of 
imports [0.2] from the rest of the world [0.3] to the E-U [0.3] the E-U now 
becomes [0.5] the cheapest source of supply [0.5] mm [0.5] not because it's the 
most efficient [1.5] but because the E-U [0.2] doesn't have to pay a tariff [0.
7] imports from the E-U don't have to pay a tariff [0.6] whereas those from the 
rest of the world do [2.0] so we're discriminating [0.3] against [0.5] the rest 
of the world [1.0] in favour of the E-U [0.9] hence we switch our imports [0.9] 
totally [1.7] away from the rest of the world [0.3] to the E-U [0.8] even 
though the E-U is not the most efficient source of supply in the world [0.9] 
right [0.5] it's because [0.6] either they're dearer they're less efficient [0.
2] less well designed [1.1] but nevertheless they don't have to pay a tariff [1.
3] the rest of the world does [0.7] and so they capture the 
market [1.3] well that's a welfare loss [0.7] mm [1.3] er [1.6] in its simplest 
terms a welfare loss because [0.3] there must be something wrong with E-U goods 
all right otherwise we'd be importing from them in the first place right [0.6] 
we've talked in terms of price here [0.7] but remember [0.3] that we've got the 
price and non-price characteristics of products [0.5] and maybe they're just 
less well designed investment goods and intermediate goods they're less 
efficient [0.7] they're not state of the art the latest technology that you get 
from the U-S or Japan [0.8] er [0.9] nevertheless you import from the E-U [1.6] 
okay [0.5] yeah the analysis is exactly the same as before [0.5] er the gain in 
the consumer surplus is the area under the demand curve okay [0.4] which is er 
[0.8] A-plus-C [1.1] okay [0.9] that is that wedge in there [1.4] er [1.9] 
slightly different of course because the loss of tariff revenue [0.7] is the 
difference between the rest of the world's price [3.1] er a world prices and 
the tariff that's the height of the tariff sorry [0.4] that's the 
height of the tariff in here [0.7] okay [2.4] so we were getting this tariff 
revenue [1.1] from the rest of the world [0.5] plus this area up in here [0.6] 
so [0.2] the tariff revenue from the rest of the world before [0.4] was A-plus-
B [0.8] okay that's the height of the tariff multiplied by the level of imports 
[0.9] okay [0.6] well we're losing that tariff revenue [2.2] er [0.5] part of 
that [0.3] loss of tariff revenue [0.3] is going to who [0.4] where's B going 
to [3.8] 
sm1135: [1.1] 
nm1128: in [2.2] where [0.3] which producers are we talking about you're right 
sm1135: E-U the E-U 
nm1128: in the E-U [0.2] that's right [0.5] so [0.2] B [0.7] is a loss of 
tariff revenue [0.5] being handed to E-U producers [0.7] okay [0.7] because 
they are [0.3] at a higher price [0.5] than the price for the rest of the world 
[0.7] okay [0.9] so there's a [0.5] a a transfer [0.3] that's a welfare loss to 
Morocco [0.8] it's a transfer of tariff revenue [0.9] which was being 
previously being collected from the rest of the world [0.4] now going to [0.3] 
Philips or wherever it happens to be the [0.3] immediate [0.2] right [0.6] er 
[2.6] to er [0.2] either [0.5] boost their 
profits or [0.5] because they are [0.2] higher cost source of supply whatever 
it is [0.5] that's a transfer to the E-U [0.6] from the government of Morocco 
[1.5] er [4.6] so we've got the gain and the consumer surplus [0.6] okay the 
area under the demand curve [0.3] right [0.3] we've got the loss of tariff 
revenue [0.4] right [0.4] remember that neutral [0.5] so the net effect [0.4] 
is [0.2] C [1.1] okay [0.3] that's the [0.2] so the gain and the the the net 
welfare effect [0.7] to to Morocco in terms of the gain in consumer surplus [0.
7] they're paying a lower price [0.4] of increased quantities of imports [0.5] 
is C [0.3] the triangle [0.7] mm [1.6] minus [0.4] the loss of tariff revenue 
[0.6] which has been transferred [0.4] to the E-U producers [0.7] okay as we've 
just said [2.1] so [0.7] the net welfare effect on Morocco [0.5] is [0.2] the 
gain and the consumer surplus [0.9] right minus [0.3] the loss of tariff 
revenue [0.2] transferred to E-U producers [3.4] purely [1.5] as a matter of 
geometry if you like [0.7] all right [0.5] the rectangle B [0.5] is going to be 
bigger [0.5] than [0.5] the triangle C [0.6] mm [1.6] unless unless [0.2] what 
[1.8] 
sm1135: 
nm1128: yes back to your point i think you were making earlier that's 
right [laugh] [0.2] okay [0.3] unless go on spell it out [0.9] 
sm1135: unless the the difference [0.3] er margin between [0.3] the er the rest 
of the world and the E-U [0.3] 
nm1128: mm 
sm1135: is is smaller 
nm1128: yes [0.2] okay [0.3] right so [0.2] the rest of the world was just a 
fraction cheaper than the E-U [0.4] okay [0.5] then that rectangle's going to 
be a very small area [0.3] right [0.5] and so it is technically possible [0.5] 
that that could be a very tiny rectangle [0.5] compared to the triangle C [0.5] 
in which case there would be [0.2] also welfare gain [0.5] but none of the 
textbooks say that [1.1] okay [0.7] er you won't find that in a textbook for 
the simple reason i think [0.4] that it's most unlikely to occur [0.2] but it's 
technically possible [2.0] so that's trade diversion that's a welfare loss then 
[0.7] it's a welfare loss because [2.2] you're transferring government revenue 
[0.3] from Morocco to the E-U [0.7] and transferring income [1.0] from Morocco 
[0.4] to the E-U straightforwardly [0.6] right [0.3] it's [0.2] it's like A 
going in the reverse direction [1.6] er and secondly [0.5] er [1.0] we weren't 
buying fr-, 
anything from the E-U before [0.7] presumably because it was a crummy source of 
supply [0.5] okay [0.5] er you know it was it was dearer it was less efficient 
it was yesterday's technology it was poor design [0.2] nobody wanted the 
blasted thing [0.3] okay [0.7] 
now suddenly [0.5] er you're not buying from the rest of the world you're 
buying only from the E-U [0.5] solely [0.2] solely because [0.3] of the 
preferential trade agreement [0.9] solely because [1.1] the E-U no longer has 
to pay tariffs [0.5] but the rest of the world still has to [0.6] okay [0.3] 
that's a distortion [0.7] in the market [0.8] it's a distortion [0.3] which is 
welfare reducing [0.5] for Morocco [1.1] it it's welfare reducing for the world 
as a whole of course as well [0.6] 'cause they there's a loss of production [0.
6] so [0.2] at a global level there's a loss of welfare [1.4] borne by whoever 
it was that was exporting to Morocco before [0.2] U-S [0.2] Japan et cetera [0.
2] to the other developing countries [1.3] so at a global level it's a loss of 
welfare [0.5] and it's a loss of welfare [0.3] to Morocco itself [5.1] i 
emphasized the the the impact on 
developing countries partly 'cause that's what we're interested in [0.9] but 
also because again you'll read in the literature [0.9] again in mostly in the 
development literature i have to say [0.9] that [0.2] you needn't worry about 
trade diversion [0.5] 'cause that's only a global loss of welfare [0.2] okay [0.
3] that the costs of trade diversion are borne [0.5] by the rest of the world 
[0.3] all right [0.5] that's nonsense [0.2] okay that's complete and utter 
nonsense [0.3] for the reasons that we've given [0.7] mm [0.7] from the 
straightforward transfer of of government revenue to the E-U [0.5] and you're 
buying [0.2] a less efficient [0.3] product than you were before [0.8] mm [0.5] 
sm1135: in this case it should be better for the devloping countries 
nm1128: well [0.2] that that's [laughter] 
sm1135: [0.8] 
nm1128: yes i mean that's what Bhagwati [0.2] so so so why do you sign the 
wretched agreements all right [laughter] [0.4] er [0.5] the point i-, i mean to 
be a-, a-, again [0.2] be impartial on this one okay because Bhagwati [0.3] 
hates preferential trade agreements [0.4] so let's be neutral about all this [1.
2] er 
there's the the [0.3] the [1.7] the [0.4] the the static [0.3] welfare effects 
[1.0] of [0.3] the preferential trade agreement [0.6] are there for the net 
effect between the positive trade creation [0.7] on the one hand [0.7] and the 
trade diversion effect on the other [0.3] okay [0.5] and if trade creation our 
previous diagram is greater [0.3] than trade diversion [0.8] then [0.2] Morocco 
gains [0.6] from the preferential trade agreement [0.6] okay so [0.2] it's [0.
3] as always it's plusses and minuses [0.4] okay we call swings and roundabouts 
[0.6] er [0.4] it's er [0.2] there's a gain the trade creation gain [0.2] the 
welfare gain on the one hand [1.0] and the trade diversion the welfare loss on 
the other and it's the net effect of the two [0.9] mm [1.9] so the change in 
welfare if you like [0.5] is trade creation [0.2] minus trade diversion [0.7] 
okay [4.5] let's look at the magnitudes of trade diversion again [0.5] our E-U 
Morocco agreement [0.8] mm [0.8] is it going to be big or small let's gask the 
same question as we did before and we said it's the net effect [3.0] what do 
you think [2.6] or [0.4] sub-Saharan Africa 
sm1135: 
nm1128: sorry [0.3] 
sm1135: 
nm1128: 
er is trade diversion going to be big or small [0.3] when you've got an African 
country on the one hand [0.3] and the E-U on the other [5.9] what would you 
expect it to be [1.5] same logic as we used before [0.4] 
sm1136: [0.8] 
nm1128: sorry [0.2] 
sm1136: [2.0] 
nm1128: yeah [0.2] you're right 
sm1136: 
nm1128: okay give yourself time 
ss: [2.2] 
nm1128: so substitutability [0.8] between [1.5] 
sm1133: [0.5] 
nm1128: sorry [0.2] 
sm1133: 
nm1128: yes okay [0.2] they're the ones that are in competition with each other 
[0.5] okay [0.9] so one of the key things is [0.5] what sort of goods is 
Morocco or Mali or Chad importing [0.7] from the E-U and the rest of the world 
[0.9] do you think there'd be [0.5] same goods or different goods [2.1] rough-, 
probably speaking [2.7] 
sm1132: should be the same [0.4] 
nm1128: yeah okay we s-, we said it would be investment goods and intermediate 
products [0.6] which largely weren't produced in the domestic economy it's a 
bit of a simplification that but it's not [0.4] wildly different from the truth 
[0.8] okay [0.6] and whether they're produced in the E-U [0.3] right 
whether they're produced in Germany or France or Italy [0.4] or Japan [0.4] or 
[0.2] er the United States [0.4] or Taiwan all right or or Singapore [0.3] okay 
[0.8] it's purely a matter of [0.6] price and technology and all the rest of it 
[0.3] okay it's going to be a similar sort of mix of goods [0.5] produced there 
[0.9] so what's that going to tell you about the elasticity of substitution [0.
6] be precise now [0.9] er between [0.9] imports from the E-U [0.3] and the 
rest of the world [1.0] 
sm1136: 
nm1128: yeah it's going to be very high 
sm1136: very high [0.4] 
nm1128: yeah [1.3] therefore the trade diversion effect will be [1.1] 
sm1132: high [0.2] 
nm1128: high [0.9] that's the key point [0.6] okay [1.5] so we would expect the 
magnitude of the [0.4] trade diversion effect [0.7] where the agreement is [1.
0] between [0.4] an industrialized and developing country we would expect trade 
diversion to be large [1.4] because the sort of goods you import from the E-U 
will be a similar sort of mix of goods [0.4] to the ones that you import [0.4] 
from other industrialized countries [0.2] okay [0.5] no big surprise about that 
[2.4] so the elasticity of substitution then [0.9] 
that's the [0.2] it will will be high [0.2] that's the key parameter [1.1] 
which will determine the magnitude of the trade diversion effect [1.0] mm [2.1] 
now surprise surprise [0.5] nobody's been able to measure that one either 
[laughter] er [0.3] i'm not sure why [0.6] er you can look at there's a book [0.
4] everybody uses by Leamer and Stern which came out in the seventies [0.4] on 
elasticities and international trade [0.5] and everybody [0.3] says well [0.2] 
they say the figure's three [0.5] so [0.2] i'm going to use three [0.3] er [0.
4] and that's the figure that they've had to use you know [0.6] people talk 
about the the elasticity of subsitution [0.3] as being three [0.4] for the 
purposes of measuring the trade diversion effect [2.0] do you think that would 
be a a sensible figure to use that we're talking about a free trade agreement 
between an industrialized and developing country [1.7] given what we've just 
said [3.5] you're shaking [0.3] no i mean [0.8] you expect it to be what [0.5] 
slightly more lot more [2.7] 
sm1136: 
nm1128: yeah a lot more [0.3] mm a lot more okay [0.7] 
again the estimates that we work with [0.6] are estimates produced [0.3] for 
trade between industrialized countries [0.7] mm [0.6] which is still possibly 
the relevant one to use mm [1.6] er [0.2] but given the structure of imports [1.
4] er being heavily concentrated in investment goods and intermediate goods for 
a developing country [0.8] i would imagine that the elasticity of substitution 
[0.6] for this sort of trade agreement [0.3] would be higher [0.4] than the 
elasticity of substitution for an agreement [0.3] say between Britain and 
France [0.2] but [0.3] you know we could debate about that [1.7] debate about 
that [0.8] anyway [1.6] so [0.2] going back to this then [0.8] trade creation 
[0.6] what conclusion did we draw about that magnitude [2.3] 
sm1136: low [0.3] 
nm1128: fairly low we wouldn't expect it to be very great [0.2] right [0.4] but 
the differences in levels of income in structures of production [0.7] et cetera 
[0.8] okay between the E-U [0.4] and the developing country [0.8] and trade 
diversion [1.7] high [1.2] so [0.2] without doing any numbers at all [0.2] all 
right [0.6] simply looking at the at the determinants [0.7] of [0.8] trade 
creation and trade diversion [0.8] we're going to say [0.3] that [0.6] trade 
diversion will be greater [0.5] than [0.2] trade creation [0.7] okay [0.9] in 
which case [0.6] welfare will decline [1.4] and it's going to be g-, [0.2] 
going to take an awful lot of persuading [1.5] to er [0.9] tell us otherwise [0.
6] the only question then [0.4] is how big [0.6] [laughter] [0.4] er [0.2] you 
know [0.4] er [0.9] how big is the loss of welfare going to be [3.4] okay 
everybody happy with the static [0.3] Vinerian model [2.8] yes [0.4] 
sm1136: sign this [0.2] 
nm1128: yes well that's [laughter] that's exactly the thing i was just going to 
say [laughter] i obviously led into it quite well [0.5] er why do they sign it 
[0.3] mm [0.6] er why why do you sign it [0.3] and really the lest of the of of 
the lecture and probably b-, [0.2] a bit of next week [0.3] going to be trying 
to [0.5] explore why that's what economists have done ever since [0.5] 
sm1136: [1.5] 
nm1128: yes i mean we-, the-, the-, there's various er things we'll be through 
that's right [0.3] where it's the sort of long runs so people say that's a 
static 
effect [0.5] okay that's the once and for all effect [0.4] but there's other 
beneficial gains to investment and blah blah blah and we'll be [0.3] doing that 
that's right [0.5] but [0.2] that's the starting point okay [0.3] why sign it 
[0.7] i've given you a th-, [0.4] a third diagram there [1.0] which er [0.3] is 
taken from Bhagwati 'cause i think it's a useful one [1.2] er it's a variation 
on [0.3] the [0.6] er [1.1] on [0.3] on the model [2.5] because one of the 
magnitudes of this [0.2] er effect [0.9] is going to [0.2] er is going to 
depend also on the share [0.9] of the E-U in the total imports [0.3] of the 
developing country [0.8] mm [0.5] that's clearly going to be very important [1.
1] but haven't said anything about that we've just talked about the magnitude 
of the tariff change [1.9] but clearly the magnitude [0.3] of the trade 
creation effect [0.6] will be larger [1.5] the larger the share of the E-U in 
total imports of the developing country [0.6] mm [3.0] and [0.5] conversely the 
trade diversion effect [0.3] okay [0.7] er will be [0.5] er smaller [0.9] the 
smaller the share of imports from the rest of the world [0.6] other things we 
need [1.2] in the E-U a caveat [6.3] 
so [0.6] we've implicitly i think [0.2] er [0.5] in our previous models assumed 
that the share of the E-U was quite significant [0.5] that's why you're signing 
the agreement [0.5] okay you're [0.4] basically it's the developing country [0.
5] signing [0.5] a free trade agreement with its major trading partner [0.8] mm 
[0.3] and that's the usual pattern [1.2] what we're looking at here is the case 
where the opposite's true [1.4] where the developing country is signing [0.2] a 
free trade agreement [0.7] with an industrialized country that's a minor [0.4] 
trading partner [1.1] an example [0.3] would be the Caribbean countries [0.4] 
signing a free trade agreement with the E-U [0.9] okay Caribbean countries 
fundamentally their trade [0.6] is with the U-S Canada [0.3] and other Latin 
American countries [0.6] and the E-U account for a very small proportion maybe 
ten per cent [0.2] at most [0.8] of total imports [2.0] nevertheless the 
Caribbean [0.5] is heading on the route of signing [0.3] a free trade agreement 
with the E-U [0.4] round about two-thousand-and-six two-thousand-and-eight i 
mean it's terribly complicated [0.2] er [0.5] 
political dynamite all round [0.4] for obvious reasons [0.5] the U-S are not 
exactly going to be jumping for joy [0.6] er and [laugh] [0.3] the Caribbean 
can't er [0.5] can't really er afford to upset the U-S so [0.3] not quite sure 
but [0.6] if they want to [0.5] preserve their [0.2] preferential access for 
their exports of sugar [0.3] and for bananas [0.4] which are terribly important 
to these countries [0.5] they'll have to sign a free trade agreement [0.2] 
that's the that's the big dilemma they're faced with [0.3] 
sm1136: [0.6] 
nm1128: sorry the banana war again yes [0.2] no yes there'll be another one 
[laughter] [1.1] so this is an agreement then between [0.2] er the Caribbean 
countries and the E-U [0.4] with the E-U [0.2] counting a maybe only a small 
proportion [0.4] of imports [0.9] well as i put here [0.9] er [2.0] it's a 
question of price-takers and price-makers all right that we talked about last 
term [0.6] er [0.9] here [0.5] fundamentally [0.4] prices are set by the U-S [0.
2] okay that's the big source of supply [0.6] okay [0.7] and E-U producers [0.
2] simply [0.4] er [0.6] sell [0.6] er in [0.2] in the market at the price set 
by the U-S suppliers okay they have they're such a small proportion of the 
market [0.5] that they have no influence on price [0.7] okay [0.6] common sense 
assumption [0.6] okay [0.7] let me see what [0.3] what happens in this case [1.
3] well again we've got [0.2] free [0.4] er [0.4] w-, er er free trade [0.4] 
imports from [0.5] er the E-U [0.7] er here [0.4] and imports from the rest of 
the world call that United States [0.2] okay [0.7] but the difference in this 
case [0.7] is that because the U-S [0.3] is the major source of supply it's the 
price-maker [0.8] perfectly elastic supply [0.5] okay [2.9] the Caribbean 
however is a distant market [0.8] er [0.3] for E-U producers [0.8] substantial 
transport costs [1.0] only a small proportion of their export's going there [0.
5] so transport costs would be a significant proportion of total cost [0.6] so 
the supply curve will be anything but [0.2] perfectly elastic [0.8] er [0.2] 
it'll be fairly steep [0.9] re-, reflecting the fact that they [0.4] command 
only a small proportion of the market [0.8] price is set [0.2] here [1.2] so [1.
3] the U-S sets the price [0.3] in the Caribbean market [0.5] the E-U [0.4] 
suppliers provide [0.3] m-, move up their supply curve [0.7] until they 
hit point B [0.7] okay [0.8] and [0.5] er at that point [0.4] which is set by 
[0.6] the U-S [0.8] er [0.2] price [0.2] plus the tariff [0.8] okay [0.6] er [0.
2] then [0.4] that determines [0.3] imports from the E-U [0.3] O-Q-one [0.8] 
okay [1.2] and then the rest of imports come from the U-S [1.0] now let's take 
the tariff away from [0.5] er [0.2] imports [1.0] from the E-U [0.2] but not 
from the U-S [1.0] okay [0.5] free trade agreement with E-U [0.5] mm [1.2] er 
[0.5] in that case then [2.1] we show the effect of that by an output movement 
[0.5] of the E-U supply curve [0.9] okay [0.8] er [0.9] in which case imports 
[0.5] from the E-U expand from Q-one [0.4] out to Q-two [1.3] okay [2.0] the 
important thing to note [0.8] is that [0.3] nothing happens [1.1] to [0.2] the 
internal price levels [0.5] in the Caribbean [0.8] 'cause they're set by U-S 
suppliers [0.6] so it's U-S supply [0.3] plus the tariff [0.6] so it's the 
tariff inclusive U-S price [0.9] which sets the domestic price level in the 
Caribbean [0.6] mm [1.2] what the [0.5] E-U exporters do is simply maximize 
profits [0.9] with price is set by the U-S suppliers [1.6] so [1.0] imports 
from the U-S expand from Q-one out to Q-two [0.3] mm [1.0] er [0.4] there's a 
loss of tariff revenue to the Caribbean governments [0.7] of A- [1.1] C- [0.3] 
G-E [0.3] 
okay that area in there where they previously collected the tariff [0.7] now [0.
4] that's being lost [0.8] and guess who's getting it [1.1] 
su1138: [0.9] 
nm1128: no the E-U [0.3] okay [0.4] that got to be the U-S are still paying the 
tariffs excuse me [0.7] er [1.1] the but but the [0.3] E-U suppliers aren't 
paying the tariff [0.3] mm [0.6] nothing's happened to the domestic price level 
'cause they're price-takers [0.6] okay [0.3] so that loss of tariff revenue [0.
3] goes straight into the pockets [0.3] of the E-U [0.2] exporters [0.9] very 
nicely thank you [0.4] mm [1.1] er [1.1] and that's it [1.4] there is no gain 
for the consumers [0.7] because nothing happens to the price [1.6] er [0.4] the 
[0.3] internal price level of the Caribbean doesn't fall [0.7] because [0.5] 
the E-U [0.6] er previously was accounting for maybe ten per cent of imports [0.
3] now goes up to fifteen per cent of imports [0.7] but it's not going to 
affect price [0.3] okay [2.9] you still get eighty-five per cent of [0.4] of 
imports coming from the U-S [0.3] that's what determines the internal price 
level in the Caribbean [1.7] so the price-makers [0.6] of the U-S exporters [1.
5] the E-U exporters 
are price-takers [1.0] mm [0.6] they can't influence price they're too small to 
do so [1.2] so they simply clean up [0.7] in terms of the of not having [0.4] 
having to pay the tariff [0.8] they previously had to [0.3] they simply [0.3] 
boost their profits [0.8] er no gain in consumer surplus [0.6] straightforward 
deterioration in the terms of trade from the Caribbean against [0.3] the E-U [0.
8] er straightforward transfer of government revenue [0.4] from the Caribbean 
governments and [0.3] people [0.9] to the E-U [0.2] producers [0.8] full stop 
[0.3] end of story [2.6] that's the price [0.3] of continuing to get access [0.
5] for your exports of sugar and bananas [3.1] and you can measure it [0.3] 
[laughter] [2.4] get to make the right assumptions [1.7] when i [0.3] i [0.3] 
actually went through this one when we because er as you know there's er all 
the [0.6] er will be up to about two-thousand-and-six two-thousand-and-eight [0.
5] the trade negotiations [0.4] er [0.2] going on [0.5] er [0.2] with the 
commission [1.6] er [0.3] over there that will be starting quite soon [0.4] and 
i went through that analysis er with the [0.3] and the with people over the the 
within the 
the commission [0.5] er there was a [laughter] [0.4] it wasn't favourably 
received [laughter] [0.6] er [0.4] people were unhappy with the idea that the 
price wouldn't change [0.5] er [0.3] but that's the reality i mean it's an 
empirical question [0.2] okay [0.7] but if you account for only ten or fifteen 
per cent of the market [0.4] and the Caribbean group [0.2] very helpfully [0.3] 
told me well actually that was a bit high [0.4] it's about seven or eight per 
cent actually you know in many countries [0.6] then you're a price-taker you 
don't influence price [0.4] and that's what the whole analysis [0.2] hinges on 
[0.7] er [1.2] so that's er by way of er a variation of a theme yeah 
sm1132: one question [0.4] the role of the U-S company in that last model [0.3] 
nm1128: yes [1.4] is to get very upset you know 
sm1132: [1.2] as a price-ma as a price-maker i mean [0.5] how [0.3] i mean how 
how will the U-S respond [0.9] 
nm1128: well they get very upset [laughter] [0.2] yes i mean er [0.2] it's 
obviously it's it's crowding out [0.3] er imports from the U-S [0.7] that's 
right [0.6] yeah [0.2] that's it 
sm1132: so [0.7] is there anything the U the U-S [0.8] will do in that 
situation 
nm1128: yes i mean that's the that's the big 
issue that's the dilemma which the Caribbean countries are faced with [0.4] 
sm1132: how 
nm1128: because at the at the [0.2] currently [0.4] they have [0.5] er [0.3] 
under the Caribbean Basin Initiative [0.6] they have preferential access to the 
U-S market [0.7] principally for clothing [0.2] i mean that's the key one for 
them really [0.7] er [1.0] you know [0.7] i can't imagine the U-S standing by 
and continuing to allow them that preferential access [0.6] while their 
exporters are saying but we're losing market share [1.3] 
sm1132: so isn't the isn't rea-, [1.3] to the er [0.8] Caribbean countries in 
this example [0.7] are better off sticking with the price-maker [0.9] than 
rather 
nm1128: and [0.2] but then if they don't sign the free trade agreement they 
lose their exports of sugar and and bananas [0.5] and that cause large scale 
unemployment in Jamaica and in the [0.6] er [0.2] you know the er [0.3] er 
Windward Islands [0.3] 
sm1132: but then again if if if that happens then the U-S [0.4] might retaliate 
[0.2] say well [0.4] you know 
nm1128: yeah 
sm1132: to import from 
nm1128: yeah [0.4] 
sm1132: Indonesia or somewhere else 
nm1128: and then the [0.3] so [0.3] so the guys in the in the in in 
the sugar and banana plantations [0.5] do all right but the guys in the 
clothing industry are unemployed 
sm1136: 
nm1128: [laughter] [0.2] yeah that's the dilemma they've got [1.2] 
sm1136: 
nm1128: right 
sm1136: [0.6] 
nm1128: yeah [0.4] 
sm1136: 
nm1128: mm 
sm1136: [0.2] 
nm1128: well [0.2] that is well th-, yes that is exactly what the Caribbean and 
and and CARICOM in particular the Caribbean community [0.4] which is a free 
trade agreement in fact it's it's moving over to a customs union [0.6] there [0.
3] and they're physically signing i mean some of those hundred-and-six 
agreements i mentioned [0.4] were between CARICOM [0.7] er and various Latin 
American countries 'cause they see that as being their future 
sm1136: 
nm1128: yes 
sm1136: 
nm1128: yeah [0.3] yeah that's right that's right so er better off [0.2] 
building up your trade with Latin America [0.4] yes [0.2] i mean [0.2] i a-, 
again it's an example of of [0.4] the patterns of trade not being determined so 
much by [0.4] purely economic considerations [0.4] as by a colonial heritage [0.
9] 
er that's why their export in sugar and bananas to Europe [0.6] er [0.3] in a 
free trade situation [0.7] they may or may not be doing so probably wouldn't [0.
8] er free trade probably sugar will be coming from India or from Brazil or 
somewhere like that [0.5] where a a very low cost producer well it's from 
Australia [0.2] are a very low cost producer [0.5] not from the Caribbean i 
mean that's a reflection [0.4] of the fact that were British colonies [0.7] er 
i'm not saying that market [1.8] er 
but and that's created a dilemma [0.9] and similarly with clothing you see the 
clothing industry [0.3] in Jamaica which is a quite an important source of 
employment for them that live there [0.9] is principally because of the [0.4] 
Caribbean Basin Initiative it's because of preferences in the U-S market [0.4] 
without those preferences [0.4] again in a free trade situation [0.4] the 
clothing would come from Asia [0.5] not from Jamaica [1.0] i mean Jamaica then 
says well what the heck are we going to produce [0.5] but [0.5] but [0.2] 
you've got the answer i mean the answer is that it'll be other things which of 
course we don't know about [0.4] because they don't exist [0.7] but [0.4] er 
the obvious trade pattern would be towards Latin American countries [0.3] that 
have a different resource base a different level of income [0.6] a different 
stage of technology [0.4] so the two economies are complementary to each other 
[0.4] and that's the future for these countries' problems [1.6] but that gets 
us away from [0.8] here anyway that's just er a variation on the [0.7] on the i 
mean th-, th-, the 
the previous models assume [0.6] that the [0.5] partner country in the trade 
agreement was a price-maker [0.3] okay [0.4] this is a case where [0.3] the 
partner country's a price-taker [0.6] with the rest of the world [0.3] 
determining the price [0.3] and that alters the analysis [3.3] okay so [0.2] 
why sign the damn thing [laughter] you know [laughter] er [1.9] and that's er 
as i say that's the question which everybody has er [0.7] you know [0.2] really 
[0.2] teased their brains about [1.7] er [2.8] you have to look to the so-
called dynamic [1.0] arguments okay [0.5] i don't like the term dynamic because 
we've nicked it off [0.2] thermodynamics or [0.2] physics or something like 
that [0.6] er [0.2] growth enhancing [0.2] i think is more accurate [0.3] okay 
[0.8] er [0.2] phrase so it's a growth enhancing [0.5] effects of a free trade 
agreement [0.3] what might they be [1.2] 'cause remember [0.3] trade creation 
and trade diversion [0.3] are once and for all [0.3] static effects [0.4] okay 
[0.3] they just have a once and for all impact [0.4] and that's it [0.3] okay 
[1.0] fundamentally what we're talking about here [0.2] is accelerating the 
growth of these countries [0.6] okay [0.4] it's a continuous 
process [0.8] so [1.0] okay [0.2] trade diversion might be greater than [0.5] 
trade creation [0.8] all right [0.7] but that's just a once and for all cost if 
you like [0.5] mm [0.9] er [1.1] is there something about the free trade 
agreements that [0.5] has a continuous effect [0.3] on [0.7] increasing output 
year by year [0.4] more rapidly [0.5] than would otherwise have occurred [0.4] 
if you hadn't signed the free trade agreement [0.9] and those who favour free 
trade agreements say those are the really important things [0.3] those growth 
enhancing effects [0.3] they're the really important ones [0.5] but they're 
difficult to measure [0.9] rather fortunate that perhaps but [0.6] er [0.3] the 
other ones are difficult to measure anyway [1.0] so the first one then [0.2] 
obvious one [0.4] is [0.2] er [0.2] economies of scale [0.8] okay [1.5] 
basically the argument is a simple one [1.8] er [1.1] the developing country [1.
6] has access to a wider market [0.9] so [0.3] previously if you imagine 
producers [0.3] simply selling [0.5] in the home market [1.0] the home market's 
small [0.5] 'cause you're a small country small size of population [0.6] and 
you've got a low level of [0.5] per capita G-N-P [0.8] 
so [0.4] er [0.2] the effect of that [0.4] is er [1.3] er [0.7] to mean that [3.
5] if that's the [0.4] long run average cost curve [4.1] er [0.8] then [1.0] 
you know [0.2] it [0.6] you're probably this is [0.8] cost [0.8] output [4.0] 
your small size of the domestic market [5.7] producing a P-A just producing [0.
4] er a production for the [0.3] for the for the home market [0.8] er [0.9] 
means that you're operating at quite high [0.3] average cost of production [1.
5] you then sign a free trade agreement gives you access to this huge E-U 
market [0.7] i don't know how many million people there are i've forgotten how 
many there are in the E-U 
sm1132: two-hundred-and-forty something like that 
nm1128: right 
sm1136: three-hundred-and 
nm1128: yeah 
sm1136: [0.5] 
nm1128: yeah three-hundred-and-fifty-million people okay [0.3] and instead of 
your population of [0.4] twelve-million [laughter] er [0.5] so [0.2] you don't 
need too many of that three-hundred-and-fifty-million people to buy your goods 
[0.5] to be able to move somewhere out here [0.6] okay [1.3] er so [0.4] you 
may er having [0.8] free access [0.6] unrestricted access to this huge market 
[0.6] enables you to increase exports [0.7] expand productions way above the 
constraint [0.5] of the [0.6] er 
domestic market [0.6] and you move down your long run average cost curve [0.7] 
okay [0.8] and that makes you even more competitive of course [1.2] than you 
were before [0.6] and so exports expand even more [0.3] so you get a [0.2] a 
virtuous process [0.8] if you're moving down [0.4] if you expand your exports 
[0.4] you're moving down the long run average cost curve [0.5] because you're 
more efficient than you were before producing a [0.3] lower average cost than 
before [0.3] you sell more output [0.3] and so you go on [0.9] moving down [0.
4] the average cost curves in that way [1.4] 
sm1132: i'm sorry just er [0.3] one point [0.3] is the assumption here that er 
[0.7] we have free er [0.4] trade agreement just between [0.7] the developing 
countries and [0.2] for example the E-U [1.0] er but what what if we say well 
[0.5] got er [0.2] free trade 
nm1128: mm 
sm1132: [0.3] you know w-, with the whole world [0.3] then obviously [0.6] do 
we have still economies of scale then [0.6] that is the question [0.2] 
nm1128: well then it gets complicated for the reasons that you've [0.2] 
indicated because everybody else has got a free trade agreement [0.2] all right 
[0.6] er so 
you've just got free trade i mean ultimately then you've just got world free 
trade [1.3] in which case comparative advantage should work on a on a world 
basis [0.2] all right [0.5] and [1.0] provided you've got a comparative 
advantage in this product [1.0] the same argument should hold [0.8] mm [1.6] i 
mean [0.4] the only difference is that this might hold for a product in which 
you don't have a comparative advantage [0.5] on a worldwide level [0.5] all 
right [0.4] but you do in terms of trade with E-U [0.5] so if you just had a an 
agreement between Morocco and E-U [0.3] nothing else in the world [0.8] all 
right [0.2] Morocco can move down its long run average cost curve say for 
clothing [0.4] it's an important industry in Morocco [0.6] okay [1.4] mm [0.7] 
er because it doesn't have to compete with Asia and the rest [0.5] but if the E-
U signs agreements up with all the Asian countries and Eastern Europe and 
everybody else [0.2] okay [0.4] then that might not hold [0.3] you had to have 
a comparative advantage at a world level [1.3] so er [0.4] i mean in a sense 
you see what what i'm saying is 
that [0.6] er [0.2] a preferential trade agreement can create a false 
comparative advantage [0.8] mm [1.1] because [0.2] you have free access to the 
E-U [0.6] but the rest of the world doesn't [0.4] okay [0.8] then you're more 
competitive but it's a false [0.4] comparative advantage [0.9] mm [0.5] and as 
more agreements are signed [0.5] you might well find that you've committed 
yourself to produce clothing [0.8] but then [0.2] you're left high and dry 
because you're a high cost producer [0.8] just that the Caribbean countries [0.
6] er [0.2] had a false comparative advantage in selling bananas in the U-K 
market [0.6] or sugar cane in the U-K market [0.6] only because they have 
preferential access [0.2] to to to Britain [0.7] but Australia [0.6] Brazil [0.
7] er Ecuador in the case of bananas and so on [0.5] er didn't [0.3] mm [0.6] 
so it created a false comparative adavantage they built up these industries [0.
7] and now [0.4] when we've got free trade virtually on those products [0.6] er 
they can't survive without 
preferences [1.1] 
sm1132: so basically [0.4] as the [0.3] for example the European Union er signs 
more and more trade agreements 
nm1128: yes 
sm1132: which it's which is in the process of doing so now 
nm1128: yes that's right 
sm1132: with the [0.5] Caribbean with Eastern Europe and [0.2] other countries 
[0.5] er 
nm1128: that's right [0.6] 
sm1132: and so so basically that preferential [0.7] er lose 
nm1128: margin 
sm1132: er it loses it's er significance 
nm1128: absolutely [0.2] absolutely [0.2] that's right [0.3] that's right [0.8] 
er yes [0.2] i mean it's er [0.8] yes i mean it [0.2] whi-, which of course [0.
5] er [0.3] those who say [0.3] therefore free trade agreements are stepping 
stones [0.6] to multilateral trade liberalization might [0.3] exa-, you know 
say well that's exactly what i'm saying [0.4] mm [0.8] that they're just 
stepping stones [0.2] to world free trade [0.8] i shall point out at the end 
it's not quite as simple as that [0.7] 'cause the agreements differ [0.2] in 
their content [0.5] and that creates barriers to trade [0.8] but that's getting 
a-, that's jumping the gun a bit [1.2] but that's right we're talking as if it 
was the only 
agreement in the world [0.4] mm [0.7] er [0.7] obviously if it isn't [0.3] then 
that [0.6] that reduces the gains [0.4] to Morocco [0.3] or wherever it happens 
to be [0.7] but then we move over more to [0.6] just global or multilateral 
trade liberalization getting closer to that [0.7] perhaps [2.5] okay so the 
first dynamic gain might be economies of scale you move down your long run 
average cost curve [0.9] the second one the familiar one to us from any trade 
liberalization [0.6] er greater competition [0.6] mm [1.1] 
to the extent [0.2] that imports [1.0] compete with domestic production we're 
back to that argument again [0.6] the elasticity of substitution between 
domestic production [0.3] and imports [0.6] if that's small [0.4] then [0.7] 
that argument's not terribly important [1.4] er [1.2] but it's still going to e-
, [0.2] exist [0.5] a wider choice of goods [0.4] okay previously you'd all 
sorts of barriers to trade [0.8] i mean [0.6] many developing countries in the 
past anyway [0.7] simply prohibited a whole range of imported goods [0.4] so as 
to conserve foreign exchange [0.4] for so-called essentials [0.5] mm [0.7] er 
[0.3] free trade [0.5] widens choice [0.3] that's a 
a welfare gain in itself [2.0] increase in foreign direct investment [0.2] 
people particularly emphasize this gain here [1.1] and [0.6] er [1.7] the two 
terms here investment creation [0.4] and investment deflection [1.9] er [9.7] 
investment creation somebody tell me about that [2.3] 
sm1135: er [0.7] it's like 
sm1135: the share of the market [1.8] [1.8] 
nm1128: right [0.2] okay [0.5] so we've got two [0.2] forces working just like 
the trade aspect [0.5] okay [1.1] first of all let's again go back to our 
agreement between E-U and Morocco [0.4] mm [0.8] now er er previously we had 
barriers to trade between the two countries [0.7] er [0.8] let let's assume 
that was the case [1.0] er [0.2] now we've a situation where there's no 
barriers to trade at all [1.8] a producer of say clothing in France [1.3] where 
labour costs are high [0.8] mm [1.2] can now close down that factory [0.8] 
relocate it in Morocco [0.3] where labour costs are much lower [1.9] er and 
then export [0.5] er the output back into France again [1.6] so that the [0.8] 
er the manufact-, the the the clothing manufacturer [0.5] can now serve the 
domestic market in France [0.4] much more cheaply than they could before [0.9] 
er [0.2] as a result of the 
preferential trade agreement [1.0] mm [1.2] so [0.4] er that's one gain from 
the free trade agreement [1.2] yeah 
sm1135: so the [0.3] [cough] there would be in er inves-, investment diversion 
from the [1.7] 
nm1128: in the sense of [0.3] 
sm1135: in the sense of [0.2] maybe er [0.6] an investor will move er [0.5] and 
then the export [0.2] 
nm1128: yes that was the case i was i was i was going though just now 
sm1136: [0.6] 
nm1128: well it's i-, er er it's normally called in-, [0.2] in-, [0.2] 
investment deflection [0.3] that one 
sm1136: 
nm1128: okay [0.7] er but it's it's a bit i mean it depends which as you say 
which wh-, which standpoint you view it from [0.8] er but if you're viewing it 
from the E-U point of view [0.4] it's investment deflection [0.8] okay [1.5] er 
[0.6] in the case of the [0.6] er say [0.2] the United States [0.2] okay [0.6] 
that was [0.3] previously [1.2] selling goods in the [0.2] you know that that 
was exporting goods [0.3] to Morocco [0.3] mm [1.0] but now a trade diversion 
against it [0.6] okay [0.9] it may wish to retain its market share [0.4] in 
Morocco [0.9] okay [0.3] in which case it replaces its exports [0.4] by 
investment [0.5] in [0.4] a plant [0.5] which will [0.3] produce [0.2] the 
goods previously exported [0.5] and that's called investment creation [0.8] 
right it's called [0.3] i-, it's the creation of 
investment because investment [0.4] is taking the place [0.4] of exports [0.4] 
as a way of servicing the market [6.1] so [0.3] yeah [0.3] 
sf1137: [0.6] 
nm1128: yes previously i mean let's say they were selling say agricultural 
machinery to Morocco [0.5] and they were exporting that from the U-S to Morocco 
[0.9] now because [0.5] of [0.2] o-, of trade diversion [1.0] the-, the-, they 
they've lost the market [0.7] the market was big enough [1.1] then they might 
say we want to retain our market share [0.5] by jumping [0.2] the tariff wall 
[0.6] in in Morocco if there's still place for it [0.6] and setting up an 
assembly plant for [0.5] the combine harvesters the tractors [0.3] in in 
Morocco [0.4] and in s-, and and and [0.2] and continuing [0.7] to retain its 
market share [1.6] 
sf1137: 
nm1128: right 
sf1137: 
nm1128: i-, [0.6] i-, [0.4] i-, [1.1] investment deflection [0.3] yeah 
sf1137: invest deflection 
nm1128: yeah investment deflection is France [0.8] er [0.5] closing down a 
factory in France [0.4] and setting up a clothing factory in Morocco [0.7] it's 
deflecting investment [0.4] from investment in the home country [0.3] to [0.2] 
investment [0.5] in in Morocco [1.4] 
sf1137: 
other word for deflection [0.3] 
nm1128: these are the [0.3] technical terms that are used in the literature [0.
2] 
sm1135: de-investment 
nm1128: sorry [0.2] 
sm1135: de-investment [1.4] 
nm1128: yes i mean i-, [0.2] it's ca-, it's called deflection [0.6] because [0.
4] it's simply in-, in-, investment taking place in a different geographical 
location [0.6] mm [0.6] but the total amount of investment hasn't increased [0.
7] all right [0.4] it's just been deflected [0.3] to a different geographical 
location [0.4] hence the word deflection [1.0] [laughter] [0.3] not a not that 
[0.6] i mean if you can imagine sort of investment flowing [0.3] in into France 
[0.4] over the years [0.5] then the preferential trade agreement's signed [0.6] 
and it's closed off there and it's deflected off down towards Morocco [0.5] 
okay [1.4] that's [0.3] whereas the other case is creation of investment that 
didn't exist before [0.5] okay [0.3] you're not closing anything down in the 
United States necessarily [0.3] i mean they'll probably sell the factory 
somewhere else [0.7] what you're doing is [0.5] in-, instead of servicing the 
market through exports [1.0] you now 
service it through investment [0.2] in a production facility [0.7] so it's i-, 
it's creation of investment [0.3] that didn't exist before [0.9] 
sf1137: but it is the U-S would have to look what to do with 
nm1128: yes but we don't ask that question [0.2] that's right [laughter] [1.3] 
'cause that's the rest of the world [0.5] and the rest of the world's very big 
[0.6] all right [0.8] er and Morocco's very small [0.4] so we needn't bother 
about that question that's all we're saying [4.3] so [0.5] er [0.4] whoops [3.
7] the the the first case [0.2] er we-, well i mentioned here anyway the the 
the investment deflection [0.2] can be quite important i i [0.2] didn't pick 
clothing by accident [0.6] er [0.2] 'cause it's the one in which you very often 
see this [0.4] er [1.3] where [0.4] er [0.6] particularly the the labour 
intensive stages [0.3] of the production process [0.6] could often be [0.2] 
relocated [0.8] from [0.3] the industrialized country [0.2] to the developing 
country [0.4] that's what the U-S is doing in Jamaica [0.2] talked about the 
Caribbean Basin Initiative agreement [0.7] er [0.2] this is what France indeed 
has done in Morocco all right [0.5] and that is what Egypt is hoping will 
happen [0.4] er if it signs a free 
trade agreement [0.4] er with the E-U [0.4] that there'll be this outward 
processing [0.8] er will take place on quite a large scale [1.0] whether that's 
beneficial or not for the country is another question [0.2] we talked about 
that under on direct investment [0.6] but that would be a clear case of 
investment deflection mm [0.5] investment creation would be the U-S [0.3] 
coming in to Egypt [0.4] because [0.5] they er they're they're losing their 
market [0.3] and it's a big market for the U-S [0.4] yeah 
sm1132: just one question [0.5] say you're a policy maker in Morocco or in [0.
3] the Caribbean [0.8] and er [0.6] you've done your analysis you've looked at 
the gains you have [0.8] and of free trade agreements well i've got on one side 
er [0.7] er [0.3] trade creation [0.6] the other hand i've got [0.6] trade 
diversion [0.3] but i also have dynamic er [0.6] dynamic gains along with that 
nm1128: right 
sm1132: [0.5] er i mean [0.5] you have nothing to measure you have [laughter] 
nm1128: no that's right 
sm1132: you know [0.3] how do you how do you decide this case and it's very 
difficult 
nm1128: yeah 
sm1132: it's a very difficult choice 
nm1128: er 
sm1132: [0.5] to make [0.3] 
nm1128: yeah i mean you just have to in the end you have to trust your 
judgement [0.7] er [0.5] all you can do however is analyse the situation [0.3] 
okay [0.2] and what this does is provide you with a framework of saying [1.6] 
are these things going to be important [0.2] okay let's go back to the Morocco 
case [0.3] all right [1.1] er Morocco actually had [0.3] already had 
preferences with the E-U [0.4] okay [1.0] so [0.4] at the stimulating an 
effects on its exports [0.2] were zero [1.2] 
okay [0.6] because they already had preferential access under a bilateral 
agreement [0.5] so Morocco could say [1.1] forget that [0.5] economies of scale 
[0.4] okay [0.7] because we've [0.2] we [0.3] we reaped those in the past [0.2] 
all right [0.3] er er and we're not being given any more preferences [0.8] 
greater competition [0.7] er [0.7] well [0.9] the goods that we import from E-U 
[1.0] compete to a limited extent with domestic production but not a lot [1.0] 
so that's not going to be great [1.1] wider choice of goods [0.4] similar sort 
of argument [0.7] er maybe a little bit more than we did before [0.6] because 
we had but we're already dismantling barriers to trade anyway [0.3] you know [0.
9] er so that's not going to be great [0.3] increased foreign direct investment 
[0.6] er [1.0] well [0.7] what's changed you know [0.3] er [0.6] the only thing 
that's changed that may be important [0.4] is [0.4] that [0.2] my tariffs on 
importing goods setting up a production facility in Morocco [0.6] er [0.6] the 
er er i-, i-, er it's certainly i-, [0.2] it's more profitable to set up a 
production facility in Morocco than it was before [0.7] if a French [0.5] er 
clothing manufacturer was setting 
up a factory [0.3] in Morocco [0.4] all the machinery [0.4] and the 
intermediate goods would have to pay duty [0.7] previously [0.6] er [0.2] but 
[0.4] er they [0.2] they no longer have to do so [0.9] er [0.6] but the duties 
usually are not terribly high on these products [0.2] in developing countries 
it's consumer goods that carry the very high tariffs [0.8] i mean it may be 
tariffs of [0.4] you know ten per cent or so so it might make a difference [0.
6] er but not a [0.3] a dramatic amount [0.9] and am i going to get investment 
from the rest of the world [1.6] i'm a tiny little market [0.2] right [0.7] if 
this is Brazil that's signing an agreement [0.5] okay [0.5] then sure [0.2] i 
mean as soon as as [0.2] er as the Mercasor agreement was signed [0.2] American 
investment poured in [0.7] er to retain market share [0.2] very big market [0.
7] Brazil er b-, t-, er er er er Morocco [0.5] what's its population did we say 
[1.1] 
sm1133: 
nm1128: sorry [1.4] 
sm1133: [0.3] 
nm1128: is it as much as that 
sm1132: i don't think it's that much 
sm1133: 
sm1132: it's even less than that 
nm1128: mm yes [0.2] it's pretty small 
sm1133: 
nm1128: and and Tunisia's 
what about twelve-million [0.5] 
sm1135: [0.3] 
nm1128: yeah [1.6] yeah [0.2] yeah [0.5] so we've we've got a small [0.2] er a 
small market [0.2] so [0.2] thi-, this is the way you'd go through it [0.4] 
yeah 
sm1135: [0.8] 
nm1128: right 
sm1135: [0.7] 
nm1128: yes if you 
sm1135: 
nm1128: mm 
sm1135: the er access to er [0.5] Moroccan or Egyptian market 
nm1128: mm 
sm1135: [1.2] 
nm1128: that's right [0.9] so y-, but you you have to i mean going through the 
point y-, y-, d-, you already had preferential access before [0.5] so you ask 
the question how much has it increased [0.5] all right 
sm1135: yeah potential 
nm1128: yeah [0.6] now one key thing though is that [0.6] you you may have had 
preferences before but they were unilateral preferences [0.5] a free trade 
agreement [0.4] is [0.3] a a binding agreement [0.2] mm a legally binding 
agreement [0.2] of indefinite duration [0.9] and that might give the investors 
[0.2] greater confidence [0.4] than they had under the previous thing [0.6] so 
that might be a big plus [0.3] and these are the questions i mean what this 
does is provide a framework [0.4] for asking a whole series of questions [0.9] 
that's i can forget about that 
one that's not going to be terribly big [0.3] that's going to be small [0.7] 
this one might be big it might not [0.2] we have to look at that more carefully 
[0.4] and that's what it does [0.4] and then at the end of the day [0.4] you 
make a judgement [2.9] but the big question too is all of these things i've 
mentioned here [0.3] you could get from unilateral trade liberalization [0.5] 
at least a lot of it anyway [0.4] mm [1.0] er i mean you wouldn't nes-, i mean 
you wouldn't get the so much the investment creation investment deflection 
effects that wouldn't tell us very much [0.7] but the other ones economies of 
scale greater competition [0.5] wider choice of goods [0.7] er [1.0] we'd all 
[0.4] i would all get if i simply lowered my barriers to trade with the world 
as a whole [1.1] and there'd be no trade diversion cost [0.9] mm [5.7] so again 
we come back and think why the hell did we sign the agreement right [0.8] er [0.
6] okay [0.2] there might be this [0.2] er investment creation investment 
deflection effects to the extent that they're important [1.0] er [0.2] as i say 
[0.4] i would [0.7] 
think fundamentally that depends how big an economy you are [0.6] mm [0.9] if 
you're a small economy i wouldn't expect it to be terribly great [0.7] may be 
wrong [0.8] er Mauritius might be an example where it was quite substantial [0.
5] mm [0.7] er where [0.4] you know it's it's the [0.2] third largest exporter 
of woollen clothes in the world [0.6] and it's a tiny little island [0.8] and 
that's [0.2] largely because of preferences [0.5] so [0.7] yeah we got to be 
careful with that one [0.4] i-, i-, it could be important [1.1] er [1.6] but er 
[0.9] so so maybe that's important but [0.2] in terms of stimulating foreign 
direct investment because [0.3] duties on imports of capital goods and 
intermediate goods have come down [0.4] well [0.2] liberalize to the world as a 
whole [0.4] mm [0.5] so investors can then buy [0.8] capital goods and 
intermediate goods at world prices [1.1] mm not simply [0.5] er at whatever 
price [0.3] the E-U exporter [0.2] sells them to you [1.2] so we still got [0.
8] really we still haven't really answered the question [1.1] why sign the 
agreement [0.5] we've got the gains from trade [1.0] but why not just get 
those [0.4] on a non-discriminatory basis through unilateral trade 
liberalization [0.5] why do it in a in a discriminatory way [1.0] we've still 
got that puzzle [1.4] well [0.9] er [0.6] next week i'll go through some new 
thinking [0.5] and er [0.2] to explain [0.6] why some of the what those gains 
might be [0.8] i've hinted at one of them already [0.8] that is in an uncertain 
world [1.1] binding yourself in to a free trade agreement [0.4] provides you 
with a bit more certainty [1.3] so if i engage in unilateral trade 
liberalization [0.7] and it's or [0.2] maybe with other countries [0.6] er 
negotiate reciprocal tariff reductions in the W-T-O [0.9] er there's always the 
danger [0.5] of going back to the nineteen-thirties [0.4] all right there's 
always [0.2] the W-T-O [0.4] has been weakened [0.2] by the Seattle [0.7] er 
situation that we've talked about before okay [0.5] maybe it's not quite such a 
strong organization that we thought it was [0.6] okay [0.5] maybe if there was 
serious unemployment in the industrialized countries [0.4] the whole agreement 
would just be torn up [0.6] and we'd be back to the [0.5] er er discrimination 
and [0.5] er barriers to trade 
of the nineteen-thirties [0.2] you know that's not improbable [1.6] but if i 
lock myself in to the E-U or to United States through a free trade agreement [0.
6] maybe that gives me a bit more certainty [0.8] okay it's a i-, it's a [0.2] 
it's a legally binding agreement [0.8] you'd build up institutional 
arrangements which link you in with the other country [0.7] so when push comes 
to shove [0.4] all right [0.5] if we if we did have a bit of a recession in the 
u-, in the E-U or [0.2] or United States [0.5] they'll discriminate against 
other people [0.9] er [0.2] not against me at least not in the first instance 
[0.8] all right [0.7] so [0.2] bit more certainty then perhaps [0.4] yeah 
sm1132: 
nm1128: well it [0.6] yeah i mean in the case of Eastern European [0.2] 
agreements [0.2] it's heavily political [0.3] all right you're trying to 
reinforce [0.4] the overthrow of communism [0.4] er democratic governments as 
long as 
they're not communist governments [0.4] er and so on [0.7] that's right [0.2] 
so i mean that was a heavy political element in that one [0.5] that was the top 
of the of the agenda [0.6] and the E-U was willing to pay quite a high price [0.
5] to maintain that [1.3] with the other dev-, o-, other developing countries 
[0.6] not really willing to pay a price [0.4] and that in a sense is part of 
the of of also of the puzzle [0.6] the developing countries in effect i mean 
from what we've said [0.4] have to pay quite a high price [0.8] upfront right 
at the beginning [0.6] for these agreements [0.6] okay that's the welfare loss 
[0.5] there's the rising unemployment as industries close down that are 
competing with imports from the E-U [0.4] there's the loss of government 
revenue [0.5] you know there's a lot of upfront costs [0.3] for the developing 
country [1.1] from the agreement [0.8] really not much 
cost [0.6] for the industrialized country [0.5] mm [1.0] so why do they sign [0.
6] why do developing countries sign these agreements with industrialized 
countries [0.7] hinted at one of them [0.4] and that's that's increased 
certainty i think that figures quite prominently [0.8] but there's other [0.3] 
aspects as well [0.3] that we'll talk about next week [0.5] to do with [0.4] 
timing consistency problems signalling [0.4] all sorts of other things that we 
[0.4] talk about [2.7] any final points [2.1] okay [0.5] well i'll carry on 
doing the theory and then we'll [0.9] talk a bit more about actual agreements 
next week [0.7] and then we'll get on to talk about article twenty-four [0.4] 
and er [0.2] how it [0.3] i-, its weaknesses [0.6] and how [0.2] it needs to be 
reformed [0.5] hopefully in a [0.2] Seattle type row whatever it's going to be 
called [0.4] [laugh] [1.5] thank you
