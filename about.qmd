# Techniques and research questions

Technique | Corpus | RQ
---- | ---- | -------
Collocation analysis | Full corpus, with or without annotation | What words does a certain word co-occur with?
Keyword analysis | Full corpus, with or without annotation | What words characterize a given text or subcorpus?
Variationist analysis (with logistic regression) - variants | Concordance and annotation of factors | What factors influence the choice of a variant over its alternative?
Analysis of varieties (with correspondence analysis) | Full corpus, with or without annotation | How are varieties distinguished based on the frequency of certain features (e.g. words)?
Multidimensional register analysis (with factor analysis) | Full corpus with annotation | What dimensions underlie the features and how do they characterize registers?
